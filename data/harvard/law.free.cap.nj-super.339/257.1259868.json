Cumba, D.M.D., challenge the validity of <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:30-8.22, entitled \u201cValidity of Diagnostic Tests for Traumatically Induced Temporomandibular Dysfunction (TMD),\u201d promulgated and adopted by respondent, New Jersey State Board of Dentistry (Board) on December 2, 1998, effective March 1, 1999, pursuant to its authority contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>45:6-19.4 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4.7 to adopt rules and regulations. 31 <em>N.J.R. </em>651(a) (Mar. 1,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We conclude that the Board\u2019s action in adopting <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:30-8.22 did not violate the express legislative authority vested in the Board by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.7 and the implied legislative authority reposed in it by the Dental Practice Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:6-1 to -69. Moreover, we find substantial evidence in the record to support the findings and conclusions of the Board in adopting <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:30-8.22, and that its adoption was neither arbitrary, capricious nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">On October 19, 1998, the Board published the proposed regulation and solicited written comments. 30 <em>N.J.R. </em>3748(b) (Oct. 19, 1998); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(a)(prescribing the required procedures for adopting administrative rules and regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">In explaining the proposed new rule, the Board stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">The proposed new rule sets forth professional standards governing diagnostic testing for temporomandibular dysfunction (\u201cTMD\u201d) requested or performed by authorized licensees of the Board of Dentistry (\u201cBoard\u201d). The objective is to assure that appropriate standards of professional care are maintained and that unnecessary and costly testing is avoided. The new rule provides guidance as to diagnostic tests that licensees shall or shall not be permitted to request or perform for persons who present symptoms of TMD subsequent to a traumatic injury to the mandibular. The genesis of this rule was the Legislature\u2019s mandate to limit payment for certain tests for persons holding specific types of automobile insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>coverage under which treatment costs are paid by insurance carriers under Personal Injury Protection (PIP) pursuant to the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act [AICRA], P.L.1998, c. 21, \u00a7 12, and c. 22____Consistent with the Board's belief that diagnosis and implementation of treatment of TMD are not dictated by the nature of the traumatic causing the symptoms and dysfunction, the Board has determined to include in the rule\u2019s scope all traumatically induced TMD regardless of the etiology and/or source of payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">The [AICRA] directs the Board to promulgate a list of valid diagnostic tests to be used in conjunction with the appropriate health care protocols in the treatment of persons sustaining bodily injury and subject to subsection (a) of section 8 of P.L.1972, c. 70 (N.J.S.A.39:6A-8). As required by that law, \u201cInclusion of a test on the list of valid diagnostic tests shall be based on demonstrated medical value, and a level of general acceptance by the relevant provider community and shall not be dependent for results entirely upon subjective patient response.\u201d <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.7.] The Board, in developing this list, received input from practitioners around the country advocating the inclusion of several tests the Board is proposing to exclude. The Board also reviewed and considered information relating to protocols for diagnosis of TMD that did not include the excluded tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">After a thorough review of the comments received, the Board has determined to include certain tests, some with restrictions as to the time frame in, and frequency with, which they may be performed. Other tests, including mandibular tracking, surface EMG, sonograms, Doppler ultrasound, needle EMG, eleetroenceph-alogram (BEG), thermographs/thermograms, video fluoroscopy, and reflexology, have been excluded. The Board developed these lists based on the ability of the tests to yield data of sufficient value in the development, evaluation, and implementation of a plan of treatment for injuries. Where tests have been excluded, it is because the Board has determined that those tests do not offer information not otherwise available from a comprehensive clinical examination and/or permitted tests, which would alter the treatment plan. The Board recognizes that the excluded tests can be performed without risk to patients, but nonetheless concludes that sufficient information will be gleaned from the permitted tests and a clinical examination to formulate a proper diagnosis and plan of care. The rule adequately protects the public interest by assuring that the needs of the patient are met and by implementing the legislative policies articulated in [AICRA],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">This Board rule is applicable only to treatment of traumatic injury to the lower jaw/mandible. Diagnosis of TMD unrelated to traumatic injury is not addressed at this time \u2014 For traumatic injuries unrelated to automobile accidents, this rule is applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">A summary of pertinent provisions follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">Subsection (a) provides definitions pertinent to the new rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-13\">Subsection (b) sets forth the diagnostic tests for which a licensee may bill a patient or third party payor to determine the presence of TMD and to formulate a treatment plan. The tests may be performed when medically necessary and consistent with clinically supported findings....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-14\">Subsection (c) lists the tests that the Board is proposing to exclude from the group for which licensees may bill a patient or third party. The Board\u2019s determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>nation to exclude is based on its considered opinion that the excluded tests fail to yield data of sufficient, additional value, given the approved diagnostic tests, which would alter or influence the development, evaluation, or implementation of a plan of treatment. The rule excludes mandibular tracking, surface EMG, sonograms, Doppler ultrasound, needle EMG, electroencephalogram (EEG), Thermographs, video fluoroscopy, and reflexology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">Subsection (d) permits licensees to perform the excluded tests for no charge to the patient or third party payor after obtaining informed, written consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">[30 <em>N.J.R. </em>3748(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In response to this notice and publication, the Board received numerous written comments opposing the adoption of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:30-8.22. Although a public hearing on the proposed rule was not conducted prior to adopting <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:30-8.22, the Commissioner published each written comment received and the Board\u2019s responses thereto. 31 <em>N.J.R. </em>651(a) (Mar. 1, 1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After consideration and analysis of the comments and information received, the Commissioner adopted the regulation, effective March 1, 1999.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">On appeal, appellants present the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">THE BOARD\u2019S REGULATION EXCEEDS THE SCOPE OF ITS STATUTORY AUTHORITY UNDER <em>NJ.S.A </em>39:6A-1.1 <em>ET SEQ., </em>AND IS, THEREFORE, INVALID AS A MATTER OF LAW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>AS THE BOARD\u2019S RULEMAKING IS NOT SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL AND CREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD, THE REGULATION MUST BE SET ASIDE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We consider these arguments in the order presented in appellants\u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Appellants contend that in promulgating and adopting <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:30-8.22 the Board exceeded the scope of the statutory authority contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-A.7 by failing to limit the scope of its regulation to traumatically induced TMD resulting from an automobile accident. Stated another way, appellants argue <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:30-8.22 is overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Appellate review of challenges to the rulemaking function of administrative agencies is limited. \u201cAdministrative regulations are accorded a presumption of validity.\u201d <em>New Jersey League of Municipalities v. DCA, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>211, 222, 729 A.2d 21 (1999). Moreover, \u201c[t]he party challenging their validity bears the burden of proving that the regulations are arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also In re Amendment of N.J.A.C. 8:31B-3.31, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>531, 543-4, 575 A.2d 481 (1990); <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 561, 384 A.2d 795 (1978). \u201cThat judicial deference to administrative agencies stems from the recognition that agencies have the specialized expertise necessary to enact regulations dealing with technical matters and are \u2018particularly well equipped to read and understand the massive documents and to evaluate the factual and technical issues that ... rulemaking would invite.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Jersey League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21 (quoting <em>Bergen Pines County Hosp. v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>456, 474, 476 A.2d 784 (1984)). Accordingly, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Dougherty v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 449 A.2d 1235 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">However, a regulation \u201cmust be within the fair contemplation of the delegation of the enabling statute.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21 (citation omitted); <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 561-62, 384 A.2d 795 (quoting <em>Southern Jersey Airways, Inc. v. National Bank of Secaucus, </em>108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 383, 261 A.2d 399 (App.Div.1970)). Additionally, \u201cthe absence of express statutory authorization in the enabling legislation will not preclude administrative agency action where, by reasonable implication, that action can be said to promote or advance the policies and findings that served as the driving force for the enactment of the legislation.\u201d A A. <em>Mastrangelo, Inc. v.
