Co. v. Bernards Township in Somerset County, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>1, 19-20, 510 A.2d 621 (1986). Appellants argue that the COAH amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-1.3 and 5:93-5.3(b) violate the \u201crealistic opportunity\u201d <em>Mount </em>Laurel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> standard by allowing COAH to certify a fair share housing plan for sites that do not have in place plans for sewer infrastructure that have been approved by the Department of Environmental Protection (\u201cDEP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We reject appellants\u2019 contentions and affirm the validity of the amended regulations because appellants have not sustained their burden of proving that the regulations are unreasonable or that the language of the regulations is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">On August 18, 1997, COAH published proposed amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:91 and 5:93. 29 <em>N.J. Reg. </em>3665(a) (August 18, 1997). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Appellants, along with four other organizations and one individual, filed comments with COAH on September 17, 1997, in which they objected to the changes to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-5.3(b). Those proposed rule changes were not adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">On October 19, 1998, COAH published proposed amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:91-7.4 and 5:93-1.3, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 6.5. On November 18, 1998, appellants, along with the Upper Raritan Watershed Association, filed comments with COAH, in which they objected to the changes in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-1.3 (definition of \u201cdevelopable site\u201d) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-5.3(b) (new construction site criteria) for reasons similar to those stated in their 1997 comments. On that same day appellants\u2019 attorneys submitted another set of comments on behalf of all of the same parties except for the Affordable Housing Network.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">On April 5, 1999, COAH adopted the amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:91-7.4 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-1.3, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 6.5 (unchanged from the proposed amendments) and published its summary of the public comments to the proposed changes and the agency\u2019s responses. 31 <em>N.J. Reg. </em>868(a) (April 5, 1999). On May 20, 1999, appellants filed a notice of appeal from COAH\u2019s adoption of the amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-1.3 and 5:93-5.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The FHA requires that COAH adopt criteria and guidelines for the municipal determination of its present and prospective fair share of affordable housing need. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-307. COAH enacted the substantive rules in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93, effective June 6, 1994, and amended them on September 5, 1995, December 6, 1995, May 20, 1996, and January 5, 1998. 30 <em>N.J.

In reviewing sites, the Council shall give priority to sites where infrastructure is available. All sites designated for low and moderate income housing shall receive approval for consistency review, as set forth in Section 208 of the Clean Water Act, 33 <em>U.S.C. </em>1251 <em>et seq., </em>prior to substantive certification. Where a site is denied consistency review, the municipality shall apply for an amendment to its Section 208 plan to incorporate the denied site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">[30 <em>N.J. Reg. </em>3719(a) (Oct. 19, 1998).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The 1999 amendment added the qualifying words \u201ccurrently or imminently\u201d to modify \u201cavailable\u201d infrastructure in the second sentence, which discusses which sites will be given priority; made some technical changes in the third sentence; and added a new substantive provision regarding COAH\u2019s obligation to \u201crevisit\u201d a site if the DEP denied approval or made no determination at the end of two years. The provision as amended, now challenged by appellants, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">Municipalities shall designate sites that are available, suitable, developable and approvable, as defined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-1. In reviewing sites, the Council shall give priority to sites where infrastructure is <em>currently or imminently </em>available. All sites designated for low and moderate income housing shall <em>be consistent with the applicable areawide water quality management plan (including the wastewater management plan) or be included in an amendment application filed prior to the grant of final substantive certification. If there is a denial by DEP or at the end of two years if there is no DEP determination, then COAH shall revisit the site and housing plan to determine if it provides a realistic opportunity.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">[30 <em>N.J. Reg. </em>3719(a) (Oct. 19, 1998); 31 <em>N.J. Reg. </em>868 (April 5, 1999) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Appellants\u2019 comments on the proposed amendments made the same objections as those presented in this appeal, the chief of which is that the amendments invite municipal delay in complying with fair share obligations by allowing substantive certification of a municipal housing element that relies on inclusionary development sites lacking DEP-approved access to sewer infrastructure, with review of the situation only after two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">COAH responded to virtually all of the objections raised by appellants in their comments. In response to the comment that \u201c[sjubstantive certification without a DEP-approved wastewater management plan fails to ensure that the Mount Laurel \u2018realistic opportunity\u2019 standard\u201d will be met, COAH said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">This rule is intended to achieve the goal of providing a realistic opportunity for affordable housing. All proposed sites in a housing element must either be in an approved water quality management plan or have such an amendment filed with DEP prior to the Council\u2019s granting final substantive certification. The municipality must, of course, endorse and support the amendment filed with DEP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">[31 <em>N.J. Reg. </em>868(a) (April 5, 1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">In response to the comment that \u201c[sjites without infrastructure cannot expeditiously deliver affordable housing,\u201d COAH offered the underlying reason for the sewer changes \u2014 to give municipalities more flexibility in developing a housing element:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">The FHA requires that a realistic plan be achievable within six years. While sites with all approvals in place are most desirable, not all municipalities have such sites at the time of petition. This rule provides a degree of flexibility for municipalities, while still assuring that the FHA\u2019s \u201crealistic opportunity\" standard is met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Responding to the comment that the proposed amendments \u201cencourage municipal delay in complying with fair share housing obligations and weaken implementation of the [State Development and Redevelopment Plan (\u2018SDRP\u2019) ]\u201d, COAH disagreed, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">The proposed amendments neither encourage municipal delay nor weakens I <em>sic] </em>the SDRP. Having a site either in an approved DEP plan or already included in a DEP amendment moves an affordable housing plan to implementation. The Council has always been consistent with the policies of the SDRP and will only certify a site if it is consistent with the SDRP or has received a waiver from the Office of State Planning (OSP) in accordance with standards set out in the Memorandum of Understanding dated October 27, 1992, between the Council and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the State Planning Commission. In addition, the proposed amendment was prepared jointly by members of the Council and the State Planning Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In response to the comment that COAH \u201cis proposing to abandon its current requirement that inclusionary development sites have prior DEP approval for sewer service,\u201d COAH referred to its prior custom in interpreting the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">The present rule does not require prior DEP approval as the commenter states. The rule has always permitted an amendment to be filed with DEP prior to COAH action. The current wording of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-5.3(b) states: \"Where a site is denied consistency review, the municipality shall apply for an amendment to its Section 208 plans to incorporate the denied site.\u201d The Council has consistently interpreted this rule as allowing inclusionary sites to be included in a certified plan without prior DEP approval of sewer service, subject to a condition of certification that the municipality files the amendments with DEP. The only difference between the current rule and the rule as proposed for amendment is the inclusion of the terminology utilized by DEP today. As a result, the terms \u201c201 and 208\u201d plans have been replaced by the term \u201careawide water quality management plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">[.IbidL]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Responding to the comment that the proposed amendment \u201cwould establish an unconstitutional \u2018good faith\u2019 standard for evaluating municipal compliance with Mount Laurel and the Fair Housing Act,\u201d COAH again disagreed, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">[T]he Council\u2019s proposed amendment does not alter the intent and practice of the rule currently in place. Moreover, the requirement of a municipal filing of an amendment with the DEP is an affirmative action on the part of a municipality to move an affordable housing plan forward. The proposed amendment also sets a time limit for the Council to act and deletes outdated terminology and replaces it with the correct language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">\n<em>mm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">In response to the comment that \u201c[r]evisiting the site if DEP denies sewer approvals or makes no decision on such approvals within two years is a vague and undefined process,\u201d COAH said that the proposed amendment was an improvement over the one then in place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">The present rule offers no time line for the Council to revisit a site if DEP has not acted. The proposed amendment strengthens the Council\u2019s review for the provision of affordable housing and gives the municipality a timeline for moving forward or reconsidering its plan. As stated above, to insure the developability of the site, the Council will require, as a condition of substantive certification, a semi-annual report from the municipality that will include the status of the DEP review. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>report will be formally presented to the Council at a regularly scheduled monthly meeting so that the Council may be fully informed as to the status of the DEP review. If necessary, the Council will contact the DEP with regard to the progress of the review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>[Ibid,.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Another comment faulted the proposal\u2019s vagueness as to \u201cthe consequences of two years of inaction\u201d and recommended that \u201c[i]f a site does not create a realistic opportunity, then the Council should revoke certification\u201d. COAH believed that such a response was too harsh:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">The Council believes that an automatic revoking of substantive certification is unduly punitive. The Council will review each municipality on a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate action if the DEP amendment is not approved within two years. Council action could be a requirement that the municipality amend its certified housing element within a limited time period, if DEP\u2019s failure to amend was not the fault of the municipality. Alternatively, the revoking of substantive certification could occur if a municipality has not supported or has obstructed the amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\"><em>[Ibid. </em>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Responding to the comment that the \u201cproposed phrase \u2018imminently\u2019 is unconstitutionally vague,\u201d COAH explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">\u201cImminently\u201d has been included to make clear that infrastructure need not be in place at the time of Council review but can be anticipated shortly based on the time of need for that particular infrastructure. For example, if it is needed in six months, then \u201cimminently\u201d means six months. If it is needed in a year, \u201cimminently\u201d means within a year. This provision adds flexibility to the process and COAH believes it is most reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-12\">[/&amp;\u00ab.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Finally, in response to the comment that COAH \u201cshould support affirmatively\u201d the SDRP and \u201cgive priority to sites where infrastructure is available,\u201d COAH agreed, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-14\">The Council supports the SDRP and the Council\u2019s rules urge municipalities to give priority to sites where infrastructure is available. The Council only will certify a plan that is consistent with the SDRP or has received a waiver of consistency from OSP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-15\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">Appellants contend that the amended regulations permitting COAH to grant certification to fair share plans without sewer access institutionalize a two-year period of delay while municipalities await sewer infrastructure approval, and thus they violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>constitutional \u201crealistic opportunity\u201d standard. They further assert that regulations also undermine that standard by giving priority to sites where infrastructure is \u201ccurrently or imminently\u201d available because \u201cimminently\u201d is a term so vague as to be void of meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Appellants, however, offer an example of how the regulations can be amended so as to uphold the constitutional requirement: COAH should permit certification to plans with inclusionary sites without existing sewer approval only if no other sites meeting COAH criteria are within existing sewer service area. According to appellants, allowing inclusionary sites to be located in areas without existing sewer service is inconsistent with the SDRP, which encourages development where it already exists (metropolitan and suburban areas) rather than in rural and environmentally sensitive areas, where it does not. Appellants urge us not to show deference to COAH on this matter due to the constitutional considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">COAH responds that the intent of the rule changes was to update the references to DEP procedures and to clarify an ambiguity in the earlier rules: the old definition of \u201cdevelopable\u201d required a site to have received DEP consistency approval, but <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-5.3(b) considered an inclusionary site to provide a realistic opportunity if it was denied consistency review but the municipality applied for an amendment to its Section 208 plan. The new rules require an inclusionary site to either be consistent with the applicable water quality management (\u201cWQM\u201d) plan or be included in an amendment to a WQM plan that has been submitted to the DEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">According to COAH, the procedures and timeliness in the amended rules ensure that an inclusionary site creates a realistic opportunity for affordable housing: the sites that are included in an amended WQM plan at the time of certification will be revisited when DEP denies the amendment or at the end of two years if DEP has not acted on the application. Further, COAH will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>require a semi-annual report from a municipality about the status of the DEP review as a condition of certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">COAH asserts that no <em>Mount Laurel </em>case has ever held that only sites with approved sewer infrastructure can satisfy the realistic opportunity standard. COAH contends that the amended rules, which are but one piece in a complex regulatory scheme, are a reasonable exercise of its authority, which is the appropriate standard of review. COAH argues that appellants\u2019 example of how to amend the regulations to uphold their constitutionality is an implicit acknowledgment that certification may be given to sites without sewer approval and thus undermines their facial constitutional challenge. We agree with COAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">As to consistency with the SDRP, COAH says it relies on the SDRP in allocating regional need, but is not required by law, statutory or otherwise, to avoid any one specific planning area in determining where inclusionary sites may be located. Again, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">An administrative agency\u2019s decision must stand unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. <em>Van Dalen v. Washington Township, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>234, 244-45, 576 A.2d 819 (1990); <em>NonProfit Affordable Hous. Network v. COAH, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>475, 479, 627 A.2d 1153 (App.Div.1993). Administrative regulations are accorded a presumption of reasonableness and validity. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Normally a reviewing court must consider three inquiries: (1) whether the agency action violates the enabling act\u2019s legislative policies (2) whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the findings on which the agency based its decision; and (3) whether the agency clearly erred in applying the legislative policies to the facts. <em>Public Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Department of Envtl. Prot., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>95, 103, 501 A.2d 125 (1985). Here, however, where facts are not at issue, and there is a constitutional challenge, the court must focus its analysis on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>whether the regulations bear a reasonable relationship to the legislative goal of providing low and moderate income housing. <em>Holmdel Builders Ass\u2019n v. Township of Holmdel, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>550, 572, 588 A.2d 277 (1990). This essentially is the same standard of review applied to other agency decisions: whether the decision is reasonable and is it consistent with the legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Furthermore, when there is a facial constitutional challenge alleging vagueness in the regulation, it will be struck down \u201conly if it is \u2018impermissibly vague in all of its applications.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Saunders, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 520, 695 A.2d 722 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>470, 700 A.2d 881 (1997) (quoting <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>489, 494-95,102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1186, 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d 362, 369 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The FHA was the legislative response to the Supreme Court\u2019s declaration in <em>Mount Laurel </em>that every municipality has an obligation to create a realistic opportunity for the construction of its fair share of the regional need for low and moderate income housing. <em>Calton Homes, Inc. v. Council on Affordable Hous., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>438, 442, 582 A.2d 1024 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>326, 604 A.2d 601 (1991). To implement that goal, the FHA created COAH and charged it with responsibility for determining regional needs and certifying fair share plans. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-305(a), -307, -314.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The FHA specifically refers to infrastructure (sewer and water) in only two contexts: (1) a municipality\u2019s fair share is to be adjusted whenever \u201c[ajdequate public facilities and infrastructure capacities are not available or would result in costs prohibitive to the public if provided,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D 307(e)(2)(g); and (2) in preparing its housing element, a municipality is to consider a \u201cplan for infrastructure expansion and rehabilitation if necessary to assure the achievement of the municipality\u2019s fair share of low and moderate income housing.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-311(a)(4). Thus, the Legislature intended municipalities to expand their infrastructure if necessary in order to satisfy their fair share obligation, but it also contemplated that in some municipalities this would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>possible or economically feasible, and thus it allowed for a downward adjustment of a municipality\u2019s obligation in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The substantive rules promulgated by COAH, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-1.1 to -15.1, create a complex methodology for determining present and prospective regional need, credits and adjustments, preparation of a housing element, and much more. The rules address infrastructure concerns, such as the lack of sewer access, in several sections other than the two challenged by appellants. For example, in the subchapter on credits and reductions, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-3.5(a) directs COAH to review previously zoned sites to determine whether they \u201cpresent a realistic opportunity for low and moderate income housing before granting a reduction.\u201d In its review, COAH is to consider \u201cenvironmental factors, the location of existing infrastructure and the likelihood of the current zoning to result in the creation of low and moderate income housing during the period of substantive certification.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-3.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In COAH\u2019s sub-chapter on municipal adjustments, the rules address a situation in which a community has sufficient land but insufficient water and/or sewer to support inclusionary development. N.J<em>.A.C. </em>5:93-4.3(a). In such a case, COAH reviews \u201ceach possible site for inclusionary development to determine if it is realistic for the site to receive the required water and/or sewer during the period of substantive certification.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-4.3(a). If it is not realistic, the municipality receives a durational adjustment of its housing obligation, deferring the obligation until adequate water and/or sewer are made available. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-4.3(c). COAH requires, among other things, that municipal officials endorse all applications to the DEP for water and sewer approval, and that they amend their housing element when new DEP approvals are received if the element included sites without water and sewer access. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-4.3(c)(2) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> <em>Mount Laurel II, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 221-22, 456 A.2d 390, defined \u201crealistic opportunity\u201d to mean that \u201cthere is in fact a likelihood \u2014 to the extent economic conditions allow \u2014 that the low<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>er income housing will actually be constructed.\u201d This means a realistic, not just a theoretical, opportunity for the construction of affordable housing. <em>Alexander\u2019s Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Borough of Paramus, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>100, 109, 592 A.2d 1168 (1991). \u201cThe responsibility to provide a \u2018realistic opportunity\u2019 for affordable housing is an obligation imposed on the municipality.\u201d <em>Rosenshein </em>Assocs. <em>v. Borough of Palisades Park, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>438, 443, 701 A.2d 448 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>380, 718 A.2d 1209 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The availability of water and sewer connections is one of the factors considered in determining whether a municipality has provided a realistic opportunity for affordable housing. <em>Mount Laurel II, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 298, 456 A.2d 390 (ruling that a proposed inclusionary site on which water and sewer access would not be available for five to six years did not provide a realistic opportunity). However, the lack of access to sewer does not necessarily rule a site out. <em>Urban League of Essex County v. Township of Mahwah, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 281, 504 A.2d 66 (Law Div.1984) (\u201cWhile approval of this proposal cannot be ruled out strictly on the basis of lack of access to utilities, it is a factor to be considered.\u201d) Where sewer infrastructure is not in place, it is crucial that it can be brought to a site at a reasonable cost. <em>Toll Bros. v. Township of West Windsor, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 543, 697 A.2d 201 (Law Div.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 756 A.2d 1074 (App.Div.2000). To that end, \u201c[municipalities have an affirmative obligation to facilitate provision of the infrastructure necessary to make development realistically likely.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Appellants cite to a case involving the Township of Hillsborough as an example of the long delays caused when a sewer infrastructure is not in place at the time substantive certification is granted. <em>See In re Petition for Substantive Certification of the Hous. Element and Fair Share Plan of the Township of Hillsborough, Somerset County, </em>No. A-6668-97T1 (App. Div. April 14, 2000). We are satisfied that appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Hillsborough </em>is misplaced, particularly to support a facial constitutional challenge to these amended regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>In 1996, COAH granted certification to Hillsborough, whose only inclusionary site was a planned adult community/health care facility, which was to include 3000 units of housing with a fifteen percent set-aside for affordable housing; 160 units were to be built within the six-year period of Hillsborough\u2019s certification. Despite an agreement between Hillsborough and the developer that included \u201can implied pledge of Hillsborough\u2019s active support for the extension of sewer service\u201d to the site, Hillsborough retreated irom that promise and did not take affirmative steps to include the site in the county\u2019s wastewater management plan, which was necessary to provide sewer service to the site. The developer, the Hillsborough Alliance for Adult Living, filed a builder\u2019s remedy action against Hillsborough in Superior Court, and in 1998, COAH revoked its certification of Hillsborough\u2019s fair share plan, finding that Hillsborough had failed to comply with its plan \u201cby failing to support the extension of sewer service\u201d to the site, as well as revoking the underlying zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">COAH refused to retain jurisdiction of the matter while Hills-borough created a new fair share plan, which would have protected the municipality from the builder\u2019s remedy action. In providing \u201cguidance to Hillsborough with regard to any new fair share plan for which it seeks COAH certification,\u201d COAH advised that if the plan involves new development, \u201cthe site or sites must be immediately approvable in terms of zoning and infrastructure.\u201d Hillsborough appealed from COAH\u2019s decision. In an unreported opinion, we affirmed COAH\u2019s decision. <em>See Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In <em>Hillsborough, </em>the municipality agreed to facilitate the DEP application process, but it did not live up to its promise. This led COAH to rescind its grant of substantive certification, and Hillsborough was exposed to builder\u2019s remedy actions. Whether it was the lack of sewer access or the municipality\u2019s dilatory behavior that led to the delay of construction is ultimately, in our view, unimportant because a delay in the provision of affordable housing is not in itself a violation of the <em>Mount Laurel </em>obligation. Our Supreme Court has said that there is no \u201cconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>tutional timetable implicit in that obligation.\u201d <em>Bernards Township, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 40, 510 A2d 621. Although appellants contend that the amendment in the regulations will lead to widespread delays in the construction of affordable housing, similar to that which occurred in Hillsborough, their contention is only speculation. This type of speculation is not enough to overcome the presumption of constitutionality in legislative determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 510 A.2d 621. As we noted above, the Legislature explicitly contemplated lack of sewer access in inclusionary sites when, in <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:27D-311(a)(4), it required municipalities to plan for infrastructure expansion if necessary to achieve their fair share.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Our courts have given COAH \u201ca reasonable degree of latitude\u201d in implementing the FHA\u2019s legislative goals, because implementation is \u201cnecessarily an evolving process.\u201d <em>Van Dalen, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 246, 576 A.2d 819. However, despite COAH\u2019s \u201cdiscretion in selecting methodologies to implement\u201d the FHA, the regulatory methods it adopts must still be \u201cconsistent with the statutory goals.\u201d <em>In re Township of Warren, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>1, 28, 622 A.2d 1257 (1993). Our courts have invalidated a COAH regulation only where it has been clearly shown to be inconsistent with those goals and thus unreasonable. For example, in <em>In re Township of Warren, </em>the Court held that an occupancy preference for municipal residents and workers was invalid because it was inconsistent with and undermined COAH\u2019s methodology for calculating and allocating regional fair share of affordable housing. <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Colton Homes, supra, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 453, 582 A.2d 1024, we held that COAH\u2019s 1000-unit cap rule was unreasonable because it exacerbated disparity in the obligation imposed on various municipalities in the same region (those municipalities with an obligation much greater than 1000 units would receive a windfall). In <em>Township of Bernards v. Department of Community Affairs, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 13, 558 A.2d 1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>194, 570 A.2d 959 (1989), we held that a rule giving credits to units built after 1980 only if their occupancy was restricted to low or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>moderate income households was unreasonable. We concluded it was inconsistent with a statutory provision that allowed the credit as long as the unit was originally part of a low-income housing program and because it would penalize communities that provided affordable housing but did not impose such restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We have refused to invalidate COAH regulations where challengers could only speculate as to the potential ill results. For example, in <em>Calton, supra, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 455, 582 A.2d 1024, we upheld a rule that allowed a municipality to include zoning for the creation of affordable accessory apartment units as part of its housing element, finding that there was nothing to support the appellant\u2019s allegation that the rule would fail to result in the creation of affordable apartments. We were persuaded that the rule had an adequate safeguard: if the projected number of apartments were not built within two years, the certified municipality had to provide an alternative method of fulfilling its obligation. <em>Id. </em>at 455-56, 582 A.2d 1024. We also upheld in <em>Calton </em>a rental bonus credit that was given even before a unit was built, holding that it was reasonable to conclude that the credit would encourage developers to construct rental housing. <em>Id. </em>at 458, 582 A.2d 1024. Furthermore, if the unit was not built, credit would be withdrawn and the municipality would have to take other steps to replace the lost units. <em>Ibid. </em>We further observed that \u201c[although there may be delay in this process, courts should not unduly impose strict timetables upon the Council\u2019s attempts to carry out its duties.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Here, there is nothing in the record to suggest that COAH\u2019s amended regulations on sewer access are unreasonable, only appellants\u2019 speculation that they may lead to delay. But as in Calton\u2019s determination on the rental bonus rule, the possibility of delay is in itself not enough to lead to invalidation of the regulations. <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:93-5.3(b) has a built-in safeguard, as did the accessory apartment rule in <em>Calton. </em>The regulation requires review of the situation if DEP approval has not been granted within two years. Even without that safeguard, the <em>Hillsborough </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ease, relied upon by appellants, shows that COAH will act to remedy a situation in which sewer approval is not obtained. We are satisfied that appellants have not sustained their burden of proving that the amended regulations are unreasonable and do not bear a reasonable relationship to the goal of providing low and moderate income housing. Therefore, their facial constitution claim must fail. <em>Holmdel Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 572, 583 A.2d 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">We are also satisfied that appellants\u2019 facial constitutional challenge based on vagueness also fails. The regulations are not impermissibly vague in all their applications. The challenged language here would have to be \u201c \u2018so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lashinsky, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>1, 17, 404 A.2d 1121 (1989) (quoting <em>Coates v. Cincinnati, </em>402 <em>U.S. </em>611, 614, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1686, 1688, 29 L.Ed.2d 214, 217 (1971)). No such claim can be made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Appellants\u2019 contentions regarding the regulations\u2019 inconsistency with the SDRP do not strengthen their case. Under the State Planning Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:18A-196 to -207 (\u201cSPA\u201d), which became effective in 1986, the SDRP was designated as a \u201ctool for assessing suitable locations for infrastructure, housing, economic growth and conservation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:18A-196c. The SDRP replaced the State Development Guide Plan (SDGP), which the Supreme Court ordered the <em>Mount Laurel </em>trial court judges to rely on in <em>Mount Laurel II, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 225, 456 A.2d 390. Cooperation between the State Planning Commission (SPC) and COAH is statutorily mandated. The SPA directs the SPC to \u201cfacilitate cooperation among State agencies and local governments with regard to development of plans, programs and policies which affect land use, environmental, capital and economic development issues.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:18A-199(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The FHA directs COAH to \u201cgive appropriate weight\u201d to the SDRP and to make municipal adjustments if the \u201cpattern of development is contrary to the planning designations\u201d in the SDRP. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-307(e) and 307(c)(2)(e). COAH relies on the SDRP in determining the location and size of growth areas. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-1.3. In 1992, COAH entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the SPC, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93 Appendix F, in which the two agencies agreed to maintain a cooperative planning process.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Outside of this institutionalized cooperation between COAH and the SPC, the SDRP itself has no regulatory effect. <em>New Jersey Builders Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>93, 96, 703 A.2d 323 (App.Div.1997). The SDRP is merely a guide to state agencies and municipal officials in order to further the goal of planning consistency and to help coordinate planning at all levels of government. <em>Id. </em>at 96-98, 703 A.2d 323. When COAH was still relying on the SDGP, the Supreme Court, recognizing that the SDGP had limitations, considered it appropriate for COAH\u2019s reliance on the plan to be \u201csufficiently flexible so as to permit the presentation of proofs demonstrating that the allocation of affordable housing on the basis of the SDGP may be flawed either statewide or in particular regions.\u201d <em>Van Dalen, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 247, 576 A.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Here, COAH\u2019s amended regulations do nothing to weaken its reliance on the SDRP or its efforts at consistency with the plan\u2019s goals. It merely gives municipalities some flexibility in applying for DEP sewer approval at the same time they submit their housing element to COAH for certification. If the DEP denies approval, the municipality will have to find an alternative way to satisfy its fair share obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\"> <em>Southern Burlington County NAACP v.
