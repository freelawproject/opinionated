Plaintiff insured appeals an order granting defendant insurer summary judgment and dismissing her complaint that sought to compel UM arbitration. As far as we can tell from the \u201cdecision\u201d below, the dismissal was based upon a \u201cfor fee\u201d exclusion in the UM endorsement contained in plaintiffs automobile policy issued by defendant. We are convinced the \u201cfor fee\u201d UM exclusion conflicts with the governing statutory provisions and, thus, is unenforceable. We remand for consideration of additional coverage issues that were not decided by the motion judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Preliminarily, we briefly comment on the \u201cdecision\u201d below. There were a number of coverage issues presented by the motion. Plaintiff asserted the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to decide them as the policy\u2019s arbitration provision required they be submitted to an arbitrator. The coverage issues included not only the \u201cfor fee\u201d exclusion but also defendant\u2019s contention that the notice and reasonable investigation obligations under its policy provisions and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-78(e) had not been complied with. As to the latter, plaintiff asserted a defense of estoppel and argued that the governing policy provisions on notice and investigation were unenforceable. Following oral argument on October 15, 1999, the judge reserved decision. By letter dated October 26, 1999, the judge sent counsel \u201ca copy of the memorandum\u201d on the motion, directing defendant\u2019s counsel to submit a proposed order. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u201cmemorandum\u201d appears to be a law clerk memo and addresses only the \u201cfor fee\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">We expect all trial judges to be cognizant of and comply with their responsibility to address the issues and provide findings of fact and conclusions of law when deciding motions. <em>R. </em>1:7-4; <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c); <em>Filippone v. Lee, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 306-07, 700 A 2d 384 (App.Div.1997). \u201cIt should, of course, be obvious that a judge does not and may not fulfill the obligation to make fact-finding by delegating that responsibility to a law clerk....\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Comment 2 on <em>R. </em>1:7-4(a) (2001). <em>See Hungerford v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>398, 402, 517 A.2d 498 (App.Div.1986). Sending the attorneys a copy of a clerk\u2019s memo does not comply with <em>R. </em>1:7-4 or <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c). Neither does it properly serve the interests of the litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The facts are not particularly complex. On April 5, 1994, plaintiff and her husband, New Jersey residents, were visiting Washington, D.C. and were passengers in the backseat of a taxi cab. The cab stopped suddenly, causing plaintiff to be thrown forward thereby striking the front seat of the cab. At that time, she felt \u201ca little\u201d pain on her left side.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">When plaintiff and her husband reached their destination, they exited the cab, and it departed. Neither the identity of the cab nor the operator was ever obtained. Plaintiff could describe the taxi cab only as a black and white station wagon and the operator as a middle-aged foreigner, possibly Arabic, who was wearing a turban. No one reported the incident to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">That same day, upon the couple\u2019s return to New Jersey, plaintiff\u2019s pain persisted and her family physician was called. The physician advised plaintiff to go directly to Burlington Memorial Hospital where she was hospitalized for having multiple fractured ribs and shortness of breath. On April 10, 1994, she was released from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">On April 21, 1994, plaintiff submitted to defendant an application for PIP benefits and, by counsel\u2019s letter dated July 8, 1994, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>defendant was advised of a claim for UM benefits. By letter dated August 3, 1994, defendant rejected the UM claim because the taxi cab did not qualify as an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d because \u201c[i]t is apparent that [she] was a passenger in a taxi cab ... and could have properly identified the taxi and driver.\u201d The record is not entirely clear as to plaintiffs PIP claim, but it does contain an August 31, 1994, note from the PIP adjuster indicating that the hospital\u2019s bill had been received and was being audited. The note further reflects \u201cI note you were in a commercial vehicle at the time of the accident. N.J. No Fault regulations are such that only medical payments are covered. Essential services are not reimbursable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Defendant\u2019s payment of plaintiffs PIP claim is not part of the present litigation. However, when defendant continued to deny UM coverage, plaintiff filed her complaint seeking to compel UM arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Initially, we think it clear that under the terms of the policy, the coverage issues raised by defendant were for the court to decide. While we \u201cstrongly favor[ ] arbitration as a means of resolving disputes without tying up limited judicial resources,\u201d Craig &amp; Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law, </em>\u00a7 23:2, at 348 (2001), \u201cthe duty to arbitrate, and the scope of the arbitration, are dependent solely on the parties agreement.\u201d <em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Turck, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>480, 486, 721 A2d 1 (1998) (quoting <em>Cohen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>97, 100, 555 A.2d 21 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>87, 563 A.2d 846 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Under the \u201cstandard\u201d UM arbitration clause in New Jersey \u201cUM coverage issues are ... decided by court and issues of liability and damages are decided by arbitrator.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 563 A.2d 846 (citing <em>Tornatore v. Selective Ins. Co., </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 246, 695 A.2d 313 (App.Div.1997)). As recognized by the Court in <em>Turck, </em>under the \u201cstandard\u201d UM arbitration clhuse, \u201can arbitrator is permitted to decide only two issues: the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>liability of the tortfeasor and the total amount of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 721 A.2d 1. <em>Compare Travelers Indem. Co. v. Mongiovi, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 459, 343 A.2d 750 (App.Div.1975) (under \u201cstandard\u201d UM arbitration clause, whether disclaimer of coverage by tortfeasor\u2019s carrier for noncooperation renders the vehicle an uninsured vehicle for UM purposes is for the court to decide) <em>with Bocelli v. Hanover Metro Ins. Co., </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 10, 529 A.2d 997 (App.Div.1987) (under broader UM arbitration clause the <em>coverage </em>issue is arbitrable).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">As depicted by the Court in <em>Turck,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">That standard clause, exemplified by the policy language in <em>[Government Employees Ins. Co. </em>v.] <em>Bovit </em>[142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268,] 271-72, 361 A.2d 100 [(App.Div.1976), <em>certif. denied, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>502, 366 A.2d 658 (1976)], reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">If any person making a claim hereunder and the company do not agree <em>that such person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured highway vehicle because of bodily injury or property damage to the insured, </em>or do not agree as to the amount of payment which may be owing under this insurance; then upon written <em>demand of </em>either, the matter ... upon which such person and the company do not agree shall be settled by arbitration. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXL\">Substantially similar language also was used in the arbitration clauses at issue in <em>[Selected Risks Ins. Co. </em>v.] <em>Schulz, </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[185,] 187, 345 A.2d 349 [(App.Div.1975)]; <em>[Travelers Indemnity Co. v.] Mongiovi, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 456, 343 A.2d 750; <em>[New Jersey. Mfrs. Ins. Co. </em>v.] <em>McDermott, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[251,] 254, 492 A.2d 1115 [(Law Div.1985)]; and <em>[Government Employees Ins. Co. v.] Shara, </em>137 Super.142, 145, 348 A.2d 212 [(Ch. Div.l975)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">[156 <em>N.J. </em>at 487-88, 721 A.2d 1.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">In all <em>of the </em>cases cited by the Court as examples of the \u201cstandard\u201d UM clause, coverage issues were construed to be with the jurisdiction of the court, while the arbitrator was limited to the issues of the tortfeasor/uninsured motorist liability and damages. The critical language specified as arbitratable only disputes over legal entitlement to recovery of damages from an uninsured vehicle <em>(i.e., </em>from the tortfeasor) in addition to damage disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">In contrast, the arbitration clause in <em>Bocelli v. Hanover Metro Ins. Co., supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 8, 529 A.2d 997, provided for arbitration in the event:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">we and a covered person do not agree ... [w]hether that person <em>is legally entitled </em>to recover damages <em>under this endorsement. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Similarly, the arbitration clause in <em>Turck </em>provided for arbitration of a dispute over \u201c[w]hether [the covered person] is legally entitled to recover damages <em>under this endorsement; </em>or [as] to the amount of damages....\u201d <em>United Serv. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Turck, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, 721 A.2d 1. (Emphasis added.) In both cases, the arbitration clauses were construed to encompass coverage issues because of the \u201cunder this endorsement\u201d phrase. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94, 721 A.2d 1; <em>Bocelli v. Hanover Metro Ins. Co., supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 9, 529 A.2d 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Here, defendant\u2019s arbitration clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">The insured\u2019s right to recover these damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle or underinsured motor vehicle and the amount of these damages will be agreed to by the insured and us. Disagreement as to such right or amounts of damages will be settled by arbitration. Disagreement as to any other issue may not be arbitrated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The clause, then, provides for arbitration of the \u201cright to recover these damages\u201d and \u201cthe amount of these damages.\u201d \u201cThese damages\u201d refers to \u201cdamages that the insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the tortfeasor. There is no reference to disputes concerning entitlement \u201cunder [the UM] endorsement.\u201d Although, therefore, not precisely identical to the \u201cstandard\u201d UM language as described in <em>Turck, </em>it is comparable. The focus is upon the liability of the tortfeasor/uninsured motorist and damages. It is certainly not as broad as the \u201cnonstandard\u201d language in the <em>Turck </em>or the <em>Bocelli </em>UM endorsements which were construed as providing for arbitration of coverage issues. The trial court, then, had jurisdiction to resolve the coverage disputes here.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">We turn to the \u201cfor fee\u201d exclusion. Defendant\u2019s UM policy contains an exclusion for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">bodily injury suffered or property damage incurred while occupying any vehicle while being used to carry person or persons or property for a fee (other than in a car- pool arrangement).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">As far as we can decipher from the \u201cdecision\u201d below, it was determined there was no UM coverage under this exclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>primarily in reliance upon <em>CSC Ins. Servs. v. Graves, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 679 A.2d 1244 (Law Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\"><em>Graves </em>is inapposite. <em>Graves </em>involves PIP benefits. The provisions of our \u201cno fault\u201d law and <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.1 are distinct and serve different purposes. Thus, we have said that \u201c[t]he provisions of the \u2018no fault\u2019 law do not govern the interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.1.\u201d <em>Transport of New Jersey v. Watler, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 459, 391 A.2d 1240 (App.Div.1978), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>400, 400 A.2d 61 (1979). <em>See e.g. Cerullo v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>372, 375-76, 565 A.2d 1125 (App.Div. 1989). As we noted in <em>Campbell v. Lion Ins. Co., </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>498, 710 A.2d 576 (App.Div.1998), in which we considered a \u201cfor fee\u201d UM/UIM exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">Although the trial court in <em>CSC Ins. Servs. v. Graves, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 247, 679 A.2d 1244 (Law Div.1996), said that this exclusionary phrase \u201cmust be taken to mean ... \u2018used as a public or livery conveyance,\u2019 \u201d the statement was made in the context of an action for personal injury protection benefits (PIP) and reflects the court\u2019s determination that the phrase was an improper attempt to add an exclusion beyond those allowed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2a and <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-7. Thus, that case does not provide an interpretation of the [for fee] exclusion [in a UM/UIM endorsement]. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 504 n. 3, 710 A.2d 576.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The exclusion before us in <em>Campbell </em>provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">A. We do not provide coverage under this [UM/UIM] endorsement ... for \u201cproperty damage\u201d or \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">3. When \u201cyour covered auto\u201d is being used to <em>carry </em>persons or <em>property for afee. </em>This exclusion does not apply to a share-the-expense car pool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 500-01, 710 A.2d 576.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">Although we ultimately concluded the exclusion was enforceable under <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.1 in the context of UIM benefits, we said as to UM benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-14\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for UM coverage is barred by the settlement they reached with Livolsi\u2019s carrier, and that is so regardless of the carrier\u2019s initial position denying coverage and despite the absence of any formal admission of coverage. <em>Kerwien v. Melone, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 274-75, 672 A.2d 235 (App.Div.1996). Thus, we should not address the issue on which the trial court focused its attention: whether the exclusion in question, in relation to UM coverage, violates public policy because it goes beyond those exclusions permitted by statute. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.1; <em>of. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>CSC Ins. Servs., supra, <em>293 </em>N.J.Super. <em>at 248, 679 </em>A.2d <em>1244; </em>Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., supra, <em>501 N.W.2d at 693 (Davies, J., concurring </em>(expressing the view that in a UM case, acceptance of this exclusion \u201cwould defeat the strong policy underlying Minnesota\u2019s system of compulsory insurance <em>\u201d)).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 507, 710 A.2d 576 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">While, therefore, we declined to address the issue, we signaled our reservation as to the enforceability of a \u201cfor fee\u201d exclusion in the context of UM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Our discussion in <em>Campbell </em>of the exclusion in the context of UIM benefits might be viewed as forecasting that conclusion. In rejecting the contention that, as applicable to UIM benefits, the \u201cfor fee\u201d exclusion was \u201cviolative of public policy\u201d by \u201cfrustrating the purposes of UIM coverage,\u201d we contrasted the statutorily mandated UM coverage with the optional UIM coverage, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">There are important distinctions between UM and UIM coverage. UM coverage must be included in every policy of insurance. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-l.la. One of its primary purposes is to alleviate financial burdens on the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund which, absent UM coverage, would be required to respond to the claims of injured parties. <em>Riccio v. Prudential Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>493, 531 A.2d 717 (1987). As a consequence, in UM eases our courts have frequently struck policy provisions which were more restrictive that [sic] those mandated by statute. <em>See, e.g., Perez v. American Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>415, 409 A.2d 269 (1979); <em>Ciecka v. Transamerica Ins. Group, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>421, 409 A.2d 272 (1979); <em>Walkouritz v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>149 <em>N.J.Super. </em>442, 374 A.2d 40 (App.Div.), <em>ceriif. dismissed, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>584, 384 A.2d 815 (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">UIM coverage, by contrast, must be offered by an insurance company but need not be accepted by the insured. <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-l.lb. As noted by the Court in <em>French v. New Jersey Sch. Bd. Ins. Group., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>478 [491-92], 694 A.2d 1008 (1997):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">The different legislative concern for the two forms of insurance is that availability of uninsured motorist benefits affects all ratepayers of insurance (all auto insurance companies pay a portion of their premiums into the Uninsured Motorist Fund), where the availability of UIM benefits affects only the parties insured under the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">As a result, the <em>French </em>Court <em>[id </em>at 492, 694 A.2d 1008,] went on to hold as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">[I]t is fundamental that in the absence of a statutory prohibition to the contrary, an insurance company has a right to impose [upon UIM benefits] whatever conditions it desires prior to assuming its obligations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">[311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 507-08, 710 A.2d 576.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The statutory scheme governing UM benefits is mandatory. That is not to say that a UM endorsement cannot add to the statutory mandates. <em>Brown v. Selective Ins. Co., </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 213, 709 A.2d 812 (App.Div.1998). But when a provision in the endorsement operates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">to reduce or take away from the coverage mandated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1, the contractual provision will almost certainly be found void and the statutorily required coverage read into the policy as a matter of law. Time and time again, the courts of New Jersey have struck down policy language more restrictive than the statutory mandate and held that coverage in accordance with the remedial aims of the legislation must be afforded regardless of the contractual efforts to limit coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">[Craig <em>&amp; </em>Pomeroy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19:2 at 270.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>See Fernandez v.

It has been noted that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1 that would limit its application to passenger automobiles as distinguished from other motor vehicles.\u201d <em>Transport of New Jersey v. Watler, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 459, 391 A.2d 1240 (finding that UM coverage applied to bus owned and operated by the state, which was self-insured). A taxi cab, then, may qualify as an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We are convinced, therefore, that defendant\u2019s \u201cfor fee\u201d exclusion restricts the coverage otherwise mandated by the statute. As such, it is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Reversed and remanded for disposition of the remaining issues raised below but not decided. As we have said, disposition of these issues shall be accompanied by a judicial decision that complies with <em>R. </em>1:7-4 and <em>R. </em>4:46-2(e). We express no view as to these issues and do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
