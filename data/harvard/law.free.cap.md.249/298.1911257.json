It was daylight, the weather was clear and the roads were dry. Both the ambulance (an authorized emergency vehicle owned by the Arundel Volunteer Fire Department driven by the defendant-appellee Raymond R. Sears) and the automobile (operated by the plaintiff-appellant Robert C. Altenburg) were traveling in a southerly direction toward Annapolis. The boulevard at the place of the accident is a divided highway with two marked lanes in each direction and a third lane for southerly bound vehicles turning left at the avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">At the time of the accident, the ambulance was carrying a highway accident victim to the Anne Arundel County General Hospital. The ambulance driver, who had entered the boulevard from U.S. Route 50, sounded the ambulance siren from the time he left the main highway until the happening of the accident. The top of the ambulance was also equipped with a spinning red \u201cbeacon ray\u201d which was functioning and red \u201ctunnel lights\u201d at each of the four corners which were on. There were ten to twelve motor vehicles ahead of the ambulance in the right-hand lane and four or five vehicles ahead of the ambulance in the left hand lane. The vehicles ahead of the ambulance in the slow or right lane promptly moved onto the gravel shoulder upon the approach of the ambulance, but the automobile operator, who was the last of several motorists in the fast lane ahead of the ambulance, apparently did not hear the siren or see the red lights and made no attempt to move out of the way. As soon as he could see that the way was clear, the ambulance driver moved over into the fast or left lane behind the automobile operator with the intention of entering the left turn lane which began approximately twenty-five to thirty feet (or two \u25a0car lengths) from the intersection. The automobile operator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>came to a stop at the intersection in obedience to the changing-traffic control signal as another motor vehicle came to a stop, in the slow lane along side of him. While the leading automobile was in a stopped position, the right front of the following ambulance collided with the left rear of the automobile as the ambulance driver was attempting to turn into the left turn deceleration or storage lane. The resulting damage to the respective vehicles was minimal but the automobile operator sustained an injury to liis neck. After the accident the automobile operator, at the request of the ambulance driver, followed him to the: hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Three witnesses testified at the trial. The pertinent testimony of the patrolman (Officer Disney), who investigated the accident not at the scene but at the hospital (after each of the parties had informed him of their movements in approaching the intersection and as to the position of the respective motor vehicles when the accident happened) was to the effect that the automobile driver told him that he had come to a gradual stop and was waiting in the fast lane for the traffic signal to change-from red to green when the accident occurred and that his statement was made in the presence of the ambulance driver who did not then contradict it.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The ambulance driver was called as a witness by the plaintiff and extensively examined. He testified that the traffic signal was green when he was between one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five feet from the intersection but had not noticed it again until after the accident; that in the meantime he began to brake the ambulance \u201cgently\u201d with the intention of making a left turn at the intersection; that there \u201cwas a little too much\u201d going on for him to really observe it all; that when he was still some distance from the intersection he noticed that the automobile in front of him had stopped; that he had not then applied his brakes harder because he did not want to \u201cshake up\u201d the injured passenger; that he had not applied them sooner because he hoped the automobile driver would \u201cpull-up\u201d closer to the intersection so that he could \u201cpull-into\u201d the left turn lane but had been precluded from so doing by the automobile stopping too far from the intersection; and that, for that reason, he had not forcefully applied his brakes un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>til he was eight to ten feet from the stopped automobile. Although he had previously testified that the automobile had \u25a0stopped suddenly when he was \u201ctrying to make this third lane,\u201d \u25a0he admitted on redirect, when asked if he could have stopped ihad he applied the brakes \u201cmore strongly,\u201d that it was possible. 'In addition to testifying that he surmised, from the fact that the \u2022automobile operator had not reacted to the siren and flashing flights, that he had not heard or seen the ambulance, he stated \u25a0\u25a0that it was the policy of the fire department to stop at all red flights.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The automobile operator testified that he had applied his 'brakes approximately thirty-five or forty feet from the traffic flight; that his stop had been a normal one and that he had been \u25a0\u25a0sitting at the light for \u201cabout thirty seconds or so\u201d when he felt the jolt. Although the ambulance driver could not remember whether he had passed to the right or left of the automobile \u25a0 after the accident, the automobile operator, in reply to a question as to whether there was room enough between the rear of his automobile and the entrance to the left turn lane for the \u2022 ambulance to enter it, stated that the ambulance driver backed \u25a0up after the collision, went to the left of the automobile, asked the automobile driver to \u201cfollow [him] to the hospital\u201d and fled the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">At the close of all the evidence, the motion for a directed ver\u25a0dict in favor of the plaintiff was denied, the case was submitted to the jury on instructions which were not excepted to <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants. When the trial court denied the motion for a judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>or, in the alternative, for a new trial and entered a judgment for costs, the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The trial court erred in denying the motion for judgment <em>\u25a0n.o.v. </em>On motions for a directed verdict or for judgment n.o.v., -as the case may be, if the evidence, considered in the light most \u25a0favorable to the party against whom the motion has been made, is capable of only one conclusion, the motion should be granted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>Dunnill v. </em>Bloomberg, 228 Md. 230, 179 A. 2d 371 (1962); <em>Garozynski v. </em>Daniel, 190 Md. 1, 57 A. 2d 339 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Under several of the provisions of the motor vehicle law, the drivers of emergency vehicles are given the right of way and excused from obeying certain rules of the road \u2014 see \u00a7\u00a7 183 (b) and (c), 214 and 235(a) of Article 66^4 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 but the drivers of such vehicles are not relieved from using due care for the safety of others. These statutory due care requirements have been interpreted to mean that the drivers of emergency vehicles are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>liable for ordinary negligence (though their conduct may not be measurable by the same yardstick as is applicable to drivers of conventional vehicles) and must use reasonable care under the circumstances. <em>M. &amp; C. C. of Baltimore v. Fire Insurance Salvage Corps, </em>219 Md. 75, 148 A. 2d 444 (1959) ; <em>Martin v. Rossignol, </em>226 Md. 363, 174 A. 2d 149 (1961). See also <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Young, </em>189 Md. 428, 56 A. 2d 140 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Thus, even though the drivers of authorized emergency vehicles are given special privileges under \u00a7 183 (b) and (c) and \u00a7214, both <em>supra, </em>they are, nevertheless, required to exercise such reasonable care and diligence as the circumstances of the case may impose. <em>M. &amp; C. C. of Baltimore v. Fire Insurance Salvage Corps, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Exactly how much warning the leading driver should give of bis intention to slow1 down or stop and what precautions the following driver should take to avoid a collision cannot be defined in a precise rule. Rather, as was said in <em>Brehm v. Lorenz, </em>206 Md. 500, 112 A. 2d 475 (1955), the duties of the respective drivers are correlative in that the driver of the front vehicle must exercise ordinary care not to slow down or stop without giving the driver of the rear vehicle adequate warning of his intention and in that the driver of the rear vehicle must exercise ordinary care to avoid colliding with the front vehicle. Ordinarily, as it was in <em>Brehm, </em>the question as to which of the drivers involved in a rear-end collision neglected to use due care is for the jury to decide. To the same effect, see <em>Moore v. Reid, </em>249 Md. 167, 238 A. 2d 874 (1968); <em>Clark v. Junkins, </em>245 Md. 104, 225 A. 2d 275 (1967); <em>Christman v. Weil, </em>196 Md. 207, 76 A. 2d 144 (1950) ; <em>Sieland v. Gallo, </em>194 Md. 282, 71 A. 2d 45 (1950) and <em>Mitchell v. Dowdy, </em>184 Md. 634, 42 A. 2d 717 (1945). Only in exceptional cases, where it is clear (as is the situation here) that reasonable minds would not differ with regard to the facts, will the question of negligence pass from the realm of fact to that of law. <em>Bernardi v. Roedel, </em>225 Md. 17, 168 A. 2d 886 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Under the facts of this case, we think it is apparent that the automobile operator was free from contributory negligence and that the ambulance driver was negligent as a matter of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The salient facts are such as to indicate that reasonable minds would not differ as to the verdict. The ambulance driver admitted that he had been remiss in watching the intermittent red and green traffic control signal. He neglected to effectively brake the ambulance after he knew that the automobile had stopped. He correctly surmised that the automobile operator was unaware of the presence of the ambulance. And, what is more important, he did not forcefully apply the ambulance brakes until he was within eight to ten feet of the stopped automobile. Obviously, the ambulance driver did not exercise ordinary care to avoid colliding with the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We hold that the motion for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\n<em>Judgment for costs reversed; judgment n.o.v. granted; and case remanded for a new trial as to damages; the appellees to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-8\">. The plaintiff excepted to the original charge with respect to \"the doctrine of last clear chance, but when the trial court fully Instructed the jury in this regard no further exceptions were taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\">. Section 183 (b) and (c), concerning the stopping of emergency vehicles at stop signals and signs, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201c(b) <em>Emergency vehicles </em>\u2014 Stopping.\u2014-The driver of any authorized emergency vehicle when responding to an emergency call upon approaching a red or stop signal or any stop sign shall slow down as necessary for safety but may proceed cautiously past such red or stop signal or stop sign.
