A written decision was filed on February 2, 1967. The order for and petition to appeal, statement of claimant\u2019s issues and prayer for a jury trial were forwarded to the clerk of court on February 16, 1967, well within the thirty days prescribed by Maryland Rule B4. Copies were also sent to the attorney for the \u25a0employer, who, on February 20, 1967, filed an answer to the petition, the employer\u2019s issues and certain interrogatories to be \u25a0answered by the claimant. Answers to the interorgatories were filed on March 8, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Without indicating whether or not the appeal had been docketed, the clerk mailed the attorney for claimant a bill for ten dollars for \u201cfiling fee due\u201d on February 23, 1967. A second 'bill was mailed on March 7, 1967, with a notice that the appeal had not been filed and a check was mailed forthwith by the \u25a0appellant. The appeal was not docketed until March 9, 1967. \u25a0Claiming that the appeal was filed too late, the employer moved to dismiss it on March 22, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">On the appeal to this Court, it is alternatively contended that without having given proper notice, the clerk could not refuse to docket the appeal until the filing fee was paid and that the \u25a0clerk, in the absence of a local rule governing payment of filing costs, should not have refused to docket the appeal. The \u2022appellant is right but for the wrong reason. The real question is whether a deposit \u201ctoward the payment of the costs\u201d due (or to become due) clerks of the circuit courts in the counties is required on appeals from administrative agencies or inferior courts. We think a deposit of costs was not required of the claimant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>While subsection (a) of \u00a7 10 of Article 24 of the Code (1966 Repl. Vol.), which now has statewide application,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201c[t]he clerks of the circuit courts of the counties and * * * the civil common-law and equity courts of Baltimore City shall not docket any suit or issue process in any original suit, matter, proceeding or action at law until the plaintiff, * * *, shall first deposit, with the clerk of the court in which such suit, matter or proceeding shall be brought, toward the payment of the costs of the clerk * * * for which plaintiff is liable\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">the case at bar, being an appeal from the compensation commission, is not an <em>original </em>suit, matter, proceeding or action at law. Nor is the appellant a <em>plaintiff </em>within the meaning of the section. An examination of the several public general and local laws on which what is now \u00a7 10(a) was based makes it clear that the Legislature never intended to require prepayment of costs on appeals to courts of law from the decisions of administrative agencies and inferior courts. With one exception \u2014 a provisory clause in the public local law applicable to Baltimore City \u2014 appeals to law courts as courts of review were not even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u25a0mentioned. Invariably, the requirement as to the prepayment of costs had reference only to cases at law or in equity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsection (b) of \u00a7 10 permits an exception when the party plaintiff is not able to make a deposit on account of the courts costs. Subsection (c), as above indicated, is nothing more than notice to the clerks of the city common-law courts not to require a deposit of costs of appellants from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission and the People\u2019s Court. See Chapter 69 of the Laws of 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Section 45 of Article III of the Constitution authorized the General Assembly to provide a uniform system of charges by clerks of courts and registers of wills and for the collection of such charges. The enactment of \u00a7 10 of Article 24 requiring a deposit toward the payment of costs on the docketing of a case at law or in equity probably had a twofold purpose \u2014 the discouraging of frivolous litigation and assuring payment of at least a part of the costs should the plaintiff be the losing party - \u2014 but it is unlikely that \u00a7 10(a) was intended to apply to appeals from administrative agencies and inferior courts to courts of review for at least two reasons \u2014 first, because the section clearly does not in terms so provide and, secondly, because the \u2022costs in appeal cases are usually allowed to the prevailing party upon conclusion of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Assuming that the Circuit Court for Carroll County had \u2022adopted local rules \u2014 the record indicates the contrary \u2014 it had no authority to adopt rules with regard to the prepayment of \u2022costs. Only the Circuit Court for Baltimore County has such power and that is limited to its ordinary jurisdiction as a law and equity court. See \u00a7 12 of Article 24 of the Code. None of the Maryland Rules of Procedure requires the prepayment of \u2022costs. Rule 604 a, with regard to costs generally, states that unless provided by law or ordered by court, the prevailing party in the trial court is entitled to an allowance of court costs. See <em>Urquhart v. Alexander &amp; </em>Alexander, 218 Md. 405, 147 A. 2d 213 (1958). Rule 882 a, with respect to the awarding of costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>in this Court, besides stating that the allowance of costs is discretionary, further provides that unless otherwise ordered costs shall be awarded against the losing party. See <em>Buckler v. Davis Sand and Gravel Corp., </em>208 Md. 162, 117 A. 2d 562 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Unless and until it is finally determined that the claimant-appellant is not entitled to compensation for her injuries, there was no reason why she should have been required to pay the costs. We hold that the petition for review should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded jor entry of an order reinstating appeal from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission; costs in this court to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\">.
