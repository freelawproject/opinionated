Under that Rule (paragraph b) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cIf more than 30 days have elapsed after the action is at issue such summons on a third party shall be issued only upon consent of the plaintiff or upon a showing that the delay was excusable or does not prejudice other parties to the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The history of the cases involved is long and somewhat complicated and counsel for the parties in attack, defense, and counter-attack have used all weapons available to skilled and resourceful practitioners under modern pleading and practice. It would serve no good purpose to detail them here. Suffice it to say that the trial judge is vested with sound discretion under Rule 315 b in deciding whether a defendant\u2019s delay in seeking impleader would prejudice \u201cother parties to the action,\u201d and his determination that there would be such prejudice will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is shown that he abused that discretion. <em>Gorn v. Kolker, </em>213 Md. 551, 554-55. We do not find in the cases before us any abuse of discretion by Judge Foster or Judge Barrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\n<em>Orders affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
