The Board consists of three members appointed biennially by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The chairman is designated by the Governor. \u00a7 155 (d) of the Act fixes the salaries of Board members and the chairman and authorizes the Board to appoint an executive secretary and fix his salary, subject to approval by the State Comptroller. \u00a7 63 (d) provides for the payment, by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, from license fees collected, of the salaries and expenses of the Board and its employees, as approved by the State Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">The Board is vested with authority to approve the issuance of licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages (\u00a7 60); to adopt rules and regulations limiting the number of licenses (\u00a7 42); to renew licenses (\u00a7 68); and to revoke and suspend them (\u00a7 69). The Board is given \u201cfull power and authority to adopt such reasonable rules and regulations as [it] may deem necessary to enable [it] effectively to discharge the duties imposed upon [it] * * (\u00a7 184 (a)). Failure of a licensee to comply with the rules or regulations of the Board makes revocation or suspension mandatory (\u00a7 69).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">On 23 June 1967, the Board adopted Rule 3 (e) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">\u201cNo licensee, except the holder of a Class \u00a3C\u2019 (Club) license, shall, directly or indirectly, refuse, withdraw from, or deny to any persons the services, accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges offered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>said licensee\u2019s premises on the grounds of race, color, creed or national origin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">The appellees, duly licensed bar owners in Baltimore, on 28 June 1967, filed in the Baltimore City Court a petition for a declaratory judgment in which they challenged the validity of Rule 3 (e), assigning, among their reasons, the Board\u2019s failure to comply with the rule-and regulation-making provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (the APA), Maryland Code (1965 Repl. Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 244-256. The Board moved to dismiss on the grounds that the Board was not a state agency to which the APA applied and that no justiciable controversy was presented. The lower court overruled the motion to dismiss, and on 20' July 1967, entered an order declaring that a justiciable controversy existed; that the Board was a state agency within the meaning of the APA; and that Rule 3 (e) was invalid in consequence of the failure of the Board to comply with the APA in the adoption of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The Board appealed, contending that the appellees\u2019 petition raised no justiciable controversy, and that the Board was not a state agency subject to the APA. This was the posture in which the case was presented to us in the briefs filed by the parties and in oral argument. Under our view of the case, we do not reach the appellant\u2019s contentions. Maryland Rule 835 permits this Court, on its own motion, to dismiss an appeal not allowed by law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In <em>Miles v. McKinney, </em>174 Md. 551, 199 A. 540 (1938), the Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of Baltimore attempted to appeal from an order of the Baltimore City Court which had reversed an order of the Zoning Board. Judge Offutt, speaking for this Court, pointed out that the Zoning Board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>which exercised quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative functions, \u201chas no interest, personal or official, in the matters which come before it other than to decide them according to the law and the proved fact, and it is in no sense a party to such proceedings.\u201d 174 Md. at 561, 199 A. at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">After pointing out that certain boards and agencies, charged with the execution of public policy, are specifically charged by the legislature with the duty of participating in litigation affecting their decisions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Offutt continued, 174 Md. at 562, 199 A. at 545 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">\u201cApart from the legislative authority, it would seem clear that the Board has no more right to appeal from its own decisions to the Baltimore City Court, or, from the decisions of that court to the Court of Appeals, than a justice of the peace or such an agency as the State Industrial Accident Commission, would have to appeal from judgments of a court reversing their decisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\"><em>See, </em>Annotation of <em>McKinney, </em>117 A.L.R. 216 and cases there cited; <em>Adler v. M. &amp; C. C. of Baltimore, </em>242 Md. 329, 219 A. 2d 22 (1966); <em>Nuova Realty Co. v. M. &amp; C. C. of Baltimore, </em>197 Md. 266, 78 A. 2d 765 (1951); <em>Roeder v. Brown, </em>192 Md. 639, 65 A. 2d 333 (1949); <em>Knox v. M. &amp; C. C. of Baltimore, </em>180 Md. 88, 23 A. 2d 15 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The Board counters with the contention that <em>Liquor License Board v. Keswick, 227 </em>Md. 598, 177 A. 2d 869 (1962) would seem to lend support to the theory that it may appeal from an adverse decision of a lower court. The Board can gain neither comfort nor support from the <em>Keswick </em>case, where the appeal was dismissed for another and equally valid reason: <em>i.e., </em>the absence of a variance required by Code (1957) Art. 2B, \u00a7 175 (f) for an appeal to lie to this Court. <em>Pearce v. Board of Liquor License Commrs., </em>228 Md. 515, 180 A. 2d 651 (1962); <em>Gianforte v. Board of License Commrs. for Baltimore City, </em>190 Md. 492, 58 A. 2d 902 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Now we turn to a consideration of the provisions of Code (1957, 1968 Replacement Vol.) Art. 2B, \u00a7 175 relating to appeals from the Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From a careful reading of the section, it is apparent that the legislative intent was to severely limit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>right of appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The action of the Board restricting a license or licensee may be appealed by the licensee to the Baltimore City Court. There is a presumption that the Board\u2019s action was proper and in the public interest, and the petitioner has the burden of proving that it was otherwise. The decision of the court is final, and no further appeal lies to this Court, except under the limited conditions described in subsection (f). Nowhere is there an intimation that an appeal by the Board to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Court will lie, and this conclusion is strengthened by the grant of authority in subsection (e) (2) authorizing the Board to be represented in the hearing in the lower court. Had the legislature intended to permit the Board to appeal from a reversal of its own decision, we are convinced it would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">In the trial of the case below, and in the case before us, the Board vigorously argued that it was not subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. Although a determination of this contention is not necessary to our decision in this case, the Board would have been in no better position before us had it attempted to invoke the APA. As Judge (later Chief Judge) Henderson, speaking for the Court, said in <em>Md. Pharmacy Board v. Peco, </em>234 Md. 200, 202-03, 198 A. 2d 273 (1964) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">\u201cCode (1963 Supp.), Art. 43, sec. 268(d) provides for an appeal by any person to whom the Board has refused to issue a permit, or whose permit has been revoked, but it does not authorize any appeal by any other person. It is conceded, however, that the Board is an \u2018agency\u2019 as defined in Code (1963 Supp.), Art. 41, sec. 244 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the provisions of that Act are applicable. Sec. 255(a) provides: <em>\u2018Right to review. </em>\u2014 Any party aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case, * * * is entitled to judicial review thereof under this subtitle.\u2019 Sec. 256 provides: \u2018An aggrieved party may secure a review of any final judgment of the circuit court by appeal to the Court of Appeals.\u2019 Code (1957), Art. 5, sec. 1 provides that \u2018[a]ny party may appeal to the Court of Appeals from any final judgment or determination of a court of law in any civil suit or action, <em>* </em>* * <em>&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">\u201cIt is well settled that the provisions of Art. 5, sec. 1 do not apply to cases where the trial court exercises a special or limited jurisdiction conferred by statute. <em>Simpler v. State, Use of Boyd, </em>223 Md. 456, 460, and cases cited. We are not here concerned with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>exception where the trial court exceeds its jurisdiction. <em>Bd. of Med. Examiners v. Steward, </em>203 Md. 574, 580.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">We think it is clear that the trial court had jurisdiction and did not exceed its statutory authority in reaching its decision on the law and the facts. It is also \u2019well settled that in cases where the trial court\u2019s power to review depends upon a statute, we must look to the statute to determine who may appeal. The question, then, is whether the Board can be considered an \u2018aggrieved party.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201cThe Board\u2019s function in acting upon an application for permit under the statute is quasi-judicial and not \u2022adversary. It is only a party in the circuit court for the purpose of producing the record (cf. sec. 255(d) and Maryland Rule B 7), or notifying the parties \u2018to the proceeding before it.\u2019 (Sec. 254 and Rule B2 d) Un\u25a0der sec. 255 (b) the trial court may \u2018permit other interested persons to intervene.\u2019 In <em>Zoning Appeals Board v. McKinney, </em>174 Md. 551, 564, it was said: \u2018Since therefore the Board [of Zoning Appeals] is not \u25a0a party to this proceeding, has no interest in it different from that which any judicial or quasi judicial agency would have, which is to decide the cases coming before it fairly and impartially, [it] is in no sense aggrieved by the decision of the Baltimore City Court, \u25a0* * *.\u2019 See also <em>Mayor &amp; C. C. of Balto. v. Shapiro, </em>187 Md. 623 and <em>Roeder v. Brown, </em>192 Md. 639. It may also be noted that the same phrase is used in sec. 255(a) and in that context it could not apply to the Board, for the Board could hardly be \u2018aggrieved\u2019 by its own decision. Moreover the Legislature, in using the phrase, presumably was well aware of its interpretation by this Court in the cases cited. Had the Legislature desired to enlarge the right of appeal it could easily have done so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">We are aware that in the field of administrative law, agencies may have duties which are quasi-legislative as well as quasi-judicial. This is a distinction which the APA recognizes by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>setting up different procedures to be followed in the promulgation of rules and regulations on the one hand and the hearing of contested cases on the other.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Compare </em>Code (1965 Repl. Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 245-50 <em>with </em>Code (1965 Repl. Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 251-56. We do not intend that this reference to the APA should be taken as a determination by us that the Board is included within the definition of an \u201cagency\u201d to which the APA is applicable. Code (1965 Repl. Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7 244(a). However, if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Board, in promulgating rules and regulations, was subject to the APA, we find statutory warrant for an appeal to this Court <em>only </em>by an aggrieved party in a contested case. Code (1965 Repl. Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7 256; <em>Md. Pharmacy Board v. Peco, supra. </em>Since the Act contains no specific provision relating to appellate review of rules and regulations, it can hardly be argued that a standard different from or less restrictive than that which governs contested cases could be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We conclude that the Board\u2019s appeal was not allowed by law and should therefore be dismissed as provided in Maryland Rule 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\">.
