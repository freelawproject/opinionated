A more complete statement will be found in <em>Avey v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 178, 228 A. 2d 614 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">It was about 2:00 a.m. on 26 January 1965 when Lt. Thorn-berry of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department noticed a broken pane in the door of a shopping center delicatessen. He and another officer went in to investigate. When they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>turned on the lights Avey stepped out of the men\u2019s room and said, \u201cOkay, copper, let\u2019s see how good you are. Kill me.\u201d In the ensuing gun fight both officers were wounded. Avey, apparently unscathed, escaped. He was arrested about 6 hours, later and when asked why he shot the officers he said \u201cbecause I was drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Indicted for assault with intent to murder in the case of each policeman and storehouse breaking, he pled not guilty generally and not guilty by reason of insanity. His trial began before Parker, J., and a jury, on 13 October 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Avey testified that he and a woman named Bonnie Caldwell had been \u201criding around\u201d and drinking during the 5 or 6 hours, before the shooting. He said they consumed a \u201cpint of moonshine\u201d and 18 to 20 cans of beer. Avey guessed he had 9 or 10 cans, \u201cmaybe more.\u201d At one point in his testimony he described his condition as \u201cquite intoxicated.\u201d Eater he testified he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say quite intoxicated\u201d but he would say he \u201cwas. still under the influence.\u201d At another point he guessed he was \u201cpretty well plastered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In the course of his charge to the jury the trial judge gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u201cNow, as to the assault with intent to murder and with the intent to maim, I instruct you in an advisory capacity that you may properly consider the state of mind of the defendant at the time of the shooting. I say that because of the type of evidence that has been introduced in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Counsel for Avey, at the conclusion of the charge, made the' statement which follows and which we shall treat as an exception :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">\u201cIf Your Plonor please, as to the question of specific intent, we would ask the Court to advise the jury this too is the State\u2019s burden and it is not the defendant\u2019s. While Your Honor did state that the jury can consider the evidence that came from the stand, you didn\u2019t make any specific mention of mental condition relating to the sanity or whether he had been drinking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Judge Parker noted his exception but he thought his instruction was adequate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Avey was convicted of assault with intent to murder in both cases, and of the crime of storehouse breaking as well. He was sentenced to serve two consecutive 12 year terms in the Maryland Penitentiary, and one 18 month term to run concurrently with the first 12 year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, affirming the conviction, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201cAvey objects to the charge to the jury * * * [b]e--cause the courtf\u2019s] refusfal] to instruct the jury of the fact that the appellant had been drinking may have some effect as to whether he could form the specific intent to commit the crimes * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201cThe majority rule is that where intoxication exists to a degree that it deprives the accused of his capacity to form a specific intent, he cannot be convicted \u2022of a crime requiring that intent, e.g. assault with intent to kill or maim, 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law Section 68. Compare <em>Clarke v. State, </em>236 Md. 648, 207 A. 2d 94, <em>Lipscomb v. State, </em>223 Md. 599, 165 A. 2d 918. We consider the court\u2019s instruction, however, adequate under the majority rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>1 Md. App. at 188-89.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">We think the Court of Special Appeals has stated correctly the general rule. To the same effect see <em>Beall v. State, </em>203 Md. 380, 101 A. 2d 233 (1953) ; <em>Chisley v. State, </em>202 Md. 87, 95 A. 2d 577 (1953); <em>Michael v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 243, 229 A. 2d 145 (1967). We do not agree, however, that the instruction given by the trial judge was adequate. It should be observed that much emphasis was placed upon the question of Avey\u2019s sanity. He filed a plea of insanity. He spent 7 months under observation at the Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital. Dr. John M. Hamilton, the superintendent of Perkins, testified at some length in respect of the tests administered to Avey, his own findings, and the findings of his staff. Dr. Schnoor, a psychiatrist employed by Avey, described fully his examination of Avey and his appraisal of his mental condition. Judge Parker began his charge to the jury by fully instructing them how they should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>go about determining the issue of Avey\u2019s sanity. Then after giving the jury the definitions of storehouse breaking and of the degrees of murder and assault he made the statement the Court of Special Appeals thought was adequate. It will be noted that there is nothing in Judge Parker\u2019s statement to suggest he had in mind Avey\u2019s intoxication vel non or, assuming the jury found it to be a fact, how it might impinge upon their determination of his guilt or innocence of the crime of assault with intent to murder. They might well have thought that by the use of the expression \u201cstate of mind\u201d the court was again referring to the issue of sanity. That the words \u201ctype of evidence\u201d were intended to refer to the psychiatric testimony only would have been a natural assumption on the part of the jury for the quite obvious reason that for every page of the record extract in which drinking is mentioned there are 10 pages given over to psychiatric testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We note with regret the failure of Avey\u2019s counsel to request, before the charge to the jury, an instruction on the question whether Avey was intoxicated to such a degree that he lacked the capacity to form a specific intent to murder. Such a request would have better informed the trial judge what counsel had in mind than the statement we have elected to treat as an exception, which, to be blunt about it, lacks the clarity and precision such an occasion would seem to require. We can understand, therefore, how the full import of wdiat counsel claims now that he meant then might have escaped the trial judge. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the jury was not adequately instructed and, as a consequence thereof, the State\u2019s Attorney, in the opening argument, was able to say that \u201cdrunkenness under our law is no defense, no defense to a crime such as this.\u201d At the conclusion of the State\u2019s opening argument counsel for Avey \u201cmovefd] for a mistrial\u201d citing the State\u2019s \u201cerroneous statement of the law\u201d and insisting that \u201cdrunkenness is a defense to a specific intent.\u201d The motion for a mistrial was denied. In his closing argument the State\u2019s Attorney told the jury that \u201cthe law on the subject is clear.\u201d The general rule, \u201cthat voluntary drunkenness is no excuse for a crime\u201d he said, applies to homicide. Pie added, without in any respect indicating the source or the context thereof, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u201cThe Court of Appeals [this Court] says, \u201cLikewise without merit is the appellant\u2019s contention he was too intoxicated to form the necessary intent to kill.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">For the reasons stated the judgments in Criminal Trials Nos. 5455 and 5456 will be reversed and the cases will be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Judgments in criminal trials Nos. 5455 and 5456 reversed. Cases remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
