He brought this action in mandamus, through his mother as guardian ad litem and against the school authorities, to compel his reinstatement. Defendants appeal from the trial court\u2019s order directing issuance of a writ of mandate as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Defendants are the school district which maintains Areata High School, the five elected members of the governing board of the district, the district superintendent, and the principal and the vice-principal of the school. Petitioner was 15 years old in 1966. In his petition, he alleged that on October 19, 1966, he was a \u201cstudent regularly attending . . . Areata High School\u201d; that Ramon A. Fauria, the school\u2019s vice-principal, suspended him on that date \u201cfor not abiding by the school policy regarding personal appearance\u201d; that the suspension was subsequently approved by the school district governing board; and that it was \u201carbitrary and capricious. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The trial court issued an alternative writ of mandate when the action was commenced. Defendants answered the petition. They admitted the fact of petitioner\u2019s suspension, but alleged in substance that he had been suspended because the length of his hair violated a \u201cregulation . . . with respect to student dress and appearance\u201d which the governing board had duly adopted pursuant to its rulemaking power as set forth in section 10604 of the Education Code. The answer pleaded the text of the \u201cregulation,\u201d which is hereinafter quoted in full. Defendants further alleged that \u201cextremes\u201d in hair style of both boy and girl students are \u201cdisruptive\u201d of the educational function of a school, and that petitioner\u2019s hair style had this effect at Areata High School. They also denied that petitioner was a \u201cstudent regularly . . . attending\u201d the school, and raised issues concerning his nonresidence in the Areata Union High School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">It was established at the trial that petitioner was suspended because the length of his hair violated that portion of the school\u2019s \u201cdress policy\u201d which provided that \u201cextremes of hair styles are not acceptable.\u201d The full text of the \u201cpolicy\u201d appeared in a \u201cStudent Handbook\u201d (and, apparently, in no other formal source). Petitioner had received a copy of the handbook, as had all students. A copy was received in evidence at the trial. The \u201cdress policy,\u201d as identified in the testimony of the district superintendent, is stated in the open<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ing paragraphs of part V of the handbook. These paragraphs read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cV. School Policies</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Campus Clothes\u2014Extremes of dress and personal appearance are not conducive to the well being of all. Simplicity, neatness, cleanliness, and good taste are the keynote for school dress. Excessive tightness in clothes as well as extremes in shirt tails and similarly, <em>extremes of hair styles are not acceptable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cGirls shall wear skirts and blouses or sweaters or appropriate dresses. Girls <em>[sic] </em>clothes shall fit properly and be in current taste and style.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201cBoys shall wear conventional slacks or jeans properly adjusted. Shirts shall be buttoned to within one button of the collar. Shirt tails with a square cut or with a soft curve designed for outside wear and in good taste are acceptable wear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201cExtremes in dress, in style, and in individual taste are to be avoided.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">The evidence at the trial did show that \u201cregulations\u201d were enforced by the school principal \u201cand his delegated authority.\u201d In practice, the principal\u2019s \u201cdelegated authority\u201d was the vice-principal, Mr. Fauria. Fauria testified that the school\u2019s physical education department acted as a screening group for him on the subject of student hair styles: \u201cThey identify students with the extreme hair styles . . . they talk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>to the student first, they try to get their cooperation, and then they refer them to me when their efforts have failed. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The physical education teacher who reported petitioner to the vice-principal was James Cady, who also testified. Cady said that five physical education teachers \u201cpolice more or less\u201d students for long hair. He (Cady) had noted the length of petitioner\u2019s hair, spoke to him about it, and sent him to the vice-principal before the suspension occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The defense witnesses were interrogated concerning the meaning of the words \u201cextremes of hair styles.\u201d Mr. Fauria testified that he regarded 1 \u2018 extremes of hair styles \u2019 \u2019 as meaning \u201cdeviation from acceptable wear,\u201d and that \u201cextremes\u201d meant \u201cdeviations\u201d which were not acceptable to him. He considered that a bald-shaven head would be \u201cextreme\u201d on the one hand, the hair of a boy who had never visited a barber would be \u201cextreme\u201d on the other. Petitioner\u2019s hair, he said, was not within \u201cnormal\u201d range: \u201cit was much longer than the range of students at Areata High School.\u201d On the same subject, Cady testified that a boy\u2019s \u201cears should be showing and ... [if his hair is] down to the collar and starting to turn up or something like that, it is too long. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The vice-principal also testified that \u201cextremes of hair styling\u201d could interfere with the \u201clearning situation\u201d at Areata High School. He said that the type of haircut affected by petitioner is a \u201cfocal point for conversation\u201d and \u201cdiscussion\u201d among students, and that \u201clong hair\u201d is an issue which interferes with classroom decorum.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Robert Meeks, another teacher at Areata High School (but not a physical education instructor), testified that the \u201clength of hair style\u201d was a \u201ctalked about item\u201d among' the students, and that they discussed it in class to the point where it interfered with the conduct of a class by distracting the students from their classroom work. He testified that they also talked about other subjects (such as athletics, ears and girls), and that discipline in such matters was always a problem in a secondary school.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Little, if any, of the foregoing evidence associated petitioner\u2019s hair (as distinguished from long hair as a general topic) with classroom distractions at the school. However, Fauria and Cady both testified that, during the \u00cd965-1966 (i.e., the preceding) school year, some of petitioner\u2019s fellow students (\u201cvigilantes,\u201d as counsel for the school authorities put it) took exception to the length of his hair, seized him, gave him a forcible haircut, and slightly injured him in the process.. .</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Cady testified that on October 18, 1966, petitioner\u2019s hair was \u201ctoo long . . . beyond what we allowed.\u201d He asked petitioner how much time he needed to have it cut. Petitioner was not cooperative, whereupon Cady sent him to the vice-principal. The latter suspended petitioner after a further conversation produced no results. The vice-principal then wrote a letter to petitioner\u2019s mother, stating in pertinent part that \u201c [Y]our son, Gregor, has been suspended from school for not abiding by the school policy regarding personal appearance. In the opinion of school personnel, your son was in violation of this policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">So far as the trial record shows, Mr. Cady\u2019s standards of a male student hair style which was \u201ctoo long\u201d (because, as he put it, the hair obscures the student\u2019s ears, or reaches his collar, or \u201cis starting to turn up\u201d) were not communicated to petitioner or to anyone else; an \u201cacceptable\u201d hair style, in terms of maximum permissible length or by reference to his ears or his collar or other criteria, was not defined to petitioner or to his mother by anyone; and neither of them was told how much of a haircut would produce a style which was \u201cacceptable\u201d as something other than \u201cextreme.\u201d Two portrait photographs of petitioner each taken on the evening preceding his suspension, were received in evidence at the trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Upon the foregoing evidence, the trial court found among other things that the school\u2019s \u201crule\u201d that \u201c \u2018extremes of hair styles are not acceptable\u2019 is so vague and indefinite as to render said rule unconstitutional and unenforceable,\u201d and that the rule \u201cwas not properly enforceable against . . . [petitioner] due to its unconstitutionality.\u201d The court made substantially the same statements as \u201cconclusions of law,\u201d and thereupon entered the order from which defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Defendants first contend that the \u201cdress policy\u201d at Areata High School, to the effect that 1 \u2018 extremes of hair styles' are not acceptable,\u201d is a reasonable exercise of the governing board\u2019s rulemaking power in the area of student discipline, and that it is not constitutionally unenforceable by reason- of its language. Because of its language, however, we hold against both contentions; we affirm the order requiring petitioner\u2019s reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The California Legislature has the constitutional duty and power to maintain a system of free public education in this state. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5.) By statute, the Legislature has delegated to local school district governing boards the authority to operate the public schools within their respective political jurisdictions (Ed. Code, \u00a7 921<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>), and to promulgate necessary rules and regulations controlling student conduct. (Id., \u00a7 10605<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) Students are required to comply with such regulations <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 10609<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) under pain of suspension. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 10604 [quoted in fn. 4, <em>ante.] </em>See, generally, <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside Unified School Dist. Board of Education, supra, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 161, 167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>In some areas of student conduct involving dress and appearance, such regulations may clash with constitutional rights; and contemporary experience demonstrates this to be notably true of school regulations controlling male students\u2019 hair. (See, e.g., <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside Unified School Dist. Board of Education, supra, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 161; <em>Ferrell </em>v. <em>Dallas Independent School Dist., supra, </em>392 F.2d 697; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Attleboro </em>(1965) 349 Mass. 704 [212 N.E.2d 468, 14 A.L.R.3d 1192]; Comment, <em>The Power of School Officials to Regulate Student Appearance </em>(1966) 3 Harv. Legal Comm. 1; Annot., 14 A.L.R.3d 1201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The wearing of a beard by one engaged in the educational process is an expression of his personality and, wearing it, he is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. <em>(Finot </em>v. <em>Pasadena City Board of Education </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 189, 201-202 [58 Cal.Rptr. 520] [teacher]. See <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside Unified School Dist. Board of Education, supra, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 161 at p. 167 [high school student].) Because a long hair style is indistinguishable from a beard for constitutional purposes,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a male affecting it in a school is entitled to the same protection.  Adulthood is not a prerequisite: the state and its educational agencies must heed the constitutional rights of all persons, including schoolboys. <em>(Board of Education </em>v. <em>Barnette, supra </em>(fn. 6, <em>ante), </em>319 U.S. 624 at p. 637 [87 L.Ed. 1628 at p. 1637, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 147 A.L.R. 674], See <em>In re Gaullt </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 13 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 538, 87 S.Ct. 1428]; <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside Unified School Dist. Board of Education, supra, </em>at p. 167; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Sacramento City etc. School Dist. </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 278, 291 [53 Cal.Rptr. 781].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>School authorities, nevertheless, may impose more stringent regulations upon the constitutional rights of minors than upon those of adults: \u2018 \u2018where there is an invasion of protected freedoms \u2018. . . the power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults. . . .\u2019 (Citation.)\u201d <em>(Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 629, 638 [20 L.Ed.2d 195, 203, 88 S.Ct. 1274] (quoted, in a school-student context, in <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside Unified School Dist. Board of Education, supra, </em>262 Cal. App.2d 161 at p. 166.)  It follows that not every limitation upon the exercise of secondary students\u2019 constitutional rights, by a school district governing board, is prohibited <em>(Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside School Dist. Board of Education, supra); </em>and, where there is empirical evidence that an aspect of a student\u2019s dress or appearance (such as a hair style) has a disruptive effect within a school, the board may prohibit it. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 168-169; <em>Ferrell </em>v. <em>Dallas Independent School Dist., </em>392 F.2d 697 at pp. 699, 702-703 (cert, den., 393 U.S. 856 [21 L.Ed.2d 125, 89 S.Ct. 98]); <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Attleboro, supra, </em>212 N.E.2d 468 at p. 472. See <em>Finot </em>v. <em>Pasadena City Board of Education, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 189 at p. 202.) Accordingly, the governing board in the present case could validly exercise its statutory rulemaking power to require that petitioner wear his hair at a shorter length.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The board need not have enacted a formal regulation to achieve this result, but one materialized in the form of the \u201cdress policy\u201d which states that \u201cextremes of hair styles are not acceptable. \u2019 \u2019 Petitioner has not asserted, in the trial court or here, that he had the right to defy any rule or instruction directed to his hair: he challenged this one\u2014the \u201cdress policy\u201d\u2014for its vagueness. (He also alleged that his hair complied with it.) In the pleadings, both parties alleged that he was suspended because his hair violated the \u201cpolicy\u201d; the vice-principal so testified; and defendants have stood squarely upon the \u201cpolicy,\u201d both at trial and on the appeal. The propriety of the suspension therefore depends upon the validity of the \u201cpolicy.\u201d Both, in our view, were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Acting in this constitutional field, a school district governing board must act constitutionally. The exercise of its rulemaking power must meet the standards of reasonableness enunciated in <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Washington Township Hospital Dist. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 499, 501-502 [55 Cal.Rptr. 401, 421 P.2d 409]; the restraint imposed by its regulations must rationall<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>y relate to the enhancement of the educational function, the public benefits produced must outweigh the consequent impairment of the student\u2019s constitutional rights, and there can be no alternatives \u201cless subversive\u201d of those rights. <em>(Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside Unified School Dist. Board of Education, supra, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 161 at pp. 167-168.) In the present case there is substantial evidence that long hair, on male students, had a disruptive effect at Areata High School. Because of the public\u2019s obvious interest in an undistracted educational process at the school, the \u201cdress policy\u201d (as it affected male students\u2019 hair) met the first two tests mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">As to the third <em>Bagley </em>test, the governing board\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> fails.  As we have seen, its inhibition of hair styles restrains the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In this area, the standards of permissible statutory vagueness are strict and government may regulate \u201conly with narrow specificity.\u201d <em>(N.A.A.C.P. </em>v. <em>Button </em>(1963) 371 U.S. 415, 432 [9 L.Ed.2d 405, 417-418, 83 S.Ct. 328]. See <em>Fort </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 331, 337 [38 Cal.Rptr. 625, 392 P.2d 385].) In the <em>Finot </em>and <em>Akin </em>cases, the applicable regulations prohibited the wearing of beards at school. <em>(Finot </em>v. <em>Pasadena City Board of Education, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 189, at p. 191; <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside Unified School Dist. Board of Education, supra, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 161 at p. 163.) This was \u201cnarrow specificity,\u201d because a beard\u2014and its presence or absence\u2014is a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\u2018' Extremes of hair styles, \u2019 \u2019 however, are not facts: whether a given style is \u201cextreme\u201d or not is a matter of opinion, and the definitive opinion here rested in the sole\u2014 and neither controlled nor guided\u2014judgment of a single school official. To him, an \u201cextreme\u201d style was \u201cdeviation from acceptable wear,\u201d but it was he alone who decided what was \u201cacceptable\u201d in the first instance and what was \u201cdeviation\u201d in the next. While his personal good faith in the matter is clear, the \u201cpolicy\u201d is \u201cfar from the kind of narrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>exception to freedom of expression which a state may carve out to satisfy the adverse demands of other interests of society,\u201d <em>(Joseph Burstyn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1952) 343 U.S. 495, 504 [96 L.Ed. 1098, 1107, 72 S.Ct. 777]), and it totally lacks the \u201cspecificity\u201d required of governmental regulations which limit the exercise of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">A \u201claw\u201d violates due process \u201cif it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits or leaves judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what is prohibited and what is not in each particular case. [Citations.] \u201d <em>(Giaccio </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1966) 382 U.S. 399, 402-403 [15 L.Ed.2d 447, 450, 86 S.Ct. 518].)  The \u201cdress policy\u201d concerning hair styles in the present case is \u201cvague and standardless.\u201d It is not a \u201claw\u201d in the sense that criminal sanctions attend its violation, but a violation means suspension from school.  The importance of an education to a child is substantial (see, e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 483, 493 [98 L.Ed. 873, 880, 74 S.Ct. 686, 38 A.L.R.2d 1180]), and the state cannot condition its availability upon compliance with an unconstitutionally vague standard of conduct. (See <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Washington Township Hospital Dist., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 499 at pp. 503-504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We recognize that school regulations not unlike the one here involved were upheld in each of the two principal cases which deal with male high school students who were suspended because of the length of their hair. <em>(Ferrell </em>v. <em>Dallas Independent School Dist., supra, </em>392 F.2d 697; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Attleboro, supra, </em>212 N.E.2d 468.) The language of the <em>Ferrell </em>regulation appears in the trial court\u2019s opinion [261 F.Supp. 545], but not in the appellate decision; the <em>Leonard </em>decision mentions the applicable regulation only in passing (212 N.E.2d 468 at p. 470) ; and, apparently, none of the students affected (who were appellants in both cases) challenged the respective regulation upon the ground of vagueness. Therefore, we do not read either decision as constitutional authority for the enforceability of a \u201cpolicy\u201d which proscribes\u2014but which does not define\u2014\u201cextremes of hair styles. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Arguing against vagueness in the \u201cdress policy,\u201d defendants cite decisions which uphold the constitutionality of statutes restraining the emission of \u201cexcessive smoke\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Madearos </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 642 [41 Cal.Rptr. 269]) and of \u201cexcessive or unusual noise\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1955) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>131 Cal.App.2d 241 [280 P.2d 522, 49 A.L.R.2d 1194]) from motor vehicles. But these eases rest upon the premises that the words \u201cexcessive smoke\u201d and \u201cexcessive or unusual noise\u201d convey ideas which find \u201cadequate interpretation in common usage and understanding\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Peterson, supra, </em>at p. 246), and that whether an emission is \u201cexcessive\u201d is a fact which is reasonably determinable from ordinary experience. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 249-250; <em>People </em>v. <em>Madearos, supra, </em>at pp. 644-645.)  The same premises do not exist in the present case. The words \u201cextremes of hair styles\u201d convey no commonly understood meaning, and whether one such style at Areata High School was \u201cextreme\u201d was neither determinable nor predictable by anyone except the vice-principal. The <em>Madearos </em>and <em>Smith </em>decisions, accordingly, do not lend constitutional stature to the \u201cdress policy\u201d allegedly violated by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Since\u2014as we have seen\u2014the governing board has the statutory power to regulate aspects of student dress and appearance which have an adverse effect upon the educational process at the school, it may enact regulations which would.be valid because less subversive of the students\u2019 constitutional rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Bagley </em>v. <em>Washington Township Hospital Dist., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 499 at pp. 501-502; <em>Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside Unified School Dist. Board of Education, supra, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 161 at pp. 167-168.) It has not done so. Therefore, its \u201cpolicy\u201d prohibiting \u201cextremes of hair styles\u201d cannot be enforced by the suspension of noncomplying students, including petitioner. <em>(Bagley </em>v. <em>Washington Township Hospital Dist., supra, </em>at pp. 506-507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The other principal point raised by defendants on the appeal is based upon these facts as shown by the evidence: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>.Petitioner did not reside in Areata Union High School District. He lived in Eureka High School District, but had nevertheless attended Areata High School throughout the 1965-1966 school year and had re-enrolled at, and attended, the school in September 1966. The two districts had entered into a written interdistrict attendance agreement, pursuant to Education Code section <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> covering the 1966-1967 year. The agreement provided that a student residing in either district could attend a school in the other if he had a \u201cproper permit\u201d from the district of his residence. This meant, in petitioner\u2019s case, that he was required to have such permit from the Eureka district in order to attend Areata High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">No such permit had been issued to petitioner at any time prior to his suspension from attendance at Areata High School. This fact was discovered by the Areata district authorities only after he had been suspended on October 19, 1966. The Eureka district issued a \u201cpermit\u201d in the matter on October 20; the evidence does not show who applied for it. On October 31, the Areata district superintendent advised the Eureka High School District, by letter, that the Areata district could not accept petitioner as a student under the interdistrict attendance agreement \u201cbecause of his failure to comply with school regulations. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Prom the foregoing evidence the trial court found that petitioner resided in Eureka High School District, but that\u2014as pleaded in his petition\u2014he had been \u201ca student regularly attending . . . Areata High School\u201d; that he \u201cdid in fact enroll in and attend Areata High School . . . and no objection to his attendance at Areata High School was raised by . . . [defendants] until October 31, 1966\u201d; and that the school, therefore, was \u201cby its own inaction estopped\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>suspending him. By our interpretation of this language, the court found that defendants, having allowed petitioner to attend Areata High School without a permit prior to his suspension, was estopped from suspending him upon the ground that he lacked one.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Defendants, so interpreting the language, challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support an estoppel. However, it was shown (and it is not disputed) that a permit <em>was </em>issued by the school district of petitioner\u2019s residence on October 20, 1966. This meant that he was entitled to attend Areata High School, so far as the interdistriet attendance agreement was concerned, because there had been compliance with the agreement. It follows that his alleged violation of the school\u2019s \u201cdress policy\u201d was the only ground for suspending him, and that the finding that defendants were \u201cestopped\u201d from suspending him on other grounds was\u2014correct or not\u2014unnecessary. Therefore, and because the trial court\u2019s finding on the constitutional point supports the judgment we need not examine the sufficiency of the evidence to support an estoppel. (See 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (1954) Appeal, \u00a7 103, par. [g], p. 2277.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Since the interdistrict attendance agreement had been complied with on October 20, 1966, and since the \u201cdress policy\u201d was void (as we have held), defendants were without discretion to exclude petitioner under the suspension pronounced on October 19. Therefore, and contrary to defendants\u2019 final contention on the appeal, mandamus was the proper remedy. (Code Civ.

The symbolic value of long hair on a male is probably less obvious: we do not readily accept it as symbolic of masculinity, for example, and in the modern secondary school it may bespeak conformity rather than otherwise. (For a discussion of its symbolism among school students, see Comment, <em>supra, </em>3 Harv. Legal Comm. 1 at p. 2.) Its symbolic value, however, need not be judicially assessed: the symbolism is subjective in the person wearing it. <em>\u201cA </em>person gets from a symbol the meaning he puts into it, and what is one man\u2019s comfort and inspiration is another\u2019s jest and scorn.\u201d <em>(Board of Education </em>v. <em>Barnette </em>(1943) 319 U.S. 624, 632-633 [87 L.Ed. 1628, 1634-1635, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 147 A.L.R. 674].)

A further question thus raised is whether the \u201cpolicy\u201d is in fact that of the board (which is authorized by the Legislature to make necessary rules affecting student conduct) or of another body (which is not). Because our comments presuppose that the \u201cpolicy\u201d is the board\u2019s, we do not reach this question.

Code, \u00a710604.) Neither this section nor any other provision of law <em>requires </em>that school discipline be maintainable only pursuant to formal written regulations; indeed, it is provided in Education Code section' 10601 that a classroom teacher may \u201cfor good cause\u201d sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>pend a pupil from school \u201cfor not exceeding one sehoolday, plus the remainder of the sehoolday during which the suspension is ordered, ...\u201d Section 10602 provides that \u201cContinued willful disobedience, [or] open and persistent defiance of the authority of the school personnel, . . . shall constitute-good cause for suspension or expulsion from school; [if] the conduct for which [the student] is to be disciplined is related to school activity or school attendance.\u201d Neither of these sections requires the adoption of regulations by the governing board or by school administrators in order for valid disciplinary action to be taken thereunder. Both quoted passages are of quite early origin: the passage quoted from section 10601 has been part of the statutory law of this state since 1873.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The language quoted from section 10602 has had a place in the California statutes in substantially its present form since the enactment of the Political Code in 1873.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The reference in section 10604 to the power of the governing board to \u201cmake and enforce all rules and regulations needful for the government and discipline of the schools under its charge \u201d is of more recent origin: it first appears as a subsidiary and implementing section of an enactment quaintly designated in the statute book as the \u201cAnti-frat Act\u201d (Cal.Stats. 1909, ch. 218, \u00a7 2). Neither the 1909 enactment nor any subsequent amendment suggests that the Legislature intended to require the educational authorities to adopt formal rules and regulations as a precondition to maintaining reasonable school discipline. Search reveals no reported decision of any American court, other than the majority opinion in the present case, holding or implying that the adoption of such regulations is a constitutional prerequisite to reasonable school discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The majority opinion mentions that some school districts have adopted elaborate and almost scientifically discrete haircut regulations. That they are free to do, so long as the regulations are not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unconstitutional. But consider the almost infinite variety of disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>concerns which may arise in a public school: personal sanitation, dress, disorder in the passageways, disruptive sp\u00e9ech or conduct in class, and use of bicycles or motor transport, to name a few. Must a school specify in a written regulation the minimum allowable frequency of baths before a teacher may require a student to be clean? What kind of specific regulation is required to enable teachers to restrain disruptive speech in classrooms or movement in passageways ? All these matters may lawfully be left to adjustment and reasonable control by teachers acting informally. It would needlessly disable our schools to force the handling of such problems into a mold of rule and regulation. So long as the teacher acts reasonably the Constitution does not require him to work in an atmosphere of litigious contest with any juvenile sea-lawyer who may appear in his class.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Despite the fact that the governing board need \"not have adopted any written regulations whatever, in order to enable school personnel to exercise reasonably the broad - powers vested in them by statute, the trial court found and concluded that respondent\u2019s suspension from school was unlawfully founded upon a vague, indefinite and unconstitutional rule that \u201cextremes of hair styles are not acceptable.\u201d Respondent himself did not allege in his petition the existence of such a rule; he merely quoted, from a mimeographed student orientation pamphlet which is in evidence, the language which the court found objectionable. It is not clear how the trial court concluded that the inclusion in the pamphlet of this language, indicating generally that students would be required to maintain good grooming, restricted or abolished the power of the principal or his delegates to carry out such a policy on. a case-by-ease basis. There are certain references to \u201cregulations\u201d in the recor<em>d </em>but those unnecessary references have no significance. Respondent was not' suspended from school\u2019 as a penalty for violating some \u201cregulation\u201d which should have been drawn with the specificity of a plumbing code- or- a penal statute; he was suspended upon his \u201ccontinued willful disobedience,\u201d in the language of Education Code, section 10602, of the vice-principal\u2019s request that he get a haircut. No claim is made that the request was vague or unintelligible; had respondent desired to know how long he could leave his hair he could have asked for further discussion. Instead he flatly refused to get a haircut. A request to get a haircut or any other school requirement regarding dress, conduct, or expression may be subject to constitutional attack if it is arbitrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>or-capricious or does not give due weight to First Amendment rights. (Cf. <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Washington Township Hospital Dist. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 499 [55 Cal.Rptr. 401, 421 P.2d 409].) But the opinion of the majority fairly sets out facts showing, as that opinion states, why it would have been lawful to \u201crequire that petitioner wear his hair at a shorter length\u201d; that -history needs no review here. <em>(Akin </em>v. <em>Riverside Unified School Dist. Board of Education </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 161 [68 Cal.Rptr. 557]; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>School Committee of Attleboro </em>(1965) 349 Mass. 704 [212 N.E.2d 468, 14 A.L.R.3d 1192].)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Because the order of suspension was valid, a brief discussion of its consequences will be appropriate. Education Code, section 10607, provides that no secondary school student shall be suspended for \u201cmore than the duration of the current semester.\u201d A further limitation is imposed by section 10607.5: \u201cno student shall be suspended . . . for more than 20 days ...\u201d unless he is transferred to a \u201ccontinuation education school.\u201d Here the suspension was ordered on October 19. Because it was discovered in the course of the controversy ihat the boy resided in an adjoining high school district with which appellant district had an interdistrict attendance agreement, the district of residence was promptly notified that respondent was no longer acceptable at Areata High School. The interdistrict agreement provides only for admission of students who are \u201cacceptable to the district of attendance.\u201d When the boy had been suspended, and thus would soon require placement in continuation school, it was entirely reasonable for appellant district to terminate its tacit acceptance so that the district of residence could make its own determination whether under its policies there existed a disciplinary problem of such gravity as to require further suspension and placement in continuation school.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">I would reverse the order for issuance of writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 9, 1969.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Political Code, section 1696, as amended by Cal.
