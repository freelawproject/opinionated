About six months later appellant took a decree in a Wisconsin court annulling the purported new marriage on the ground that a prior subsisting marriage of Pineda rendered his marriage to Norma bigamous and void. Thereupon, in August of 1967, appellant moved the California court for an order determining that because the new marriage was void she was entitled to receive alimony from respondent under terms of the divorce decree. Hearing evidence that respondent had paid all alimony accrued at the time of appellant\u2019s purported marriage to Pineda, and concluding that the Pineda marriage, though void, extinguished appellant\u2019s right to further alimony, the court denied the motion.  In this appeal Norma concedes that under Civil Code, section 139,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alimony would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>extinguished had the Pineda marriage been merely voidable; but citing such eases as <em>Sefton </em>v. <em>Sefton </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 872 [291 P.2d 439], and <em>Husted </em>v. <em>Husted </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App. 2d 50 [35 Cal.Rptr. 698], she contends for a different result where the second marriage was \u201cillegal and void from the beginning\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 59, 61).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In <em>Sefton </em>v. <em>Sefton, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 872, the Supreme Court considered the effect on alimony rights of an annulled, voidable remarriage. Although the opinion does not discuss the distinction between void and voidable marriages, the court suggested that different consequences might result from the two types of invalid remarriages (see 45 Cal.2d at pp. 875-876). The actual holding of <em>Sefton </em>was that although an annulment is often said to erase entirely the existence of a marriage (see <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>McDonald </em>(1936) 6 Cal.2d 457 [58 P.2d 163, 104 A.L.R. 1290]) annulment of the <em>voidable </em>marriage which had occurred in that case did not reinstate the alimony obligation. One basis for this decision was that third parties would be injured by a rule that an .annulment relates back to the time of the marriage ceremony. The court cited section 86 of the Civil Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in support of this theory and also pointed out that other exceptions to the relation-back doctrine have evolved for the protection of third parties (e.g., children of all annulled marriages, whether void or voidable, are legitimate). (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a784, 85.) The court also noted the following reasons why alimony should not be reinstated (45 Cal.2d at pp. 876-877): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>sustained as the result of the misconduct of a stranger.\u201d All the reasons given for the <em>Sefton </em>holding apply with equal force to a void second marriage. We are therefore not persuaded by dictum to the contrary effect in <em>Husted </em>v. <em>Husted, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.2d at p. 53.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>1.

As a result, the foreign decisions are concerned either with the effect of the annulled remarriage as a \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d between the divorced parties or are involved in interpreting a separation agreement according to the parties\u2019 assumed intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Nevertheless, a review of these cases puts the void-voidable marriage question in perspective. <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Leib </em>(7th Cir. 1952) 199 F.2d 163 [33 A.L.R.2d 1451], is relied upon by appellant. The annulled remarriage in <em>Sutton </em>was like that in the present case: bigamous and void. The federal court held that because under the law of Illinois such a marriage was void as between the two parties to it, it could not be relied upon by a third party either. (199 F.2d at p. 165.) The court declared that the alimony obligation subsisted until a \u201cvalid\u201d remarriage. But we note that <em>Sutton </em>was decided under Illinois law and therefore is of little aid in interpreting California Civil Code, section 139. Moreover, the decision rests upon an assumption that is negated by section 86 of the California Civil Code, i.e., that the invalidation of a marriage has the same effect upon third parties as it does on the two persons directly involved. Among the states which have considered the void-voidable distinction in the context of alimony reinstatement there is a divergence. (See anno. 48 A.L.R.2d 270, 318.) The majority are consistent with <em>Sutton, supra, </em>refusing to consider a void marriage to be a \u201cremarriage\u201d which would terminate alimony obligations (e.g. <em>Johnson County Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bach </em>(1962) 189 Kan. 291 [369 P.2d 231]). However a significant minority of jurisdictions regard the void-voidable distinction as irrelevant, holding that even a bigamous or incestuous remarriage terminates alimony (eg., <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Keeney </em>(1947) 211 La. 585 [30 So.2d 549] <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Jacobsen </em>(1954) 308 N.Y. 218 [124 N.E.2d 290, 48 A.L.R.2d 312]; <em>Denberg </em>v. <em>Frischman </em>(1965) 24 App.Div.2d 100 [264 N.Y.S.2d 114], cert. den. 385 U.S. 884 [17 L.Ed.2d 111, 87 S.Ct. 176]; <em>Herscher </em>v. <em>Herscher </em>(1966) 51 Misc.2d 921 [274 N.Y.S.2d 295]; <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Elam </em>(1944) 182 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Va. 469 [29 S.E.2d 222]). These courts have treated a divorcee as a responsible person who must be held to her decision, presumably relied upon by others, to terminate her right to support from a former husband. (See <em>Herscher </em>v. <em>Herscher, supra, </em>at pp. 297-298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">We find no persuasive reason for distinguishing between the effects upon alimony of a void and a voidable remarriage. Either constitutes a remarriage under section 139 of the Civil Code; either terminates the alimony rights of the remarried spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The order denying appellant\u2019s motion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Devine, P.
