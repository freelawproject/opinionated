J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alv\">Wilson K. Short, convicted after jury trial of two counts of first degree robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211), appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">On January 3, 1968, Martha Ann Moore, while working as a clerk at Danber Drug Store in Fountain Valley, saw Short standing at the store\u2019s ice cream counter near the cash register. Short pulled out a gun, pointed it at Mrs. Moore and demanded cash from the register. Mrs. Moore complied, putting bills and rolls of coins in a paper bag and handing the bag to Short who departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">Catherine Mikolajek, a customer in the store witnessed the robbery and studied Short\u2019s features very carefully, stating positively Short was the robber. Mrs. Mikolajek saw Short drive away in a car and memorized the license number of it. It was a stolen car.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">Deacon W. Smith, a driver for Professional Drug Company, also witnessed the robbery, gave chase in his car as the robber fled, but lost him. Smith was unable to identify Short as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">Several days after the robbery, the police showed Mrs. Moore, the clerk, about six pictures for suspect identification. Mrs. Moore selected two she thought \u201cmight have been\u201d of the man who robbed her. A second time the police showed Mrs. Moore three pictures from which she picked one that 11 could be the man. \u2019 \u2019 She was not sure whether the one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>11 could have been the man\u201d was a picture of Short or not. She identified Short as the robber at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">On January 13, 1968, Dorothy Todd, a clerk at the Allen Rexall Drug Store in Huntington Beach, saw Short standing at the record counter in the store about 7 p.m. She had talked to Short some two hours earlier when he had inquired about some shaving lotion. Short confronted her with a gun and ordered her to put all bills from the cash register into a paper bag; Mrs. Todd obeyed. Short grabbed the bag and left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The police showed Mrs. Todd pictures from \u201cmug books.\u201d She could not find Short\u2019s picture. When the police later showed Mrs. Todd a group of three pictures she recognized one of them as a picture of Short.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Short offered alibi defenses to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Short claims the pretrial photographic identification procedures were impermissibly suggestive and he should have had counsel present when the pictures were shown. It does not appear Short was in custody when the pictures were shown to Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Todd. It is difficult to imagine how he could have had an attorney represent him during this stage of investigation, while he was still at large and undoubtedly hoping to remain at large. It would be impractical if not impossible to require presence of Short\u2019s counsel when photographs are shown a witness while Short was still at large, probably unrepresented, and not charged with a crime. Under these circumstances Short did not have the right to counsel\u2019s presence at the photographic identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The record does not indicate whether any of the pictures shown Mrs. Moore were in fact of Short. Both victims had a good look at Short as he robbed them. Nothing in the record indicates the in-trial identification of Short by the victims was based on seeing the photographs. Mrs. Mikola]ek had no doubt the Danber Drug Store robber was Short. She had not been shown any photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">Nothing in the record indicates impermissible suggestiyeness in the photographic identification procedures which were followed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laursen, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 932, 944-945 [71 Cal.Rptr. 71].) Short\u2019s claim one of the three photographs shown Mrs. Todd was a female is not supported Jby the record before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AXK\">\u2022  Absent unfair .suggestiveness, the- employment of photographs as an investigative tool is approved in <em>Simmons </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377 [19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 88 S.Ct. 967].</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Moreover, Short did not object to the in-court identification of him by any witness. He may not now raise the question on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>266 Cal.App.2d 766, 770 [72 Cal.Rptr. 310].)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Coughlin, J., and Whelan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
