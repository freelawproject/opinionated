It was stipulated that as the result of the injury he suffered permanent disability of 3% percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">He testified that, while it was the first time he had played catch during one of his two morning and afternoon paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>breaks, he had done so in the past during his lunch periods; that he was never told not to play ball during the break or lunch periods. His supervisor testified that he worked out of the home office and visited the job site only once every two or three days; he was not present when the injury occurred and had no knowledge of ball playing by the employees at any time; he was not aware of any company regulation prohibiting employees from playing ball during a break.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The referee found that the injury did not arise out of or occur in the course of the applicant\u2019s employment. Reconsideration was denied by the appeals board. The conclusion of the referee and of the board was that the activity was not in the course of employment because it was not an act for personal convenience or comfort reasonably t\u00f3 be anticipated by the employer and thus not an incident of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\u2022 In <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., </em>(Cardoza) 67 Cal.2d 925 [64 Cal.Rptr. 323, 434 P.2d 619], the court upheld an award of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to an employee for injuries sustained while swimming on a hot day on company time in a canal near the work premises, the court finding that the evidence supported the conclusion that some swimming during work breaks, although not encouraged, was tolerated and would improve the efficiency of the employees. The court pointed out that under the \u2018\u2018 personal comfort\u201d doctrine, \u201d... the course of employment is not considered broken by certain acts relating to the personal comfort of the employee, as such acts are helpful to the employer in that they aid in efficient performance by the employee. On the other hand, acts which are found to be departures effecting a temporary abandonment of employment are not protected. \u201d (67 Cal.2d at p. 928.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Recapping the evidence in the instant case, it is undisputed that the injury occurred during a paid rest or \u201ccoffee break.\u201d It occurred while the applicant was engaged with other employees in a mild form of exercise on the front lawn. He testified that they had previously engaged in that form of exercise during lunch periods and had not been told they could not do so. His supervisor, although testifying that he was not aware such activity took place and was not present at the time, indicated that he visited the job site only periodically and stated that he knew of no company rule prohibiting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We conclude that the undisputed facts compel the conclusion that applicant\u2019s injury occurred while he was engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>an activity for personal convenience or comfort which was not prohibited but, rather, reasonably to be anticipated; that consequently, the injury occurred in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The order denying petitioner\u2019s claim is annulled and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Files, P. J., and Dunn, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
