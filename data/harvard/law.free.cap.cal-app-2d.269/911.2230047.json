Plaintiffs appeal, because the jury exonerated OroDam Constructors, his employer. At the time of the collision Byers had completed his daily work shift and was driving his own automobile on a direct homeward journey,  Although the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d ordinarily insulates the employer from liability for the negligent driving of an employee enroute to or from work, plaintiffs contend that the employer\u2019s payment of Byers\u2019 travel expenses excludes the going and coming rule as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Two months before the accident Oro-Dam Constructors, a contractor on the Oroville Dam Project, had employed Byers as an oiler on a truck crane. Byers lived in Marysville, about 23 miles from the job site. The governing collective bargaining agreements gave Byers, a member of the operating engineers\u2019 union, the benefits provided under the employers\u2019 contract with the piledrivers \u2019 union. Byers received an hourly wage for an eight-hour shift, which began and ended at the job site. Thus the hourly wage rate did not cover travel time. He did receive a daily transportation allowance of $6. This allowance was established by the piledrivers \u2019 collective bargaining contract, which described it as a \u201creimbursement for travel expenses.\u201d It was payable to employees who resided more than 15 miles from the place of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The going and coming rule is a special expression of the <em>respondeat superior </em>principle, which limits an employer\u2019s liability for his employee\u2019s torts to those committed in the course of the latter\u2019s employment. As a feature of California automobile liability law, the limitation first appeared as a logical application of the <em>respondeat superior </em>doctrine. <em>(Mauchle </em>v. <em>Panama-Pacific Intl. Exposition Co. </em>(1918) 37 Cal.App. 715, 717-719 [174 P. 400]; <em>Nussbaum </em>v. <em>Traung Label etc. Co. </em>(1920) 46 Cal.App. 561, 571-572 [189 P. 728].) Later, it crystallized as a decisional rule under the sobriquet \u201cgoing and coming.\u201d <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>George </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 238, 244 [105 P.2d 914]; <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>McKales </em>(1956) 139 Cal.App.2d 777, 788-789 [294 P.2d 733]; <em>Vivion </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co. </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 597, 605 [19 Cal.Rptr. 602]<em>; Harvey </em>v. <em>D &amp; L Constr. Co. </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App. 2d 48, 51 [59 Cal.Rptr. 255]; see 6 Blashfield, Automobile Law and Practice (3d ed. 1966) pp. 166-171; Annots. 52 A.L.R.2d 287-346, 52 A.L.R.2d 350-402.) Generally, the rule declares that an employee is not within the scope of his employment while he is going to or returning from his place of work. The rule is sometimes ascribed to the theory that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>employment relationship is \u201csuspended\u201d from the time he leaves his job to go home until he returns to it. (See, e.g., <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>D &amp; L Constr. Co., supra.) </em>Sometimes it is ascribed to the notion that he is not at that time rendering a service to his employer. (See, e.g., <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>George, supra; </em>Rest. 2d Agency, \u00a7 229, com. d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The rule has had a parallel development in a separate but related field of the law, workmen\u2019s compensation. The problem in the workmen\u2019s compensation cases is whether an injury to the employee arose 11 out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a73600.) The limitation which denies compensation when the employee is injured enroute between home and work originated in British workmen\u2019s compensation decisions and was imported into California by <em>Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1916) 173 Cal. 313, 322 [159 P. 1041, L.R.A. 1917B 336], Since then, the going and coming rule \u201chas become a part of the jurisprudence of workmen\u2019s compensation by judicial decision.\u201d <em>(Zenith Nat. Ins. Go. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 944, 946 [59 Cal.Rptr. 622, 428 P.2d 606].) \u201c \u2018It is the general rule that injuries sustained by an employee going to or returning from work are not compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The rule is premised on the theory that ordinarily the employment relationship is suspended from the time the employee leaves his work to go home until he resumes his work.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kobe </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 33, 35 [215 P.2d 736], quoted in <em>Zenith Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>at pp. 946-947.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">California workmen\u2019s compensation decisions recognize a number of exceptions to the going and coming rule. Where the employer requires the employee to drive his own ear to work, the latter\u2019s injury is employment-connected and compensable. The rationale is that his trip indirectly benefits the employer, hence is incompatible with a suspension of the employment relationship. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 814, 819-820 [73 Cal.Rptr. 253, 447 P.2d 365]; see also <em>Whaley </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 754 [73 Cal.Rptr. 348].) Similarly, the going and coming rule will not bar workmen\u2019s compensation coverage where the employer defrays the employee\u2019s travel expenses. <em>(Zenith Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at pp. 947-949; <em>Kobe </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>35 Cal.2d at p. 35; 2 Hanna, California Law of Employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation (2d ed.) pp. 9-38\u20149-39; 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, pp. 270-277.) The travel expense exception applies whether the employer pays travel expenses pursuant to contract or in lieu of a promise to furnish transportation. <em>(Zenith Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at p. 949, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Plaintiffs rely heavily on the workmen\u2019s compensation \u201ctravel expense\u201d cases. Indeed, a number of California decisions cite the tort liability and workmen\u2019s compensation cases interchangeably, as though the prolongations and indentations of the going and coming rule must precisely duplicate themselves in both fields of the law. (See, e.g., <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1941) 19 Cal.2d 236, 239-244 [120 P.2d 650]; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>George, supra, </em>16 Cal.2d at pp. 244-245; <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>McKales, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.2d at p. 789.) Plaintiffs also rely on <em>Breland </em>v. <em>Traylor Engineering etc. Co. </em>(1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 415, 423-425 [126 P.2d 455], <em>Breland, </em>indeed, is a direct precedent, since it is a tort case which excludes application of the coming and going rule where the employee-driver receives a transportation allowance from the employer. Because <em>Breland </em>rests on workmen\u2019s compensation decisions to the exclusion of tort principles and precedents, we do not care to be bound by it. Although a healthy symbiosis is possible, precedents developed in one field should not be injected into another without recognition of the separate principles prevailing in each.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Court-made workmen\u2019s compensation doctrines develop from a social philosophy distinct from that underlying tort rules. Tort liability rests upon fault, compensability for employee injuries upon work-connection regardless of fault. Work-connection as the basis of compensability serves to transfer the cost of injury to the ultimate buyers of the commodity or service in the production of which the injury has occurred. (1 Larson, <em>op. cit., </em>pp. 6-7.) In reviewing workmen\u2019s compensation awards, the courts heed statutory admonitions for a liberal construction favoring coverage of the injury. (Lab. Code, \u00a73202; <em>Lundberg </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., </em>69 Cal.2d 436, 439 [71 Cal.Rptr. 684, 445 P.2d 300].) Although not always reiterated, the promptings of liberalized coverage frequently serve as the inarticulate impulse for judicial limitations upon the going and coming rule in workmen\u2019s compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The expansions and contractions of vicarious liability for torts result from other considerations. Although in a sense <em>respondeat superior </em>imposes strict liability upon the employer, its foundation is the imputation of the employee\u2019s fault to the employer because of the special relationship between them. (2 Harper and James, Torts (1956) pp. 1361-1363; Prosser, Torts (3d ed. 1964) p. 470.) Activity \u201cwithin the scope of employment\u201d is the pivot of the employer\u2019s responsibility, but the pivoting action responds to two primary inquiries: (1) the activity\u2019s benefit to the employer\u2019s enterprise and (2) his right to control it. <em>(Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1909) 212 U.S. 215, 220-221 [53 L.Ed. 480, 483-484, 29 S.Ct. 252]; <em>Robinson </em>v. George, <em>supra, 16 </em>Cal.2d at p. 244; <em>Gossett </em>v. <em>Simonson </em>(1966) 243 Ore. 16 [411 P.2d 277, 279-282]; Rest. 2d Agency, \u00a7\u00a7219, 228; 2 Harper and James, <em>op. cit. </em>1366-1370; Prosser, <em>op. cit. </em>pp. 471-473; Laski, <em>The Basis of Vicarious Liability </em>(1916) 26 Yale L.J. 105, 123-124; Person, <em>Bases for Master\u2019s Liability and for Principal\u2019s Liability to Third Person </em>(1951) 4 Vand. L.Rev. 260, 269-270, 287.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>The test of benefit to the employer\u2019s enterprise is expressed in California case law by the requirement that the employee be 1 \u2018 engaged in the duties which he was employed to perform\u201d [or] \u201cthose acts which incidentally or indirectly contribute to the [employer\u2019s] service.\u201d <em>(Kish </em>v. <em>California State Auto. Assn. </em>(1922) 190 Cal. 246, 249 [212 P. 27]; <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>McKales, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.2d at p. 789; see also Rest. 2d Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 228, 229.) Conversely, the employer is not liable when the employee is pursuing \u201chis own ends.\u201d <em>(Kish </em>v. <em>California State Auto. Assn., supra, </em>190 Cal. at p. 248; Rest. 2d Agency, \u00a7 235.) Although the going and coming rule rests upon recognition that travel between home and work is primarily for the employee\u2019s benefit and only tangentially for the employer\u2019s, variant arrangements may evoke a \u201cdual or combined purpose\u201d rule. <em>(Gipson </em>v. <em>Davis Realty Co. </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 190, 211 [30 Cal.Rptr. 253]; Rest. 2d Agency, \u00a7236; note, 16 Okla. L.Rev. 181 (1963).) The employee may combine his trip with a \u201cspecial errand\u201d for the employer. <em>(Harvey </em>v. <em>D &amp; L Constr. Co., supra, </em>251 Cal.App.2d at p. 52; <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>McKales, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.2d at p. 789.) The employer may furnish an automobile for his employee\u2019s use, prompting the inquiry whether the driving takes place primarily to assist the employer\u2019s interests or mainly for the benefit of the employee. (Rest. 2d Agency, \u00a7 229, com. d; 6 Blashfield, <em>op. cit., </em>pp. 168-170.) An employee who does not work at a fixed location but travels from place to place on his employer\u2019s business, may drive his own car at the employer\u2019s direction, with or without an expense allowance, <em>e.g., Smith </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 814; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>George, supra, </em>16 Cal.2d 238; <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>19 Ca.l.2d 236; see also cases cited 52 A.L.R.2d at pp. 298-300, 309-311.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">At this point several characteristics of the going and coming rule emerge. First, it is usually invoked when the employee performs services \u201cat or in a particular plant or upon particular premises. ...\u201d <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>George, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>16 Cal.2d at p. 245.) Second, it has particular application to vehicle accidents of employees whose jobs do not embrace driving.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The present employee, Byers, worked at a fixed location and was not employed to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The going and coming rule recognizes that travel between home and work is primarily for the employee\u2019s benefit. Benefit is a tangible fact. When a trip for the employee\u2019s benefit concurrently produces some additional benefit to the employer, an abstract employment relationship may result. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 820.) The obverse is not true, that is, hypothesizing an abstract relationship will not produce a benefit where none exists in fact. Payment of a transportation allowance, without more, is equally ineffectual to produce a benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">A transportation allowance may promote the recruitment of applicants living at a distance from the job; or, as is more likely in a collective bargaining situation, it may be demanded as a matter of fairness to workers who incur extra expenses in travel between home and work. Whatever the motivation, the essential purpose of the automobile trip does not change. If, as the going and coming rule denotes, the trip between home and the fixed place of work is primarily for the employee\u2019s benefit, the fixed reimbursement allowance does not alter that fact. Byers, living outside the 15-mile zone, was eligible for the allowance, while a fellow employee living within the zone, was not. Byers\u2019 trip was as much for his own benefit and as little for his employer\u2019s as that of his ineligible fellow employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">It is said that the right of control \u201cgoes to the very heart of the ascription of tortious responsibility.\u201d <em>(Connor </em>v. <em>Great Western Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., supra, </em>separate opinion of Mosk, J., 69 Cal.2d at p. 874.) Physical control over the actual driving is irrelevant. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 821.) The question is one of a right to control the trip. The only condition attached to the $6 daily allowance was residence beyond the 15-mile zone. Neither the collective bargaining contract nor the employer\u2019s traditional dominion over work practices<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> gave Oro-Dam Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>stmctors power to dictate the manner of travel, the kind of vehicle, its route or speed or even that the trip be taken at all. The employee might choose to travel by public carrier, in the car of a fellow worker or remain overnight in a lodging near the work site. The circumstances correspond to those described in Restatement Second of Agency, section 239: \u201cA master is not liable for injuries caused by the negligence of a servant in the use of an instrumentality which if [sic] of a substantially different kind from that authorized as a means of performing the master\u2019s service, or over the use of which it is understood that the master is to have no right of control. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Measured by the two basic tests governing <em>respondeat superior </em>determinations, Byers\u2019 trip was outside the scope of his employment or, what is the same thing, within the going and coming rule. In some eases the question of an employer\u2019s liability under <em>respondeat superior </em>is a jury question, in others a question of law for the court. <em>(Loper </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>23 Cal.2d 600, 605-607 [145 P.2d 1]; see Weiner, <em>The Civil Jury Trial and the Law-Fact Distinction </em>(1966) 54 Cal.L.Rev. 1867, 1872-1873.) Here the facts were undisputed. The trip was for the employee\u2019s purpose alone. There was no occasion for the jury to weigh or balance the effect of a combined purppse trip or of a trip shaped by the transitory intention or state of mind of one or another of the parties. (Cf. <em>Loper </em>v. <em>Morrison, supra.) </em>In view of the undisputed facts governing the agency question, the trial court would have been justified in directing a verdict for the employer. Applied to the undisputed facts, the going and coming rule insulated the employer from liability as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">This case was tried in March 1967, a few months before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Zenith Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra. </em>The trial court gave jury instructions dealing with the responsibility of Oro-Dam Constructors, the employer. In the light of Supreme Court statements in the <em>Zenith </em>opinion, these instructions were probably erroneous. Since the employer was not liable as a matter of law, the probable error caused no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Pierce, P. J., and Regan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 19, 1969, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 17, 1969.
