J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8E\">On December 22, 1964, an accusation was filed before the respondent Board charging petitioner with violations of sections 651, 651.3, 3125 and 3129 of the Business and Professions Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After extensive hearings before a hearing officer a proposed decision was filed with the Board on October 20, 1965. The Board decided not to adopt it. Argument was had before the full Board on March 17, 1966. By that time a transcript of the proceedings before the hearing officer had been prepared and had been read by all of the board members.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>On April 16, 1966, the Board rendered its decision, finding that petitioner had violated the designated code sections and imposed discipline, the severity of which is not in issue Reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">On May 17, 1966, petitioner filed in the superior court a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the Board to set aside its decision. (Gov. Code, \u00a711523.) An alternative writ-issued, the Board answered the petition and on January 25, 1967, the superior court filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law to the effect that a judgment should be entered discharging the alternative writ and denying a peremptory writ. Judgment followed and petitioner appealed. This court granted a stay of the administrative decision, pending the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The superior court exercised its independent judgment on the evidence and found that the Board\u2019s findings were supported by the weight of the evidence. <em>(Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>32 Cal.2d 301, 308-309 [196 P.2d 20].) The court also found that the decision of the Board was supported by the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Since the correctness of the findings\u2014as distinguished from the legal conclusions drawn therefrom\u2014is not attacked, we summarize them briefly: in February 1963, petitioner presented a plan <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor A.F.L.-C.I.O. (\u201cFederation\u201d), an organization of union locals in Los Angeles County. He offered to start and maintain an optical service for union members and their families. The plan contemplated the adoption of a specific price schedule for eye examinations, glasses and contact lenses. Under that schedule glasses would cost $21 per pair less than the average cost in Los Angeles County. Between February and April 1963, petitioner acquired a building from which the proposed service to union members was to be rendered. On the front of the building there was a sign reading; \u201cUnion Vision Service\u201d (\u201cU.V.S.\u201d) about 20 feet long with letters 1% feet high.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The Federation approved petitioner\u2019s plan on April 18, 1963, and permitted him to advise local unions of the approval. Petitioner then prepared<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and distributed to union members brochures outlining the features of his services for distribution to the members of union locals. These brochures included the fees, costs and prices of eye examinations, glasses and contact lenses. In some cases no charge was to be made for examinations. The printed material also had language such as \u201cSave up to 50% on your glasses\u201d and other similar language to the effect that savings up to 50 percent were being offered. These brochures were printed in whole or in part on the facsimile of the letterheads of four specific locals. Some of the brochures also contain statements to the effect that eye examinations were \u201cprepaid by union.\u201d In truth the examinations were free.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Together with the literature concerning available services and prices, the union members received a numbered, wallet-sized card bearing the name \u201cUnion Vision Service\u201d and respondent\u2019s facsimile signature in which he identified himself as \u2018\u2018 Professional Director. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">On November 15 and 22, 1963, one Keith W. Hooper engaged petitioner\u2019s services. Through an employee and personally, petitioner informed Hooper that the price of glasses he was purchasing was about 50 percent of what they would cost elsewhere.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The court made no detailed evidentiary findings concerning the initial dealings between petitioner and the Federation or with respect to the negotiations between petitioner and the various locals. The record shows that the initial contact between petitioner and the Federation was made on petitioner\u2019s initiative. After the Federation approved his plan petitioner asked for a list of locals with which he could get in touch. He was refused and it was suggested that he place an advertisement in a labor newspaper. This was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Petitioner then got in touch with at least four different union locals which also approved his plan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> His brochures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>were then mailed to the members of the locals on the locals\u2019 letterheads. However the entire cost of the mailing was borne by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Additional facts will be referred to in connection with the discussion of petitioner\u2019s contentions,</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Petitioner claims that the superior court committed error when it refused to allow him to present evidence\u2014and to take depositions for that purpose\u2014to show that all members of the Board, except the public member (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a73010), were biased and prejudiced against him. The charges of bias and prejudice derive from the following, which petitioner offered to prove in the superior court: the five professional members of the Board were all members of the California Optometric Association (\u201cAssociation\u201d) and of California Vision Service (\u201cC.V.S.\u201d) which was operated, serviced and sponsored by the Association. C.V.S. negotiates contracts with various unions for optometric services at certain fees and was therefore directly competitive with petitioner\u2019s U.V.S. The charges made by U.V.S. are lower than those of C.V.S. and the Board members had made statements in the past that U.V.S., a \u201cprice cutting operation,\u201d was detrimental and should be eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The trial court did not permit petitioner to prove his allegations because the petition for the writ of mandate did not charge bias and prejudice and because they were made too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">The trial court was correct. Section 1094.5, subdivision (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure permits the trial court to admit relevant evidence not adduced before the administrative agency only where such evidence could not have been produced there in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Petitioner has made no showing of any kind why the evidence could not have been made part of the record at the administrative level. It may be that neither the hearing officer nor the Board would have allowed it, for section 11512, subdivision (c) of the Government Code provides as follows: \u201c. . .No agency member shall withdraw voluntarily or be subject to disqualification if his disqualification would prevent the existence of a quorum qualified to act in the particular case. \u2019\u2019 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This does not excuse petitioner\u2019s failure to even offer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Further, of course, there is no showing how any alleged bias or prejudice of the Board members affects petitioner\u2019s present status as an appellant from a judgment of the superior court denying the issuance of a writ of mandate. The Board did not prevent him from offering any evidence which might be relevant to the judgment of that court, which was based on an independent review of the record. <em>(Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>32 Cal.2d 301, 308-309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Petitioner claims that these proceedings deny him the equal protection of the law because of the Board\u2019s failure to institute proceedings against the professional members of C.V.S. which, he claims, is also subject to discipline if it is ultimately decided that he is. <em>(Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356, 373-374 [30 L.Ed. 220, 227-228, 6 S.Ct. 1064]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>254 Cal.App.2d 256 [63 Cal.Rptr. 211].) The record before us shows that C.V.S. is a nonprofit corporation organized under the provisions of section 9201 of the Corporations Code. That section permits the formation of nonprofit corporations for the purpose of defraying or assuming the cost of professional services of licentiates of the healing arts (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, div. 2), or of rendering such service, under strict conditions prescribed by the Legislature. Petitioner can make no such claim. It may be, as petitioner suggests, the C.V.S. and he are both guilty of the violations he has been found to have committed, or it may be that neither is. The point is that there is a sufficient difference between C.V.S. \u2019s way of doing business and petitioner\u2019s to suggest a rational distinction. <em>(McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420 [6 L.Ed.2d 393, 81 S.Ct. 1101]; <em>West Coast Hotel Co. </em>v. <em>Parrish, </em>300 U.S. 379 [81 L.Ed. 703, 57 S.Ct. 578, 108 A.L.R. 1330]; <em>California Physicians\u2019 Service </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>28 Cal.2d 790, 802-803 [172 P.2d 4, 167 A.L.R. 306].)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">It is claimed that the evidence does not support the court's finding that petitioner violated section 651. Section 651 reads as follows: \u201c It is unlawful for any person licensed under this division or under any initiative act referred to in this division to offer for sale or to sell any commodity or to offer to render or to render any service under the representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>tion that the price or fee which is to be, or is, charged for such commodity or service, or both, is at a discount, or under the representation that the price or fee which is to be, or is, charged for such commodity or service, or both, is at a percentage or otherwise less than the average fee or price then / regularly charged under like conditions by the person so licensed or by other persons for such commodity or service or commodity and service. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to modify or establish prices or fees or to modify or affect in any manner any other provision of this division. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Citing no cases, but presumably relying on <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Button, </em>371 U.S. 415 [9 L.Ed.2d 405, 83 S.Ct. 328]; <em>Railroad Trainmen </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>Bar, 377 U.S. 1 [12 L.Ed.2d 89, 84 S.Ct 1113, 11 A.L.R.3d 1196]; and <em>Mine Workers </em>v. <em>Illinois Bar Assn., </em>389 U.S. 217 [19 L.Ed.2d 426, 88 S.Ct. 353], petitioner asserts that it is an undue restriction on his right of free speech to discipline him for aiding unions in composing \u201ctheir\u201d material or contributing to the cost of printing and transmitting the material to the members of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Petitioner\u2019s characterization of his role in drafting and financing of the brochures as merely \u201caiding and contributing\u201d is unduly modest, but more fundamentally there is nothing in any of those esses which would prevent a state from disciplining members of the Bar for participating in the dissemination of information practice by the NAAGP, the Trainmen and the Mine Workers. In <em>Railroad Trainmen </em>v. <em>Virginia Bar, supra, </em>the Supreme Court says: \u201c. . . Here what Virginia has sought to halt is not a commercialization of the legal profession which might threaten the moral and ethical fabric of the administration of justice. It is not \u2018ambulance chasing. \u2019 The railroad workers, by recommending competent lawyers to each other, obviously are not themselves engaging in the practice of law, <em>nor are they or the lawyers whom they select parties to any soliciting of business. </em>...\u201d (377 U.S. at pp. 6-7 [12 L.Ed.2d at pp. 93-94], Italics added.) The point has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Petitioner also argues that because his operation \u2018\u2018was like no other\u201d he could not be found to have made his offers at prices lower than those \u201cregularly charged under like conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">In <em>Cozad </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 249 [314 P.2d 500], a chiropractor was charged with violations of section 651. He too argued that he and his associates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>rendered services under \u201ccertain special conditions.\u2019\u2019 The argument was rejected, the court pointing out that the licensee in question had testified that the examination which he had advertised for $1.00 was the same as the examination for which he claimed that the other charged $5.00. The same is true here. To determine whether the conditions are similar, we do not look at the methods by which a licensee generates a practice, but at the situation from the point of view of the patient. It would be a perversion of the intent of section 651 to permit advertising under the banner of \u201cequal treatment for less money\u201d simply because the advertiser can show that in some fashion, quite immaterial to the patient, the conditions which permit him to render less expensive service are unlike those of his fellow practitioners with whom he compares himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><em>Cozens </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, supra, </em>also disposes of petitioner\u2019s further point that section 651 is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Petitioner claims that the finding of a violation of section 651.3 is not supported by evidence and that, in any event, he comes within the terms of the proviso which makes the section inapplicable to \u201cthe furnishing of information regarding benefits available, and charges therefor, under the coverage of any hospital or medical service or insurance plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The relevant part of section 651.3 reads as follows: \u201cNo person licensed as a physician and surgeon, optometrist, or registered dispensing optician shall advertise or cause or permit to be advertised, any representations in any form which in any manner whether directly or indirectly refers to the cost, price, charge or fee to be paid to such licensed person for any commodity or commodities sold by such licensed person or any service or services performed by such licensed person when those commodities or services are furnished in connection with the professional practice or business for which he is licensed; provided, however, that the provisions of this section do not apply to the furnishing of information regarding benefits available, and charges therefor, under the coverage of any hospital or medical service or insurance plan. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The argument that petitioner has not violated section 651.3, even without benefit of the proviso, is based on petitioner\u2019s contention that his brochures did not address themselves to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>\u201cthe public. \u2019 \u2019 This contention is advanced although there is no language in section 651.3 which would limit its application to instances where the advertising is directed to the \u201cpublic.\u201d Petitioner argues that the definition of \u201cadvertising\u201d found in section 3000<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> somehow limits the prohibitions of section 651.3, at least as applied to optometrists. Section 3000 is found in chapter 7 of division 2, which chapter contains certain specific provisions concerning optometrists. By its terms the definition is applicable only to chapter 7. Section 651.3 is found in chapter 1, the general provisions applicable to all the healing arts.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We do not have to decide whether the attempted transplant is successful, for as we shall see the point that petitioner did not address himself to the \u201cpublic\u201d has no merit, even when considered in connection with his argument to the effect that he has not violated section 3129, a section applicable to optometrists only and, admittedly, governed by section 3000.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">We now reach what is really the heart of this appeal, the question whether or not by informing union members of the lower prices available at U.V.S., petitioner was merely furnishing information concerning benefits and charges under the coverage of a \u201cmedical service plan.\u201d Petitioner, of course, claims that he was and we have no reason to doubt his <em>good </em>faith. Nor do we question his assertion and that of several of his witnesses that he provided a much needed low cost optometric service to union members and their families, patients who hut for his service might never have received necessary eye examinations or glasses. The question is simply whether the Legislature intended that an operation like petitioner\u2019s should fall under the proviso to section 651.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Neither the section as a whole nor the proviso has ever been construed. No statutory or judicial definition of the specific term \u201cmedical service plan\u201d has been brought to our attention or found by us.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>We \"believe it is reasonable to conclude that when, in 1961, the year section 651.3 was enacted, the Legislature spoke of a \u201cmedical service plan\u201d it had in mind such plans, providing for specific benefits and charges, as had then been recognized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Assuming for the moment that the term \u201cmedical service plan\u201d is roughly synonymous with \u201chealth plan,\u201d we find that before the passage of section 651.3 the Supreme Court had dealt with health plans on at least three occasions, without however having had to define the concept. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pacific Health Corp., Inc., </em>12 Cal.2d 156 [82 P.2d 429, 119 A.L.R. 1284], a stock corporation, operated for profit, was found to be illegally engaged in the practice of medicine. It had issued contracts undertaking to pay for medical service to be rendered by physicians designated by the defendant. The doctors were paid from funds collected from the contract holders which were paid into defendant\u2019s general fund. Although the opinion does not expressly say so, it is quite clear that the monies collected from the contract holders were not only prepaid, but paid regardless of whether the need for medical services ever arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In <em>California Physicians\u2019 Service </em>v. <em>Garrison, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d 790, the court held that the medical plan of the plaintiff, organized under section 9201 of the Corporations Code\u2014 then section 593a of the Civil Code\u2014was immune from supervision by the Insurance Commissioner. This time the opinion emphasized that payments to the plan were made \u201con a periodic budgeting basis.\u201d (28 Cal.2d at p. 794.) Finally, in <em>Complete Service Bureau </em>v. <em>San Diego County Medical Soc., </em>43 Cal.2d 201 [272 P.2d 497], the plan of a nonprofit corporation organized under section 9200 of the Corporations Code withstood assorted attacks by the San Diego County Medical Society and individual physicians. Again the plan featured periodic prepayments on the part of its members for which they received certain designated benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>American Independent Medical &amp; Health Assn., </em>119 Cal.App.2d 319 [259 P.2d 503], the insurance commissioner was permitted to take charge of an insolvent nonprofit corporation which operated a health plan which featured the payment of \u201cmembership dues\u201d in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>It is seen, then, that at the time of the enactment of section 651.3 periodic prepayment was a common feature of all health plans which had come before the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Legislation enacted since the passage of section 651.3 demonstrates that when the Legislature thinks about health plans, it thinks of periodic prepayment. Thus, for example, in the Meyers-Geddes State Employees\u2019 Medical and Hospital Care Act (Gov. Code, \u00a722751 et seq) a \u201ccarrier\u201d is an entity which provides certain services \u2018 \u2018 in consideration of premiums or other periodic charges payable to it.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 22754, subd. (c).) A \u201chealth benefits plan\u201d is a plan provided by a \u201ccarrier.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 22754, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In 1965 the Legislature enacted the so-called Knox-Mills Plan Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12530 et seq), which subjects what it calls \u201chealth care service plans\u201d to supervision by the Attorney General. A health care service plan is defined in subdivision (a) of section 12530 of the Government Code. Again the definition features \u201cprepaid or periodic charges. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">We do not hold that section 651.3 cannot refer to a \u201cmedical service plan\u201d which does not come within- the definition of the Meyers-Geddes or Knox-Mills Acts, but we do think it significant that the prepayment feature is a common thread not only in the decisional but also in the statutory law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">So far we have used the terms \u201cmedical service plan\u201d (\u00a7651.3), \u201chealth benefits plan\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 22754) and \u201chealth care service plan\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12530) interchangeably. Closer inspection of the decisional law, particularly <em>California Physicians\u2019 Service </em>v. <em>Garrison, supra, </em>and <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Roddis </em>v. <em>California Mut. Assn., </em>68 Cal.2d 677 [68 Cal.Rptr. 585, 441 P.2d 97], discloses that the term \u201cservice\u201d is, in this field, a term of art. A \u201cservice\u201d plan is distinguished from an <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>insurance \u2019 \u2019 plan in that the latter features <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>indemnity paid to the \u201cinsured.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It reimburses him for all or part of an obligation which he has incurred. The principal feature of a \u201cservice\u201d plan, on the other hand, is that as far as the benefits provided by it are concerned, the physician has agreed to look exclusivly to the plan for payment. The member owes nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">That the Legislature had the technical meaning of the word \u2018\u2018 service \u2019 \u2019 in mind is strongly suggested by the fact that it is juxtaposed to the word \u201cinsurance.\u201d By no stretch of the imagination did petitioner advertise a \u201cservice plan\u201d within the accepted technical meaning. However low his charges might have been, it was the patient who had to pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Further, the word \u2018\u2018coverage \u2019 \u2019 has an accepted meaning in the insurance business. If the Legislature had meant to include operations such as petitioner\u2019s in the proviso to section 651.3 the word \u201ccoverage\u201d is singularly inappropriate. One does not talk of the \u201ccoverage\u201d of a price list.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Finally, when section 651.3 talks of \u201cplan,\u201d whose plan does it mean ? Every medical professional, whether he intends to run an office for the upper crust or for low income groups, has a \u201cplan\u201d on how to build a practice. This does not make it the plan of the patient until he is in need of the services offered. True, the brochure mailed by petitioner to his prospective patients contained the numbered wallet-sized card mentioned early in this opinion. At least some of the brochures informed the addressee that in order to be eligible for petitioner\u2019s \u201cbasic fee schedule\u201d it would be necessary to telephone his office and \u201cregister\u201d the number within 10 days of receipt of the brochure. If the recipient did not do so, according to one of the brochures, the eye examination would not be free. This obvious \u201ccome on\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which entailed no obligation whatever on the part of the recipient, hardly made him a member of the plan. Reduced to its simple facts petitioner\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d amounted to this: by selling his service to certain union representatives and obtaining their endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>ment, he was given access, by mail, to thousands of prospective patients whom he circularized at his own expense. He was not bound contractually to the union or to the patient to provide services at the schedules indicated in his literature.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By this method he obtained access to a total of 515,000 union members of which, at the time of the administrative hearing 71,000 had become patients! It may well be that many of these would never have found their way to an optometrist except for petitioner\u2019s advertising. It may also be true that petitioner\u2019s way of practicing optometry is the better way from the point of view of the general public. That judgment is, of course, for the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">One final red herring on this subject: after three of the four union locals prominently involved in the evidence in this proceeding had been solicited and circularized, petitioner caused a nonprofit corporation to be formed. There is no evidence that it complied with the stringent provisions of section 9201 of the Corporations Code and we therefore must assume that it was formed under the provisions of section 9200 of that code. In some unexplained fashion petitioner seeks to use the existence of this corporation as a shelter. According to petitioner the corporation, Union Health and Welfare of California, was \u201cset up in order not to control but to distribute profits of Union Vision Service which is sponsored and controlled by the Union Health and Welfare Services.\u201d The corporation was designed to render other medical and dental services to union members. It was the \u201cmother\u201d of these other services. It had a board of directors and an address different from that of U.V.S. That is about all we know about the corporation. This vague evidence should be contrasted with petitioner\u2019s own testimony when questioned about the brochures: \u201c. . . Now, this statement appears in all of your brochures with that in mind. Are you still sure? A. They are not my brochures, please. They are not my brochures. Q. These are the brochures of Union Vision Service? A. They aren\u2019t mine. Q. Who owns Union Vision Service ? A. I am the owner. Q. Any other stockholders? A. No. We don\u2019t have any stock. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Petitioner claims that the finding of a violation of section 3129 is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Section 3129 reads as follows: \u201c It is unlawful to advertise at a stipulated price, or any variation of such a price, or as being free, any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u2018\u2018 The examination or treatment of the eyes; the furnishing of optometrieal services; or the furnishing of a lens, lenses, glasses, or the frames or fittings thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u2018\u2018 The provisions of this section do not apply to the advertising of goggles, sun glasses, colored glasses or occupational eye-protective devices, provided the same are so made as not to have refractive values. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">It is first claimed that the proviso to section 651.3 must he held to apply to section 3129. We do not have to come to grips with that contention, since the proviso does not help petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Further, by reference to the definition of \u201cadvertising\u201d in section 3000, it is claimed that petitioner did not advertise because he did not address himself to the \u201cpublic.\u201d The argument is that although he admittedly sent his brochures to many thousands of union members, he did communicate only to union members and not to the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">In <em>Mary Pickford Co. </em>v. <em>Bayly Bros. Inc., </em>12 Cal.2d 501, [86 P.2d 102], the question was whether certain securities had been offered to the \u201cpublic.\u201d The securities in question had been offered to a small number of persons selected at random, The court held: \u2018\u2018This method certainly constituted an offering to the \u2018public\u2019. Corpus Juris states that the word does not have a fixed or definite meaning; in one sense \u2018the word does not mean all the people, nor most of the people, nor very many of the people of a place, but so many of them as contra-distinguishes them from a few\u2019. (50 C.J. 844, 845.) Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, second edition, gives among other definitions of the word, \u2018a particular body or section of the people; often specifically, a clientele\u2019. While the group solicited by defendants in this case was a comparatively small one, it nevertheless constituted the \u2018public\u2019 so far as the purposes of the Corporate Securities Act are concerned. Sales were made in pursuance of a general plan to dispose of a substantial portion of the beneficial interest in the trust for the purpose of raising capital to carry out the venture. This, in the absence of a permit, constituted a violation of the Corporate Securities Act <em>(People </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>219 Cal. 522 [27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>P.2d 906] <em>supra; Black </em>v. <em>Solano County, </em>114 Cal.App. 170 [299 P. 843]).\u201d (12 Cal.2d at p. 514.)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In <em>Askew </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>151 Cal.App.2d 759 [312 P.2d 342], the question was whether a swimming pool maintained by the defendant was a public pool within the meaning of section 24100 of the Health and Safety Code. The pool in question was owned by a religious foundation. Invitations to use the pool had been mailed to all post office box and R.F.D. box holders at Valley Center\u2014about 300 to 400 persons\u2014and' to all teen-age children in that community. About 100 children registered to use the pool and it was regularly used by about 40 to 60 of them. The court held that the pool was public, having in mind the purpose of the public health statute of which section 24100 was a part. \u201c. . .In such a situation the word \u2018 public \u2019 must be given as broad a definition as is necessary to provide the protection to the public which the Legislature sought to provide. (3 Sutherland on Statutory Construction, 3d ed., \u00a7 7202, p. 397.) A pool may be public although all persons do not have a right to be admitted, and a pool may be public even though certain persons can be legally excluded from it. Whether a charge is made for admission is not necessarily a determining factor. The public health is not particularly affected by the transfer of money from patron to operator, but it is affected by the physical contact of many persons with a particular swimming pool unless precautions are taken. <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Hollywood Canteen, </em>27 Cal.2d 802 [167 P.2d 729].)\u201d (151 Cal.App.2d at pp. 762-763; see also <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Hesperia Golf &amp; Country Club, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 241 249-251 [63 Cal.Rptr. 189], [Swimming pool maintained by country club].)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that his brochures were not designed to bring his charges\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014 \u2018\u2018to the attention of the public\u201d is based on the fact that he had addressed himself only to union members and their families. It is perfectly plain, however, that if a practitioner is permitted to subdivide the general public into segments, he could never violate section 3129. He could with just as much plausibility claim that he mailed his advertisements only to persons living within a 25-mile radius from his office or only to prospective patients whose last names began with the letters \u201cA\u201d through \u201cM.\u201d We think the word \u201cpublic\u201d in section 3000 refers to any and all persons who, at the time an advertisement is addressed to them, have not yet entered into some kind of professional relationship, actual or prospective, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>licensee. Just being a member of a union which recommends the licensee to its members is obviously not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Finally petitioner claims not to have violated section 3125 which reads as follows: \u2018\u2018It is unlawful to practice optometry under a false or assumed name. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Although an immense amount of literature emanated from his office recommending Union Vision Service and in spite of the large sign maintained on the premises, it is contended that the statute was not violated because on some\u2014by no means all\u2014of the literature distributed, petitioner was identified as the \u201cProfessional Director\u201d of Union Vision Service. He says that the name Union Vision Service \u201cwas merely a designation of the medical service plan available to the union members. \u2019 \u2019 Further, it is claimed that section 3125 merely forbids the practice of optometry under a false or assumed name, not offering to practice under such a name.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is pointed out that whenever a patient came in personal contact with petitioner, signs on the premises disclosed his true name.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">We think almost all of petitioner\u2019s points are adequately answered in <em>Garvai </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>216 Cal.App.2d 374 [31 Cal.Rptr. 187], When petitioner argues, on the one hand, that Union Vision Service was merely the name of a service plan available to union members and on the other that the name was merely used to offer the service, he is obviously contradicting himself. The plan, such as it was, surely went further than the mere offer. Anyway, the evidence is ample that petitioner actually practiced under the U.V.S. label. Naturally, when coming into personal contact with a patient he would not introduce himself as Union Vision Service, but that does not alter the fact that patients who entered the building where several doctors practiced optometry would believe that they were about to be examined by a member, associate or employee of an organization called Union Vision Service and that such belief would continue through the actual treatment, even though the individual practitioners had less impersonal names.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Stephens, J., and Aiso, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 17, 1969. Peters, J., Tobriner, J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-11\">A11 code references in this opinion, unless otherwise noted, are to the Business and Professions Code. Sections 651, 651.3 and 3129 forbid certain types of advertising. Section 3125 prohibits the practice of optometry under a false or assumed name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\">Although petitioner does not make it a separate point on appeal, there is a suggestion in his brief that somehow the refusal of the Board to adopt the hearing officer's proposed decision before the preparation of a reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing violated his rights. We find nothing in the statutes (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11500-11528) which makes the privilege of an agency not to adopt a proposed decision of a hearing officer dependent on the availability of a transcript at the time of the refusal. Even if in a particular situation a person accused before an agency could be prejudiced by the agency\u2019s refusal to adopt a proposed favorable decision without having read the reporter\u2019s transcript, this case is a poor vehicle for the establishment of such prejudice, since the facts are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>really in dispute and the Board\u2019s eventual disagreement with the hearing officer was solely on questions of law which were clearly delineated by his proposed decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b739-10\">At this point we do not use the word \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>plan \u201d as a word of art. As will be seen, the principal issue on this appeal is whether or not petitioner \u2019s proposal, when put into effect, was a \u2018 \u2018 medical service plan \u2019 \u2019 within the meaning of section 651.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b739-11\">Petitioner carried on the practice of optometry from that building and from a second TJ.V.S. building which he opened later in another part of Los Angeles County.
