We have concluded that none of appellant's contentions is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the judgment is not questioned. No useful purpose would be served by detailing it here. A former trial also resulted in appellant\u2019s conviction but was reversed on appeal by reason of the retroactive application of the rule enunciated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, </em>63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265], <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>66 Cal.2d 482 [58 Cal.Rptr. 361, 426 P.2d 929].) Due to the presence of the <em>Aranda </em>error and the necessity of determining its prejudicial effect, the court in <em>Gonzales </em>deviated from the usual rule requiring an appellate court to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. (Pages 484-485.) Nevertheless, the presentation set forth in this earlier decision is sufficient for an understanding of the factual background and basic events involved in the instant homicide. Therefore, we shall restrict our recital of the evidence to that which is necessary to a proper understanding of appellant\u2019s present contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Appellant fatally stabbed Jesus Ontiveros some time around 10:30 p.m. on the night of July 30, 1965. Within moments thereafter Officer Haner of the Oxnard Police Department received a radio call directing him to the scene. He and his partner arrived only two or three minutes later and summoned an ambulance within approximately the same time period following their arrival. The ambulance arrived within approximately four or five minutes. Officer Haner testified that he spoke to the victim who appeared to be in pain and had difficulty speaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Robert Brown, an ambulance driver with 10 years\u2019 experience, testified that when he arrived on the scene, he was immediately directed to the victim who was lying on the ground with no one around him. He knelt beside him and said, \" Relax now, take it easy. I am the ambulance driver and I am here to help you so just take it easy now and we will do what we can and we will get you out of here.\u201d As he began to examine Ontiveros, who appeared to be in pain but not in shock, the latter exclaimed, \u201cOh, my God, oh, my God, help me. I don\u2019t do \u2018notting,\u2019 I don\u2019t see dem\u2019. \u2018Day\u2019 chase me. Oh, my God, help me, help me. I run. \u2018Day\u2019 try take my money.\u201d He \u201cwas repetitious. He said this over and over and over again.\u201d At no time was Ontiveros ever asked a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">In contending that evidence of the statements of Ontiveros was improperly received as evidence of spontaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>statements, admissible under section 1240 of the Evidence Code, appellant does not argue that the statements were the product of interrogation or solicitation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is necessarily conceded that these utterances were entirely voluntary and not the result of any influence exerted by Robert Brown. Rather, appellant urges that by reason of the lapse of time and the presence of the police prior to Brown\u2019s arrival, \u201cit seems reasonable to assume that the declarant who was involved in this bloody fight and was an active participant had ample opportunity to overcome the excitement of the fight and was afforded the opportunity of fabricating a story, or at least there was a great likelihood the declarant could and would fabricate a story to protect his own personal interests. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Quite apart from the fact that it is the province of the trial judge, and not that of an appellate court, to resolve the issue here presented, we would be unable to accept appellant\u2019s contention. Evidence Code section 1240 provides: \u201cEvidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement: (a) Purports to narrate, describe, or explain an act, condition, or event perceived by the declarant; and (b) Was made spontaneously while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by such perception.\u201d As indicated by the Law Revision Commission comment thereto: \" Section 1240 is a codification of the existing exception to the hearsay rule for statements made spontaneously under the stress of excitement engendered by the event to which they relate. <em>Showalter </em>v. <em>Western Pacific R.R. Co., </em>16 Cal.2d 460 [106 P.2d 895] (1940).\u201d In <em>Showalter </em>the court stated: \" The rule which we deem to be correct was enunciated in the early ease of <em>People </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>35 Cal. 49 [95 Am.Dec. 49] \u2014 namely, that declarations which are voluntary and spontaneous and made so near the time of the principie act as to preclude the idea of deliberate design, though not precisely concurrent in point of time therewith, are regarded as contemporaneous and admissible.\u201d (P. 465.) \u201cThe test so laid down is whether or not the statement is made under such circumstances of physical shock or nervous excitement as preclude the likelihood of reflection and fabrication.\u201d (P. 466.) \u201c [I]n our opinion the rule to be followed is that where a declaration is made under the immediate influence of the occurrence to which it relates and so near the time of that occurrence as to negative any probability of fabrication, said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>declaration is admissible. . . . The cases cited hereinabove to the contrary, holding the view that the admissibility of such statements is dependent on proximity of time to the principal event or on the continuation of the occurrence to which they relate, are as a consequence hereby overruled.\u201d (P. 467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">And at pages 468-469: \u201cThe basis for this circumstantial probability of trustworthiness is \u2018that in the stress of nervous excitement the reflective faculties may be stilled and the utterance may become the unreflecting and sincere expression of one\u2019s actual impressions and belief. \u2019 To render them admissible it is required that (1) there must be some occurrence startling enough to produce the nervous excitement and render the utterance spontaneous and unreflecting; (2) the utterance must have been before there has been time to contrive and misrepresent, i.e., while the nervous excitement may be supposed still to dominate and the reflective powers to be yet in abeyance; and (3) the utterance must relate to the circumstance of the occurrence preceding it.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>40 Cal.2d 160, 168 [252 P.2d 1]; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Pacific Greyhound Lines, </em>26 Cal.2d 575, 581-584 [160 P.2d 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Appellant\u2019s reliance upon the decision in <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Easter, </em>203 Cal.App.2d 845 [21 Cal.Rptr. 905], is misplaced. In truth, the contrasting factual picture presented in <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Easter, supra, </em>merely serves to point up the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling in the instant case. In <em>Wiley, </em>it appeared that a police officer had interviewed one of the parties to a traffic accident approximately an hour thereafter and at a hospital where she \u201cmay well have\u201d received \u201c \u2018medication for pain\u2019.\u201d (P. 853.) In addition, the statement sought to be introduced in <em>Wiley </em>actually was not a verbal \u201cdeclaration\u201d of the party at all but a summary prepared by the officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The anguished cries of the fatally wounded victim in the instant case, that were repeated over and over again both at the scene and during the drive to the hospital, clearly support the trial court\u2019s determination<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that they were \u201c \u2018spontaneous, \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u2018natural,\u2019 \u2018impulsive,\u2019 \u2018generated by an excited feeling which extends without letup or breakdown from the moment of the event they illustrate.\u2019.\u201d (6 Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 1749, p. 139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Although we hold that Ontiveros\u2019 statement was properly received in evidence, it may also be noted that inasmuch as it was merely cumulative of the evidence introduced by the direct testimony of others, it would not have constituted grounds for reversal even if erroneously received. Juan Lujano, the actual victim of the robbery, testified that after he had fallen to the ground wounded, he heard one of his assailants say, \u201cKill him, take his billfold and let\u2019s go.\u201d In addition, one of appellant\u2019s group testified that several times he heard his companions saying, \u2018 \u2018 Get the wallet. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Turning to appellant\u2019s contention that the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct during his cross-examination, our observation in <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>207 Cal.App.2d 717, 724 [24 Cal.Rptr. 691], is equally apposite here: \u201cThe term \u2018misconduct\u2019 when applied to the act of an attorney implies a dishonest act or an attempt to persuade the court or jury by the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods. [Citation.] In this case, there can be no fair assertion that . . . the prosecutor . . . conducted [himself] in such fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">During appellant\u2019s first trial the prosecution had elicited through the testimony of one of appellant\u2019s companions evidence that appellant had borrowed a glass cutter earlier in the evening \u201cfor the purpose of \u2018gettin\u2019 into some place and get something out of it in town;\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 482, 487.) A glass cutter was later found at the scene. Although the court noted, footnote 4, page 487, that testimony relating to an apparent abortive burglary \u201cwas received over vigorous objection on the grounds of irrelevancy and undue prejudicial effect,\u201d it did not hold that such objection was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">However, apparently in conformity with a policy of extreme caution designed to avoid even the possibility of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>upon retrial, the prosecutor at an earlier stage of the instant trial indicated to the court that he would not seek to prove this other plan for criminal endeavor. It is extremely doubtful that such abstention was necessary. Proof that appellant\u2019s desire to obtain funds was so great as to cause him to formulate a plan to acquire them through felonious means constituted strong evidence that this intent and purpose to rob existed in his mind at the inception of his fatal assault upon Ontiveros.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The fact that the crimes of burglary and robbery have different elements is not determinative where the prosecution is not seeking to establish the identity of the perpetrator by means of proof that the modus operandi in each of two crimes was sufficiently similar to permit the inference that the perpetrator of the uncharged offense was the perpetrator of the charged offense. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Haston, </em>69 Cal.2d 233, 244-245 et seq. [70 Cal.Rptr. 419, 444 P.2d 91].) The issue here was whether or not the intent to commit theft, manifested by earlier plans for a burglary, remained with appellant when he and his companions assaulted their victims a few minutes after the abandonment of their initial plan and after he had expressly suggested the idea of \u2018\u2018 rolling someone. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\u201c \u2018[I]n <em>People </em>v. <em>Peete, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d 306 [169 P.2d 924], this court pointed out that \u201cexcept when it shows merely criminal disposition [citation], evidence that is relevant is not excluded because it reveals the commission of an offense other than that charged,\u201d and noted that the general test of admissibility of evidence in a criminal ease is whether it tends logically, naturally, and by reasonable inference, to establish any fact material for the People or to overcome any material matter sought to be proved by the defense. \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Haston, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 233, 244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">However, as indicated, the prosecution did not seek to develop this issue upon retrial until appellant had denied that the glass cutter found on the scene was his. He also asserted that despite the fact he and his companions lacked funds with which to purchase gasoline for their car, he was not suffering any particular financial pressure. The prosecution then developed the fact that appellant was delinquent in his child support payments and questioned him concerning any delinquency in his rent payments and in his restaurant account. Appellant was then asked: \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that on the afternoon of Friday, July 30, 1965, at the Alarcon residence, that you got a glass cutter to commit a burglary with ? \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>An objection to this question was promptly interposed and sustained. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel apparently was well satisfied with this ruling for he merely stated 1 \u2018Thank you\u201d without requesting that the jury be admonished. From a tactical point of view, counsel\u2019s good reason for satisfaction is clear. He had effectively prevented the prosecution from opening up this telling area of inquiry and he certainly had no desire to have his achievement pointed out to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On appeal, however, appellant now argues that the trial court did not go far enough. He asserts that despite his counsel\u2019s decision not to seek any further action by the court, nevertheless the trial judge either should have admonished the prosecution or declared a mistrial, <em>sua sponte. </em>We cannot agree. While it might have been better practice for the prosecution, if it had decided, contrary to its original intention, to inquire into the planned criminal offense, to have so advised the trial court and thereby obtained a direct ruling on the issue, its failure so to do certainly does not constitute misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">As pointed out in our previous comments, if such a ruling had been sought, it might well have been adverse to appellant with resulting serious damage to his defense. We are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the record discloses neither misconduct nor prejudicial error. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a713.) Viewing this one inquiry in its context of seven volumes of reporter\u2019s transcript, we find the observations of the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>40 Cal.2d 483, 490 [254 P.2d 501], equally appropriate here: \u201cRoberts contends that the prosecuting attorney was guilty of misconduct in asking him, on cross-examination, \u2018You\u2019re commonly known in the Fillmore as a peddler of narcotics, are you not?\u2019 Defense counsel promptly objected to the question and the objection was sustained. There was no request that the jury be instructed to disregard the question. As indicated above, throughout the trial there appears to have been an atmosphere of fairness which was contributed to by the trial judge and by both counsel. We find nothing in the record to indicate that the asking of the question was anything more than an inadvertence. It should not have been asked but in the circumstances we do not believe that asking the question was prejudicial or can possibly be considered to constitute ground for reversal. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Appellant\u2019s third and fourth contentions require no extended discussion. We have examined the medical evidence and the photographs introduced herein and find no abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the discretion vouchsafed to the trial court in such matters. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>64 Cal.2d 691, 706 [51 Cal.Rptr. 417, 414 P.2d 633]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>252 Cal.App.2d 932, 956-957 [61 Cal.Rptr. 1].) Evidence Code section 788 expressly provides for impeachment by proof of a prior felony conviction and in the absence of any constitutional invalidity in the prior conviction, and none is asserted here, this form of impeachment has been consistently upheld by our highest court. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>67 Cal.2d 204, 218-219 [60 Cal.Rptr. 457, 430 P.2d 15].)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Appellant\u2019s fifth contention arises from the following circumstance. Officer Vasquez of the Oxnard Police Department testified that after appellant's arrest, the officer entered a certain room in the station in order to complete his log. He did not know that appellant was using a telephone<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> therein and he overheard a portion of his conversation entirely by accident. He at no time asked appellant any questions and gave him no direction or instruction. He heard appellant say in Spanish, \u201cGet rid of that red shirt in the cleaners.\u201d Thereafter, appellant noticed Officer Vasquez\u2019 presence and said to him, \u2018\u2018 Can\u2019t I even talk to my wife while I\u2019m talking on the telephone ? \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, it is quite immaterial whether or not he had been apprised of his constitutional rights in accordance with <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974], or <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361], prior to this occurrence. Neither <em>Miranda </em>nor <em>Dorado </em>prohibit the receipt into evidence of statements or confessions that are entirely volunteered without solicitation or interrogation. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>p. 478 [16 L.Ed.2d p. 725]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>p. 354; <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>66 Cal.2d 330, 342 [57 Cal.Rptr. 745, 425 P.2d 545].)  It is not claimed here that Officer Vasquez was acting as an \u201cundercover agent\u201d or eavesdropper or that he in any way induced appellant\u2019s statement. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Arguello, </em>63 Cal.2d 566, 571 [47 Cal.Rptr. 485, 407 P.2d 661].)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Appellant\u2019s contention regarding the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of his assigned errors is without merit for we have rejected the premise on which it is based, i.e., that his first five assignments of error were well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Appellant\u2019s supplemental contentions regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>manner in which the jury was selected are based upon an incident during the <em>voire dire </em>of the prospective jurors. It appears from the record before us that following a luncheon recess, one of the prospective jurors, Tavy Cain, advised the trial judge in open court that he had heard that the pending ease was a \u201cretrial.\u201d The court promptly interrupted the proceedings to permit the juror to be examined on the matter outside the presence of the other members of the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In chambers, juror Cain informed the court that during the luncheon recess he had heard one of the other prospective jurors remark that the pending ease \u201cwas a retrial; that is, the defendant was found guilty before and that it was set aside on a technicality.\u201d However, as indicated, the proceedings in open court had been suspended after the word \u201cretrial\u201d had been mentioned and no reference was made to the balance of the statement overheard by juror Cain. The court and counsel for both parties questioned juror Cain concerning the effect, if any, the statement he had overheard would have upon his ability to serve as an impartial trier of the fact herein. Following this inquiry, the court denied appellant\u2019s challenge of juror Cain for cause and his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Our examination of juror Cain\u2019s answers during this inquiry convince us that the trial court properly determined that the juror would be able to disregard the indicated statement regarding the retrial and act impartially and without prejudice or bias.  To the extent that the juror, in attempting to speculate on what his \u201csubconscious\u201d reaction might be to the statement he had overhead, gave somewhat inconsistent estimates of his ability, the law is clear that \u201cWhere a prospective juror gives conflicting answers to questions relevant to his impartiality, the trial court\u2019s determination as to his state of mind is binding upon an appellate court. [Citations.] \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Linden, </em>52 Cal.2d 1, 22 [338 P.2d 397].)</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Moreover, even if the court\u2019s ruling on appellant\u2019s challenge for cause had constituted error, he would be precluded from asserting such error on appeal since it was stipulated during oral argument herein that he had six peremptory challenges remaining when he announced his acceptance of the jury. As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkes, </em>44 Cal.2d 679, 686 [284 P.2d 481] : \u201cWhen the jury had been selected, defendants had 11 peremptory challenges which they had not used. Even if the trial judge had erroneously disallowed a challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>for cause, defendants could not complain that an objectionable juror was forced on them where they could have had him excused by peremptory challenge. [Citations.] \u201d (See also 29 Cal.Jur.2d, Jury, \u00a7 121, p. 657, and cases cite therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Appellant\u2019s secondary contention that his motion for a mistrial should have been granted finds no support in the record before us. Apparently the only statement heard by the other members of the jury panel was the juror Cain\u2019s report that he had heard that the case before the court was a \u201cretrial.\u201d Certainly it would be wrong for us to hold as a matter of law that the entire jury panel was automatically disqualified and rendered incapable of reaching a fair and impartial verdict because of this relatively innocuous incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Finally, we note that the court\u2019s abstract of judgment (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a71213, 1213.5) contains the finding that appellant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of each offense of which he was convicted \u201cwithin the meaning of Penal Code Sections 969c and 3024.\u201d Appellant does not challenge the factual basis for this finding and its limitation to section 3024 is correct. That is to say, inasmuch as appellant\u2019s use of the deadly weapon was a factor in each of the offenses charged, he was not \u201carmed . . . under such circumstances as to bring [him] within the operation of . . . Section 12022 of the Penal Code\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 969c) permitting the imposition of an additional, consecutive sentence. <em>(In re Shull, </em>23 Cal.2d 745, 749 [146 P.2d 417].) We need not modify the judgment in order to indicate the inapplicability of section 12022 since any sentence here imposed necessarily would be merged into the life term expressly prescribed for first degree murder. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7190, 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Roth, P. J., and Fleming, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 9,1969,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Apparently the evidence of the statements of Ontiveros was not offered or received on the theory that the statements constituted dying declarations as defined in section 1242 of the Evidence Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\">The officer testified, pages 853-854; <em>\u201c </em>\u2018That is the substance of our conversation.
