Lynch, Attorney General, William E.

Code, \u00a7 207, a felony), and in count II with rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. 4, a felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">It was alleged that, prior to the commission of the offenses charged, defendant had been convicted of the crime of robbery, a felony, on December 24, 1956, and also convicted of a violation of secton 487, subdivision 1, of the Penal Code, a felony, on March 10,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u2022 Defendant pled not guilty and withdrew the plea; his motion under Penal Code, section 995, was denied; defendant again pled not guilty and denied the truth of the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Defendant was found guilty on both counts and the prior convictions were found true. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The court, after reading and considering the court-appointed psychiatrist\u2019s report, found defendant to be sane in the past and presently sane and able to participate in the proceedings. The court dismissed count II (rape) on its own motion, on the ground that the proof did not amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ordered proceedings suspended on count I and granted probation for five years on condition that defendant spend the first six months in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">On December 23, 1966, Mrs. Nay da Laga\u00f1a, a waitress at Lyttle\u2019s Restaurant, was walking to work at 11:25 p.m., when a car made a U-turn and drove up to the curb where she was walking. Defendant got out, grabbed her arm and told her to get in the ear. Mrs. Laga\u00f1a recognized defendant because she had seen him several times in the restaurant where she worked. Defendant said, \u201cGet into the ear or I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019\u2019 Defendant said he had a knife, and he pushed Mrs. Laga\u00f1a into the car, held his hand over her eyes, and another person drove the car. They stopped at a dirt lot. Defendant had a cane with him. He told Mrs. Laga\u00f1a to get down or he would kill her, and defendant accomplished an act of sexual intercourse with her. Then defendant said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u2019-\u2019 'Mrs. Laga\u00f1a said, \u201cNayda.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cOh, my God, I think I got the wrong girl. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Mrs. Laga\u00f1a was driven to work by two boys who saw her running, and she reported the events to the police. Slides taken from Mrs. Laga\u00f1a showed human spermatozoa. There were seminal stains on defendant\u2019s shorts and trousers at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">James Schirtzinger was with defendant on December 23d. He and defendant picked up a young lady. Schirtzinger drove defendant to the lot and defendant and the girl got out and Schirtzinger drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Defendant testified that he had a back injury. Mr. Walters testified that defendant wore a brace on his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Defendant first contends that it was prejudicial error to allow the jury to determine the truth or falsity of the prior convictions without first finding defendant guilty of the crime he was charged with. Defendant argues that it was unconstitutional to fail to bifurcate the trial such that the jury would receive evidence relating to defendant\u2019s prior conviction only after determination of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">It is not necessary to have a bifurcated proceeding in which the fact of the prior conviction is determined in a proceeding after the conviction of the primary offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hickok </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 57, 59-60 [40 Cal.Rptr. 687]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hoerler </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 402, 408 [25 Cal.Rptr. 209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">The statutory procedure (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1025, 1093, 1158) <em>of </em>reading to the jury the indictment referring to a prior conviction, and of presenting evidence to the jury of the prior convictions at the same time that the proof of the substantive crime is presented, does not deprive defendant of his constitutional rights. <em>(Spencer </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1967) 385 U.S. 554 [17 L.Ed.2d 606, 87 S.Ct. 648]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hoerler, supra, </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 402, 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">Defendant\u2019s second assertion is that the People did not have sufficient proof of the prior convictions. Defendant asserts that only documentary evidence was admitted regarding the prior convictions and there was no showing by fingerprints or pictures that the prior convictions related to the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant asserts that, \u201cNothing, in fact, was shown but the same or similar names. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">Although there are conflicting authorities among the vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>ous states (see 85 A.L.R 1107; 11 A.L.R.2d 884, 886 and 892), the California cases hold that, in the absence of other and contrary testimony,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the identity of names, coupled with proper proof of prior convictions, is sufficient to sustain a finding that defendant was the person involved in the earlier cases. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Theodore </em>(1953) 121 Cal.App.2d 17 [262 P.2d 630].) We see no reason to depart from the <em>Theodore </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Files, P. J., and Dunn, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-15\">The record <em>does </em>show that some pictures of defendant were admitted but these pictures were taken years after the earlier convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-17\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Willison </em>(1931) 116 Cal.App. 157 [2 P.2d 543], where the finding of a prior was reversed for insufficient evidence, the record showed commitments under names other than those given for the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
