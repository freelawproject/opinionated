Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 211a) as charged in count II of the information and of kidnaping for purposes of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209) as charged in count III of the information.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His motion for a new trial and request for probation were denied. Sentenced to the state prison on the two counts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of conviction. Pursuant to his request, this court appointed appellate counsel for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The sole issue which counsel raises in this appeal is whether it was error to permit the reading at the trial of the testimony of the robbery victim given at the preliminary hearing, the victim then being confined to a hospital due to a cerebral thrombosis, incapacitated from speaking, and unable to be transported to the court to testify. Furthermore, the prognosis was that the witness would not recover his speech facility for another eight-week period. We have concluded that there was no error and that the judgment should be affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Upon his direct examination at the preliminary hearing, Lee E. Freeman had testified in substance as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>During the early evening hours of December 20, 1966, he was the manager of the Buster Car Company used car lot located on South Figueroa Street in Los Angeles. At that time a man approached him on the lot, \u201cbrought from behind a Luger-type automatic,\u201d and told him to keep his hands and head down and walk to the office. Freeman complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Inside the office, the gunman said, \u201cI want all your money\u201d and \u201cwhere is the safe!\u201d Freeman answered that they had no safe and that the only money he had was on his person in his pockets. The gunman then said, \u201cGive it to me.\u201d Freeman testified, \u201cI took the money I had in my left trousers pocket. I handed it to him. He took it in his hand and tossed it over on the desk. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The gunman thereupon stated that he wanted \u201call of it,\u201d so Freeman took a money folder out of his hip pocket, which the gunman took and put into his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The monies taken from Freeman\u2019s two pockets totalled about $240.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The gunman next proceeded to search through the desk drawers, which he had commanded Freeman to open. After looking through the drawers, the gunman closed them, one by one, using the barrel of his pistol to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">In the meantime, another man came in from the outside, took the money which the gunman had obtained earlier from Freeman and had thrown on the desk, and went outside again.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Freeman opened the drawers of another desk on the other side of the office, as commanded. From the center drawer of this desk, the gunman took and put into his own pocket \u201ca $30 money order, a $15 money order, and a $6.50 personal, and a $5 personal check,\u201d all drawn payable to the Buster Car Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Freeman was then commanded \u201cto turn around and lay down on the floor.\u201d When Freeman hesitated \u201ca little too long,\u201d the gunman hit Freeman on the head, knocking off Freeman\u2019s glasses, and causing Freeman to bleed. The gunman attempted to hit Freeman again. Freeman warded off the blow, and in the ensuing ruckus the gunman\u2019s weapon fell to the floor. In this scuffle, Freeman suffered two gashes to his scalp, one requiring five surgical stitches and the other two stitches.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">After the gunman \u201cdropped his gun, he did not make any effort to retrieve the gun. He took off and ran out the door. \u2019 \u2019 Freeman then got his own gun and went after the culprit, who \u201cwent down\u201d with the first shot Freeman fired. Not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>withstanding that, Freeman \u201ckept firing.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Freeman returned to his office and telephoned the police. The gun, which had been dropped by the hold-up man, was still lying on the floor after the police arrived and when Freeman left in an ambulance for the emergency hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Freeman identified the defendant, Ira Lee King, Jr., as the gunman and the Luger-type automatic produced at the hearing as appearing \u201cto be the identical\u201d gun as used in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Freeman was then cross-examined by defendant\u2019s counsel at the preliminary hearing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201c Q. Is the ear lot that you were originally stopped on well-lit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">\u201cA. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">\u201cQ. Would you say that it would give approximately the same light as a streetlight ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">\u201cA. Even more so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Q. Did you, when you were in the car lot, have an opportunity to face the individual that approached you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">\u201cQ. Approximately how far from this individual were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-14\">\u201cA. About an arm\u2019s length.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-15\">\u201cQ. Did this individual have a beard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-16\">\u201cA. Just a mustache.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-17\">\u201cQ. What was he wearing ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-18\">\u201cA. He had on a red baseball cap and a knit sweater. I believe it was a pastel. I can\u2019t remember the exact color of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-19\">\u201cQ. You indicate that some money was removed, the sum of $240 in currency, is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-20\">\u2018 \u2018A. That is correct, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-21\">\u201cQ. How much of that was on your person ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-22\">\u201cA. All of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-23\">\u201cQ. $240 was in your pocket ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-24\">\u201cA. Yes. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-25\">\u201cQ. You indicated that you were hit on the head ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-26\">\u201cA. Yes. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-27\">\u201c Q. Did you make any fast movements prior to that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-28\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-29\">\u201cQ. You were just standing there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-30\">\u201cA. Just standing there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-31\">\"Q. Were you going into any desk drawers ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The circumstantial evidence produced at the trial likewise pointed to defendant\u2019s guilt. The defendant was arrested about 9 :20 p.m. in the hallway of an apartment two or three doors east of the used ear lot. He did not live in the apartment. He was found shot in the lower back and upper buttocks region and bleeding profusely. He was wearing a Imitted type shirt or sweater, but no shoes. The sum of $196, plus some change, was found in his right front pocket. A wallet was removed from his rear pants pocket, containing a driver\u2019s license showing his home address to be elsewhere. \u201cNumerous\u201d cheeks and money orders made payable to the Buster Car Company, and a re-order form for personalized cheeks with \u201cFreeman\u201d on it, were found in the wastebasket of a room in the apartment, where defendant was first seen immediately preceding his arrest in the hallway. At the receiving hospital, a police officer observed some teeth of a comb removed from the area of the bullet wound suffered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The police, responding to a radio call right after the robbery, found the following items at the Buster Car Company: (1) a .45 automatic weapon on the office table, (2) a loaded P-38 German automatic weapon on the floor underneath the table, and (3) a red baseball cap on the floor under a desk drawer. Outside the office, they also recovered some spent .45 caliber shells, a pair of shoes, and a black comb.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Essentially, the defense consisted of the testimony of several witnesses, which given full credence would amount to no more than a qualified alibi defense, and defendant\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Defendant admitted being on the premises at the time of the robbery, but claimed that he had gone there for the purpose of trading his car and making a down-payment. He had $180 to $190 on him for the purposes of making the down-payment. When he arrived at the used car lot and had reached the top of the porch, another man bumped into him and a gun fell to the ground. At that moment, he was shot in the back and fell. He saw a second man with a gun and determined that the shot had come from that direction. He tried to pick up the gun lying on the ground and to fire it. It would not operate, so he threw it on the porch. He then made his way to an apartment house \u201cmostly\u201d by \u201csliding.\u201d He admitted that the comb and shoes found at the Buster Car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Company premises were his, hut denied ownership of the baseball cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The identification testimony of the absent witness Freeman that it was the defendant who held the gun on him and relieved him of his money and who took the money orders and checks from his immediate presence was, therefore, an essential part of the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The issue of nonavailability presents no serious question here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence thereon was undisputed. It was stipulated that if a Dr. Akira Nishizawa were called and sworn as a witness, he would testify: that he is a doctor of medicine licensed to practice in California, specializing in internal medicine; that he examined the witness, Lee Freeman, Sr., on August 13, 1967, about 1 p.m., at the Washington Hospital in Los Angeles; that he diagnosed Freeman to be suffering most likely from a cerebral thrombosis with possibilities of subdural hematoma; that the patient was confused and unable to speak, which condition would not clear up for another eight weeks; and that the patient could not be moved to the court at that time to testify. The investigating officer, Rollie Lawson, also testified at the trial on August 15, 1967, that he had seen Freeman at the Washington Hospital about 1:30 p.m. of the previous day (August 14, 1967), and at which time Freeman was unable to speak at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The preliminary hearing was conducted on February 17, 1967. The trial proceedings were held on August 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17, of 1967. The provisions of the Evidence Code are, therefore, applicable. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Before the effective date of the Evidence Code (January 1 1967), prior recorded testimony of an absent witness could be read to a jury in a criminal trial only where the witness was dead, insane, or could not with due diligence be found within the state. (Former Pen. Code, \u00a7 686; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lint </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 402, 420-421 [6 Cal.Rptr. 95]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rinesmith </em>(1940) 40 Cal.App.2d 786, 790 [105 P.2d 1021].) Section 240, subdivision (a)(3), of the Evidence Code now provides that a witness is unavailable if he is \u201c [d]ead or unable to attend or to testify at the hearing because of then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Section 686 of the Penal Code was amended to read, commencing from the effective date of the Evidence Code, in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201cIn a criminal action the defendant is entitled: ... 3. ... to he confronted with the witnesses against him, in the presence of the court, except that: (a) Hearsay evidence<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> may be admitted to the extent that it is otherwise admissible in a criminal action under the law of this state, (b) The deposition of a witness taken in the action may be read to the extent that it is otherwise admissible under the law of this state. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Section 1291 of the Evidence Code provides in part: \u201c (a) Evidence of former testimony is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness and: ... (2) The party against whom the former testimony is offered was a party to the action or proceeding in which the testimony was given and had the right and opportunity to cross-examine the declarant with an interest and motive similar to that which he has at the hearing.\u201d This provision was intended by the Legislature to apply to criminal as well as civil cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">In this ease, defendant\u2019s counsel at the preliminary hearing did exercise the defendant\u2019s right and opportunity of cross-examining the witness Freeman. He astutely focused his questions on the identification testimony of Freeman given on direct examination.  While it is true that \u201c [a] preliminary hearing is ordinarily a much less searching exploration into the merits of a case than a trial, simply because its function is the more limited one of determining whether probable cause exists to hold the accused for trial\u201d <em>(Barber </em>v. <em>Page </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 719, 725 [20 L.Ed.2d 255, 260, 88 S.Ct. 1318 1322]), nevertheless the interest and motive for the cross-examination of a prosecution witness in both proceedings arc similar.  Defense counsel is also on notice at the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>liminary hearing that the reporter\u2019s transcript of that hearing can be used against the defendant at the trial if the witness then testifying becomes unavailable. In permitting th.e transcript of the absent witness Freeman to be read at the trial, the trial court found the interest and motive of the cross-examination of Freeman at the preliminary hearing to be similar to that which the defense counsel would have had if Freeman had testified at the trial. (Evid. Code, \u00a7402 subd. (c).) The statute requires only that the interest and motive be similar, not identical. We find no abuse of discretion or error in the trial court\u2019s finding in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The defendant filed a supplemental appellant\u2019s brief, albeit with permission first obtained. Differing from <em>In re Cathey </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 679, 684-685 [12 Cal.Rptr. 762, 361 P.2d 426], where the <em>pro se </em>briefs were filed before appointment of appellate counsel, this supplemental brief was filed subsequently to his counsel\u2019s filing his very workmanlike brief raising the dispositive issue presented by the record on appeal.  As a general rule, a defendant who is represented by counsel upon appeal may not file <em>pro se </em>documents and such documents may properly be stricken <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 777, 798 [336 P.2d 937]) or disregarded <em>(People </em>v. <em>Root </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 600, 604, fn. 2 [55 Cal.Rptr. 89]). However, since permission to file the <em>pro se </em>brief was obtained in this ease, we have given consideration to each of the points raised therein. We do not, however, find any of them as having any merit. We further add that the fact that permission was granted the defendant to file a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief in this case and that we have taken the time to consider it should not be construed as precedent for future cases of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Stephens, Acting P. J., and Reppy, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 19,1969.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Defendant was also charged with another robbery (Pen.
