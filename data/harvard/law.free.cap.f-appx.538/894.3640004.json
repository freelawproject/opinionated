(\u201cCisco\u201d) appeals from a final judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, dismissing its declaratory judgment action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the reasons explained, we <em>affirm </em>the district court\u2019s finding of no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Cisco develops and manufactures networking equipment components used in telecommunications infrastructures. Cisco sells its products to national and regional telecommunications providers, who use the products to build telecommunication networks. Among other products, Cisco supplies its ONS 15454 multiservice platforms and CRS routers, which are network components used to deliver voice and data content. Alberta Telecommunications Research Centre, d/b/a TR Labs, is a Canadian nonprofit research consortium with universities, companies, and government agencies as members. TR Technologies Inc. (together with Alberta Telecommunications Research Centre, \u201cTR Labs\u201d) is a Canadian corporation and the exclusive licensee of patents owned by Telecommunications Research Laboratories.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alberta Telecommunications Research Laboratories is the owner by assignment of the TR Labs patents. The TR Labs patents are directed to telecommunication networks and claim the networks themselves (i.e., system claims) and methods performed on the networks.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">TR Labs has brought several lawsuits asserting the TR Labs patents against various national and regional telecommunications network providers; many are customers of Cisco. These lawsuits are currently pending in a multi-district litigation in the District of New Jersey. The consolidated cases include lawsuits against AT &amp; T, Verizon, and Comcast. There is another pending case against seven defendants in the District of Colorado (\u201cthe Colorado case\u201d). In some of the complaints served on these network providers, TR Labs accused the defendants of infringing the asserted patents \u201cbased on\u201d the use of Cisco products in their network systems. As those cases progressed, moreover, TR Labs provided claim charts to the defendants which tie TR Labs\u2019 infringement contentions to the respective defendants\u2019 use of Cisco products, identified by model number, and quote Cisco\u2019s product literature to describe the allegedly infringing functionality made possible by those Cisco products. In some of the cases, TR Labs even identifies the Cisco components as comprising \u201ca Cisco MPLS network.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">In response to TR Labs\u2019 actions against its customers, Cisco filed an action in the Northern District of California on June 26, 2012, seeking declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the TR Labs patents. TR Labs moved to dismiss Cisco\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that Cisco failed to allege facts sufficient to establish that TR Labs had accused Cisco itself of either direct or indirect infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">Before opposing TR Labs\u2019 motion to dismiss, Cisco sought a covenant not to sue. But, because Cisco sought to include in those covenants a release of its customers in addition to itself, the parties did not reach agreement. Cisco thus opposed TR Labs\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">The district court granted TR Labs\u2019 motion to dismiss, finding that Cisco failed to establish declaratory judgment jurisdiction. <em>Cisco Sys., Inc. v. Alberta Tele-comms. Research Ctr., </em>892 F.Supp.2d 1226, 1228 (N.D.Cal.2012) After noting that Cisco conceded it could not base subject matter jurisdiction on fears of a direct infringement claim against it, the district court also found jurisdiction could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>based on threatened claims of indirect infringement by Cisco. <em>Id. </em>at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The district court did not find the claim charts TR Labs served on Cisco\u2019s customers determinative, finding it impossible to tell if the Cisco components were mentioned in those charts only as background information or \u201cas required parts of the accused networks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233. Ultimately, the district court found it difficult to tell from the record whether a justicia-ble controversy yet existed between Cisco and TR Labs.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">The trial court then discounted the parties\u2019 inability to enter into a covenant not to sue because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-6\">Finally, the parties\u2019 inability to agree on a covenant not to sue is not determinative of this issue. It is true ... that a patentee\u2019s grant of a covenant not to sue a supplier for infringement can eliminate the supplier\u2019s standing to bring a declaratory judgment action.... However, the converse\u2014that because the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a covenant not to sue, there must necessarily be a justiciable controversy\u2014is not necessarily true, particularly if, as TR Labs claims here, it was unwilling to agree to Cisco\u2019s draft proposal because such a covenant not to sue would have essentially resulted in the elimination of TR Labs\u2019 ability to sue alleged infringers who also happened to be Cisco\u2019s customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Cisco appeals that ruling to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Powertech Tech. Inc. v. Tessera, Inc., </em>660 F.3d 1301, 1306 (Fed.Cir.2012). When reviewing the decision, we must \u201caccept[ ] as true all well-pleaded allegations of fact, construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Chiron Corp., </em>136 F.3d 1317, 1321-22 (Fed.Cir.1998) (citing <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974)). \u201cThe burden is on the party claiming declaratory judgment jurisdiction to establish that such jurisdiction existed at the time the claim for declaratory relief was filed.\u201d <em>Powertech Tech. Inc., </em>660 F.3d at 1306 (citing <em>King Pharm., Inc. v. Eon Labs, Inc., </em>616 F.3d 1267, 1282 (Fed.Cir.2010); <em>Benitec Austl., Ltd. v. Necleonics, Inc., </em>495 F.3d 1340, 1344 (Fed.Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, \u201c[i]n the case of an actual controversy within its jurisdiction, ... any court of the United States, upon'the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such a declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). In <em>MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court reiterated that the proper test for whether a declaratory judgment action presents a justiciable controversy is \u201cwhether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d 549 U.S. 118, 127, 127 S.Ct. 764, 166 L.Ed.2d 604 (2007) (quoting <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v. Pac. Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Cisco relies on two of or our prior cases, <em>Arkema Inc. v. Honeywell International, Inc., </em>706 F.3d 1351 (Fed.Cir.2013) and <em>Ar-ris Group, Inc. v. British Telecommunications PLC, </em>639 F.3d 1368 (Fed.Cir.2011), to support its claim that the district court erred when it dismissed Cisco\u2019s complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>While a close call, we ultimately are unpersuaded that either case justifies reversal here, particularly given the concessions counsel for TR Labs made during the oral argument before this Court. <em>See Organic Seed Growers &amp; Trade Ass\u2019n v. Monsanto </em>Co., 718 F.3d 1350, 1358-59 (Fed.Cir.2013) (\u201cIf we rely on Monsanto\u2019s representations to defeat the appellants\u2019 declaratory judgment claims (as we do), those representations are binding as a matter of judicial estoppel. It is well-established that a party who successfully argues one position is estopped from later adopting a contrary position in a case involving the same patent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">In <em>Arkema, </em>the district court refused to allow Arkema to amend its declaratory judgment complaint to add claims for newly-issued patents, finding no justiciable controversy over those patents. 706 F.3d at 1353. We reversed, holding that a justi-ciable controversy existed between Arke-ma and the defendant on the new patents based on Arkema\u2019s plans to sell a product allegedly covered by those patents. <em>Id. </em>at 1353-54. The parties had a history of litigation, both in the U.S. and abroad, surrounding Arkema\u2019s activities with the product allegedly covered by the patents, both old and new. <em>Id. </em>at 1357. The pat-entee acknowledged, moreover, that there were no substantial non-infringing uses for the coolant within the industry which Arkema planned to operate (i.e., the automobile industry). <em>Id. </em>at 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">In <em>Arris, </em>we also found jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action because an actual controversy existed between the parties. 639 F.3d at 1371. British Telecommunications (\u201cBT\u201d) accused Arris customers of infringing its patents by using Arris\u2019 products. <em>Id. </em>There was substantial communication between BT, the customers, and Arris regarding BT\u2019s theories of infringement against both Arris and its customers before the declaratory judgment action was filed. <em>Id. </em>at 1372. Additionally, the customers had demanded \u201cthat Arris \u2018defend, indemnify and hold harmless [the customer] from [BT\u2019s] assertions of infringement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on this activity, we found that an actual controversy warranting declaratory judgment jurisdiction existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">The facts in this case fit neither the facts in <em>Arkema </em>nor those in <em>Arris </em>and otherwise fail to give rise to a current justiciable controversy between TR Labs and Cisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">As an initial matter, at oral argument, Cisco\u2019s counsel conceded that its products were not identified in claim charts relating to two of the eight patents at issue, the '505 and '543 patents. Oral Argument at 8:20-8:55; 9:30-9:45; 27:46-29:15, <em>Cisco Sys., Inc. v. Alberta Telecomms. Research Ctr., </em>2012-1687, <em>available at </em>http://www. cafc.useourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/search/audio.html.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the reference to Cisco\u2019s products in certain of the claim charts is the primary basis upon which Cisco premises its alleged fear that an infringement claim might be asserted against it, the absence of any reference to Cisco products in the charts relating to the '505 and '543 patents greatly undercuts Cisco\u2019s claim that a controversy exists as to those patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Also at oral argument, TR Labs\u2019 counsel conceded that TR Labs has \u201cno basis for suing [Cisco] either for direct or indirect infringement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24:20-24:26. TR Labs further conceded that there are sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>stantial non-infringing uses of Cisco\u2019s products, a point Cisco does not dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 17:20-18:50. Given this reality, TR Labs could not assert a claim of contributory infringement against Cisco under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(c). <em>See Ricoh Co. v. Quanta Computer, Inc., </em>550 F.3d 1325, 1337 (Fed.Cir.2008) (\u201cThe language of the statute incorporates the core notion that one who sells a component especially designed for use in a patented invention may be liable as a contributory infringer, provided that the component is not a staple article of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use.\u201d). These facts clearly distinguish the facts here from those at issue in <em>Arkema.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Additionally, unlike in <em>Arris, </em>there were no protracted discussions between Cisco and TR Labs regarding Cisco\u2019s potential liability before filing the declaratory judgment action. And, unlike in <em>Arris, </em>Cisco has never asserted that it has indemnity obligations for any liability its customers might incur. Indeed, when asked about indemnity agreements directly during oral argument, Cisco\u2019s counsel could not point to any such agreement, promise, or obligation. Oral Argument at 3:45-5:35.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Finally, TR Labs has expressly offered to give Cisco a covenant not to sue Cisco for infringement of any of the asserted patents. As noted above, TR Labs\u2019 counsel stated that TR Labs has \u201cno basis for suing [Cisco] either for direct or indirect infringement\u201d and \u201cwe were happy\u201d to give Cisco a covenant not to sue. <em>Id. </em>at 24:20-24:35. It is understandable that Cisco may have an interest in saving its customers from infringement contentions premised, even in part, on their use of Cisco products. In the circumstances presented here, that interest is simply insufficient to give rise to a current, justiciable case or controversy upon which federal declaratory judgment jurisdiction may be predicated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">TR Labs\u2019 concession that it is willing to grant Cisco an unqualified covenant not to sue, TR Labs\u2019 concession that it has no basis for asserting direct or indirect infringement claims against Cisco, including the parties\u2019 agreement that Cisco\u2019s products have substantial non-infringing uses, and Cisco\u2019s failure to identify any obligation to indemnify or defend its customers distinguish this action from others in which this Court has found declaratory judgment jurisdiction and support the district court\u2019s finding that it lacked the same. We therefore affirm the district court ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-7\">. The patents relevant to this appeal are U.S. Patent Nos.: 4,956,835 (\"the '835 patent\u201d); 5,850,505 (\"the '505 patent\u201d); 6,377,543 (\"the '543 patent\u201d); 6,404,734 (\"the '734 patent\u201d); 6,421,349 (\u201cthe '349 patent\u201d); 6,654,-379 (\"the '379 patent\"); 6,914,880 (\"the '880 patent\u201d); and 7,260,059 (\"the '059 patent\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe TR Labs patents\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b925-7\">. Cisco\u2019s counsel actually pointed to the '379 patent, rather than the '505 patent, but that appears to have been a mistake, albeit an understandable one. There were actually no claim charts submitted in connection with the '379 patent. It was the '505 and '543 patents where the claim charts were submitted, but were void of any reference to Cisco.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-6\">.
