As the responsible party, Buffalo Marine Services, Inc. (\u201cBuffalo\u201d) stipulated to liability and settled most of Unocal\u2019s claims for damages, but the parties proceeded to a bench trial to determine the quantum of Unocal\u2019s lost profits attributable to the spill. On appeal, both parties contend that the district court erred in calculating that amount. Unocal also challenges the court\u2019s decision to deny pre-judgment interest on the damages award for the 20-month period in which it failed diligently to pursue its claims. Finally, Buffalo challenges the court\u2019s decision, under Federal Rule of Evidence 408, to exclude from evidence the National Pollution Fund Center\u2019s (\u201cNPFC\u201d) claim determination. We affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">To calculate damages for lost profits, the district court began by selecting, as a representative sample, the three months on either side of August 2004-the month of the spill. It then calculated the average number of barrels of oil that Unocal\u2019s terminal received monthly during these two periods, then subtracted from that figure the number of barrels actually received that August. Finally, the court multiplied that shortfall by the average profit that Unocal realized on each barrel of oil received.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">The court did not err in applying this methodology. Contrary to Buffalo\u2019s assertion, the \u201creasonable certainty\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with which Unocal was required to prove lost profits did not require it to identify lost opportunities from specific vessels that would have visited the terminal but for its closure following the spill.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Considering figures from adjacent months was more than adequate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And, despite Unocal\u2019s protestations, the court correctly declined to project a banner August for Unocal based on supposed seasonal trends that find no support in the actual numbers. The court\u2019s projection of profits for that August was neither penurious nor extravagant; it was realistic in light of objective data depicting the terminal\u2019s actual business volumes in the months bracketing the month of the spill.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Neither did the district court clearly err in finding that Unocal unduly delayed the prosecution of its claims or abuse its dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>cretion in concluding, based on this delay, that the interests of justice demanded that pre-judgment interest not accrue during such period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court gave Unocal ample opportunity to explain its lengthy silence following its rejection of the claims adjuster\u2019s offer, but Unocal never offered such an explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding from evidence, under Federal Rule of Evidence 408, the NPFC\u2019s determination of the amount of Unocal\u2019s lost profits: Rule 408 renders settlement offers inadmissible for proving or disproving liability or the amount of damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Buffalo could not offer the NPFC\u2019s claim determination as evidence of the appropriate methodology for quantifying damages because selection of the proper methodology was the primary issue in the ease: The final amount of damages would flow directly from that determination. Neither was the NPFC\u2019s determination admissible (1) to show the \u201cshifting nature\u201d of Unocal\u2019s claim before the NPFC\u2014the relevancy of which Buffalo does not explain\u2014or (2) to support Buffalo\u2019s estoppel argument, which, as earlier stipulated, it could not raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
