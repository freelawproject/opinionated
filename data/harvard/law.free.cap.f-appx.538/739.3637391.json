California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Reese has filed a pro se supplemental brief. Reese pleaded guilty to a drug charge and the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed a sentence of 235 months in prison and 6 years of supervised release, after concluding that Reese was a career offender. Counsel argues that the sentence is unreasonable, and Reese argues that the court erred in classifying him as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">We conclude that the district court did not plainly err in determining that Reese is a career offender within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (defendant is career offender if he was at least 18 when he committed instant offense, instant offense is crime of violence or controlled substance offense, and defendant has at least 2 prior felony convictions of crime of violence or controlled substance offense). <em>See United States v. Troyer, </em>677 F.3d 356, 358 (8th Cir.2012) (claim of procedural error not objected to at sentencing is reviewed for plain error); <em>United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (procedural error includes improperly calculating Guidelines range). Reese has a 2004 conviction for assaulting a police officer and interfering with official acts causing bodily injury, and he has a 1998 two-count conviction for possessing cocaine base with intent to deliver, and for delivery of cocaine base. Both the 2004 and the 1998 convictions are predicate offenses, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and (b) (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d), and we reject Reese\u2019s pro se argument that a crime for \u201cdelivery\u201d rather than \u201cdistribution\u201d of a controlled substance is not a predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">As to counsel\u2019s challenge to Reese\u2019s sentence, the district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Reese at the top of the applicable Guidelines range. <em>See Feemster, </em>572 F.3d at 461 (appellate court applies deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review; in reviewing for substantive reasonableness, appellate court may apply presumption of reasonableness to within-Guidelines-range sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">Finally, having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, subject to counsel informing appellant about procedures for seeking rehearing or filing a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-11\">.
