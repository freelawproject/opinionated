Nov. 29, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam). An alien seeking to reopen proceedings is required to file a motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is no dispute that Butta\u2019s motion to reopen, filed in 2011, was untimely, because the BIA issued a final order of removal in Butta\u2019s case in 2005. Butta contends, however, that he has established changed circumstances excusing his untimely motion to reopen, namely, materially worsened conditions in Pakistan for moderate Muslims who reject extremist ideology. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The BIA did not err in declining to credit Butta\u2019s generalized, uncorroborated statements in his affidavit that he is a moderate Muslim in light of the agency\u2019s underlying adverse credibility determination. As Butta notes, we have held that a prior adverse credibility determination does not necessarily preclude a finding of a well-founded fear of persecution when the new claim rests on a factual predicate \u201cindependent of the testimony the [immigration judge] found not to be credible.\u201d <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 154 (2d Cir.2006). However, this does not mean that the prior adverse credibility determination is never relevant to the agency\u2019s assessment of evidence supporting a new asylum claim, as we have also held that the agency may consider prior false documents or testimony in deciding whether to credit \u201c\u2018uncorroborated or unauthenticated evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160 (2d Cir.2007)). Here, the BIA appropriately considered the underlying adverse credibility determination in declining to rely on Butta\u2019s brief, conclusory statement in his affidavit that he was a moderate Muslim who would be persecuted on account of his religion, where he submitted no other corroboration of his religious beliefs. Because evidence of Butta\u2019s religious beliefs was necessary to assess whether he established a material change in conditions that affected his eligibility for asylum, the BIA did not err in finding that Butta did not establish changed circumstances warranting reopening of his proceedings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Butta also argues that the BIA erred in finding, in the alternative, that Butta\u2019s country conditions evidence did not establish changed conditions in Pakistan for a person in his circumstances. While the BIA\u2019s analysis of the country conditions ' evidence does not clearly address whether Butta established materially worsened country conditions for moderate Muslims, <em>see Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 77, 81-82 (2d Cir.2005), we decline to remand on this basis, as the BIA\u2019s finding that Butta\u2019s affidavit was not reliable, and thus that he did not adequately establish his religious beliefs, was dispositive of his motion, and is a sufficient basis for the agency\u2019s decision. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005) (despite error, remand is not required where the agency adopts an \u201calternative and sufficient basis\u201d for its decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
