Madison\u2019s attorney has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>sues, but raising whether the court applied the proper standard in finding the violations, whether a preponderance of the evidence supported the alleged commission of a new crime violation by obstruction of justice, and whether Madison\u2019s sentence is plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke an individual\u2019s supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pregent, </em>190 F.3d 279, 282 (4th Cir.1999). To revoke supervised release, a district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2012); <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). This burden \u201csimply requires the trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mani-gan, </em>592 F.3d 621, 631 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. White, </em>620 F.3d 401, 410 (4th Cir.2010). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if the court reviews all the evidence and \u201cis left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>532 F.3d 326, 336-37 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is not enough for the court to conclude that it would have decided the case differently. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Madison argues that the district court erred by allegedly applying a probable cause standard to determine whether the Government proved the obstruction of justice/commission of a new crime violation instead of the proper preponderance of the evidence standard. This claim is reviewed for plain error because it was not raised below. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428-29, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). He also argues that the evidence was insufficient to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he committed the obstruction of justice violation. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion or plainly err in determining that the Government\u2019s evidence established that Madison violated his supervised release by committing a new crime of obstruction of justice. Madison admitted several other violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">We also discern no error in the district court\u2019s decision to impose a fifteen-month sentence. Madison argues that the district court improperly considered 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors that are not to be considered for a revocation sentence; namely, \u201cto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense[.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2006). He also contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary in light of the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 438-40 (4th Cir.2006). While a district court must consider the Chapter Seven policy statements, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>ch. 7, pt. B (2011), and the statutory requirements and factors applicable to revocation sentences under \u00a7 3553(a) and \u00a7 3583(e) in fashioning a sentence after revoking supervised release, the district court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke the previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>A supervised release revocation sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court considered the Guidelines\u2019 Chapter 7 advisory policy statements and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that it is permitted to consider in a supervised release revocation case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439-40. A revocation sentence is substantively reasonable if the district court stated a proper basis for concluding the defendant should receive the sentence imposed. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. Although the district court need not explain the reasons for imposing a revocation sentence in as much detail as when it imposes an original sentence, \u201cit still must provide a statement of reasons for the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 547 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Only if a sentence is found procedurally or substantively unreasonable will this court \u201cthen decide whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable!)]\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (emphasis omitted). We have reviewed the record and have considered Madison\u2019s arguments and discern no reversible error. We therefore conclude that Madison\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Madison, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Madison requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Madison.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
