Calloway\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious arguments for appeal but raising for the court\u2019s consideration whether Callo-way\u2019s sentence was unconstitutional because of the court\u2019s consideration of the facts, how it applied the Guidelines or how it applied the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 (2006) sentencing factors. Calloway was notified of the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so. The Government did not file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-20\">We review Calloway\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, applying a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We begin by reviewing the sentence for significant procedural error, including improper calculation of the Guidelines range, failure to consider sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), sentencing based on clearly erroneous facts, or failure to adequately explain the sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 51,128 S.Ct. 586. Once we have determined that the sentence is free of significant procedural error, we must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctakfing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the sentence is within the appropriate Guidelines range, we apply a presumption on appeal that the sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2010). Such a presumption is rebutted only when the defendant demonstrates \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-21\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that there was no procedural or substantive error in the imposition of Cal-loway\u2019s sentence. Further, the district court adequately explained the basis for the within-Guidelines sentence based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a), and we conclude that Calloway has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Calloway\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires counsel to inform Calloway, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Calloway requests that a petition be filed but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Calloway. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
