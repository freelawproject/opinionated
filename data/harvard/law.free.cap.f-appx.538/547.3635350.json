He appeals the eight-level sentence enhancement he received pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) for having previously committed an aggravated felony. Because Galvez-Morales\u2019 2010 Texas conviction for assault of a public servant is properly classified as a crime of violence and therefore as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C), we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">In 2010, Galvez-Morales pleaded guilty in Texas to assault of a public servant. A person commits the Texas offense of assault \u201cif the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to another, including the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1). The offense is a felony of the third degree, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cif the offense is committed against a person the actor knows is a public servant while the public servant is lawfully discharging an official duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 22.01(b)(1). Galvez-Morales\u2019 Texas indictment charged that on or about December 3, 2009, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-14\">did unlawfully ... intentionally, knowingly and recklessly cause bodily injury to [the victim] by STRIKING [the victim] WITH DEFENDANT\u2019S HAND and [the victim] was at the time of said offense a public servant, namely: a DALLAS POLICE OFFICER, engaged in the lawful discharge of an official duty and [Galvez] knew that [the victim] was a public servant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">In his judicial confession, Galvez-Morales admitted that he committed the offense \u201cexactly as alleged in the indictment in this cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">On December 20, 2011, Galvez-Morales was arrested by immigration authorities and charged with illegal reentry following deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Galvez-Morales pleaded guilty. The pre-sentence report recommended an eight-level sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) for Galvez-Mor-ales\u2019 2010 Texas conviction for assault of a public servant. The district court agreed, overruling Galvez-Morales\u2019 objection. The district court sentenced Galvez-Morales to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-18\">Galvez-Morales now appeals the district court\u2019s application of the eight-level enhancement to his sentence. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court properly categorized a prior offense as an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Flores-Gallo, </em>625 F.3d 819, 821 (5th Cir.2010). Where, as in the present case, the statute of conviction defines multiple offenses, at least one of which does not describe an aggravated felony, we apply a modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>categorical approach. <em>United States v. Medina-Torres, </em>703 F.3d 770, 774 (5th Cir.2012). Under the modified categorical approach, we may examine the charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of a plea colloquy, or any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented, in order \u201cto determine whether the guilty plea conviction \u2018necessarily\u2019 fell under a particular subsection of the statute that meets the aggravated felony criterion.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>705 F.3d 207, 210-11 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), a defendant convicted of illegal reentry receives an eight-level sentencing enhancement when the defendant was previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony. The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d has the meaning given to the term in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) cmt. 3. Section 1101(a)(43) defines aggravated felony as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of Title 18, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Section 16 defines a crime of violence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. The Texas offense of assault does not satisfy \u00a7 16(a) because it does not have the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force as an element. <em>See United States v. Villegas-Her-nandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 878-79 (5th Cir. 2006). Therefore, Galvez-Morales\u2019 offense will qualify as an aggravated felony only if it constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">\u201cSection 16(b) encompasses crimes that, while capable of being committed without the use of physical force, always entail a substantial risk that physical force\u2014defined as \u2018destructive or violent force\u2019\u2014may be used.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>705 F.3d at 213 (quoting <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 465 (5th Cir.2006)). \u201cA \u2018substantial risk requires a strong probability that the application of physical force during the commission of a crime will occur.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Landeros-Gonzales, </em>262 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Guzman, </em>56 F.3d 18, 20 (5th Cir.1995)). \u201cSection 16(b) sweeps more broadly than \u00a7 16(a).\u201d <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 10, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). It \u201ccovers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It does not, however, encompass merely negligent conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Galvez-Morales\u2019 indictment charged that he \u201cintentionally, knowingly and recklessly cause[d] bodily injury to [the victim] by STRIKING [the victim] WITH DEFENDANT\u2019S HAND,\u201d and he admitted in his plea that he committed the offense \u201cexactly as alleged in the indictment.\u201d Under the modified categorical approach, we may take into account Galvez-Morales\u2019 charging sheet and guilty plea \u201cto pare down [the] statute to determine if a violation of part of the statute constitutes a crime of violence when the statute as a whole categorically does not.\u201d <em>Perez-Munoz v. Keisler, </em>507 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2007). Because Galvez-Morales admitted that he acted intentionally and knowingly to cause bodily injury by striking the victim with his hand, we need not reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the question of whether the offense committed with the lesser <em>mens rea </em>of recklessness would also qualify as a crime of violence pursuant to \u00a7 16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The offense of intentionally and knowingly causing bodily injury to another person involves a substantial risk that a person will use physical force to commit the offense. \u201c[Wjhen analyzing the operative phrase \u2018substantial risk,\u2019 it is not necessary that [the risk] <em>must </em>occur in every instance; rather a substantial risk requires a strong probability that the event, in this case the application of physical force during the commission of the crime, will occur.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>705 F.3d at 213 (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although one can hypothesize scenarios in which a person may intentionally cause bodily injury without resorting to physical force, this is not the proper inquiry. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (holding that for the purpose of defining a violent felony pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), the proper inquiry is whether the offense \u201cin the ordinary case, presents a serious risk of injury to another\u201d). \u201cBeing able to imagine unusual ways the crime could be committed without the use of physical force does hot prevent it from qualifying as a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b).\u201d <em>Perez-Munoz, </em>507 F.3d at 364. With regard to Galvez-Morales\u2019 offense, in the ordinary case, when the defendant is charged with and admits to intentionally and knowingly causing bodily injury to a public servant by striking him with the defendant\u2019s hand, the defendant uses or substantially risks using physical force to commit the offense. Therefore, under the modified categorical approach, Galvez-Morales\u2019 prior conviction assault of a public servant with an intentional, knowing <em>mens rea </em>qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b). Because it is a crime of violence, it therefore qualifies as an aggravated felony for the purpose of \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The district court did not err in assigning an eight-level sentencing enhancement to Galvez-Morales.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">For the aforementioned reasons, we AFFIRM Galvez-Morales\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b576-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
