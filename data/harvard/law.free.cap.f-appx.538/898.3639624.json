Funding, LLC, </em>No. 85255510, 2012 WL 4763146 (T.T.A.B. Sept. 19, 2012). Because the Board\u2019s decision finding the marks generic for the recited services is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b927-20\">Health Science filed applications seeking registration of the marks \u201cPRASTER-ONE.ORG\u201d and \u201cTHE PRASTERONE COMPANY\u201d on the Supplemental Register for services identified as \u201cproviding a website featuring scientific and clinical research information about investigational medical foods, dietary supplements or drugs, namely, prasterone or derivatives or analogs thereof.\u201d The examining attorney refused registration, finding that the proposed marks are generic under Section 23 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">Health Science appealed to the Board, which affirmed the denial of registration. The Board began its analysis \u201cby finding that the genus of services at issue in this case is adequately defined by applicant\u2019s identification of services, namely, \u2018providing a website featuring scientific and clinical research information about investigational medical foods, dietary supplements or drugs, namely, prasterone or derivatives or analogs thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Health Sci. Funding, </em>2012 WL 4763146, at *3. The Board then found that, given the genus of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>services offered, the terms PRASTER-ONE.ORG and THE PRASTERONE COMPANY would be understood by the relevant public primarily to refer to that genus, namely information services regarding prasterone.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The Board analyzed each mark in its entirety by first considering the separate elements of the marks and then finding that the combinations produced no non-generic meaning. The Board found, and Health Science concedes, that prasterone is a generic term for synthetic dehydroe-piandroesterone (DHEA). The Board reasoned that because prasterone is generic for the subject matter of applicant\u2019s services, it is likewise generic for the services themselves. The Board then found that the terms \u201c.org\u201d and \u201ccompany\u201d are themselves generic and without source-identifying significance in the context of those services. Finally, looking to the marks in their entirety, the Board found that the addition of the generic top-level domain \u201c.org\u201d does nothing to convert the otherwise generic term \u201cprasterone\u201d into something more that would allow registration of the PRASTERONE.ORG mark. So too with THE PRASTERONE COMPANY mark, finding that the addition of the article \u201cthe\u201d and the generic word \u201ccompany\u201d to prasterone did not produce a registrable mark. Having found the marks generic, the Board affirmed the refusal to register the marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Whether a particular term is generic is a question of fact. <em>In re Reed Elsevier Props. Inc., </em>482 F.3d 1376, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2007). The Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) bears the burden of establishing that a proposed mark is generic by clear evidence. <em>In re Hotels.com, L.P., </em>573 F.3d 1300, 1302 (Fed.Cir.2009). We review the Board\u2019s genericness finding for substantial evidence, taking into account the PTO\u2019s heightened burden of proof. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">Health Science challenges the Board\u2019s decision on two grounds. First, Health Science vaguely avers that the Board misidentified the genus of services at issue and that there is no evidence that either mark is generic for the correct genus of services. Second, Health Science construes the Board\u2019s opinion as holding that genericness in one class of goods or services is sufficient to establish genericness for another class, which according to Health Science is contrary to our precedent. Neither of these arguments has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">\u201cThe critical issue in genericness cases is whether members of the relevant public primarily use or understand the term sought to be protected to refer to the genus of goods or services in question.\u201d <em>H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int'l Ass\u2019n of Fire Chiefs, Inc., </em>782 F.2d 987, 989-90 (Fed.Cir.1986). Determining a mark\u2019s genericness is \u201ca two-step inquiry: First, what is the genus of goods or services at issue? Second, is the term sought to be registered or retained on the register understood by the relevant public primarily to refer to that genus of goods or services?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">With respect to the first step, Health Science contends that there is no evidence in the record to support a finding that the marks are generic for publication services. This assertion is as true as it is immaterial. The Board did not determine that the services at issue are publication services, but rather found that the services are \u201cproviding a website featuring scientific and clinical research information about investiga-tional medical foods, dietary supplements or drugs, namely, prasterone or derivatives or analogs thereof.\u201d <em>Health Sci. Funding, </em>2012 WL 4763146, at *3. Health Science does not directly challenge this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>finding. Even so, such a challenge would fail as the Board merely adopted Health Science\u2019s own identification of its services. Moreover, as the Board noted, there is no serious contention that Health Science\u2019s services are \u201c \u2018publishing services\u2019 that involve \u2018preparation of the works for online publication, not providing the work itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. at </em>*3 n. 8. Accordingly, we find no error in the Board\u2019s identification of the services at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Health Science also finds fault with the Board\u2019s analysis concerning whether the marks are understood by the relevant public primarily to refer to the identified genus of services. According to Health Science, the Board held that genericness in one class of goods or services is sufficient to establish genericness for another class as a matter of law. It is true that the Board stated that \u201cbecause \u2018prasterone\u2019 is the generic name of one of the items that is the subject matter of applicant\u2019s services, it is likewise generic for the services themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Had the Board ended its analysis there, Health Science might have a point. However, the Board did not stop there.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">To the contrary, the Board looked first to the term \u201cprasterone\u201d in isolation and found that, as the parties agree, it is generic for synthetic DHEA. The Board also found that the generic top-level domain \u201c.org\u201d and the word \u201ccompany\u201d are themselves both generic terms. The Board then looked to the evidence concerning both the generic meaning of prasterone and its use on informational websites. The Board found that \u201cprasterone\u201d is frequently used with websites that provide general information about prasterone and its efficacy in medical use. Finally, the Board, viewing the marks in their entirety, found that the addition of \u201c.org\u201d and \u201ccompany\u201d did nothing to convert the generic term prasterone into something more, something registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Health Science relies heavily on our holding in <em>In re Steelbuilding.com, </em>415 F.3d 1293 (Fed.Cir.2005), arguing that the board erred in relying on genericness in one class of goods or services (i.e. drugs) to establish genericness for another class (i.e. information services). As noted above, the Board analysis was considerably more detailed than Health Science alleges. Moreover, <em>Steelbuilding.com </em>is easily distinguishable. In that case, we reversed because \u201cthe Board erroneously: (1) construed the genus of applicant\u2019s services and goods too narrowly; (2) discounted the ambiguities and multiple meanings in the mark; and (3) dismissed the addition of the TLD indicator despite its expansion of the meaning of \u2018STEELBUILD-ING.COM.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299. Health Science points to no similar errors in the Board\u2019s decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">In fact, the Board\u2019s analysis in the present case largely tracks the analysis we approved in <em>In re Hotels.com, L.P., </em>573 F.3d 1300 (Fed.Cir.2009). In <em>Hotels.com, </em>the Board found that HOTELS.COM is a generic term for hotel information and reservations, and that the \u201cdotcom\u201d shows internet commerce and does not convert the generic term \u201chotels\u201d into a brand name. As they have in this case, the Board addressed the genericness of each of the constituent words and then used the prevalence of \u201chotel.com\u201d or \u201chotels.com\u201d in hotel reservation service websites to find the combination generic. We affirmed, finding the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, including \u201cthe large number of similar uses of \u2018hotels\u2019 with a dot-com suffix, as well as the common meaning and dictionary definition of \u2018hotels\u2019 and the standard usage of \u2018.com\u2019 to show a commercial internet domain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306; <em>see also In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number><em>1800Mattress.com IP, LLC, </em>586 F.3d 1359 (Fed.Cir.2009) (finding \u201cMATTRESS.COM\u201d generic in relation to online retail store services in the field of mattresses was supported by substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">In the present case, as noted above, the Board found that the generic meaning of prasterone was not altered by the use of the generic terms \u201c.org\u201d or \u201ccompany.\u201d Further, the Board relied on evidence showing that \u201cprasterone\u201d is frequently used with websites that provide general information about prasterone and its efficacy in medical use; the very use for which Health Science seeks registration. Health Science fails to show why any of these factual findings lack substantial evi-dentiary support. Indeed, these findings as well as the Board\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the marks are generic are supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
