The petition was referred to a Magistrate Judge on May 10, 2013. The District Attorney was granted an extension of time to file an answer, which is due on or before October 25, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-21\">On September 5, 2013, Short filed the present petition for a writ of mandamus asking us to compel the District Court to adjudicate his habeas petition. Mandamus is a drastic remedy available in only the most extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). Although we may issue a writ of mandamus when a district court\u2019s \u201cundue delay is tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996), there has been no such delay here. The District Attorney has yet to respond to Short\u2019s habeas petition. Once that response is filed, we are confident that the District Court will rule on Short\u2019s habeas petition in a timely manner. Accordingly, we will deny the mandamus petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
