For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-25\">In May 2009, shortly after entering the United States without inspection, Li was served with a notice to appear. Li conceded removability, but sought relief in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>form of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Li claimed that he had previously been persecuted and that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution for failing to comply with China\u2019s family planning policies. He also claimed a well-founded fear of future persecution due to his Christian religion and for having left China illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Li testified in support of his application before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d). In support of his claim of persecution based on resistance to family planning policies, Li testified that he was arrested after a private doctor removed his wife\u2019s intrauterine device so that she could have more children. Li was detained for approximately 24 hours, interrogated about his violation of family planning policies, fed only once, and punched and kicked several times. He did not require medical attention upon release.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In support of his claim of persecution based on his religion, Li testified that while in China he began practicing Christianity in unregistered house churches. Li was not harassed due to his religious practice, but he heard that a fellow church member was arrested and beaten. Li has continued to practice Christianity in the United States. Li testified that if he returned to China he would practice in an unregistered house church, but he fears persecution due to his faith. The documentary evidence Li submitted included the State Department\u2019s 2010 International Religious Freedom Report for China and the State Department\u2019s 2007 Asylum Profile for China.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The IJ denied Li\u2019s requests for relief and ordered his removal to China. Li appealed. Regarding Li\u2019s claim of persecution due to his violation of family planning policies, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings that his detainment and physical abuse did not rise to the level of persecution; the BIA also agreed that Li failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. With respect to Li\u2019s religious persecution claim, the BIA agreed that Li did not allege past persecution. Additionally, the BIA concurred that Li did not show a well-founded fear of future persecution because he did not establish that anyone in China was aware of his religion and he did not establish that there is a pattern of persecution against Christians in China. The BIA also concluded that Li failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured in China. The BIA dismissed Li\u2019s appeal, and he timely filed a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">We have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this instance, because the BIA issued its own opinion on the merits, we review its decision rather than that of the IJ. <em>See Li v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 157, 162 (3d Cir.2005). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Sandie v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>562 F.3d 246, 251 (3d Cir.2009). The BIA\u2019s findings are considered \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). We exercise de novo review over the BIA\u2019s legal decisions. <em>See Sandie, </em>562 F.3d at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>To establish eligibility for asylum, Li needed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1); <em>see also Wang v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 134, 138-39 (3d Cir.2005). A petitioner\u2019s burden to prove eligibility for a grant of withholding of removal is higher than the burden to prove eligibility for asylum: the petitioner must establish a \u201cclear probability\u201d that he would suffer persecution if he returns to his country of nationality. <em>See Ghebrehi-wot v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>467 F.3d 344, 351 (3d Cir.2006). To be eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT, Li needed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to China. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Li argues that he has shown past persecution on the basis of his opposition to family planning policies, which resulted in his detainment, interrogation, and beating. While abhorrent, not all \u201charassment and discrimination\u201d necessarily rises to the level of persecution contemplated by the asylum statute. <em>Wong v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>539 F.3d 225, 236 (3d Cir.2008), <em>abrogated on other grounds by, Nbaye v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>665 F.3d 57 (3d Cir.2011). \u201c[Pjersecution connotes extreme behavior, including \u2018threats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u2019\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 214, 217 (3d Cir.2003). The BIA correctly concluded that Li\u2019s brief detainment and beating, which did not result in serious injuries, did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Kibinda v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>477 F.3d 113, 119 (3d Cir.2007) (holding that a five-day detention and beating that required stitches and left a scar did not constitute persecution); <em>Voci v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 607, 615 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201c[0]ur cases suggest that isolated incidents that do not result in serious injury do not rise to the level of persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Substantial evidence likewise supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Li failed to show that he possesses a well-founded fear of future persecution due to his opposition to China\u2019s family planning policies. Li argues that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution to the family planning policy because the Government did not rebut the presumption afforded him. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1); <em>see also Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 174 (3d Cir.2003). Li does not receive the benefit of that presumption, however, because he did not demonstrate past persecution. <em>See Lukwago, </em>329 F.3d at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution in China based on his opposition to family planning policies, Li was required to show a subjective fear of persecution, supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility. <em>See Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 592 (3d Cir.2003). The evidence in the record shows that, despite Li\u2019s claim of other resistance to the family planning policy, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), Chinese officials have not sought to arrest or punish him. Thus, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Li has not established a well-founded fear of persecution based on his other resistance to family planning policies. <em>See Abdulrah-man, </em>330 F.3d at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Regarding Li\u2019s religious persecution claim, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Li failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. Li did not allege past persecution on the basis of his religion. Li can show an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution by showing either that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>would be individually selected for persecution or by demonstrating a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution of Christians in China. <em>See Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 536 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A)). The documentary evidence, including the 2010 International Religious Freedom Report and the 2007 Asylum Profile, shows that there are millions of Christians worshipping in unregistered house churches in China and that some are persecuted. The frequency of persecution varies greatly by region, however, and often only church leaders or proselytizers are targeted. Li has not alleged that he is or is likely to become a church leader or proselytizer, nor has he shown that officials are aware of his religious belief. Further, although Li claimed that church members in his hometown were persecuted, his testimony and affidavits in support of this claim did not identify specific members persecuted or provide supporting evidence. Li also did not show that persecution was pervasive or widespread. <em>See, e.g., Lie, </em>396 F.3d at 537. Accordingly, the record before us does not compel a contrary outcome to the BIA\u2019s rejection of this claim. <em>See Yu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 346, 349 (3d Cir.2008) (\u201cThis Court has repeatedly recognized that State Department reports may constitute substantial evidence.\u201d). Because Li did not meet the standard for obtaining asylum, he also failed to satisfy the \u201chigher burden of proof\u2019 required for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>676 F.3d 112, 117 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Finally, in order to be eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT, Li needed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to China. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). Li has not shown that the record compels a finding that he would likely be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, the Chinese government if removed to China. <em>See Kaita v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>522 F.3d 288, 300 (3d Cir.2008) (noting that eligibility for relief under CAT is based wholly on objective evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\">. Li did not argue before the BIA that the IJ erred in finding that he failed to establish eligibility for relief on the basis of his illegal departure. Because Li did not present this claim to the BIA and did not argue it in his brief in support of his petition for review, the claim is waived. <em>See Garcia v. Att'y Gen., </em>665 F.3d 496, 502 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
