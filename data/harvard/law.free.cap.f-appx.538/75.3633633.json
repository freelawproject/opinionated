Schoppert, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Wu Sun, </em>No. A089 091 842 (B.I.A. July 21, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A089 091 842 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 8, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">In evaluating Sun\u2019s credibility regarding his testimony that he suffered past harm and feared future harm in China on account of his Christian faith and opposition to China\u2019s family planning policy, the IJ found that: (1) Sun\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his credible fear interview with respect to his girlfriend\u2019s name, whether he had been threatened or harmed on account of his religion, and whether he had ever been arrested in China; (2) Sun\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his asylum application with respect to the manner in which he escaped from a hospital room allegedly guarded by four security officers; and (3) Sun\u2019s testimonial account of his alleged hospital escape was implausible. Sun does not challenge these findings, which stand as valid bases for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">The agency also did not err in finding that the evidence Sun submitted was insufficient to rehabilitate his otherwise incredible testimony. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007). Specifically, the agency was not required to credit letters from Sun\u2019s girlfriend, mother, and friend in China. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341-42 (2d Cir.2006) (recognizing that the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence in immigration proceedings lies largely within the discretion of the agency); <em>Matter of H-L-H- &amp; Z-Y-Z-, 25 </em>I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 209, 215 (BIA 2010) (giving diminished evidentiary weight to \u201cletters from relatives and friends,\u201d who were \u201cinterested witnesses ... not subject to cross examination\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, </em>677 F.3d 130 (2d Cir.2012). Sun\u2019s argument that these witnesses were not, in fact, biased in his favor does not compel the conclusion that the IJ erroneously disregarded this evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">The agency also reasonably afforded little probative weight to the letter from Sun\u2019s pastor confirming that Sun regularly attends church in the United States, because it did not bolster Sun\u2019s testimony that he had been persecuted in <em>China </em>on account of his religion. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342. Finally, the agency\u2019s determination that Sun\u2019s remaining evidence-which included an abortion certificate, birth certificates, household registry card, resident identification cards, and a Chinese church certificate\u2014was of little probative value is entitled to deference, given that the evidence was unauthenticat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ed and Sun\u2019s credibility already was questionable. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d at 149 (affording IJs \u201cconsiderable flexibility in determining the authenticity of\u2019 proffered documentary evidence and in evaluating such documents when \u201cmaking an overall assessment of the credibility of a petitioner\u2019s testimony and, ultimately, of her persecution claim\u201d); <em>Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 149 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in discrediting a purported village notice where the document was not authenticated and the alien had been found not credible by the IJ); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Ultimately, in light of the fact that Sun does not challenge the agency\u2019s inconsistency and implausibility findings, and given the agency\u2019s discretion as to the weight attributed to the corroborating evidence, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008). The adverse credibility determination is dispositive of Sun\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, as those claims are predicated on the same facts. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
