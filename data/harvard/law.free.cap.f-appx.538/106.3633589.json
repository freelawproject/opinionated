Nov. 3, 2011), <em>ajfg </em>No. A099 880 102 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 11, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). Because Huang does not challenge the agency\u2019s determination that his asylum application was untimely, we consider only the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">For applications such as Huang\u2019s, governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(C); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). An agency\u2019s credibility determination, however, will not satisfy the substantial evidence standard \u201cwhen it is based entirely on flawed reasoning, bald speculation, or conjecture.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">While the agency\u2019s finding that Huang should have mentioned his Falun Gong practice in his visa application because it shares artistic similarities with his martial arts practice is arguably impermissibly speculative, <em>see Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007), remand is not warranted as the alternative bases for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding are supported by substantial evidence and the totality of the circumstances supports the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167; <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 338-39. The agency reasonably declined to credit Huang\u2019s explanations for why he sought advance parole to travel to China if he feared the Chinese government because Huang gave conflicting explanations, stating first that he wanted to travel to China but his advance parole application was denied, and then stating that he withdrew his travel application because it was too dangerous to return to China. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so). The adverse credibility determination is further supported by the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding, which was based in part on Huang\u2019s inconsistency, as well as on additional observations of non-responsive answers, and we defer to that finding. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Finally, the agency does not err in relying on a lack of corroboration as grounds for an adverse credibility determination where, as in this case, the alien\u2019s credibility already has been called into question. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007). Because Huang did not challenge the IJ\u2019s corroboration finding before the BIA and does not challenge it here, the finding stands as a valid basis for the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146-47 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Therefore, given the inconsistent explanations, the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding, and the lack of corroboration, the totality of the circumstances supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(C); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Because the only evidence of a threat to Huang\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination necessarily precludes success on his claims for both withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
