We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata, <em>Stewart v. U.S. Bancorp, </em>297 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>The district court properly dismissed Link\u2019s action because Link alleged nearly identical claims arising out of the same facts against the same defendants in a prior action in which the court entered a final judgment on the merits. <em>See Link v. California, 895 </em>Fed.Appx. 383 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Stewart, </em>297 F.3d at 956-57 (setting forth elements of the doctrine of res judicata, and noting that \u201cdismissal for failure to state a claim\u201d constitutes a final judgment to which res judicata applies).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Link\u2019s contentions regarding the alleged impropriety of giving preclusive effect to the prior judgment as to claims that Link failed to allege in that action are contrary to established law. <em>See id. </em>at 956 (noting that res judicata bars subsequent litigation of claims that were raised, or could have been raised, in a prior action).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Because we affirm dismissal on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata, we need not address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the alternate grounds relied upon by the district court to support its judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Link\u2019s contentions regarding the district court\u2019s denial of his motions to recuse are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b829-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
