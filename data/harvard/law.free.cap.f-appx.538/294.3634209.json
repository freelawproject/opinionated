We conclude that the record evidence does not compel a ruling contrary to any of the administrative factual findings, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006), and that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Perlera-Sola v. Holder, </em>699 F.3d 572, 577 (1st Cir.2012) (finding that although the immigration judge deemed alien\u2019s testimony to be credible, it was not specific enough to support asylum claim \u201cgiven Mr. Perlera\u2019s failure to identify any of the assailants and more importantly, their motives for attacking\u201d). We further uphold the Board\u2019s finding that Escobar-Almaraz\u2019s Convention Against Torture claim was too speculative to warrant relief. <em>See In re J.F.F., </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 912, 917-18 (A.G.2006) (stating that a petitioner may not establish a claim for CAT relief merely by stringing together a series of suppositions to show that it is more likely than not that torture will result where the evidence does not establish that each step in the hypothetical chain of events is more likely than not to occur).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Escobar-Almaraz </em>(B.I.A. Nov. 13, 2012). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
