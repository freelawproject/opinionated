We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s removal order because Kattaura\u2019s admissions before the IJ establish that he is removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii) due to his conviction for possession for sale of a controlled substance under California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11378. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (eliminating appellate jurisdiction to review removal orders predicated on aggravated felonies); <em>see also Pagayon v. Holder, </em>675 F.3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (holding that a petitioner\u2019s pleading-stage admissions and concessions may be sufficient to establish removability). Kattaura\u2019s claim that he did not receive the same treatment as another alien with the same conviction is not sufficiently colorable to invoke our jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cTo be colorable in this context, the alleged violation need not be substantial, but the claim must have some possible validity.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-21\">We also lack jurisdiction to consider Kattaura\u2019s claim that the IJ failed to timely provide him with copies of the record relating to his conviction, because he failed to exhaust this claim before the BIA. <em>See Tijani v. Holder, </em>628 F.3d 1071, 1080 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-22\">We deny Kattaura\u2019s request to supplement the administrative record. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b782-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
