P\u2019ship for Children\u2019s Rights, </em>No. 10 Civ. 5167(CBA), 2012 WL 4503415 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2012). Pastor also appeals from the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of her motion to re-open discovery regarding the Partnership\u2019s number of employees. <em>See </em>Discovery Order, <em>Pastor v. P\u2019ship for Children\u2019s Rights, </em>No. 10 Civ. 5167(LB) (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2012), ECF No. 37. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, affirming if \u201cthere are no genuine issues of material fact and [ ] the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). We review a district court\u2019s discovery rulings for abuse of discretion, bearing in mind that a \u201cdistrict court has broad discretion to manage pretrial discovery.\u201d <em>Wood v. FBI, </em>432 F.3d 78, 84 (2d Cir.2005). The District Court considered Pastor\u2019s arguments that various volunteers, interns, board members, and others constituted employees within the meaning of Title VII and the ADA, and concluded, based on the undisputed facts, that they did not. We affirm the grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>summary judgment for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s memorandum and order of September 28, 2012.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We further conclude that the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion in her January 30, 2012 order denying Pastor\u2019s motion to reopen discovery on the basis that the documents in question did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">We have considered all of Pastor\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-14\">. To the extent Pastor argues for the first time on appeal that bookkeeper Alvin Linton and other unnamed individuals from \"Accountst-emps\" should be counted as employees, we decline to consider that argument. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120-21, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
