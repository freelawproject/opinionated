The district court sentenced Simmons to fifty-seven months of imprisonment and he now appeals. Appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the sentence was reasonable. Simmons filed a supplemental pro se brief raising additional issues.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-22\">Counsel questions whether the sentence is procedurally reasonable, arguing that the district court implicitly presumed the advisory Guidelines to be reasonable. We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Layton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 335 (4th Cir.2009). In so doing, we examine the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d including \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2006) ] factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-23\">Although a sentencing court may not apply a presumption of reasonableness to the advisory Guidelines, <em>see Nelson v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 350, 352, 129 S.Ct. 890, 172 L.Ed.2d 719 (2009), we will presume on appeal that a sentence within a properly calculated advisory Guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 346-56, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentence). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that the sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>We have examined the entire record in accordance with the requirements of <em>An-ders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Simmons, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Simmons requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Simmons. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-19\"> We have thoroughly considered the arguments raised in Simmons' pro se supplemental brief and conclude that they lack merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
