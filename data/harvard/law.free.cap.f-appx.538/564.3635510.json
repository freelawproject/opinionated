Aguirre contends that the district court\u2019s imposition of a three-year term of supervised release was procedurally and substantively unreasonable in light of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 recommendation that a court ordinarily should not impose a term of supervised release on a deportable alien unless supervised release would provide additional deterrence and protection based on the facts of the case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) cmt. n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-21\">As Aguirre challenges the imposition of the term of supervised release for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012). Under the plain error standard, Aguirre must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If Aguirre makes such a showing, we have discretion to correct the error but should do so only if the error seriously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Aguirre has failed to show procedural or substantive error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s imposition of a term of supervised release. The district court\u2019s comments during the sentencing hearing regarding Aguirre\u2019s extensive criminal history of domestic violence and his propensity to commit future violent crimes satisfied the procedural requirement for a \u201cparticularized explanation and concern [that] would justify imposition of a term of supervised release.\u201d <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 330. Aguirre\u2019s assertion that the district court committed substantive error by failing to account for \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) and the statutory sentencing factors reflecting the goals of rehabilitation, monitoring, and training is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness applicable to Aguirre\u2019s within-guidelines term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d 601, 607-08 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
