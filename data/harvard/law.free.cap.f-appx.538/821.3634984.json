We review de novo the denial of the motion but review for clear error the underlying findings of fact. <em>United States v. Basher, </em>629 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir.2011). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-23\">1. Reasonable suspicion justified the traffic stop. The officers\u2019 testimony, which was credited and not contradicted, established a traffic violation, which suffices to justify a stop. <em>United States v. Miranda-Guerena, </em>445 F.3d 1233, 1236 (9th Cir.2006). The officers also had a reasonable suspicion that Defendant was transporting drugs, based on a detailed and reliable informant\u2019s tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-24\">2. The district court did not clearly err, <em>United States v. Washington, </em>490 F.3d 765, 769 (9th Cir.2007), in finding that Defendant voluntarily consented to the search. Several facts support the finding that she was not coerced, including advice that Defendant could withdraw her consent at any time, her retention of the keys to her vehicle, and the absence of potentially intimidating measures such as handcuffs or displayed firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b849-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
