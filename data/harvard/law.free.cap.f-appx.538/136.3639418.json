For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-23\">Cardona\u2019s habeas petition, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, was denied on July 6, 2011. Since then, he has attempted to reopen the judgment at least five times. This appeal stems from his sixth unsuccessful attempt, filed on April 15, 2013. He relied on Rule 60(b)(2), claiming that he had newly discovered evidence that would warrant relief from the District Court\u2019s order denying his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-24\">Motions brought under Rule 60(b)(2) must be filed \u201cno more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c). Cardona\u2019s motion was filed nearly two years after the entry of judgment, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying it as untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Brown </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth., </em>350 F.3d 338, 342 (3d Cir.2003). There being no substantial question presented on appeal, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-14\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We may summarily affirm the decision of the District Court if no substantial question is presented on appeal. 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-27\">. As he did in the District Court, Cardona argues that his previous appeal to us tolled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the one-year deadline. As the District Court explained, (Dkt. No. 42, p. 4), it did not. <em>See Hancock Indus. v. Schaeffer, </em>811 F.2d 225, 239 (3d Cir.1987). The District Court also determined that Cardona\u2019s motion was merit-less, an issue we need not discuss, given its untimeliness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
