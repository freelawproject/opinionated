We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">The BIA denied Arman\u2019s untimely motion to reopen after finding that he failed to establish prima facie eligibility for relief. In doing so, the BIA found that, even under a disfavored group analysis, Arman failed to establish sufficient individualized risk of persecution to warrant relief, and also that Arman failed to provide any evidence that his children would be harmed. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Arman\u2019s motion. <em>See id. </em>at 986 (BIA can deny a motion to reopen on \u201cany one of \u2018at least\u2019 three independent grounds,\u201d including \u201cfailure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought\u201d); <em>see also Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 978-79 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">In light of our previous conclusion in <em>Arman v. Holder, </em>No. 07-71553, 2010 WL 1986196 (9th Cir. May 18, 2010), we do not address Arman\u2019s argument that he has demonstrated that harm to his wife due to her Chinese ethnicity constitutes a pattern of persecution tied to Arman.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">Finally, we reject Arman\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to consider the evidence of harm suffered by his in-laws. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must overcome the presumption that the agency has considered all the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b793-11\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
