We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Avagyan v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 672, 674 (9th Cir.2011), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Flores Cruz\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where the motion was filed nearly twelve years after his removal order became final, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Flores Cruz failed to show the due diligence required for equitable tolling of the filing deadline, <em>see Ava-gyan, </em>646 F.3d at 679 (equitable tolling is available to a petitioner who is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud or error, and exercised due diligence in discovering such circumstances). Contrary to Flores Cruz\u2019s contention, the BIA did not create a per se rule when finding he failed to show the requisite due diligence. <em>See id. </em>(assessing the exercise of due diligence includes \u201cascertain[ing] ... if petitioner is ignorant of counsel\u2019s shortcomings, whether petitioner made reasonable efforts to pursue relief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In light of our determination, we do not reach Flores Cruz\u2019s contention regarding the absence of a complete record from the 1998 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b786-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
