The district court sentenced him to concurrent sentences of 57 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release and 36 months of imprisonment and one year of supervised release. In a related case, the district court revoked Valdez\u2019s term of supervised release arising from a prior illegal reentry conviction, and it sentenced him to a consecutive sentence of 24 months of imprisonment with no further term of supervised release. Valdez filed notices of appeal from both judgments, and the cases were consolidated on appeal. However, as Valdez has failed to raise any challenge to his supervised release revocation and resulting sentence, he has abandoned those issues on appeal. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-20\">According to Valdez, the district court\u2019s imposition of terms of supervised release was procedurally and substantively unreasonable in light of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 recommendation that a court ordinarily should not impose a term of supervised release on a deportable alien unless supervised release would provide additional deterrence and protection based on the facts of the case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c), comment, (n. 5). As Valdez challenges the imposition of the terms of supervised release for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012). Under the plain error standard, Valdez must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If Valdez makes such a showing, we have discretion to correct the error but should do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">The district court\u2019s imposition of terms of supervised release did not constitute procedural or substantive error, plain or otherwise. The district court\u2019s discussion at sentencing of Valdez\u2019s long criminal history and admitted substance abuse problem satisfied the procedural requirement for a \u201cparticularized explanation and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>cern [that] would justify imposition of a term of supervised release.\u201d <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 330. Moreover, we have held that implicit consideration of \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) is sufficient. <em>United States v. Becerril-Pena, </em>714 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2013). \u201cThe amendments, after all, did not alter our highly deferential review of within-Guidelines sentences,\u201d which requires the application of \u201ca baseline infer[ence] that the [district] judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Becerril-Pena, </em>714 F.3d at 350 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Valdez\u2019s assertion that the district court committed substantive error by failing to account for \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) and the statutory sentencing factors of rehabilitation and monitoring is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness applicable to Valdez\u2019s within-guidelines terms of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d 601, 607-08 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b520-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
