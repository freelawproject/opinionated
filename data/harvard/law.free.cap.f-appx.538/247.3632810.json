We grant the petition for review, vacate the Board\u2019s decision, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">We review the Board\u2019s and the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and \u201cindepen-dentfly] review ... the record to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 207-08 (4th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla\u2019; it is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). In conducting this review, we confine ourselves to the grounds on which the Board based its decision. <em>Daniels Co. v. Mitchell, </em>479 F.3d 321, 329 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-16\">Subject to the substantial evidence requirement, we defer to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations and \u201cevaluation of the proper weight to accord conflicting medical opinions.\u201d <em>Harman Mining Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>678 F.3d 305, 310 (4th Cir.2012). The ALJ is not bound to accept any medical expert opinion but \u201cmust evaluate the evidence, weigh it, and draw his own conclusions,\u201d giving consideration to \u201cthe qualifications of the experts, the opinions\u2019 reasoning, their reliance on objectively determinable symptoms and established science, their detail of analysis, and their freedom from irrelevant distractions and prejudices.\u201d <em>Underwood v. Elkay Mining, Inc., </em>105 F.3d 946, 949, 951 (4th Cir.1997), <em>superseded on other grounds as stated in Elm Grove Coal Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>480 F.3d 278, 287 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-17\">Because this is a subsequent claim, Fortner was required to first demonstrate a change in \u201cone of the applicable conditions of entitlement\u201d since the last denial of benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.309(d) (2013); <em>see Milburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir.1998) (enumerating conditions of entitlement); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.201 to 204 (2013) (same). The ALJ had most recently denied Fortner benefits after finding that he failed to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>that he suffered from a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">A miner may prove that he is totally disabled due to a respiratory or pulmonary condition in one of four ways, only two of which are relevant here: qualifying arterial blood gas studies and well-documented and well-reasoned physician\u2019s opinions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(2)(ii), (iv). \u201cThe miner can establish total disability upon a mere showing of evidence that satisfies any one of the four alternative methods, but only f[i]n the absence of contrary probative evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lane v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>105 F.3d 166, 171 (4th Cir.1997) (quoting language now codified in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(2)). Thus, if the ALJ finds that the miner has met his burden with evidence under one of the \u00a7 718.204(b)(2) prongs, the ALJ must examine the record for contrary probative evidence and, if there is such contrary evidence, assign it \u201cappropriate weight and determine whether it outweighs the evidence that supports a finding of total disability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">After considering the newly-submitted evidence, the ALJ concluded that Fortner demonstrated that he suffered from a totally disabling respiratory condition based on the results of the arterial blood gas studies and the medical opinions, and that there was no probative contrary evidence in the record. Thus, the ALJ allowed the subsequent claim to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In the petition for review, Employer does not dispute the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the newly-submitted arterial blood gas studies qualified Fortner as totally disabled due to a respiratory impairment. However, Employer contends that the ALJ erred by rejecting Dr. Kirk Hippen-steel\u2019s opinion when evaluating the medical opinions related to total disability, because the ALJ failed to explain his reasons for discrediting the physician and engaged in \u201chead counting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">We agree with Employer\u2019s contention. As Employer noted, we have rejected the practice of \u201ccounting heads\u201d as \u201chollow.\u201d <em>Adkins v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>958 F.2d 49, 52 (4th Cir.1992); <em>accord Sterling Smokeless Coal Co. v. Akers, </em>131 F.3d 438, 440-41 (4th Cir.1997) (finding that ALJ erred \u201c[b]y resolving the conflict of medical opinion solely on the basis of the number of physicians supporting the respective parties\u201d); <em>Sahara Coal Co. v. Fitts, </em>39 F.3d 781, 782-83 (7th Cir.1994) (vacating and remanding decision of ALJ that appeared to be based upon numerical count of experts). This is precisely what the ALJ did in this case. While finding that each of the physicians\u2019 opinions was probative, well-reasoned, and well-documented, and that each physician was a well-qualified pulmonologist, the ALJ simply decided that the \u201cconsensus\u201d of Fortner\u2019s two physicians outweighed Dr. Hippensteel\u2019s opinion, without further explanation. <em>See Milburn Colliery Co., </em>138 F.3d at 534 (finding that ALJ erred by failing to explain rejection of evidence of miner\u2019s other medical conditions as cause of total disability). Thus, the Board\u2019s order affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision that Fortner was totally disabled due to a respiratory condition as supported by substantial evidence cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Because we have concluded that the ALJ improperly discredited Dr. Hippen-steel\u2019s opinion on the grounds that he was outnumbered, we also conclude that substantial evidence does not support his conclusion that Fortner established that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>suffered from a totally disabling respiratory condition. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.204(b)(2); <em>Lane, </em>105 F.3d at 171. Thus, the ALJ erred in finding that Fort-ner demonstrated a change in applicable condition of entitlement, as required by \u00a7 725.309(d), and allowing the subsequent claim to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Accordingly, we grant Employer\u2019s petition for review, vacate the Board\u2019s order affirming the ALJ\u2019s award of benefits, and remand to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the ALJ certainly may reach the same conclusion after properly weighing the evidence; however, he must fully explain that decision in accordance with the substantial evidence standard. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would, not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-12\">. Upon review of the record, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over Employer\u2019s petition for review. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) (2006); 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a); <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v.
