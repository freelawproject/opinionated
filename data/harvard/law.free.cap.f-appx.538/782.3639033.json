We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-22\">Ferguson brought suit against Wells Fargo under a provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b), for failing to accurately report to TransUnion that there was no bankruptcy on his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-23\">Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b), a fur-nisher of credit information must investigate and report \u201c[ajfter receiving notice ... of a dispute with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information provided by a person to a consumer reporting agency.\u201d Here, Wells Fargo furnished information about Wells Fargo accounts to TransUnion, the credit reporting agency, either originally, in response to TransUnion\u2019s inquiry, or both. Ferguson disputed to TransUnion the completeness and accuracy of the information about his Wells Fargo account. Because Ferguson in fact disputed that account, Wells Fargo was obligated to reasonably investigate and accurately report its findings back to TransUnion.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-24\">The district court erred by granting summary judgment because there are gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>uine disputes of fact as to whether Wells Fargo accurately reported the account. <em>See Gorman v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, LLP, </em>584 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir.2009) (summary judgment is only appropriate where there are \u201cno genuine disputes of material fact\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). In particular, there is a dispute as to whether it was correct for Wells Fargo to leave the Consumer Information Index space blank instead of entering the Q code on the form it sent to TransUnion.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">The district court did not reach Wells Fargo\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment on the issue of willfulness and we leave that motion for the district court to rule on in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of Wells Fargo\u2019s motion for summary judgment and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b810-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
