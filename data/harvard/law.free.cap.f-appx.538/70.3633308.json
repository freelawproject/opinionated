Rohan, which denied their application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Bing Yan Li &amp; Shu Qi Wu </em>Nos. A089 908 328/329 (B.I.A. Feb. 2, 2012), <em>ajfg </em>Nos. A089 908 328/329 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 14, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). For applications such as the petitioners\u2019, governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, \u201c[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances, ... base a credibility determination on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant,\u201d or any inconsistency or omission in an applicant\u2019s statements, \u201cwithout regard to whether the inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">The petitioners challenge the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, in which the agency discredited their testimony based on their hesitant or non-responsive demeanor and contradictions regarding the time, circumstances, and location of their practice of Falun Gong. The petitioners do not dispute the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding, but contend that the agency faded to credit their explanations\u2014that Li was nervous and Wu was \u201cnot in a right state of mind.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>However, the petitioners\u2019 argument misapprehends the \u201cparticular deference\u201d afforded to an assessment of demeanor, <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005), because demeanor is \u201cparadigmatically the sort of evidence that a fact-finder is best positioned to evaluate,\u201d <em>Li Zu Guan v. INS, </em>453 F.3d 129, 139-40 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir.2005)). Even assuming the petitioners\u2019 explanations for their demeanor were plausible, where the demeanor findings were not based on a misstatement of the record, but rather were \u201ctethered to the evidentiary record,\u201d <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007), the petitioners \u201cmust do more than offer a plausible explanation ... to secure relief; [they] must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit [their] testimony,\u201d <em>Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Accordingly, the petitioners\u2019 explanations for their poor demeanor are inadequate to overcome the \u201cparticular deference\u201d due to those findings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The petitioners also contend that the IJ failed to consider the totality of the circumstances regarding their explanations for their discrepant testimony. During the merits hearing, Wu testified that he and Li practiced Falun Gong together in parks, contradicting Li\u2019s testimony, but later testified that Li did not practice Falun Gong in parks. Wu explained his inconsistent testimony by stating that he \u201cprobably forgot [he] said that.\u201d However, this explanation was inadequate to compel a reasonable factfinder to credit his testimony because it does not explain his inconsistent statements if he was testifying truthfully. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81. In their brief, the petitioners also explain Wu\u2019s further inconsistent testimony that he last practiced Falun Gong at 2:00 in the afternoon, whereas Li testified it was between 5:00 or 6:00 in the evening\u2014by asserting that Wu\u2019s time was only an estimation. Similarly, this explanation is inadequate to compel a contrary conclusion because it fails to address other inconsistent aspects of his testimony\u2014the discrepancy between his and Li\u2019s testimony regarding what their children were doing while they were practicing Falun Gong\u2014 and is otherwise insufficiently compelling to require a reasonable fact-finder to credit it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Accordingly, the agency properly grounded its adverse credibility determination on those inconsistencies. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167 (the agency \u201cmay rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes the asylum applicant is not credible\u201d) (emphasis in original) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii)); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (providing that \u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d). Given these inconsistency and demeanor findings, the totality of the circumstances supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167, which is dispositive of petitioners\u2019 application for withholding of removal, <em>see Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
