Because Susinka is actually attempting to relitigate a sentencing argument that he lost on direct appeal, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Susinka was convicted in 2009 for his role in a racketeering conspiracy, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d), and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. At that time he had been in state custody since 2002 on convictions for delivery of cocaine and unlawful use of a firearm. The district court ordered the federal term to run concurrently with Susinka\u2019s state sentence, and on direct appeal Susinka argued that the district court had intended the federal and state sentences to be \u201cfully concurrent\u201d to assure that all of the time he already had served in state prison would be counted toward his federal term. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>617 F.3d 958, 960-62 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. McNeil, </em>573 F.3d 479, 484 (7th Cir.2009). We disagreed with his interpretation of the district judge\u2019s pronouncement and concluded that the judge gave Susinka \u201cboth federal and state credit for time served after the federal sentence was imposed, but no more.\u201d <em>United States v. Benabe, </em>436 Fed.Appx. 639, 661 (7th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Susinka\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition rests on the false premise that the sentencing judge, in ordering concurrent sentences, meant for him to be credited with all time served since 2002. We already have explained to Susinka that his understanding of the judge\u2019s sentencing intent is wrong, and our conclusion should have been the end of his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
