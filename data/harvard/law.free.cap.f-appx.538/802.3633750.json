R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b830-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-23\">California state prisoner Keith Kemp appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging violations of various rights stemming from his placement in segregated housing. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>315 F.3d 1108, 1117 (9th Cir.2003). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-24\">The district court properly dismissed Kemp\u2019s claims alleging improper classifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>tion and retaliatory transfer because Kemp failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit. <em>See Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 85, 93-95, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006) (holding that \u201cproper exhaustion\u201d is mandatory and requires adherence to administrative procedural rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Because Kemp does not raise any arguments regarding the district court\u2019s dismissal of the remaining counts of his Sixth Amended Complaint, he waives any such challenge on appeal. <em>See Greenwood v. FAA, </em>28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe review only issues which are argued specifically and distinctly in a party\u2019s opening brief. We will not manufacture arguments for an appellant, and a bare assertion does not preserve a claim.... \u201d (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Kemp\u2019s untimely motion for an extension of time to oppose defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>See Ahanchian v. Xenon Pictures, Inc., </em>624 F.3d 1253, 1258-59 (9th Cir.2010) (setting forth the standard of review for extension requests.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Kemp\u2019s motion for reconsideration because Kemp failed to establish grounds for such relief. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir.1993) (setting forth the standard of review and grounds for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Kemp\u2019s contention that the district court improperly denied his motions for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order requesting access to the prison law library and legal assistance is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b830-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
