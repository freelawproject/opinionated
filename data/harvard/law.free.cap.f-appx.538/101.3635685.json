This newly-designated District Judge shall implement this Court\u2019s mandate staying all proceedings and otherwise await further action by the Court of Appeals on the merits of the ongoing appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In taking these actions, we intimate no view on the substance or merits of the pending appeals, which have yet to be fully briefed and argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The mandate shall ISSUE FORTHWITH for the sole purpose of implementation of this Order and shall otherwise remain in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In the interest of judicial economy, any question, application, or further appeal regarding the scope of this Order or its implementation shall be directed to this panel, which will hear the case on the merits in due course.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-14\">. In a proceeding on December 21, 2007 involving the parties in <em>Daniels v. City of New York, </em>No. 99 Civ. 1695, 2001 WL 228091 (S.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 8, 1999), the District Judge stated, \"[I]f you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in a good constitutional case, why don't you bring a lawsuit? You can certainly mark it as related.\u201d She also stated, \"[WJhat I am trying to say, I am sure I am going to get in trouble for saying it, for $65 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>you can bring that lawsuit.\u201d She concluded the proceeding by noting, \"And as I said before, I would accept it as a related case, which the plaintiff has the power to designate.\u201d Two of the attorney groups working on behalf of plaintiffs in <em>Daniels, </em>a case challenging the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk practices, helped file <em>Floyd </em>the next month. <em>See generally </em>Joseph Goldstein, A <em>Court Rule Directs Cases Over Friskings to One Judge, </em>N.Y.
