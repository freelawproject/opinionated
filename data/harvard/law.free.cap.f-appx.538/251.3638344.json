In addition, Noshafagh sought to pursue a state law claim for invasion of privacy. On appeal, Noshafagh challenges the court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. <em>See Noshafagh v. Leggett, </em>No. 8:ll-cv-8038, 2013 WL 93345 (D.Md. Jan. 7, 2013), ECF No. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">After a careful review of the various briefs, the appellate record, and the applicable legal principles, we are compelled to conclude that the district court did not err in awarding summary judgment to the defendants. We are therefore satisfied to affirm on the well-reasoned opinion of the district court, as filed on January 7, 2013. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before our court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
