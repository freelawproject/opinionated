Hood alleged in his complaint, and contends on appeal, that prison officials violated the Eighth Amendment by acting with deliberate indifference to his medical needs when they denied him doctor-prescribed Phenobarbital and entered false information in his medical chart regarding his allergies to drugs. The district court dismissed Hood\u2019s complaint as frivolous, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. We review such a dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-21\">Pursuant to the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, prisoners are entitled to receive \u201cadequate medical care.\u201d <em>Easter v. Powell, </em>467 F.3d 459, 463 (5th Cir.2006). To meet the \u201cextremely high standard\u201d of deliberate indifference, Hood had to establish that prison officials \u201crefused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-22\">Hood\u2019s contention that the district court erred by dismissing his claims without allowing him to conduct discovery is unavailing because \u00a7 1915(e)(2) permits a district court to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s IFP action \u201cat any time.\u201d \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Also, Hood\u2019s allegations and the documents that he submitted in response to the district court\u2019s questionnaire indicate that prison officials addressed Hood\u2019s concerns on numerous occasions, yet Hood constantly disagreed with and questioned prison officials regarding the appropriate treatment. Although Phenobarbital was ordered by medical personnel, that medication was, at one time, on Hood\u2019s allergen list because of his potential allergy to another medication that contained Phenobarbital. Neither was Phenobarbital approved by the prison\u2019s regional pharmacy, which considered it to be a controlled substance that could not be used in the prison setting. The prison medical staff attempted to find another option to treat Hood, yet he refused to take other prescribed medication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>even after being advised that he could remain in the prison medical facility for monitoring of potential allergic reactions to drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">In sum, prison medical staff continually attempted to address Hood\u2019s medical issues, yet Hood constantly disagreed with prison staff. Such disagreement with medical professionals does not establish an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006). The record also supports the district court\u2019s determination that Hood did not suffer substantial harm as a result of not receiving Phenobarbital. As Hood failed to allege facts that established a claim of deliberate indifference, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Hood\u2019s complaint as frivolous. <em>See Domino, </em>239 F.3d at 756; <em>Berry, </em>192 F.3d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Our affirmance and the district court\u2019s dismissal are counted as one strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Hood is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
