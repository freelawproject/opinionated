No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160 (1997) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 note), and asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. Mr. Nino argues the BIA erred by concluding (1) that he is ineligible for relief under NACARA because he failed to timely register for benefits pursuant to the settlement agreement reached in <em>American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh, </em>760 F.Supp. 796 (N.D.Ca.1991) (\u201cABC\u201d), and (2) that he did not qualify for asylum. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The BIA\u2019s legal conclusions are afforded <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Ayala v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test, and we will affirm the BIA\u2019s factual determination \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). We will only reverse \u201cwhen the record compels a reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">As an initial matter, we dismiss the petition in part on jurisdictional grounds. We lack jurisdiction over the claim that Mr. Nino was denied an opportunity to testify on whether he registered for ABC class benefits because he failed to raise that claim before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. United States Atty. Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[B]ecause Amaya failed to raise his due process claim before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider it.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We also lack jurisdiction over Mr. Nino\u2019s remaining arguments aimed at showing the BIA erred by denying his application for relief under NACARA. As section 203(5)(C)(ii) of NA-CARA mandates that a \u201cdetermination by the Attorney General as to whether an alien satisfies the requirements of this clause (i) is final and shall not be subject to review by any court,\u201d we are precluded from reviewing Mr. Nino\u2019s remaining arguments because they, at bottom, challenge the factual determination that he failed to timely register for ABC class benefits. <em>See, e.g., Ixcot v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 1202, 1213-1214 (9th Cir.2011) (concluding federal courts are precluded \u201cfrom reviewing the agency\u2019s factual determination that an immigrant is ineligible for ABC benefits or special rule cancellation of removal under NACARA \u00a7 203\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Molina Jerez v. Holder, </em>625 F.3d 1058, 1069 (8th Cir.2010) (\u201cWhether Molina registered for ABC benefits in a timely manner is a purely factual issue over which this court lacks jurisdiction.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Turning next to Mr. Nino\u2019s asylum claim, we conclude that it fails on the merits. An alien may qualify for asylum by demonstrating he has a well-founded fear that upon returning to his country he will be persecuted on account of one of five statutorily protected grounds: \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. United States Atty. Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). To satisfy this standard, an alien has the burden of proving, among other things, good reason to fear he will be \u201csingled out\u201d for persecution on account of one of the statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>protected grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1200 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Nino argues that he is entitled to asylum because he has a well-founded fear of being the target of crime due to his wealth and previous refusal to join the Salvadorian military and guerrillas, but the BIA did not err in rejecting this argument. Even assuming that wealthy Salvadorians who previously refused to join the Salvadorian military or guerillas constitute a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d Mr. Nino failed to meet his burden of demonstrating he would be singled out on account of his membership in that group. <em>See, e.g., Forgue v. United States Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[A]n alien is required \u2018to present <em>specific, detailed facts </em>showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account\u2019 of such a protected activity\u201d) (citation omitted and emphasis added). None of the evidence or testimony Mr. Nino presented demonstrated a connection between his previous refusal to join the Salvadorian military or guerillas and his fear of being the target of criminals; instead, Mr. Nino\u2019s testimony and declaration [AR at 161, 214], the U.S. Department of State Human Rights Report [AR at 186], and relatives\u2019 written declarations [AR at 993, 995] paint a picture of general criminal activity that all of Salvadorian society must unfortunately endure. Accordingly, Mr. Nino\u2019s application for asylum was properly denied by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\">. On appeal to the BIA Mr. Nino argued that sufficient evidence showed that he was registered as an ABC class member and urged the Board to \u201creview Respondent\u2019s record in its entirety and find that he was a registered ABC class member....\u201d [AR at 44].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\">. Although an alien need not show he will be singled out if he proves a \"pattern or practice ... of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant\u201d on account of one of the statutorily protected grounds, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii), Mr. Nino did not raise this argument before the BIA [AR at 41-44], and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
