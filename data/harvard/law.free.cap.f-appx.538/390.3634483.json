Wyatt, federal prisoner # 04900-051, challenges under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 the 262-month sentence imposed in 2004 following his conditional guilty-plea conviction for possession, with intent to distribute, over 100 kilograms of marijuana. (He has previously filed several other petitions under \u00a7 2241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">Wyatt contends: his petition is properly brought under \u00a7 2241, rather than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, because he challenges the execution of his sentence, rather than its imposition; and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) , and <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009) , establish that he was actually innocent of the career-offender enhancement at sentencing because his prior conviction of simple escape no longer qualifies as a violent felony. The district court dismissed his petition, concluding Wyatt\u2019s claims were not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and he had not satisfied the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-22\">The district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its findings of fact, for clear error. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-23\">Wyatt first contends the district court erred in dismissing his petition because he is challenging the execution of his sentence, which is proper under \u00a7 2241. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-01 (5th Cir.2001). Because he challenges the validity of the sentence imposed by the sentencing court, and not the manner in which it is being administered, however, Wyatt\u2019s petition should have been filed under \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Gabor, </em>905 F.2d 76, 77-78 (5th Cir.1990); <em>cf. Gallegos-Hernandez v. United States, </em>688 F.3d 190, 194 (5th Cir.) (allowing prisoner to seek \u00a7 2241 relief for challenging his eligibility to participate in a prison drug program, which could result in 12-month sentence reduction), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 561, 184 L.Ed.2d 365 (2012). (Wyatt\u2019s \u00a7 2255 mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>tion was denied. <em>Wyatt v. United States, </em>574 F.3d 455 (7th Cir.2009).)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Wyatt next contends he may pursue his \u00a7 2241 petition under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d because, <em>inter alia, </em>his sentence was erroneously enhanced by a nonexistent offense. Section 2255(e) permits petitioners, under \u00a7 2241, to challenge the validity of a sentence only if \u00a7 2255 provides an \u201cinadequate [remedy] or [is] ineffective to test the legality of [petitioner\u2019s] detention\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Petitioner satisfies \u00a7 2255(e) by showing the claim: \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been <em>convicted </em>of a nonexistent offense\u201d; and \u201cwas foreclosed by- circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the prisoner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904 (emphasis added). A claim of actual innocence for a career-offender sentencing enhancement, however, does not establish actual innocence of the crime of conviction and, thus, does not, pursuant to the \u00a7 2255 savings clause, warrant review under \u00a7 2241. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27 (holding challenge to validity of enhanced sentence did not fall under \u00a7 2255 savings clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
