Daniels\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising the issue of whether his sentence is substantively unreasonable but concluding that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Daniels was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-23\">We review a district court\u2019s judgment revoking supervised release and imposing a term of imprisonment for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006). We first consider whether the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 438. In this initial inquiry, we take a more deferential posture concerning issues of fact and the exercise of discretion than reasonableness review for Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>sentences. <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 656 (4th Cir.2007). Only if we find the sentence procedurally or substantively unreasonable must we decide whether it is \u201cplainly\u201d so. <em>Id. </em>at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">While a district court must consider the Chapter Seven policy statements and the statutory factors applicable to revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e) (2006), the court need not roboti-cally tick through every subsection, and ultimately, the court has broad discretion to revoke the previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>at 656-57. Moreover, while a district court must provide a statement of reasons for the sentence, the court need not be as detailed or specific when imposing a revocation sentence as when imposing a post-conviction sentence. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 547 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that Daniels\u2019s sentence is reasonable, and the district court did not abuse its discretion. The sentence is within the prescribed statutory range and the policy statement range, and the district court reasonably determined that a sentence at the high end of the policy statement range was appropriate in this case. Moreover, in accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his or her client, in writing, of his or her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
