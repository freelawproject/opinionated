The district court denied the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>tion, determining there was no evidence that the government\u2019s petition for revocation was vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith. Williams appeals. Upon careful review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees or the request for a hearing. <em>See United States v. Porchay, </em>533 F.3d 704, 711 (8th Cir.2008) (denial of attorney\u2019s fees under Hyde Amendment reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>380 F.3d 387, 390 (8th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (denial of hearing on motion for attorney\u2019s fees under Hyde Amendment reviewed for abuse of discretion). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-25\">. The Honorable Lyle E.
