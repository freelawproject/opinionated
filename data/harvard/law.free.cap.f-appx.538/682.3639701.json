MeCALLA, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">This appeal was brought by Bobbie A. Maxwell, Jr., while an inmate at the Florence Crane Correctional Facility, Michigan Department of Corrections. Maxwell filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that private contractors working for the Michigan Department of Corrections violated his Eighth Amendment right against deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs due to denial of hip-replacement surgery and adequate pain medication. Ultimately, all of Maxwell\u2019s claims were dismissed either on motions to dismiss or motions for summary judgment. Maxwell appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim against Dr. Keith W. Ivens for denial of hip-replacement surgery in 2007 and his claim against Dr. Bency Mathai for denial of pain medication. Maxwell also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his two motions to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s decision regarding Appellant\u2019s claim against Dr. Ivens, and REMAND that claim to the district court for consideration on the merits. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision regarding Appellant\u2019s claim against Dr. Mathai and the district court\u2019s' denial of Appellant\u2019s two motions to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">Plaintiff-Appellant Bobbie A. Maxwell, Jr. (\u201cAppellant\u201d or \u201cMaxwell\u201d), developed pain in both hips during a term of incarceration with the Michigan Department of Corrections (\u201cMDOC\u201d) that ended in 2003. After being released in 2003, Appellant consulted a private physician, Dr. Boon Cho Chang (\u201cDr. Chang\u201d), who recommended surgery after therapy proved ineffective. While Dr. Chang was looking for a specialist to do Appellant\u2019s hip surgery, Appellant was again incarcerated in July of 2005. While incarcerated, in \u201cAugust, 2005, [Appellant] was diagnosed with moderately advanced bilateral hip degenerative changes,\u201d and on \u201cNovember 14, 2007, [Appellant] was diagnosed with bilateral avasular [sic] necrosis of the hips.\u201d (R. 1 \u00b6 14.) The latter term of incarceration ended during the course of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">Until April 1, 2009, Defendant-Appellee Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (\u201cAp-pellee CMS\u201d or \u201cCMS\u201d), a private corporation, was under contract with the MDOC to provide medical services to MDOC inmates. Defendant-Appellee Dr. Keith W. Ivens (\u201cAppellee Ivens\u201d or \u201cDr. Ivens\u201d) was an employee of CMS until December 14, 2007. Defendant-Appellee Dr. Bency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Mathai (\u201cAppellee Mathai\u201d or \u201cDr. Ma-thai\u201d) was also an employee of CMS. Since April 1, 2009, Defendant-Appellee Prison Health Services, Inc. (\u201cAppellee PHS\u201d or \u201cPHS\u201d), a private corporation, has been under contract with the MDOC to provide medical services to MDOC inmates. The Pain Management Committee is a three-member body and part of the MDOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">On December 27, 2008, Appellant filed the grievance relevant to this appeal (the \u201cGrievance\u201d). On the Prisoner/Parolee Grievance Form, where the grievant is directed to \u201c[s]tate [the] problem clearly,\u201d Appellant wrote: \u201cSee: Attached Grievance Statement. In the form of: Administrative Notice. By: Affidavit 2 pages.\u201d In the Administrative Notice attached to the Prisoner/Parolee Grievance Form, Appellant stated, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6y\">1. On December 23, 2008, I received verbal confirmation from Sandra K. Powell, R.N., that my request for Special Accomodation [sic], Pain Medication and Hip Replacement surgery forwarded by Hope S.

There is NO legitimate reason to deny Affiant \u2018Solutional Remedy\u2019 i.e. Surgery, Effective Medication, Injections to assist in alleviation of Affiant\u2019s [sic] current infliction of unnecessary suffering upon Affiant by failure to treat medical needs, which boils down to \u2018Crule [sic] and Unusual Punishment\u2019 and C.M.S. being inconsistant [sic] with contemporary standards of decency, and unnecessary [sic] wanton infliction of pain, In [sic] violation of the Eigth [sic] Amendment, U.S. Constitution. [See: <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 1331, 97 S ct. [sic] 285, 50 L Ed.2d 273 (1976) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">(R. 11-2 at PID 159 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">On March 27, 2009, the Grievance was denied after being pursued through all three stages of the grievance process. The final denial of the Grievance stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADu\">Grievant alleges he is being denied hip surgery and pain relief associated with his hips.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-19\">All relevant information has been reviewed within the electronic medical record. Grievant has had several evaluations, diagnostic testing, x-rays, and specialty consults requested by the Medical Practitioner. Grievant also currently has a treatment plan in place and a re-evaluation has been submitted to the Pain Management Committee. Denial of treatment is not supported by the record. Grievant\u2019s request for hip replacement surgery is not medically indicated at this time. Step I and Step II respondents are both affirmed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Grievance appeal denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">(R. 11-2 at PID 221.)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On April 26, 2010, Appellant filed the instant complaint. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Appellant sought injunctive relief and damages because his Eighth Amendment rights had been violated due to \u201cdeliberate indifference of [his] medical needs.\u201d As relevant to this appeal, Appellant made the following allegations: that, in November 2007, Dr. Ivens denied a recommendation that Appellant receive bilateral hip-replacement surgery because Appellant\u2019s \u201c[h]ip problems [are] from preexisting GSW (gunshot wounds) and other trauma\u201d; that Dr. Mathai denied a request from a physician\u2019s assistant that Appellant receive an MRI examination; and that \u201cCMS and PHS are vicariously liable for the actions of their employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">On July 2, 2010, Appellees Ivens, Ma-thai, and CMS filed a motion to dismiss, and on July 7, 2010, Appellee PHS filed a motion to dismiss. On January 18, 2011, the magistrate judge recommended that the claim against Dr. Ivens regarding Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; that Appellant stated a claim against Dr. Ma-thai only for a denial of a recommended MRI examination, which should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; and that the claims against CMS and PHS be dismissed for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">On March 16, 2011, Appellant filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint (the \u201cFirst Motion to Amend\u201d). Appellant requested \u201cleave to file an amended complaint as to [CMS] and [PHS] to specifically allege the polices [sic], practices of [sic] customs of each of those defendants.\u201d Appellant attached his proposed Amended Complaint (the \u201cFirst Proposed Amended Complaint\u201d) to the First Motion to Amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">On April 13, 2011, and April 15, 2011, the district court issued orders adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and denying Appellant\u2019s First Motion to Amend. Regarding the First Motion to Amend, the district court found that \u201c[e]ven were the Court to overlook the untimeliness of Plaintiffs motion, and the prejudice resulting therefrom, Plaintiffs attempt to cure the legal deficiencies in his complaint is futile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">On January 6, 2012, and February 10, 2012, pursuant to motions by the remaining defendants, the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment against Appellant on his remaining claims. On March 13, 2012, Appellant filed a second motion for permission to file an amended complaint (the \u201cSecond Motion to Amend\u201d), seeking to add Dr. Haresh B. Pandya and Dr. Sylvia McQueen as defendants, reinstate Appellees CMS and PHS as defendants, and reassert the claim against Appellee Ivens regarding Dr. Iv-ens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">On May 2, 2012, the district court issued an order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and denying the Second Motion to Amend. The district court denied the Second Motion to Amend because it would \u201cprejudice Defendants and unreasonably delay resolution of the claims presently before the Court.\u201d On May 2, 2012, the district court entered a Judgment \u201cin favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">The court addresses, in turn, Appellant\u2019s arguments regarding Dr. Ivens\u2019s denial of hip-replacement surgery in 2007, Dr. Ma-thai\u2019s denial of pain medication, the First Motion to Amend, and the Second Motion to Amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>A. Appellant Exhausted His Administrative Remedies Regarding Dr. Iv-ens\u2019s 2007 Denial of Appellant\u2019s Hip-Replacement Surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">A district court\u2019s dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s civil-rights claims for failure to exhaust is reviewed de novo. <em>Risher v. Lappin, </em>639 F.3d 236, 239-40 (6th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Boyd v. Corr. Corp. of Am., </em>380 F.3d 989, 993 (6th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) states that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d As a result, \u201c[t]here is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the [Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995] and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought in court.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 211, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007); <em>see also Grinter v. Knight, </em>532 F.3d 567, 577 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense. <em>Bock, </em>549 U.S. at 216, 127 S.Ct. 910; <em>Surles v. Andison, </em>678 F.3d 452, 455 (6th Cir.2012). The defendant, therefore, bears the burden of proof on exhaustion. <em>Surles, </em>678 F.3d at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Appellant challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim against Dr. Ivens for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The district court held that the Grievance did not give adequate notice that Maxwell was grieving Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of his hip-replacement surgery. Appellant challenges this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">1. The Grievance Gave Prison Officials Sufficient Notice that Appellant Was Grieving Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 Denial of Appellant\u2019s Hip-Replacement Surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Appellant argues that the sixth paragraph of the Grievance gave adequate notice that he was grieving Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery. (Appellant Br. at 21.) The sixth paragraph of the Grievance reads: \u201cC.M.S. Staff demonstrated \u201cDeliberate Indifference\u201d to My [sic] medical needs going back to November, 2007, when Dr. Ivens refused to authorize my Hip Replacement Operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">The Supreme Court has addressed \u201chow courts determine whether a prisoner has properly exhausted administrative remedies specifically, the level of detail required in a grievance to put the prison and individual officials on notice of the claim.\u201d <em>Bock, </em>549 U.S. at 205, 127 S.Ct. 910. The Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[t]he level of detail necessary in a grievance to comply with the grievance procedures will vary from system to system and claim to claim, but it is the prison\u2019s requirements, and not the [Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995], that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.\u201d <em>Bock, </em>549 U.S. at 218, 127 S.Ct. 910; <em>see also Reynolds-Bey v. Harris, </em>428 Fed.Appx. 493, 499 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Appellant\u2019s Grievance was filed pursuant to MDOC Policy Directive 03.02.130 (effective date June 9, 2007) (the \u201cMDOC Grievance Procedures\u201d). According to the MDOC Grievance Procedures, \u201cvague\u201d grievances may be rejected. The MDOC Grievance Procedures do not define \u201cvague\u201d but do give the following indication of what should be included in a grievance: \u201cThe issues should be stated briefly but concisely. Information provided is to be limited to the facts involving the issued being grieved (i.e., who, what, when, where, why, how). Dates, times, places, and names of all those involved in the issue being grieved are to be included.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">\u201cWhen prison officials decline to enforce their own procedural requirements and opt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>to consider otherwise-defaulted claims on the merits, so as a general rule will we.\u201d <em>Reed-Bey v. Pramstaller, </em>603 F.3d 322, 325 (6th Cir.2010). When prison officials decline to enforce their own procedural rules, \u201cthe State, as the promulgator of the rules, has had a chance to provide a remedy for the inmate and to decide whether the objectives of the review process have been served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, \u201cthe State\u2019s decision to review a claim on the merits gives us a warrant to do so as well, even when a procedural default might otherwise have resolved the claim.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Reynolds-Bey, </em>428 Fed.Appx. at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In the case presently before this court, the Grievance is not \u201cvague\u201d regarding Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery. The Grievance contained the dates and \u201cnames of all those involved in the issue being grieved.\u201d In paragraph three of the Grievance, Appellant stated that Dr. Ikrom recommended the surgery on November 14, 2007: \u201cAffi-ant was \u201c[sic] seen by Orthopedic Surgery (Dr. Ikrom) who recomended [sic] referral to U. of M. or St. Joseph for Bilateral Hip Replacement ... on 11-14-2007.\u201d In paragraph six of the Grievance, Appellant stated that he was grieving Dr. Ivens\u2019s November 2007 denial of hip-replacement surgery as part of his assertion of deliberate indifference: \u201cC.M.S. Staff demonstrated \u201cDeliberate Indifference\u201d to My [sic] medical needs going back to November, 2007, when Dr. Ivens refused to authorize my Hip Replacement Operation.\u201d The Grievance is not vague: it is clear that Appellant was grieving Dr. Ivens\u2019s denial in November 2007 of Dr. Ikrom\u2019s recommendation that Appellant receive bilateral hip-replacement surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Furthermore, while the MDOC Grievance Procedures state that the time of day and location of the incident \u201care to be included,\u201d prison officials did not dismiss the Grievance as it regards Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery because the time of day and location of the incident were not included. In <em>Reed-Bey, </em>we refused to dismiss a claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies despite the fact that the prisoner did not include the \u201cnames of all those involved in the issue being grieved,\u201d as required by the MDOC grievance procedures in effect at the time the grievance was filed. <em>Reed-Bey, </em>603 F.3d at 325-26. In that case, the prisoner filed a <em>grievance </em>complaining about the lack of follow-up care he received after being treated in an emergency room for a shoulder injury because, while an emergency-room physician recommended that the prisoner see an orthopedic specialist for a shoulder injury within five days, prison officials did not send him to see an orthopedic specialist for more than two months. <em>Id. </em>at 323. As in that case, in the case presently before this Court, Appellant\u2019s Grievance gave sufficient notice of the matter being grieved Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery to conclude that \u201c[o]f-ficials at the Department of Corrections, for reasons of their own, overlooked (or perhaps forgave) [the] procedural failing and chose to address [the] grievance on the merits.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 324. Prison officials, therefore, have \u201chad a chance to provide a remedy for the inmate and to decide whether the objectives of the review process have been served,\u201d <em>see id., </em>and this Court will not find procedural default regarding Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Finally, unlike the strict adherence to the requirement that prisoners include the names of the defendants in their grievances, <em>see, e.g., Hall v. Warren, </em>443 Fed.Appx. 99, 106 (6th Cir.2011), requiring a grievance to state the time of day and location of the incident in this case may raise constitutional concerns. For exam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>pie, unlike a physical altercation with a guard, there is no indication that Appellant could determine the time of day or location in which Dr. Ivens denied Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery in November 2007. Since the MDOC Grievance Procedures require Appellant to grieve Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery, requiring the time of day and location of the incident would deny Appellant the ability to grieve, and by extension to file a claim in federal court regarding, Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery. Strictly interpreted, therefore, the MDOC Grievance Procedures might well be unconstitutional as denying Appellant\u2019s First Amendment right to redress grievances. <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 84, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (\u201c[P]risoners retain the constitutional right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.\u201d). Therefore, such a narrow construction of the MDOC Grievance Procedures would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">2. Prison Officials Did Not Dismiss As Untimely Appellant\u2019s Grievance As It Regarded Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 Denial of Appellant\u2019s Hip-Replacement Surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\u201c[T]o properly exhaust administrative remedies prisoners must \u2018complete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules\u2019 rules that are defined not by the [Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995], but by the prison grievance process itself.\u201d <em>Bock, </em>549 U.S. at 218, 127 S.Ct. 910 (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 88, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006)); <em>see also Reynolds-Bey, </em>428 Fed.Appx. at 499. \u201cThe benefits of exhaustion can be realized only if the prison grievance system is given a fair opportunity to consider the grievance. The prison grievance system will not have such an opportunity unless the grievant complies with the system\u2019s critical procedural rules.\u201d <em>Woodford, </em>548 U.S. at 95, 126 S.Ct. 2378. As a result, \u201ca prisoner must adhere to any time limitations that are part of the institutional grievance policy.\u201d <em>Surles, </em>678 F.3d at 455; <em>see also Reynolds-Bey, </em>428 Fed.Appx. at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">In the instant case, Appellant correctly points out that, even if the Grievance could have been dismissed as untimely, \u201cnowhere in the grievance process is there a claim that it was untimely.\u201d (Appellant Reply Br. at 8.) The MDOC has dismissed grievances similar to that of Appellant because those grievances referred to concerns that were not timely grieved. <em>See Vandiver v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., </em>326 Fed.Appx. 885, 890 (6th Cir.2009) (finding untimely a grievance that the MDOC had dismissed because \u201cconcerns relating back to 1997 [policies and customs] were not timely\u201d filed in 2006). In the instant case, however, prison officials did not deny the Grievance as untimely. Rather, prison officials denied the Grievance on the merits after it had been pursued through all three stages of the grievance process, concluding that \u201c[a]ll relevant information has been reviewed within the electronic record\u201d regarding Appellant\u2019s \u201callegation that] he is being denied hip surgery and pain relief associated with his hips.\u201d Prison officials, therefore, have \u201chad a chance to provide a remedy for the inmate and to decide whether the objectives of the review process have been served,\u201d <em>see Reed-Bey, </em>603 F.3d at 325, and this court will not consider the Grievance untimely as it regards Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">In summary, the Grievance gave sufficient notice that Appellant was grieving Dr. Ivens\u2019s 2007 denial of Appellant\u2019s hip-replacement surgery, and prison officials did not dismiss the Grievance due to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>cedural default. We reverse the district court\u2019s finding that Appellant did not exhaust his administrative remedies regarding his claim against Dr. Ivens for the 2007 denial of hip-replacement surgery, and we remand that claim for consideration on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">B. Appellant Did Not State a Claim Against Dr. Mathai for Denial of Pain Medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Appellant asserts that \u201cthe claim against Dr. Mathai should not have [sic] dismissed as to the denial of pain medication because the complaint made that claim and it was covered in the grievance.\u201d (Appellant Br. at 15.) The only statement in Appellant\u2019s brief supporting this assertion is that \u201cthe Magistrate Judge erroneously read the complaint against Dr. Mathai as limited to only to [sic] a denial of an MRI whereas the complaint also complains of Dr. Mathai for failure to give adequate pain medication.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 19.) In his brief, Appellant does not indicate where in his Complaint he states a claim against Dr. Mathai for denial of pain medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The district court found that the complaint \u201conly asserted a claim against Dr. Mathai for denial of an MRI examination.\u201d Appellant argued before that court that paragraph forty-two of his complaint stated a claim against Dr. Mathai for denial of pain medication because that paragraph stated that Dr. Mathai \u201cdid not act to \u2018optimize pain management.\u2019 \u201d The district court rejected this argument because the language of the complaint actually states that <em>\u201cthe [Pain Management Committee] </em>did not act \u2018to optimize pain management.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">If Appellant did not state a claim against Dr. Mathai for denial of pain medication, whether Appellant properly exhausted his administrative remedies regarding Dr. Ma-thai\u2019s alleged denial of pain medication is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">\u201cThis court reviews the district court\u2019s order granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss de novo.\u201d <em>Dudenhoefer v. Fifth Third Bancorp, </em>692 F.3d 410, 416 (6th Cir.2012).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">In assessing a complaint for failure to state a claim, we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept all well pled factual allegations as true, and determine whether the complaint \u201ccontain[s] sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-11\"><em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">Taken in the light most favorable to Appellant, the Complaint fails to state a claim against Dr. Mathai for denial of pain medication. Paragraph forty-two of the complaint states that Dr. Mathai did not authorize an MRI examination and referred Appellant to the Pain Management Committee \u201cto optimize pain management.\u201d (R. 1 \u00b6 42(e).) The complaint then alleges that, following Dr. Mathai\u2019s recommendation \u201cthe [Pain Management Committee] did not act to \u2018optimize pain management.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 42(f).) The complaint, therefore, may allege that the Pain Management Committee denied Appellant pain medication, but it does not allege that Dr. Mathai denied Appellant pain medication. Since Appellant did not state a claim against Dr. Mathai for denial of pain medication, whether Appellant exhausted his administrative remedies regarding that claim is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Appellant did not state a claim against Dr. Mathai for denial of pain medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>C. Appellant\u2019s First Motion to Amend Was Futile and, Therefore, Properly Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Appellant first sought leave to amend his complaint to \u201cspecifically allege the polices [sic], practices of [sic] customs of [CMS and PHS].\u201d The district court denied Appellant\u2019s First Motion to Amend because it was untimely, and therefore prejudicial, and because it was futile: \u201cEven were the Court to overlook the untimeliness of Plaintiffs motion, and the prejudice resulting therefrom, Plaintiffs attempt to cure the legal deficiencies in his complaint is futile\u201d because the \u201callegations in Plaintiff [sic] proposed amended complaint ... fail to \u2018raise a right for relief above the speculative level.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\u201cWe review the denial of a motion for leave to amend for abuse of discretion, except when the denial was due to futility, in which case we review de novo.\u201d <em>Orton v. Johnny\u2019s Lunch Franchise, LLC, </em>668 F.3d 843, 850 (6th Cir.2012). \u201cAny error in denying a motion to amend is subject to harmless error analysis.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Cleveland City Sch. Dist., </em>344 Fed.Appx. 104, 114 (6th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Rose v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>203 F.3d 417, 420 (6th Cir.2000)). An abuse of discretion in denying a motion to amend \u201camounts to harmless error where the proposed amendment would have been futile.\u201d <em>Colvin v. Caruso, </em>605 F.3d 282, 294 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\u201cA proposed amendment is futile if the amendment could not withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Riverview Health Inst. LLC v. Med. Mut. of Ohio, </em>601 F.3d 505, 512 (6th Cir.2010) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). To survive a motion to dismiss, \u201c[flactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level and to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Keys v. Humana, Inc., </em>684 F.3d 605, 608 (6th Cir.2012) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA plaintiff must \u2018plead[ ] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Regarding private contractors employed by a state such as CMS and PHS, \u201cliability only attaches where a custom, policy, or practice attributable to the municipality was the \u2018moving force\u2019 behind the violation of the plaintiffs constitutional rights.\u201d <em>See Heyerman v. Cnty. of Calhoun, </em>680 F.3d 642, 648 (2012); <em>see also Street v. Corrs. Corp. of Am., </em>102 F.3d 810, 818 (6th Cir.1996) (recognizing that <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), extends to private corporations as well as municipal corporations). \u201cSince such bodies can act only through natural persons, the critical question is whether the person committing the act did so pursuant to official policy.\u201d <em>Baar v. Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Educ., </em>476 Fed.Appx. 621, 636 (6th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Appellant\u2019s First Proposed Amended Complaint was futile because it did not sufficiently plead a cause of action against CMS or PHS. Appellant argues that: \u201cThe proposed amended complaint alleged the policies, practices, and customs against CMS and PHS in paragraphs 37 and 46. What these policies, practices, and customs caused to plaintiff are alleged in paragraphs 38 and 47.\u201d The only indication in paragraphs thirty-eight and forty-seven that the policies of CMS and PHS were the \u201c \u2018moving force\u2019 behind the violation of the plaintiffs constitutional rights\u201d is the following statement: \u201cThese policies, practices, and customs resulted in Plaintiff suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>fering almost constant pain for the entire time of the most recent incarceration.\u201d This court, however, \u201cneed not accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences, and conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual allegations will not suffice.\u201d <em>In re Travel Agent Comm\u2019n, </em>583 F.3d 896, 903 (6th Cir.2009) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). As a result, Appellant\u2019s conclusory allegation that CMS and PHS policies caused the violation of his constitutional right does not \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>See Keys, </em>684 F.3d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Appellant also argues that the First Proposed Amended Complaint \u201ccould have been ... amended\u201d to state a claim and that \u201c[l]eave to amend should only be denied if there are [sic] no set of facts which would constitute a valid claim.\u201d (Appellant Br. 33.) The no-set-of-facts standard, however, was \u201cretired\u201d by the Supreme Court in <em>Twombly. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 670, 678-80, 129 S.Ct. 1937. As stated above, Appellant\u2019s argument fails under current pleading standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In his reply brief, Appellant also argues that \u201c[t]he policy to deny surgery because of a claim that the need arose due to a condition suffered before incarceration is clearly an alleged unconstitutional policy expressly followed by Defendant Ivens.\u201d (Appellant Reply Br. at 11.) As stated in the First Proposed Amended Complaint, however, the policy referenced by Appellant allowed employees to exercise discretion: \u201cThe custom, practice, or policy <em>to consider </em>whether [sic] prisoner had the condition prior to incarceration as a reason to not approve needed surgery.\u201d (R. 35-2 at PID 715, 720 (emphasis added).) While Appellant alleged that Dr. Ivens denied the 2007 request for hip-replacement surgery because the condition was \u201cpre-existing,\u201d Appellant did not. allege that Dr. Ivens was \u201c\u2018responsible for establishing final [corporate] policy respecting such activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Holloway v. Brush, </em>220 F.3d 767, 773 (6th Cir.2000) (en banc) (quoting <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>475 U.S. 469, 483, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986)); <em>see also Miller v. Calhoun Cnty., </em>408 F.3d 803, 814 (6th Cir.2005). Regarding the policy of considering whether a condition was pre-existing, the First Proposed Amended Complaint did not plead a necessary element of the claim, so it does not \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>See Keys, </em>684 F.3d at 608 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In summary, because the First Proposed Amended Complaint did not sufficiently plead a cause of action against CMS or PHS, it was futile. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the First Motion to Amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">D. Regarding the Second Motion to Amend, Appellant Did Not Show Good Cause and Allowing the Amendment Would Have Been Prejudicial to the Nonmoving Parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">In the case presently before this court, it is asserted that the district court abused its discretion by denying Appellant\u2019s Second Motion to Amend pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) without first considering Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b). The court finds, however, that any abuse of discretion by the district court was harmless error in any event. There was no showing of good cause as required by Rule 16(b), and the district court properly found prejudice pursuant to Rule 15(a). Moreover, there would be substantial prejudice to the other parties. Appellant\u2019s counsel filed the Second Motion to Amend more than three months after the deadline for completing discovery, and both the Appellant and Ap-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>pellee PHS argue that they would have had to reopen discovery <em>(see </em>Appellant Br. 24; Appellee PHS Br. 19). The district court denied Appellant\u2019s Second Motion to Amend because \u201cPlaintiff waited to attempt to remedy [the legal deficiencies in his Complaint] until after the Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of all remaining claims.... [Permitting the amendment] under these circumstances would prejudice Defendants and unreasonably delay resolution of the claims presently before the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The district court having properly found prejudice pursuant to Rule 15(a), we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the Second Motion to Amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">For the reasons stated, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s decision that Appellant did not properly exhaust his administrative remedies regarding his claim against Dr. Ivens for denial of hip-replacement surgery in 2007, and we REMAND that claim to the district court for consideration on the merits. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision that Appellant did not state a claim against Dr. Mathai for denial of pain medication. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denials of Appellant\u2019s motions to amend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
