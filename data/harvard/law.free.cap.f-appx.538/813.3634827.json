We have jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921. Because the ALJ erred in discrediting the testimony of Dr. Kafrouni, we grant the petition for review and remand. Because the parties are familiar with the history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">The ALJ\u2019s determination that the claimant did not establish that the cervical myelopathy caused by Cloyd Seachris\u2019s (\u201cSeachris\u201d) 1979 work injury could have accelerated the immobility and diabetes that contributed to his death is unsupported by substantial evidence of the record considered as a whole. The ALJ\u2019s credibility determination as to Dr. Kafrouni\u2019s testimony was \u201cpatently unreasonable\u201d and \u201cconflict[s] with the clear preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Hawaii Stevedores, Inc. v. Ogawa, </em>608 F.3d 642, 648 (9th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>The ALJ unreasonably characterized Dr. Kafrouni\u2019s testimony as \u201cignoring]\u201d and \u201cdismissing]\u201d Seachris\u2019s other health conditions when Dr. Kafrouni did acknowledge that other conditions in addition to cervical myelopathy contributed to Sea-chris\u2019s immobility and diabetes. The ALJ also erred in finding that Dr. Kafrouni\u2019s opinion was unsubstantiated by medical records when the preponderance of the evidence supports Dr. Kafrouni\u2019s opinion. Dr. Kafrouni testified that Seachris\u2019s medical records lacked reference to Seachris\u2019s depression, pain, and worsening cervical myelopathy because Seachris had not been examined by a specialist and that Sea-chris\u2019s decreased mobility over time was evidence itself that his cervical myelopathy worsened over time. Additionally, the evidence shows that Seachris\u2019s medical records were incomplete and that Seachris\u2019s own 1990 report to the Social Security Administration supports Dr. Kafrouni\u2019s opinion that cervical myelopathy likely caused chronic pain and depression and that the resulting immobility likely contributed to Seachris\u2019s diabetes and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Therefore, we must grant the petition for review and remand to the BRB for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">PETITION GRANTED.
