After review and oral argument, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">On October 21, 2008, Plaintiff Bollinger was involved in a car accident with a vehicle driven by Richard Armstrong. Bol-linger was injured in the accident and made a claim against Armstrong and his insurance carrier. Armstrong\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy had a $25,000 bodily injury liability limit. Armstrong\u2019s insurer tendered this policy limit to Bol-linger in exchange for a release from future liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">State Farm, the issuer of Bollinger\u2019s automobile insurance policy, authorized Bollinger to accept the offer and provide the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-16\">Bollinger, alleging that the $25,000 tendered by Armstrong\u2019s insurer under-compensated her for her injuries, then filed a claim against State Farm, pursuant to a provision for uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (\u201cUM Coverage\u201d) contained within her automobile insurance policy. Bollinger\u2019s State Farm automobile insurance policy had a $10,000 limit for UM Coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-17\">On November 5, 2009, Bollinger wrote a letter to State Farm in which she demanded that State Farm tender the $10,000 UM policy limit. In this letter, Bollinger\u2019s attorney estimated that the value of Bollinger\u2019s claim was \u201cin excess of $60,000,\u201d and stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-18\">if State Farm is unwilling to tender policy limits, I will have no alternative to file suit and, at the appropriate time, file a Proposal for Settlement/Demand for Judgment under Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and Florida Statutes, and at the expiration of the time limit for the proposal/demand, file a statutory Notice of Bad Faith Insurer Violation, in an attempt to get full value for [ ] Bollinger\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-19\">State Farm initially rejected Bollinger\u2019s demand and made a $500 counteroffer, which Bollinger refused to accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-20\">B. December 2009-March 2011: State Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b886-21\">Bollinger filed a civil complaint against State Farm in Florida state court, alleging one count of breach of contract based on State Farm\u2019s failure to pay the UM policy limits. During the state court litigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>and pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.442 and Florida Statute \u00a7 768.79, on April 13, 2010 Bollinger\u2019s attorney sent State Farm a Proposal for Settlement and a Demand for Judgment in the amount of $10,000. State Farm rejected Bollinger\u2019s settlement offer by letter on May 18, 2010. After State Farm rejected the settlement offer, Bollinger\u2019s attorney sent State Farm a letter on May 19, 2010 again indicating that Bollinger would \u201cseek extra[-]contractual damages for State Farm\u2019s bad faith in this claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">On July 9, 2010, State Farm changed course and sent Bollinger a letter offering to settle her breach of contract claim for $10,000\u2014the UM policy limit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bollinger\u2019s attorney rejected State Farm\u2019s offer in a letter dated July 12, 2010, despite the fact that State Farm\u2019s offer amounted to a tender of the full UM policy limit, indicating that the time and costs expended in litigating Bollinger\u2019s claim, and the possible pursuit of extra-contractual bad faith damages, made settlement at that time \u201ctoo late and totally unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"alz-dedup-0\">Bollinger\u2019s breach of contract claim proceeded to a jury trial. On January 13, 2011, the jury returned a $410,000 verdict in Bollinger\u2019s favor for her injuries, medical expenses, and other losses associated with the car accident. After applying set-offs for other insurance payments Bollinger received, the state court entered an order on March 22, 2011, setting Bollinger\u2019s total damages at $312,764.84\u2014an amount in excess of the $10,000 UM policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">C. April 2011: Bollinger\u2019s Amended State Court Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Bollinger did not obtain a judgment against State Farm. Following the jury\u2019s verdict, instead, on April 8, 2011, Bollinger sought leave from the state court to file an amended complaint against State Farm. In this motion, Bollinger noted that her damages, as determined by the jury, exceeded the $10,000 UM policy limit, and that she could not recover an amount in excess of the policy limit from State Farm without alleging that State Farm had acted in bad faith. Bollinger therefore requested that she be permitted to amend her complaint against State Farm to add a claim of statutory bad faith and seek extra-contractual damages based on State Farm\u2019s unwillingness to settle her claim in good faith.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The state court granted Bollinger\u2019s motion on June 20, 2011. In her amended complaint, Bollinger alleged a single count of statutory bad faith against State Farm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>pursuant to Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155(l)(b)(l). Bollinger alleged she had substantially complied with Florida\u2019s statutory civil remedy pre-suit notice requirement, Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155(3), by notifying State Farm of (1) the alleged violation and (2) her intent to pursue a bad faith claim. Bollinger\u2019s amended complaint did not re-allege or incorporate by reference her breach of contract claim against State Farm, and she sought recovery of \u201cextra[-]contractual damages in the amount of $312,764.84, plus interest and all costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">D. July 2011: Removal to Federal Court</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">State Farm timely removed Bollinger\u2019s amended complaint to federal court on July 19, 2011. Bollinger moved to remand, arguing that State Farm\u2019s notice of removal was untimely filed. The district court denied the motion, concluding that State Farm\u2019s July 19 notice of removal was timely, since the 30-day removal period did not begin until the state court granted Bollinger\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint on June 20, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Shortly after removal, State Farm moved for summary judgment, arguing that Bollinger\u2019s failure to comply with Florida\u2019s statutory civil remedy notice requirement, a condition precedent to the pursuit of a bad faith claim under \u00a7 624.155, barred her from pursuing a bad faith claim against State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">On January 12, 2012, the district court denied State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Instead, finding that Bollinger\u2019s bad faith claim was \u201cnot ripe for review,\u201d the district court ordered Bollinger\u2019s amended complaint dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). In finding Bollinger\u2019s bad faith claim unripe, the district court noted that a bad faith claim did not ripen until the insurer failed to \u201ccure\u201d the alleged bad faith during a 60-day period triggered by the filing of a statutory civil remedy notice by the insured. Thus, \u201cthe entire basis for any [bad faith] case or controversy\u201d was contingent on the insured filing such a notice. Because Bol-linger had not complied with the notice requirement, State Farm had not been afforded the required 60-day cure period. The district court therefore found dismissal without prejudice of Bollinger\u2019s amended complaint to be the appropriate remedy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">E. April 2012: Return to State Court</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Instead of appealing the federal district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of her amended complaint, Bollinger returned to state court. On April 16, 2012, Bollinger filed a \u201cMotion to Continue with Plaintiffs Claim against Defendant in the Original State Court Action\u201d in the state court from which State Farm had removed her amended complaint. In this \u201cMotion,\u201d Bollinger requested that the state court permit \u201ccontinuation of [her] Amended Complaint, in the [s]tate [c]ourt action which is still open....\u201d State Farm opposed Bollinger\u2019s \u201cMotion,\u201d arguing that the federal district court\u2019s dismissal of Bol-linger\u2019s bad faith claim demonstrated that the claim was \u201cbarred as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">At a hearing on the \u201cMotion,\u201d State Farm further argued that because it had removed Bollinger\u2019s amended complaint to federal court, and the federal court had not remanded the amended complaint to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>the state court, the state court \u201chad its jurisdiction taken away to handle any aspect of this [case].\u201d At the end of this hearing, the state court granted Bollinger\u2019s \u201cMotion\u201d because the federal district court did not issue a \u201cfinal adjudication on the merits\u201d of Bollinger\u2019s amended complaint, but instead had rested its dismissal on \u201cfederal court jurisdictional grounds.\u201d For these reasons, the state court permitted Bollinger to continue litigating her bad faith claim against State Farm in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">F. May 2012: Bollinger\u2019s Motion to File a Second Amended Complaint in State Court</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">On July 6, 2012, Bollinger moved the state court for leave to file a second amended complaint. In the motion, Bol-linger explained that she sought leave to amend her complaint to add: (1) an allegation that the \u201cDoctrine of Waiver\u201d applied to her bad faith claim against State Farm; and (2) a claim for attorney\u2019s fees under Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 624.155 and 627.727(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The state court granted Bollinger\u2019s motion on August 7, 2012, and Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint was deemed filed on August 7, 2012. Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint reasserted the statutory bad faith claim against State Farm that Bollinger pled in her amended complaint, but with the additional allegation that State Farm, \u201cby its acts and/or omissions, waived the statutory notice precondition required under Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155.\u201d The second amended complaint also included a demand for attorney\u2019s fees under Florida Statute \u00a7 627.727(10). Bol-linger did not, however, re-allege or incorporate her breach of contract claim against State Farm, and she sought recovery only for extra-contractual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">G. August 2012: Removal to Federal Court of Bollinger\u2019s Second Amended Complaint &amp; Denial of Bollinger\u2019s Motion to Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">On August 31, 2012, State Farm removed Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint to federal court, alleging diversity of citizenship between the parties and an amount in controversy greater than $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Bollinger moved to remand to state court, arguing that (1) her second amended complaint (and the bad faith claim alleged therein) were materially identical to her amended complaint and its bad faith claim; (2) the federal district court, in dismissing the amended complaint, had determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the amended complaint; and (3) therefore, the federal district court likewise lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the second amended complaint. Bol-linger also argued that remand was necessary because State Farm\u2019s notice of removal (filed August 31) of the second amended complaint (filed August 7) was untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b), since it was filed: (1) more than 30 days after Bollinger filed her <em>first </em>amended complaint on April 8, 2011 (which put State Farm on notice that federal diversity jurisdiction existed); and (2) more than 30 days after Bollinger moved, on July 6, 2012, for leave to file the second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">The district court denied Bollinger\u2019s motion to remand, concluding that the second amended complaint initiated a new action in state court, rather than a continuation of the previously-removed action. The district court concluded that State Farm timely removed the new action because removal occurred within 30 days of August 7, 2012\u2014the date on which Bollinger was granted leave to file the second amended complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>State Farm[\u2019]s removal of this newly-filed action does not violate the one year limit on removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b), because the action was commenced in 2012 following the dismissal of [Bollinger\u2019s] earlier suit on this exact same claim. State Farm removed this matter within 30 days of filing of a complaint that first established this action was removable. Finally, State Farm has established the requirements of diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, as there is complete diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy minimum requirement is clearly satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">H. September\u2014October 2012: State Farm\u2019s Motion to Dismiss &amp; District Court\u2019s Dismissal with Prejudice of Bollinger\u2019s Second Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">After removing Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint, State Farm moved to dismiss it for failure to state a claim, pur-su\u00e1nt to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). State Farm\u2019s motion to dismiss again argued that Bollinger had failed to comply with the notice requirement, and that Bollinger cited no legal authority for her contention that State Farm could or did waive compliance with this strict statutory condition precedent to the pursuit of a bad faith claim. State Farm\u2019s motion further argued that Bollinger, by continuing to re-file a bad faith claim that failed as a matter of law, was attempting to sidestep the statutory framework designed to give State Farm a 60-day window to cure any bad faith claim by tendering the UM policy limits, a tender that State Farm had tried repeatedly to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Bollinger responded to State Farm\u2019s motion to dismiss by arguing that she had substantially complied with the statutory civil notice requirement by providing actual notice to State Farm of her intention to file a bad faith claim. Bollinger also contended that State Farm waived any notice requirement because during the pendency of Bollinger\u2019s breach of contract action in state court, State Farm (1) knew that Bol-linger was planning to pursue a bad faith claim in the event that the jury returned a verdict in her favor (and an award of damages exceeding the $10,000 UM policy limit) on the breach of contract claim; and (2) failed to notify Bollinger or her counsel that \u201cfailure to comply with the condition precedent of written notice to [State Farm] and the Department of Insurance[ ] would prevent any claim for bad faith from being successful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">The district court granted State Farm\u2019s motion to dismiss Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim due to Bollinger\u2019s admitted noncompliance with the statutory notice requirement in Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155(3). As to Bollinger\u2019s substantial compliance and waiver arguments, the district court held that neither of these arguments could excuse Bollinger\u2019s failure to comply with a \u201cmandatory\u201d condition precedent, stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-10\">[Bollinger\u2019s] Response [to the motion to dismiss] provides no authority to contradict the legal requirements of Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155 or the cases that reaffirm that requirement. Instead, [Bol-linger] argues that she substantially complied with the Civil Remedy Notice requirements by communicating by letter to State Farm that [Bollinger] intended to pursue a bad faith claim. [Bollinger] made this argument in her earlier suit on this exact same claim before this Court. This Court rejected [Bollinger\u2019s] arguments then and rejects them again now. Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155 and relevant case law are clear that [Bollinger] must file a Civil Remedy Notice in order to bring her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>statutory bad faith claim. Because it is undisputed that [Bollinger] failed to file the requisite Civil Remedy Notice, [Bol-linger] cannot, as a matter of law, bring a statutory bad faith claim against [State Farm].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">(citations omitted). Bollinger then timely appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of her second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">On appeal, Bollinger contends that the district court erred in denying her motion to remand and in dismissing her second amended complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim. We address each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">A. Timeliness of Removal of Bollinger\u2019s Second Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to remand <em>de novo. Henderson v. Washington Nat. Ins. Co., </em>454 F.3d 1278, 1281 (11th Cir.2006). An action in state court may be removed to federal court when the federal courts have diversity or federal question jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). \u201cThe notice of removal of a civil action ... shall be filed within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1446(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Bollinger bases her argument concerning the untimeliness of State Farm\u2019s August 31, 2012, removal of the second amended complaint (filed on August 7, 2012) on two separate \u201ctriggering dates\u201d: April 8, 2011 (the date on which Bollinger moved in state court for leave to file an amended complaint alleging a bad faith claim against State Farm) and July 6, 2012 (the date on which Bollinger moved in state court for leave to file a second amended complaint, after the state court granted her \u201cMotion to Continue with Plaintiffs Claim against Defendant in the Original State Court Action\u201d). Plainly, if the 30-day removal window began to run on either of these dates, State Farm\u2019s August 31, 2012 notice of removal was untimely filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b)(1). However, as we explain below, the only relevant date in the removal timeliness analysis is August 7, 2012: the date on which the state court granted Bol-linger\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and deemed Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint filed, which is the date on which the 30-day removal clock began to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">1. April 8 (June 20), 2011</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">Bollinger\u2019s amended complaint\u2014which she moved to file in state court on April 8, 2011, and was granted leave to file on June 20, 2011\u2014was properly removed to federal court by State Farm and later dismissed without prejudice by the federal court. The federal court, upon dismissing the amended complaint, did not remand the case to state court. It is well-established that once a case is removed to federal court, the \u201c[s]tate court shall proceed no further unless and until the case is remanded.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(d); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1447(c) (\u201cA certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of the [s]tate court. The [s]tate court may thereupon proceed with such case.\u201d). Because no remand order was entered in federal court, Bollinger\u2019s amended complaint never returned to state court, such that state court proceedings could have reopened on it or it could have been removed again by State Farm. <em>See Maseda v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., </em>861 F.2d 1248, 1254-55 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201c[A]f-ter removal, the jurisdiction of the state court absolutely ceases and the state court has a duty not to proceed any further in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the case. Any subsequent proceedings in state court on the case are void <em>ab initio.\u201d </em>(citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">2. July 6, 2012 Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Even assuming that the state court had some arguable basis for allowing the second amended complaint to be filed and even assuming it was not void <em>ab initio, </em>Bollinger\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint (filed in state court on July 6, 2012) also did not start the 30-day removal clock.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Bollinger\u2019s proposed second amended complaint was attached to the motion, the state court did not grant Bollinger\u2019s motion and deem the second amended complaint filed until August 7, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Because State Farm\u2019s notice of removal was filed August 31, 2012\u2014fewer than 30 days after Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint was deemed filed by the state court\u2014removal was timely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b)(1). Thus, the district court did not err in denying Bollinger\u2019s motion to remand the second amended complaint to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">B. Dismissal with Prejudice of Bol-linger\u2019s Second Amended Complaint for Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). To avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must allege \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\u201d and that rises \u201cabove the speculative level.\u201d <em>Speaker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>623 F.3d 1371, 1380 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">As noted at the outset, under Florida law, an insurer may be liable to its insured if the insurer does not attempt \u201cin good faith to settle claims when, under all the circumstances, it could and should have done so, had it acted fairly and honestly toward its insured and with due regard for [the insured\u2019s] interests.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.155(l)(b)(l). A first-party bad faith claim under Florida law is purely a creature of statute\u2014\u201cFlorida does not recognize a common law first-party action for bad faith failure to settle a claim under an insurance contract.\u201d <em>Chalfonte Condo. Apartment Ass\u2019n v. QBE Ins. Corp., </em>561 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see Talat Enter., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>753 So.2d 1278, 1281 (Fla.2000) (noting that prior to 1982, the year in which the Florida Legislature adopted \u00a7 624.155, \u201cclaims made by an insured against its own insurer for failing to act in good faith when settling a claim\u201d were not cognizable under Florida law). \u201cBecause [Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155] is in derogation of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>law, it must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Talat, </em>753 So.2d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The Florida statute that creates the first-party bad faith cause of action also contains the following pre-suit notice requirement in \u00a7 624.155(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">(a) As a condition precedent to bringing an action under [\u00a7 624.155], the [Department of Financial Services] and the authorized insurer must have been given 60 days\u2019 written notice of the violation ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-7\">(b) The notice shall be on a form provided by the department and shall state with specificity the following information, and such other information as the department may require:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">1.

Stat. \u00a7 624.155(3)(a)-(b), (d). As stated in the statute, \u201cthe requirements of written notice to the Department of [Financial Services] and the insurer are conditions precedent to bringing an action under subdivision (l)(a) or (b).\u201d <em>Talat, </em>753 So.2d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">As the Florida Supreme Court explained in <em>Talat, </em>\u201cit is plain that the Legislature intended the notice to the Department [of Financial Services] to serve as a basis for the Department to assist in the settling of claims and to monitor the insurance industry. It also is plain that the sixty-day period was a time in which the insurer could act to \u2018cure\u2019 a violation of subdivision (l)(a) or (b) about which it had been served notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-17\">Pursuant to the statute, there is no remedy until the notice is sent by the insured and the insurer has the opportunity to \u201ccure\u201d the violation. If the insurer pays the damages during the cure period, then there is no remedy.... <em>The statutory cause of action for extra-contractual damages simply never comes into existence until expiration of the sixty-day window without the payment of the damages owed under the contract.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"APr\"><em>Id, </em>at 1283-84 (emphasis added). Florida\u2019s statutory scheme governing first-party bad faith insurance claims is crystal clear: there is no bad faith cause of action for an insured against her insurer until (1) the insured provides written notice to the insurer and the Florida Department of Financial Services and (2) the insurer fails to take curative action during the 60-day cure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-18\">In light of this statutory scheme, Bol-linger\u2019s admitted failure to comply with the statutory pre-suit notice requirement is fatal to her pursuit of a statutory bad faith action against State Farm. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.155(3)(a) (\u201cAs a condition precedent to bringing an action under [\u00a7 624.155], the [Department of Financial Services] and the authorized insurer must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>have been given 60 days\u2019 written notice of the violation.\u201d). Her arguments concerning substantial compliance\u2014by providing written notice to State Farm (via letter, rather than the civil remedy notice form prescribed by \u00a7 624.155(3)(b))\u2014and waiver are without merit and are unsupported by both statute and precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">First, these arguments ignore the requirement that \u00a7 624.155 must be \u201cstrictly construed.\u201d <em>Talat, </em>753 So.2d at 1283. Bollinger\u2019s contention that \u00a7 624.155 is a remedial statute that, like other unrelated remedial statutes, should be liberally construed to protect the public interest is clearly foreclosed by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Talat </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Second, these arguments also ignore several of the purposes behind the statutory notice requirement: (1) giving the insurer a \u201clast opportunity\u201d to cure the alleged bad faith, an opportunity that State Farm tried to take advantage of by tendering the $10,000 UM policy limit and (2) assisting the Florida Department of Financial Services in its oversight of the insurance industry. <em>See id. </em>at 1283-84. Additionally, Bollinger has not attempted to address how, even if State Farm were capable of waiving the notice requirement on its own behalf, State Farm could likewise waive the requirement on behalf of the Florida Department of Financial Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Even accepting the factual allegations in Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint as true, her statutory bad faith claim against State Farm fails because Florida law does not permit an insured to pursue a claim of bad faith against her insurer unless and until a civil remedy notice is filed\u2014an action Bollinger admits not taking. The requirement is not merely technical, as this case demonstrates; both sides agreed at oral argument that had Bollinger given the required notice, State Farm would have paid the $10,000 within the 60-day period. In light of the failure to give the required notice, Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint does not \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Speaker, </em>623 F.3d at 1380. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">In light of the foregoing, and after oral argument and our review of the record, we affirm the dismissal with prejudice of Bol-linger\u2019s second amended complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-6\">. State Farm contends that it ultimately sent Bollinger three separate checks for $10,000 each, urging Bollinger to accept the policy limit by simply cashing one of the checks, which Bollinger did not do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">. A first-party bad faith claim under Florida law is a statutory claim\u2014\"Florida does not recognize a common law first-party action for bad faith failure to settle a claim under an insurance contract.\u201d <em>Chalfonte Condo. Apartment Ass\u2019n v. QBE Ins. Corp., </em>561 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir.2009). Under Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155(l)(b)(l), which creates the first-party bad faith cause of action, an insurer may be liable to its insured if the insurer does not attempt \"in good faith to settle claims when, under all the circumstances, it could and should have done so, had it acted fairly and honestly toward its insured and with due regard for [the insured\u2019s] interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155 also contains a mandatory pre-suit notice requirement, which requires, <em>inter alia </em>\"[a]s a condition precedent to bringing an action under [\u00a7 624.155], the [Department of Financial Services] and the authorized insurer must have been given 60 days\u2019 written notice of the violation.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 624.155(3)(a). This statutory pre-suit notice must be provided \u201con a form provided by the [Department of Financial Services] and shall state with specificity\u201d certain information about the alleged bad faith. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 624.155(3)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b888-9\">. We agree that Bollinger failed to file the statutory cure remedy notice which caused her claim to fail, but we disagree that the issue affected the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b892-9\">. As noted above, the federal district court dismissed the first amended complaint without prejudice but did not remand it. Without a remand from the federal court, any further action by a state court in the same case is void <em>ab initio. Maseda, supra, </em>861 F.2d at 1254-55. However, given that Bollinger filed the second amended complaint and asserted its validity and given that State Farm removed the second amended complaint and sought its dismissal on the merits, we assume for purposes of this appeal, as the parties did in the district court and in their appellate briefs here, that the second amended complaint has some validity (as opposed to being void <em>ab </em>initio) and decide the case as the parties litigated it. <em>See Marsh v. Butler Cnty., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1024 &amp; n. 4 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc) (stating that this Court accepts \"and will decide this case\u201d in the way that the \u201cparties and the district judge clearly litigated [it]....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\">. In her brief on appeal, Bollinger requests that we modify the district court's order to make clear that \"just that part of the complaint which alleges bad faith should be ... dismissed.\" This modification, she argues, would permit the district court to remand her case to state court so that she could obtain a final judgment against State Farm in the breach of contract action that was tried to a jury and resulted in a damages award of $312,764.84. The problem with this request is that, other than the bad faith claim and a demand for attorney\u2019s fees associated with that bad faith claim, there is no other claim against State Farm alleged in Bollinger\u2019s second amended complaint. Thus, aside from the bad faith claim resolved in this appeal, there is nothing in the second amended complaint that the federal district court could remand to state court. At oral argument, State Farm acknowledged it would still pay $10,000 plus interest. We do not read the dismissal with prejudice as precluding a separate breach of contract action for payment of that amount in the event State Farm fails to pay it. Nor do we read the dismissal with prejudice as precluding a bad-faith claim if Bollinger gives the required notice and State Farm fails to pay the $10,000 within the statutory 60-day period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
