Vargas-Torres\u2019 total offense level was 21; combined with a criminal history category of III, his advisory Guidelines range was 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. After hearing defense counsel\u2019s arguments for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>below-Guidelines sentence, the district court imposed a within-Guidelines sentence of 50 months\u2019 imprisonment. Vargas-Torres appeals, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court \u201cerroneously perceived repeat offending as to immigration\u201d and because it relied too heavily on prior drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id.; see United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th Cir.2010). In determining the procedural reasonableness of a sentence, this court considers whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006), factors, analyzed any arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. A sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range is presumed reasonable by this court. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Vargas-Torres concedes that the district court committed no procedural error, but argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We disagree. The record reveals that the district court based Vargas-Torres\u2019 sentence on its consideration of several relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors: his personal history and characteristics, the need to reflect the seriousness of the current offense, and the need to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and adequate deterrence. Moreover, the court considered Vargas-Torres\u2019 alleged fear of retaliation and his health issues, but found that neither justified a departure from the applicable Guidelines range. We find no error in the district court\u2019s consideration of either Vargas-Torres\u2019 pri- or drug convictions or his prior attempts to enter the United States, regardless of whether those attempts led to criminal charges. Accordingly, we find that Vargas-Torres cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness afforded his within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Therefore, we affirm Vargas-Torres\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
