Stone\u2019s claim is time barred because he filed it after the two-year statute of limitations had expired. The limitation period began to run on the date Stone was shot, even though he did not know the true identity of the wrongdoer. <em>Childs v. Haussecker, </em>974 S.W.2d 31, 36, 40 (Tex.1998). Stone\u2019s fraudulent concealment argument is waived because it was not pursued in the district court. <em>LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">2. Menchaca was entitled to qualified immunity under well-settled Circuit precedent. <em>Ontiveros v. City of Rosenberg, Tex., </em>564 F.3d 379, 380 (5th Cir.2009). Vasquez\u2019 actions posed a serious threat to those around him, and it was reasonable for Menchaca to use deadly force. <em>See Id. </em>at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">3. The district court properly dismissed Vasquez\u2019 premises liability and negligent hiring, supervision, and training claims against RL Worth because Vasquez did not point the court to any evidence supporting these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
