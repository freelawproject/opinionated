We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-25\">Gomez contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) sentencing factors and by failing to explain adequately the reasons for imposing an 18-month sentence. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1176 (9th Cir.2006), and find none. The record reflects that the district court considered the section 3583(e) sentencing factors, and adequately explained why an above-Guidelines sentence was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-26\">Gomez also contends that the victim who addressed the court at the disposition hearing was only a \u201csecondary victim\u201d of Gomez\u2019s underlying offense because he suffered no financial loss, that he should not have been permitted to address the court, and that the government should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>have disclosed that he suffered no financial loss. These contentions are unavailing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(a)(4) and (e) (any person directly and proximately harmed by the commission of a federal crime is a crime victim who may address the district court in a supervised release proceeding). Furthermore, the record reflects that the district court was aware that the testifying victim suffered no financial loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b827-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
