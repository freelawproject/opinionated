Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-23\">While on probation for a drug conviction, Appellant pled true to three charges of drug usage/possession and one violation for failure to report for drug testing. Revoking her probation, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>gave an above-Guideline sentence of one year to allow time for participation in a drug rehabilitation program. Counsel objected because of the sentence\u2019s length and the court\u2019s drug treatment consideration. The judge responded that he could give Robles a \u201cstraight sentence ... [wjith no mention of drug treatment\u201d and also noted the statutory maximum in the case (5 years) was under consideration. After the government concurred that lengthening the sentence for treatment purposes would violate <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2393, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011), the district court cited the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) and restated that the sentence would be one year. The court acknowledged it could not and, in fact, was not sentencing primarily on the need for Robles to complete a drug program. Treatment was mentioned again as a \u201cstrong recommendation,\u201d but not an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The sentence here is reviewed under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). We first assess whether the district court committed procedural error and then consider the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Appellant contends that the sentence still violates <em>Tapia </em>and that it is unnecessarily long; both arguments rely on Robles\u2019s belief that the treatment program was the primary consideration of the court. The government responds that no error took place because the court substituted proper reasons in response to the objection and stated the drug program was only a secondary justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">We hold there was neither procedural nor substantive error here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After recognizing its initial mistake, the court explicitly focused on punishment, incapacitation, and deterrence. Reasonable considerations\u2014the repetitive nature of the crimes and Robles\u2019s implicit rejection of leniency previously shown her\u2014provide a valid foundation for the court\u2019s decision and references to treatment as an <em>additional </em>factor do not constitute error. <em>See Tapia, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2392. While Appellant\u2019s Guidelines range was 3-9 months, the one year sentence was well under the statutory maximum and, given the number of offenses at issue, we cannot say it was plainly unreasonable. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-21\">. Even if this were not the case, it is clear from the hearing record that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
