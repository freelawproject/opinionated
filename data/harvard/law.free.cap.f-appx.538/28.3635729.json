Montante, which denied his motion to transfer venue to New York, N.Y. and his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Romain Chrysostome Ngassaki, </em>No. A088 935 706 (B.I.A. May 22, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 935 706 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo June 28, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the denial of a motion to change venue for abuse of discretion. <em>See Monter v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 546, 558-59 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Lovell v. INS, </em>52 F.3d 458, 460 (2d Cir.1995). We find an abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">Ngassaki argues that the BIA abused its discretion because it: (1) relied on a non-existent holding by the IJ; (2) erroneously found that there was no good cause for the transfer; and (3) erroneously found that he was not prejudiced by the denial. First, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the IJ did not err in rejecting Ngassaki\u2019s motion to transfer venue for failure to follow the rules relies on the IJ\u2019s finding as to Ngassaki\u2019s April 2009 motion, not his subsequently filed July 2009 motion upon which his appeal was based. Although a mischaracterization of the record may not constitute an abuse of discretion where it is clear that the BIA thoroughly reviewed the record and determined, in a sufficient exercise of discretion, that a venue transfer was not warranted, <em>see Lovell, </em>52 F.3d at 460, there is no indication that the BIA made such a thorough review of the record before upholding the denial of venue transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">Even assuming, however, that the BIA did consider the good cause factors, its conclusion that those factors failed to establish good cause constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>See Monter, </em>430 F.3d at 559; <em>Lovell, </em>52 F.3d at 461. Similar to <em>Monter, </em>Ngassaki has shown that he resided in the desired venue along with all of his witnesses and his counsel, who was unable to represent him in the original venue. Moreover, he has demonstrated that the government did not oppose the transfer. Finally, as to prejudice, the agency\u2019s conclusory finding that \u201cthere was no due process violation\u201d is insufficiently detailed for us to review its findings and therefore constitutes an abuse of discretion. \u201cWhen faced with cursory, summary or conclusory statements from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the BIA, we cannot presume anything other than ... an abuse of discretion, since the BIA\u2019s denial of relief can be affirmed only the basis articulated in the decision ... and we cannot assume that the BIA considered factors that it failed to mention in its decision.\u201d <em>Anderson v. McElroy, </em>953 F.2d 803, 806 (2d Cir.1992) (citations and quotations omitted); <em>see also Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision ... is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or eonclusory statements.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Nor can we be confident that Ngassaki suffered no prejudice, given the effect that the denial of the venue transfer may have had on the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. Specifically, the BIA upheld the credibility determination primarily due to inconsistencies between Ngassaki\u2019s testimony and that of his witnesses, who appeared only by telephone or affidavit. The location of the proceedings thus may have affected the adverse credibility determination. This concern is particularly acute given the IJ\u2019s statements questioning the credibility of a critical witness\u2014including his concerns that she was relying on documentation rather than speaking from memory during her telephonic testimony\u2014and unavailability of other witnesses. Because we cannot know whether the credibility determination would survive the BIA\u2019s review if all appropriate factors were fully considered, we remand to allow the BIA to determine in the first instance whether Ngassaki was prejudiced by the arbitrary denial of the requested change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the proceedings remanded to the BIA for further consideration of the motion to change venue and for any additional necessary proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
