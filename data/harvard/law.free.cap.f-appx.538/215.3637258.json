We will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-25\">Because the parties are familiar with the history and facts of the case, we will recount the events in summary fashion. Liu was granted asylum in 2005, but the Board reversed the decision on the Government\u2019s appeal. We granted Liu\u2019s petition for review and remanded the matter for further proceedings, noting that the BIA had failed to address pertinent evidence. <em>See Liu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>300 Fed.Appx. 137 (3d Cir.2008). The Board then issued an order remanding to the IJ for further proceedings and a new decision. A new master hearing was held on September 7, 2011, at which Liu was questioned about the status of her husband and her attempt to authenticate two village notices she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>presented in support of her application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ issued a written opinion finding that Liu had failed to meet her burden of proof for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). The BIA dismissed Liu\u2019s appeal, agreeing that Liu had failed to meet her burden of proof as to asylum and withholding of removal, and that she had waived any claims for relief under the CAT by failing to address the issue in her brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Liu then filed a timely, counseled petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including findings regarding likelihood of persecution, <em>see Huang v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>620 F.3d 372, 382-83 (3d Cir.2010), under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Brise-no-Flores v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 226, 228 (3d Cir.2007). We uphold the factual findings \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Although the IJ found that Liu was a credible witness in testifying to her genuine fear of persecution, thereby satisfying the first, subjective component of the \u201cwellfounded fear of persecution\u201d test, <em>see Yu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 346, 348 (3d Cir.2008), the facts of record do not establish the required second, objective component of the test, namely, that her fear of persecution is objectively reasonable, <em>id. </em>The BIA properly considered and weighed State Department reports which provided evidence contradicting Liu\u2019s claim that her fear of persecution is objectively reasonable, <em>see Yu, </em>513 F.3d at 349 (State Department reports may constitute substantial evidence), and also gave close consideration to the evidence submitted by Liu. It considered the documents Liu submitted from China, including two unsigned, unauthenticated notices from the \u201cVillage Committee\u201d purportedly addressed to Liu\u2019s husband, and a letter from Liu\u2019s mother-in-law. However, as the BIA\u2019s opinion explained in detail, because the record reflects that such documents were either unauthenticated or lacked minimal indicia of trustworthiness, the BIA gave them less weight in its consideration of Liu\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">While we have held that failure to authenticate under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.6 does not warrant \u201cper se exclusion of documentary evidence, and a petitioner is permitted to prove authenticity in another manner,\u201d the BIA correctly held that Liu\u2019s failure to authenticate her evidence in any manner undermines its evidentiary value. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 212, 218 n. 6 (3d Cir.2005). The first Village Committee Notice is confusing, as it appears that it is addressed to a woman. A.R. 100.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>although Liu testified that village officials told her mother-in-law that the notices would never be authenticated, the unsworn letter from Liu\u2019s mother-in-law does not mention this statement, nor does it indicate that she made any other attempt to authenticate the notices.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given the unauthenticated statements, and the other record evidence, including the State Department reports, the record does not compel us to find that Liu has an objectively reasonable fear of persecution. As she failed to meet the burden of proof for entitlement to asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the higher burden for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). <em>See Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 182 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\">. Liu argues that a \"master calendar was held on June 29, 2010\" and that the transcript of the hearing is missing from the record. Petitioner's Brief at 17, 23. However, a \"Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings,\u201d dated June 29, 2010, states that the master hearing was reset for August 24, 2010, \"for DHS to retrieve its record\u2014by agreement off record.\u201d A.R. 280. The notice is stamped, \u201cThis notice served on both parties in open court on above date by IJ A. Garcy.\u201d Id. Thus, it appears that both parties were present on June 29, 2010, and in proceedings off the record, agreed to continue the hearing to a later date (the hearing eventually took place on September 7, 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\">. Liu does not contest the finding that she waived any claims for CAT relief, so we will not address those claims further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b244-12\">. The notice states in part, \"If you were Chinese citizen and had one child, you would be the object to insert an IUD.\u201d It notes that Liu and her husband have two children, and concludes that her husband is required \"to have ligation operation.\u201d A.R. 100. While it is possible that the \"you\u201d in the first sentence is used in a general sense, the rest of the notice appears to use the word \"you\u201d to specifically refer to Liu's husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b245-15\">. Liu argues that she cannot challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that the documents were not properly authenticated because the transcript of the June 29, 2010 hearing is missing. However, as noted, it appears that Liu\u2019s attorney agreed to proceed off the record on that date. Further, at the merits hearing on September 7, 2011, after determining that the notices had not been properly authenticated, the IJ asked Liu\u2019s attorney if he had any response about the lack of authentication, and he said he did not. A.R. 90. Thus, if he disagreed with the IJ\u2019s authentication requirements, he had an opportunity to state his objections on the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
