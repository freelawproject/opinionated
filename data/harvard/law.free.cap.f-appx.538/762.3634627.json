Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zeha-tye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Juan Francisco failed to establish past persecution on account of an actual or imputed political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (forced recruitment alone does not suffice to show persecution on account of political opinion). Because Juan Francisco failed to present his \u201csocial group\u201d argument to the BIA, we do not consider it. <em>See Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 988 (9th Cir.2000). Having failed to establish past persecution, Juan Francisco is not entitled to a presumption of future persecution. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1096 (9th Cir.2002). Juan Francisco does not argue that he otherwise established a well-founded fear of future persecution. Accordingly, his asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s determination that Juan Francisco is not eligible for NACARA relief. <em>See Ixcot v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 1202, 1213-14 (9th Cir.2011). Juan Francisco argues that the BIA found that he credibly testified regarding completion of an <em>ABC </em>registration form, and that it erred as a matter of law by requiring him to prove that the form was properly filed. We reject this argument because, contrary to his assertion, the BIA did not find that the document Juan Francisco signed was an <em>ABC </em>registration form.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b791-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
