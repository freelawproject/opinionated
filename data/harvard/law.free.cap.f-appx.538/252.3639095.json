We lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2006), and find that Chen has failed to raise a constitutional claim or question of law that would fall under the exception set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (2006). <em>See Gomis v. Holder, </em>571 F.3d 353, 358-59 (4th Cir.2009). Given this jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of her asylum claims. Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Chen also contends that the agency erred in denying her request for withholding of removal. \u201cWithholding of removal is available under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1281(b)(3) if the alien shows that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal because of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Gomis, </em>571 F.3d at 359 (citations omitted); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2006). An alien \u201cmust show a \u2018clear probability of persecution\u2019 on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Djadjou v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 265, 272 (4th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 788, 184 L.Ed.2d 581 (2012). Based on our review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Chen failed to establish that she faces a clear probability of persecution in China based upon her religion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review in part and deny the petition for review in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-11\"> Chen has failed to raise any challenges to the denial of her request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. She has therefore waived appellate review of this claim. <em>See Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
