In spring 2011, faced with possible budget cuts, Brookeland decided to reorganize its bus routes, which would eliminate the need for one bus driver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Brookeland, it decided that Kilgore would be the eliminated driver because he had the most job performance issues. So it did not send Kilgore a notice of reasonable assurance of employment that spring.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The school superintendent met with Kilgore to inform him of the district\u2019s decision. He explained that the bus driver position was being eliminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>due to budget cuts and, according to Kil-gore, noted that Kilgore was \u201celigible for retirement.\u201d Kilgore was 72 years old at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Over the summer of 2011, the Texas Legislature passed a budget that allowed Brookeland to retain all five bus routes. One of Brookeland\u2019s teachers, John Thacker, expressed an interest in the reinstated bus driver position, and the superintendent hired him. According to the superintendent, he selected Thacker for the bus driver position rather than contacting Kilgore because he preferred to have a bus driver without performance issues. Thacker was 54 years old when Brookeland hired him.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Kilgore filed suit against Brookeland in September 2011, alleging that Brookeland discriminated against him on the basis of his age when it terminated his employment as a bus driver, in violation of the ADEA and the Texas Labor Code. Following discovery, Brookeland filed a motion for summary judgment on both claims. The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, who issued a report and recommendation finding that Kilgore did not proffer direct evidence of discrimination and failed to rebut Brookeland\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate Kilgore. Kilgore filed his objections to the report, which the district court overruled. Upon <em>de novo </em>review, the district court agreed with the magistrate judge, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and granting Brookeland\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Kilgore appeals, arguing that the district court erred in concluding that he presented no direct evidence of discrimination and failed to rebut Brookeland\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reason for terminating him.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">We \u201creview a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as did the district court.\u201d <em>Stults v. Conoco, Inc., </em>76 F.3d 651, 654 (5th Cir.1996). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cWe view facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Widnall, </em>99 F.3d 710, 713 (5th Cir.1996). But we \u201cmay affirm summary judgment on any legal ground raised below, even if it was not the basis for the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Performance Autoplex II Ltd. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>322 F.3d 847, 853 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Kilgore first argues that the superintendent\u2019s comment that Kilgore was \u201celigible for retirement\u201d is sufficient direct evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his discrimination claim. A plaintiff may prove his discrimination claim by direct evidence or he may follow the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to prove his case with indirect evidence. <em>See Reed v. Neopost USA, Inc., </em>701 F.3d 434, 441 (5th Cir.2012) (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). \u201cDirect evidence of discrimination is evidence which, if believed, would prove the existence of a fact (i.e., unlawful discrimination) without any inferences or presumptions.\u201d <em>Bodenheimer v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>5 F.3d 955, 958 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see Moss v. BMC Software, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 917, 929 (5th Cir.2010) (explaining that, \u201cfor an age-based comment to be probative of an employer\u2019s discriminatory intent, it must be direct and unambiguous, allowing a reasonable jury to conclude without any inferences or presumptions that age was an impermissible factor in the decision to terminate the employee,\u201d and for such evidence to be sufficient to prove age discrimination, it must be \u201c1) age related, 2) proximate in time to the employment deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>sion, 3) made by an individual with authority over the employment decision at issue, and 4) related to the employment decision at issue\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We agree with Brookeland and the district court that the superintendent\u2019s alleged comment that Kilgore was \u201celigible for retirement\u201d is not direct evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Brookeland terminated Kilgore because of his age. The superintendent\u2019s \u201cstatement simply recognized a fact concerning\u201d Kilgore\u2019s eligibility, \u201can observation which did not imply\u201d that his eligibility \u201cwas the reason for discharge.\u201d <em>E.E.O.C. v. Tex. Instruments Inc., </em>100 F.3d 1173, 1181 (5th Cir.1996). And \u201c[t]his interpretation of the statement is consistent with the context in which it was allegedly made,\u201d as it was natural for the superintendent to inform Kilgore of the benefits to which he was entitled upon his termination. <em>Id. </em>Nothing in the superintendent\u2019s comment suggests that Kilgore was terminated <em>because of </em>his eligibility for retirement; therefore, the comment is not direct evidence of discrimination. The district court did not err in concluding that there was no genuine issue of direct evidence of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Although Kilgore did not provide direct evidence of discrimination, he may nevertheless prove his case using the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>evidentiary framework. <em>See Bienkowski v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>851 F.2d 1503, 1504 (5th Cir.1988). Under this procedure, he must first establish a prima facie case of age discrimination. <em>See id. </em>at 1504-05. The burden of production then shifts to Brookeland to rebut the presumption of discrimination created by the prima facie case, which it does \u201cby articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its disparate treatment\u201d of Kilgore. <em>Id. </em>at 1505. If Brooke-land carries its burden, Kilgore must prove that Brookeland\u2019s \u201creasons are pretexts for unlawful discrimination either by showing that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated\u201d Brookeland or by showing that Brookeland\u2019s \u201creason is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Kilgore \u201cretains the burden of persuading the fact finder that impermissible discrimination motivated the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">To establish a prima facie case that Brookeland discriminated against him because of his age in violation of the AJDEA, Kilgore must show that \u201c(1) he was discharged; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he was within the protected class at the time of discharge; and (4) he was either i) replaced by someone outside the protected class, ii) replaced by someone younger, or iii) otherwise discharged because of his age.\u201d <em>Bodenheimer, </em>5 F.3d at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Kilgore has established his prima facie case. He was discharged from his position as a bus driver for Brookeland; he was qualified to be a bus driver; he was 72 years old when he was discharged; and he was replaced by Thacker, who was 54 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">In response, Brookeland was required to provide a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the discharge. There is some confusion here as to when Brooke-land discharged Kilgore. Brookeland inconsistently claims at some points that it discharged him in spring 2011, when it decided not to send Kilgore a letter of reasonable assurance, and at other points that it did not discharge him until late summer, when it decided to rehire Thatcher rather than Kilgore as the fifth bus driver. Brookeland, however, has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for each of these decisions. It asserted that it did not send the letter of reasonable assurance because it planned to reduce the number of bus drivers from five to four in the face of possible budget <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>cuts. A reduction in force is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for discharge. <em>See Tex. Instruments, </em>100 F.3d at 1181. And it explained that it made its decision to fill the reinstated fifth bus driver position with Thatcher rather than Kilgore because it preferred a bus driver without job performance issues. Performance deficiencies are also a legitimate reason for discharge. <em>See Davis v. W. Cmty. Hosp., </em>786 F.2d 677, 683 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The burden thus fell on Kilgore to rebut these legitimate reasons. He has failed to show a genuine issue of pretext with respect to either explanation. He did not attempt to show that Brookeland\u2019s fear of budget cuts was unwarranted. Neither did he contend that the job performance concerns Brookeland cited were untrue or that other bus drivers employed by Brookeland had more numerous or serious performance issues. He has, therefore, not created a genuine issue that these reasons are unworthy of credence. Furthermore, the only evidence Kilgore supplied of an age-based motive is the superintendent\u2019s comment concerning Kilgore\u2019s retirement eligibility, which, by itself, is an insufficient basis for a reasonable jury to conclude that Kilgore\u2019s age more likely motivated Brookeland\u2019s decision to discharge him than either of Brookeland\u2019s proffered reasons. The district court did not err when it determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">For the reasons given above, the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for Brookeland is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-9\">. The district court also granted Brookeland summary judgment on Kilgore\u2019s Texas Labor Code claim. He does not pursue a challenge of that decision on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-10\">. At various points in the record, Brookeland inconsistently claims that it made the final decision to eliminate the route in the spring and that it made the contingent decision to eliminate the route if the anticipated budget cuts were implemented, but did not make a final decision in the spring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-20\">. As Brookeland explains, a notice of reasonable assurance of employment is a letter that a school district provides to at-will employees who work only when school is in session. Districts send the letters near the end of the school year to employees that they anticipate employing in the coming school year. These letters do not guarantee employment. Kil-gore received such a letter in all his years of employment by Brookeland prior to 2011, except for 2006, when he quit his job.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
