Abrams, denying their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Shkelzen Sylaj, Ariana Sylaj, </em>Nos. A088 533 483/84 (B.I.A. Feb. 25, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A088 533 483/84 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 13, 2009). Petitioners additionally seek review of an October 31, 2011 order of the BIA denying their motion to reopen the immigration proceedings. <em>In re Shkelzen Sylaj, Ariana Sylaj, </em>Nos. A088 533 483/84 (B.I.A. Oct. 31, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions. <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The agency\u2019s determination that Petitioners have not demonstrated past persecution on account of their family membership is supported by substantial evidence. Shkelzen\u2019s uncle committed the crime that started the \u201cblood feud,\u201d and Shkelzen was only lightly wounded when his uncle was murdered, which suggest that Shkelzen was not a target of his uncle\u2019s murderers. Furthermore, neither Shkelzen nor any member of his family in Albania has been harmed since his uncle\u2019s death in 1995. The agency\u2019s determination that Petitioners do not have a well-founded fear of persecution is also supported by substantial evidence. Shkelzen was not a target of his uncle\u2019s murderers. Neither Shkelzen nor any member of his family in Albania has been harmed since the uncle\u2019s death in 1995. The Albanian government has recently increased the penalties for committing murder in furtherance of a blood feud, and has criminalized mere participation in a blood feud. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng, </em>562 F.3d at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">In its February 2011 decision, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Petitioners\u2019 request for remand to the IJ for consideration of additional evidence, because the BIA considered the additional evidence, and it did not negate the substantial evidence supporting the agency\u2019s factual determinations that Petitioners had not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Sanusi v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 193, 201 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Since the agency did not err in finding that Petitioners failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution, it reasonably denied them withholding of removal and CAT relief, as those claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Similarly, the evidence that Petitioners submitted with their motion to reopen, taken together with previously submitted evidence, did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for the relief sought, since it also did not negate the substantial evidence supporting the agency\u2019s factual determinations that Petitioners had not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen. <em>Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). Moreover, contrary to Petitioners\u2019 contention, the BIA\u2019s October 2011 decision reflects that the BIA considered the entire record in deciding the motion to reopen. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 97 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]hen faced with a motion to reopen, the Board has an obligation to consider the record as a whole.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DENIED and the pending motion for a stay of removal in these petitions is DISMISSED as moot. The pending request for oral argument in these petitions is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
