Western Carolina Univ., </em>2012 WL 6728360 (W.D.N.C. Dec. 28, 2012). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
