We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Cholla Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-26\">The district court properly dismissed Missud\u2019s claims against the State of California on the basis of Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>See Montana v. Goldin (In re Pegasus Gold Corp.), </em>394 F.3d 1189, 1195 (9th Cir.2005) (absent waiver, state and its agencies are immune under the Eleventh Amendment from private actions in federal court).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-27\">The district court properly dismissed Missud\u2019s claims against the City and County of San Francisco, and its affiliated departments and agencies, because Missud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cognizable claim under federal law or raise a substantial federal issue. <em>See South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 369, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976) (\u201cThe authority of police to seize and remove from the streets vehicles impeding traffic or threatening public safety and convenience is beyond challenge.\u201d); <em>Provincial Gov\u2019t of Marinduque v. Placer Dome, Inc., </em>582 F.3d 1083, 1086-87 (9th Cir.2009) (discussing requirements for federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331); <em>see also Cholla Ready Mix, Inc., </em>382 F.3d at 973 (courts need not accept as true conclu-sory allegations, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Missud\u2019s first motion for reconsideration because Missud failed to establish grounds for such relief. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v. ACandS, Inc., 5 </em>F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir.1993) (setting forth standard of review and factors regarding reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We do not review the district court\u2019s order denying Missud\u2019s second motion for reconsideration because Missud did not file an amended notice of appeal from that order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Missud\u2019s motions dated July 17 and 24, 2013 for judicial notice of voluminous irrelevant documents filed with the district court, including those filed during the pen-dency of this appeal, are denied. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Missud\u2019s contentions regarding alleged corruption in the federal and state judiciaries, fraud, and conspiracies against him, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b837-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
