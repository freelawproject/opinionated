Because Taylor did not have three qualifying \u201cstrikes\u201d at the time he filed this appeal, we grant his motion to proceed in forma pauperis in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-22\">We also conclude that Taylor did not have three qualifying strikes at the time he filed this action in the District Court. We have reviewed the three cases that the District Court identified as strikes, and only two qualify. <em>See Owens v. Isaac, </em>487 F.3d 561, 563 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of \u00a7 1915(g)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Specifically, the dismissal of <em>Taylor v. Francis, </em>No. 4:12-cv-613, is not a qualifying strike because only some of the claims asserted were dismissed as legally frivolous, while others were dismissed without prejudice for improper joinder. The plain language in \u00a7 1915(g) requires that the entire action be dismissed on one or more of three enumerated grounds, i.e., as frivolous, malicious, or for failing to state a claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g) (instructing that three-strikes bar applies if a prisoner has on three or more occasions while detained brought an action or appeal in federal court that was dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failing to state claim); <em>Tolbert v. Stevenson, </em>635 F.3d 646, 649-55 (4th Cir.2011) (collecting cases for the proposition that \u201caction\u201d in \u00a7 1915(g) unambiguously means the entire case or suit and thus that an inmate\u2019s entire \u201caction or appeal\u201d must be dismissed on one or more of the enumerated grounds to count as strike); <em>see also Orr v. Clements, </em>688 F.3d 463, 466 (8th Cir.2012) (citing <em>Tolbert </em>for the proposition that \u201caction\u201d under \u00a7 1915(g) means \u201centire \u2018case\u2019 or \u2018suit\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the \u00a7 1915(g) dismissal, and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
