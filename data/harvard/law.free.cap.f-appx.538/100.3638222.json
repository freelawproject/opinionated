We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). Here, an independent review of the record and relevant case law reveals that the district court properly dismissed Tucker\u2019s claims as time-barred. We affirm for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its thorough January 4, 2013 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-20\">We have considered all of Tucker\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
