In an accompanying opinion filed today, we affirm on alternative grounds the district court\u2019s dismissal of Washington\u2019s claim that Defendants-Appellees substantially burdened his right to free exercise of religion in violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-l. In this summary order, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Washington\u2019s due process claim and reverse dismissal of his First Amendment retaliation claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">We review the grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo, </em>accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>See Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir.2009). The complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Since Washington filed his complaint <em>pro se, </em>\u201cit must be construed liberally to raise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>strongest arguments it suggests,\u201d <em>Walker v. Schult, </em>717 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted), although \u201ca <em>pro se </em>complaint must state a plausible claim for relief,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">1. Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u201cAlthough prison inmates necessarily have their liberty severely curtailed while incarcerated, they are nevertheless entitled to certain procedural protections when disciplinary actions subject them to further liberty deprivations such as loss of good-time credit or special confinement that imposes an atypical hardship.\u201d <em>Sira v. Morton, </em>380 F.3d 57, 69 (2d Cir.2004). When a prison disciplinary hearing may impose a punishment sufficient to trigger due process protections, \u201cthe inmate must receive: (1) advance written notice of the disciplinary charges; (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). In addition, \u201cdue process requires \u2018that there be some evidence to support the findings made in the disciplinary hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zavaro v. Coughlin, </em>970 F.2d 1148, 1152 (2d Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. at 457, 105 S.Ct. 2768); <em>see Luna v. Pico, </em>356 F.3d 481, 488 (2d Cir.2004) (explaining that this Court \u201clook[s] to see whether there was \u2018reliable evidence\u2019 of the inmate\u2019s guilt\u201d supporting the disciplinary decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Washington fails to raise a due process claim upon which relief may be granted because his complaint does not plausibly allege that Defendant-Appellee Paul Gonyea\u2019s (\u201cGonyea\u201d) disciplinary decision that Washington had \u201ccommunicat[ed] messages of a personal nature to an employee,\u201d thereby violating Rule 107.11, 7 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 270.2(B)(8)(h), lacked the support of at least some reliable evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Washington\u2019s complaint alleges that during the disciplinary hearing Gonyea heard testimony from Defendant-Appellee Tammi Chaboty (\u201cChaboty\u201d), corroborated by testimony from Defendant-Appellee Keith Granger (\u201cGranger\u201d), that Chaboty \u201cwas concerned\u201d when Washington handed her the Quran, that he had an \u201ceerie smile which was unnerving,\u201d and that his \u201cconduct [on] the night of the incident seemed inappropriate.\u201d The transcript of the proceeding also indicates that Gonyea interviewed the accuser, Chaboty, and in issuing his decision, relied upon Chaboty\u2019s written incident report and her testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although New York\u2019s Third Department found that the disciplinary decision was not based on <em>substantial </em>evidence, <em>Washington v. Selsky, </em>48 A.D.3d 864, 865, 850 N.Y.S.2d 720 (3d Dep\u2019t 2008) (annulling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Washington\u2019s disciplinary disposition), Chaboty\u2019s testimony and corroborating evidence constituted <em>some </em>evidence in support of the decision. Since the decision did not rest on \u201cblatantly implausible\u201d evidence, <em>Zavaro, </em>970 F.2d at 1152, or on hearsay accusations not independently assessed to be credible, <em>see Pico, </em>356 F.3d at 489-90, Washington\u2019s due process claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">II. First Amendment Retaliation Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Washington alleges that the Defendants-Appellees violated his First Amendment rights to free exercise of his religion and free speech when they retaliated against him for disseminating religious material to Chaboty. To prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a prisoner must demonstrate \u201c(1) that the speech or conduct at issue was protected, (2) that the defendant took adverse action against the plaintiff, and (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected [conduct] and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Espinal v. Goord, </em>558 F.3d 119, 128 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gill v. Pidlypchak, </em>389 F.3d 379, 380 (2d Cir.2004)). To be entitled to protection under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, a prisoner must make a threshold showing that \u201cthe disputed conduct substantially burden[ed] his sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d <em>Salahuddin v. Goord, </em>467 F.3d 263, 274-75 (2d Cir.2006). In determining whether a prisoner\u2019s conduct is motivated by a sincerely held religious belief, we do not \u201cevaluate the objective reasonableness of the prisoner\u2019s belief;\u201d <em>Ford v. McGinnis, </em>352 F.3d 582, 590 (2d Cir.2003); rather, our \u201cscrutiny extends only to whether a claimant sincerely holds a particular belief and whether the belief is religious in nature,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The district court erred in dismissing Washington\u2019s retaliation claims on the basis that he failed to plead that his act of giving the Quran to Chaboty constituted an exercise of his sincerely held religious beliefs. Washington alleged that he wanted to give Chaboty the Quran \u201cin response to her expressed interest to know about the religion of Islam\u201d and, significantly, that \u201che felt that he would be remissed [sic ] not to give her the book as it is the primary source of Islam.\u201d In his affidavit opposing dismissal, Washington stated that he believes it to be his \u201creligious duty to inform others about the religion of Islam, especially those who inquire about it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, read liberally and as a whole, the complaint alleges that Washington felt a sincere religious obligation to give the Quran to Chaboty, and while the contours of the burden standard are not precisely drawn, <em>see Salahuddin, </em>467 F.3d at 275 n. 5, the conduct alleged here\u2014that Washington was severely punished for engaging in protected activity\u2014rises to the level of a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Even if Defendants-Appellees substantially burdened Washington\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs, their actions do not constitute a constitutional deprivation if they were \u201creasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d <em>Redd v. Wright, </em>597 F.3d 532, 536 (2d Cir.2010) (quoting <em>O\u2019Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, </em>482 U.S. 342, 349, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987)); <em>see Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (articulating three-step analysis for determining reasonableness of a prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>regulation). As the district court correctly recognized, assessing the reasonableness of penological interests is a factual and context-specific inquiry that in this case is inappropriate at this preliminary stage of the proceedings. <em>See Ford, </em>352 F.3d at 596; <em>Salahuddin, </em>467 F.3d at 277. Furthermore, Washington alleges that Defendants-Appellees were motivated by personal prejudice and did not act against him for legitimate penological reasons. <em>See Shakur v. Selsky, </em>391 F.3d 106, 116 (2d Cir.2004) (reversing dismissal of prisoner\u2019s retaliation claim and noting that \u201ca failure to abide by established procedures or standards can evince an improper objective\u201d). Therefore, accepting the complaint\u2019s well-pled factual allegations as true, we conclude that Washington has plausibly alleged that the officers\u2019 actions were not reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Additionally, we note that Washington alleges that he was denied religious services while in Special Housing Unit (\u201cS.H.U.\u201d) pursuant to the discipline imposed by Gonyea. Although assigned pro bono counsel did not argue on appeal that this alleged deprivation constituted a violation of Washington\u2019s free exercise rights, our waiver doctrine is prudential, <em>see In re Nortel Networks Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>539 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam), and we address that claim here. While the complaint does not specify which official denied him religious services in S.H.U., a liberal reading of the complaint gives rise to a plausible inference that Chaboty and Granger were involved either directly or indirectly, and Washington has therefore adequately pled a violation of his First Amendment rights on that basis. On remand, the district court should allow Washington leave to amend his pleadings to add additional defendants if requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">III. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Finally, Defendants-Appellees argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct, as alleged, did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights. However, \u201cwhere a more specific intent is actually an element of the plaintiffs claim as defined by clearly established law, it can never be objectively reasonable for a government official to act with the intent that is prohibited by law.\u201d <em>Locurto v. Safir, </em>264 F.3d 154, 169 (2d Cir.2001). Here, Washington has plausibly alleged that Defendants-Appellees acted with an improper retaliatory motive. <em>See Bennett v. Goord, </em>343 F.3d 133, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cIn order to prevail on his retaliation claims, [plaintiff] bears the burden of showing ... that the [constitutionally protected] conduct was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse actions taken by prison officials.\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20, 22, 24, 39. Therefore, at this stage of the proceedings, Washington\u2019s allegations are sufficient to require deferral of the issue of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-10\">. Washington did not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his conspiracy claim on appeal, and we therefore deem that claim abandoned. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\">. Rule 107.11 is part of Rule Series 107, which addresses an inmate\u2019s \"Interference with an Employee or Other Person.\u201d 7 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 270.2(B)(8). Rule 107.11 provides in full,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">An inmate shall not harass an employee or any other person verbally or in writing. Prohibited conduct includes, but is not limited to, using insolent, abusive, or obscene language or gestures, or writing or otherwise communicating messages of a personal nature to an employee or any other person including a person subject of an order of protection with the inmate or who is on the inmate's negative correspondence list.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 270.2(B)(8)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b53-12\">. In considering a motion to dismiss, a court may consider both documents incorporated by reference into the complaint and unincorporated documents that are integral to the complaint and upon which the complaint heavily relies. <em>Chambers v.
