Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(1). We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider, <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791 (9th Cir.2005), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-25\">To the extent the BIA decided not to reopen under its sua sponte authority, we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See MejiaHernandez v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 818, 823-24 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-26\">Even assuming that the lawyer performed ineffectively, there was no abuse of discretion in denying the motion to reopen, because Petitioner failed to show prejudice. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (requiring prejudice to prevail on an ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>tance claim). Petitioner failed to show what additional evidence would have been offered had the BIA reopened the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">With respect to the motion to reconsider and the underlying merits, we lack jurisdiction to review the hardship determinations. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b848-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
