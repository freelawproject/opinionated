For the following reasons, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"ax-dedup-0\">In 2011, a grand jury returned a fourteen-count indictment charging Appellants and three others\u2014Jami Pearlman, Michele Quigley, and Randy Trost\u2014in all counts. Appellants pled guilty to Count Two of the indictment, which alleged that between January 2005 and February 2006, they and their codefendants operated a money-transmitting business without complying with federal registration requirements, thereby violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Appellants were owners and managers of Payment Processing Center, Inc. (\u201cPPC\u201d). They stipulated that PPC processed payments on behalf of offshore internet gambling companies. Appellants set up bank accounts through which PPC would receive wire transfers from these gambling companies. The gambling companies would then email to PPC the amount of money owed to certain bettors, and PPC would prepare and deliver checks from its accounts to the bettors. PPC would also prepare and deliver checks to local vendors of the gambling companies. PPC did not participate in the gambling business except for its transmission of money from the gambling companies to the bettors and vendors. PPC did not register with the United States Department of the Treasury as a money-transmitting business, as required by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5330.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">After Appellants pled guilty, the District Court determined that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3 was the appropriate offense guideline. The Court also applied a sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3131.1(a) for all three Appellants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It sentenced Donald Hellinger to thirty six months imprisonment and ordered him to pay a $10,000 f\u00edne; sentenced Ronald Hellinger to twenty seven months imprisonment; and sentenced Weisberg to twenty two months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">\n<em>A. Offense Guideline</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">Appellants argue that the District Court erred in identifying \u00a7 2S1.3 rather than \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l) as the applicable offense guideline. We review an \u201capplication of the Guidelines to the facts for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Blackmon, </em>557 F.3d 113, 118 (3d Cir.2009).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">Appendix A of the Sentencing Guidelines lists both \u00a7 2S1.3 and \u00a7 2S1.1 as applicable offense guidelines for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1960. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. A. \u201cIf more than one guideline section is referenced for the particular statute,\u201d Appendix A instructs courts to \u201cuse the guideline most appropriate for the offense conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Section 2S1.3 applies to the operation of a money-transmitting business without complying with state and federal registration requirements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1960(b)(1)(A) and (B). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2S1.3 cmt. Section 2S1.1, on the other hand, applies to money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1960(b)(1)(C). <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 2S1.1 cmt.; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1960(b)(1)(C) (referring to \u201cthe transportation or transmission of funds that are known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense or are intended to be used to promote or support unlawful activity\u201d). Appellants argue that \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l) is the applicable offense guideline because it more closely tracks the offense conduct charged against them. Although Appellants admit that the operation of an unlicensed money-transmitting business \u201cis certainly a central allegation of Count Two,\u201d they maintain that \u201cthe overwhelming weight of the alleged conduct describes service as the money laundering arm of illegal internet gambling businesses, through collection of bets and payment of winners, and through payment of invoices to vendors.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Appellants\u2019 offense conduct involved both the operation of an unlicensed money-transmitting business and money laundering. The District Court relied on the formal charging language of Count Two of the Indictment and Appellants\u2019 conduct in determining which offense guideline was more applicable. The language of Count Two\u2014\u201cknowingly conducted, controlled, managed, supervised, directed, and owned all or part of a money transmitting business ... while failing to comply with the money transmitting business registration requirements under Title 31, United States Code, Section 5330\u201d\u2014 charges a violation of \u00a7 1960(b)(1)(B), which corresponds with offense guideline \u00a7 2Sl.3.App. at 94. The Court\u2019s reliance on the charging language was proper. Thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in choosing \u00a7 2S1.3 as the more appropriate offense guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">\n<em>B. Sentencing Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">Appellants allege that the District Court erred in increasing the offense levels of Ronald Hellinger and Weisberg by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have held that because \u201cthe question of a defendant\u2019s aggravating role ... is \u2018essentially factual,\u2019 we will reverse the district court ... only if its conclusion is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>878 F.2d 125, 127 (3d Cir.1989). Here, the Court did not make independent factual findings, but instead adopted the findings in Appellants\u2019 PSRs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In such a case, we also apply the clear error standard of review. See <em>United States v. Belletiere, </em>971 F.2d 961, 969 (3d Cir.1992). The application of the enhancement is clearly erroneous \u201cif, after reviewing all of the evidence, we are left with a firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Under \u00a7 3B1.1 (a), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by four levels if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>court finds that the defendant \u201cwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 (a). If the defendant \u201cwas a manager or supervisor\u201d of such a criminal activity, the offense level is increased by three levels. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(b). The commentary to this section further requires the defendant to whom an enhancement under \u00a7 3B 1.1 applies to \u201chave been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B 1.1(a) cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Appellants do not dispute that the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. Instead, they argue that there is no evidence on the record of Weisberg or Ronald Hel-linger exercising control over another participant. We disagree. According to the PSRs, Jami Pearlman, one of the Appellants\u2019 co-defendants \u201cinformed the attorney who PPC hired to research the legality of their gambling payout business that PPC decided not to comply with the legal requirements for money transmitting businesses\u201d and she did so \u201con behalf of Donald Hellinger, Ronald Hellinger, and Michael Weisberg.\u201d Weisberg PSR \u00b633; Ronald Hellinger PSR \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Appellants alternatively argue that even if an enhancement under \u00a7 3B 1.1 applies to Weisberg and Ronald Hellinger, it should be the three-level enhancement for managers and supervisors under \u00a7 3B 1.1(b). The commentary to \u00a7 3B 1.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">In distinguishing a leadership and organizational role from one of mere management or supervision ... [factors the court should consider include the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00a7 3B 1.1 cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The extensive involvement of Weisberg and Ronald Hellinger in PPC\u2019s activities supports the four-level enhancement. Weisberg and Ronald Hellinger each owned 22.5% of PPC. Both were PPC account representatives for client companies and received commissions from the activity on these accounts. According to his PSR, Ronald Hellinger \u201cnegotiated an agreement between PPC and a trade association for foreign internet gambling companies ... so that PPC could be introduced to the companies and offer them payment services in the U.S.\u201d Ronald Hellinger PSR \u00b6 30. Weisberg signed the agreement between PPC and the trade association. Weisberg formed PPC. He, along with a co-defendant, opened several bank accounts into which offshore gambling companies could make deposits and was a signatory on those accounts. He established business agreements and controlled bank accounts into which proceeds of PPC\u2019s activities were deposited. On these facts, the District Court did not clearly err in applying the four-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">The District Court did not err in determining that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3 was the appropriate offense guideline and in applying the leadership enhancement to determine the sentences of Ronald Hellinger and Weisberg. We will affirm the judgments of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\">. Although the District Court did not explicitly state that it was applying the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement, the Court adopted the Presen-tence Investigation Reports (\"PSRs\u201d) which applied the enhancement for each Appellant. Neither Appellants nor the Government dispute that the Court applied this enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-19\">. Appellants contend that we should apply de novo review. However, the interpretation of a guideline provision is not at issue here. Rather, the issue is which offense guideline better fits the facts in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\">. The four-level enhancement was also applied to Donald Hellinger's sentence, but he does not appeal his sentence on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">. Appellants allege that because the Court did not make findings of fact on a contested issue, we must remand. However, failure to make findings on a contested issue does not require remand where the findings of fact \"are implicit in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Gricco, </em>277 F.3d 339, 362 (3d Cir.2002) <em>overruled on other grounds as stated in United States v. Cesare, </em>581 F.3d 206, 208 n. 3 (3d Cir.2009). Appellants do not dispute that the District Court adopted the findings from Appellants\u2019 PSRs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
