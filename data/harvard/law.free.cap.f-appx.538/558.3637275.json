He argues that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court mistakenly failed to fulfill its intention to award him a downward variance beyond the one-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>variance relating to his acceptance of responsibility. Navarro acknowledges that because he failed to object in the district court to the error he now raises, his argument is reviewed for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Under plain error review, Navarro must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\u201cThis court has held that questions of fact capable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing can never constitute plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Conn, </em>657 F.3d 280, 284 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Divining the district court\u2019s intent in selecting a sentence arguably is a question of fact that could have been resolved if a proper objection had been made, and as such, it could never be plain error. In any event, Navarro has failed to show that the district court made a clear or obvious error in selecting his sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. This is because Navarro has not shown that his interpretation of the district court\u2019s remarks at the sentencing hearing is the only plausible interpretation of those remarks. In light of Navarro\u2019s failure to show an error that is plain, we do not examine the remaining elements of the plain error test.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b586-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
