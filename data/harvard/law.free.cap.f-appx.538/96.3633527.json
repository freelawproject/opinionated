Phelps, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Lin Jia Yang, </em>No. A087 587 468 (B.I.A. Dec. 7, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A087 537 463 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 28, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-67 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">For applications such as Yang\u2019s, governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, \u201c[considering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility finding on the plausibility of an applicant\u2019s account, as well as inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(C); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. We \u201cdefer [ ] to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. As discussed below, the agency reasonably based its adverse credibility finding on the inconsistencies among Yang\u2019s testimony and evidence concerning the dates of his alleged beating and attempted arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In finding Yang not credible, the agency reasonably relied on the discrepancies between his testimony and the record evidence regarding the years in which: (1) village cadres allegedly detained, beat, and tortured him; and (2) police officers attempted to arrest him for promoting Falun Gong at his friend\u2019s book stand. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). While Yang contends that these inconsistencies were minor, the IJ reasonably found that they were significant because they related to the two seminal events underlying Yang\u2019s claim and, as such, the totality of the circumstances do not suggest that \u201cno reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Contrary to Yang\u2019s assertions, the agency did not ignore any of his corroborating evidence. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that the agency is presumed to have \u201ctaken into account all of the evidence before [it], unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise\u201d). Although Yang faults the IJ for failing to explicitly discuss each of his evidentiary submissions on the record, the agency is not required to \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each and every one of a petitioner\u2019s purported explanations for testimonial inconsistencies or evidentiary gaps.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the agency explicitly addressed Yang\u2019s friend\u2019s affidavit and found that it was inconsistent with Yang\u2019s testimony with respect to the dates of his beating and attempted arrest and, therefore, did not corroborate his claim. <em>See id. </em>at 342 (stating that generally the weight afforded to a petitioner\u2019s evidence lies largely within the discretion of the agency). Accordingly, the record does not compellingly suggest that the agency ignored Yang\u2019s corroborating evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 336 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Given the inconsistencies in Yang\u2019s testimony and between his testimony and corroborating evidence, the totality of the circumstances supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Moreover, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination necessarily precluded Yang\u2019s success on his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>relief, as those claims shared the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
