Johnson pled guilty, without a written plea agreement, to possession, with the intent to defraud, of fifteen or more counterfeit or unauthorized access devices in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(3) (2006). The district court sentenced Johnson to forty-eight months\u2019 imprisonment. Johnson\u2019s counsel has submitted a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 when it accepted Johnson\u2019s guilty plea and whether Johnson\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Johnson was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he did not do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-22\">Because Johnson did not move to withdraw his plea in the district court, the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error only. <em>United States v. Massenburg, </em>564 F.3d 337, 342-43 (4th Cir.2009) (stating that, in guilty plea context, defendant meets burden by showing reasonable probability that he would not have pled guilty but for Rule 11 omission). Our review of the guilty plea hearing transcript leads us to conclude that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Johnson\u2019s guilty plea and that the district court\u2019s minor omissions did not affect Johnson\u2019s substantial rights. Critically, the transcript reveals that the district court ensured the plea was supported by an independent basis in fact and that Johnson entered the plea knowingly and voluntarily with an understanding of the consequences. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we discern no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Johnson\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-23\">Turning to counsel\u2019s challenge to Johnson\u2019s sentence, we review for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In determining procedural reasonableness, we consider whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, gave the parties an opportunity to argue for an appropriate sentence, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, or failed to explain sufficiently the selected sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">If the sentence is free of significant procedural error, we review it for substantive reasonableness, \u201ctak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. When, as here, the sentence is within the properly calculated Guidelines range, we apply a presumption on appeal that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2010). Such a presumption is rebutted only if the defendant shows \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In this case, the district court correctly calculated and considered the advisory Guidelines range, heard argument from counsel, and gave Johnson the opportunity to allocute. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained that the within-Guidelines sentence of forty-eight months\u2019 imprisonment was warranted in light of Johnson\u2019s history and characteristics. Counsel offers no argument to rebut the presumption on appeal that Johnson\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Johnson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Johnson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
