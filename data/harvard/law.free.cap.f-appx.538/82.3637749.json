Van Wyke, denying Jiang\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Guang Qing Jiang, </em>No. A089 922 661 (B.I.A. July 11, 2012), <em>affg </em>No. A089 922 661 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 25, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions as to Jiang\u2019s credibility \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act, such as the application in this case, the agency may, \u201c[cjonsidering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility finding on the applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account, and inconsistencies in his statements and other record evidence, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 163-64. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">In finding Jiang not credible, the IJ reasonably relied on Jiang\u2019s demeanor, noting that his testimony appeared memorized from a script and was at times hesitant and evasive when deviating from that script. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). That finding is supported by the hearing transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is further supported by specific examples of inconsistencies between Jiang\u2019s testimony and other record evidence. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cWe can be still more confident in our review of observations about an applicant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>demeanor where, as here, they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimony.\u201d). Indeed, the agency reasonably found inconsistent statements regarding whether Jiang knew his fellow congregants in China from school, when he was fired from his job, and whether he had informed his fellow congregants in the United States of the harm he had suffered in the past. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 163-64. Jiang failed to provide compelling explanations for these discrepancies. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Finally, having questioned Jiang\u2019s credibility, the agency reasonably relied further on his failure to provide reliable corroborating evidence. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007). An applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate testimony may bear on credibility, either because the absence of particular corroborating evidence is viewed as suspicious, or because \u201cthe absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the agency reasonably declined to credit the letter from Jiang\u2019s father regarding his claim of past persecution because it was strikingly similar to Jiang\u2019s statement, and because it was prepared by an interested witness who was not available for cross-examination. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 524 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006). In addition, the agency reasonably noted that Jiang\u2019s father\u2019s letter did not corroborate his claimed fear of future persecution, and that Jiang failed to present the testimony of his current pastors or fellow congregants in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Given the lack of corroboration, as well as the demeanor and inconsistency findings, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, and was dispositive of Jiang\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167; <em>see also Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, we need not reach the agency\u2019s alternative burden of proof finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
