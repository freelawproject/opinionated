Zhu appeals his sentence arguing that the district court incorrectly determined that Zhu was responsible for 100 or more fraudulent documents. We disagree. The district court\u2019s conservative calculation was reasonable and supported by the preponderance of the evidence. Therefore, we affirm Zhu\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b743-24\">Zhu and his co-conspirators were charged with helping individuals fraudulently obtain Illinois drivers\u2019 licenses by providing them with fake passports, fake proof of residency documents, and Social Security cards belonging to third parties. On May 14, 2012, Zhu entered a guilty plea on two counts: conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Count One), and aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) (Count Five). As part of his plea, Zhu admitted that from 2004 to 2007 he referred customers and supplied Social Security cards to his co-conspirators, Lili Liu and Jun Yun Zhang. Specifically, Zhu admitted to referring \u201capproximately 20 to 30 customers to Lili Liu\u201d and to providing Social Security cards to Jun Yun Zhang \u201con multiple occasions.\u201d At sentencing, the Probation Office provided specifics in its Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) regarding the number of documents attributable to Zhu, and found that Zhu supplied Jun Yun Zhang with 80 to 200 Social Security cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-25\">The PSR concluded that Zhu was responsible for 100 or more documents and recommended a nine-level increase to his offense level. Zhu objected, arguing that a six-level enhancement was appropriate because he was responsible for 25 to 99 documents. Crediting the PSR\u2019s findings, the district court concluded that Zhu was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>responsible for 100 or more documents in the conspiracy and applied a nine-level increase to Zhu\u2019s offense level, which yielded an offense level of 23 and resulted in an advisory Guidelines range of 46 to 57 months for Count One. The district court sentenced Zhu to 41 months for Count One. As Count Five carried a mandatory minimum sentence of two years to run consecutive to Count One, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), Zhu\u2019s total sentence was 65 months\u2019 imprisonment. Zhu appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The only issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in finding that Zhu\u2019s offense involved 100 documents or more. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2), a defendant\u2019s offense level for dealing in fraudulent documents is subject to increase based on the number of fraudulent documents involved. The provision specifies a six-level increase for 25 to 99 documents, and a nine-level enhancement for 100 or more documents. We review challenges to factual determinations at sentencing for clear error. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>563 F.3d 572, 577 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Zhu challenges the facts on which the lower court relied. He argues that there was no evidence above the 20 minimum number of customers Zhu admitted he referred to Lili Liu. But Zhu\u2019s position is unsupported by the record. In his plea agreement, Zhu admits to providing Social Security cards to Jun Yun Zhang on various occasions. In addition to Zhu\u2019s plea agreement, the district court relied on the facts in the PSR, which were based in part on the grand jury statements of Lili Liu and Tao Zhang (son of Jun Yun Zhang) and a proffer interview with Jun Yun Zhang.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The court did not clearly err in relying on the PSR and finding that the included statements were reliable. In calculating a defendant\u2019s sentencing range, a court may consider all relevant information that has \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3 (2011); <em>United States v. Morales, </em>655 F.3d 608, 646 (7th Cir.2011), and may adopt the factual findings of the PSR if it has indicia of reliability, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(6)(D); <em>United States v. Berkey, </em>161 F.3d 1099, 1101-02 (7th Cir.1998). In this case, the grand jury statements and proffer interview provided detailed, corroborated testimony by co-conspirators. <em>See United States v. Ewers, </em>54 F.3d 419, 421-22 (7th Cir.1995) (holding that self-interested witnesses can be reliable when they provide detailed testimony that is corroborated by other witnesses or facts). Both Lili Liu and Tao Zhang admitted to participating in the conspiracy. They implicated Zhu in their criminal activities and he admitted that he worked with them in the conspiracy. So the court did not err in finding that there was reliable evidence of criminal activity undertaken by Zhu other than the customers he admitted referring to Lili Liu.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">But Zhu\u2019s main argument is that the district judge erred under the Sentencing Guidelines by including multiple documents used by one customer in his calculation of documents attributable to Zhu. This argument is unsupported by a complete reading of the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Application Note 2 of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2) establishes that multiple documents that are part of a set intended for use by one customer only count as one document. Zhu\u2019s argument that the judge violated Application Note 2 is based on a small portion of the proceeding where the judge began adding multiple documents provided to the same customer. However, when defense counsel noted that Application Note 2 prohibited calculating in that manner, the court corrected its calculation. The court ultimately reached 100 docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>ments by adding the 20 minimum customers Zhu admitted to referring to Lili Liu to the 80 minimum Social Security cards the PSR found Zhu supplied for Jun Yun Zhang\u2019s customers. The district court\u2019s ultimate calculation only counts one document per customer and does not violate U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2) Application Note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Since the district court did not clearly err in relying on the PSR or in calculating the number of documents attributable to Zhu under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2), we do not conclude that the court clearly erred in finding that Zhu was responsible for 100 or more documents and applying a nine-level enhancement to his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
