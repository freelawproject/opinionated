Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293, 296 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s findings about the quantity of drugs on which a sentence should be based, including amounts that were part of a common plan or scheme, are findings of fact which are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>964 F.2d 454, 457-58 (5th Cir.1992). The district court here did not clearly err in light of the temporal proximity and similarity of the offenses <em>(e.g., </em>transporting similar quantities of marijuana in similar packaging in a tractor trailer from a similar starting point after similar stops to a similar destination).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b605-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
