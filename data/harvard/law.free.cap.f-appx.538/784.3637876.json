Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Singh\u2019s contention that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance with his motion to reopen to adjust status based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen because Singh failed to exhaust this claim before the BIA. <em>See Tijani v. Holder, </em>628 F.3d 1071, 1080 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cWe lack jurisdiction to review legal claims not presented in an alien\u2019s administrative proceedings before the BIA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">In his opening brief, Singh failed to raise, and therefore waived, any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to his asylum application. <em>See Rizk v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 1083, 1091 n. 3 (9th Cir.2011) (a petitioner waives an issue by failing to raise it in the opening brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">To the extent Singh challenges the agency\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen to adjust status based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen, the challenge is unavailing because, as he concedes, the evidence was insufficient to establish a strong likelihood of a bona fide marriage. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir.2003); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(a)(1 )(iii)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
