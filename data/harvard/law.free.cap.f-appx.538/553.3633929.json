FACTUAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">Officer Michael Anthony Milazzo<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> approached Shane Damond in a gas station parking lot, suspecting him of operating a stolen vehicle. Although Milazzo and certain eyewitnesses present conflicting accounts of the ensuing interaction, it is undisputed that Milazzo fatally shot Damond. Shortly thereafter, an ambulance transported Damond\u2019s body to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">None of the Siblings were at the gas station when Milazzo shot Damond, but all of them learned that Damond may have been shot. Two of the Siblings went to the scene, but when they arrived Da-mond\u2019s body had already been transported to the hospital. The Siblings proceeded to the hospital to get further information, but the officer at the hospital and the chief of police, Jim Craft, refused to tell the Siblings whether the individual who had been shot was Damond. Consequently, none of the Siblings saw Damond\u2019s body or knew whether the deceased individual was, in fact, their brother until Damond\u2019s body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>was released to a funeral home nearly a week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The Siblings sued for emotional distress under Louisiana\u2019s bystander recovery statute, La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 2315.6 (2010). The district court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the Siblings\u2019 claims with prejudice. The Siblings appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Gen. Universal Sys., Inc. v. HAL, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 444, 448 (5th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party can show that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ.P. 56(a). Thus, summary judgment is proper \u201cagainst a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>United Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Hixson Bros., </em>453 F.3d 283, 285 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Louisiana\u2019s bystander recovery statute allows certain family members, including siblings, \u201cwho view an event causing injury to another person, or who come upon the scene of the event soon thereafter, [to] recover damages for mental anguish or emotional distress that they suffer as a result of the other person\u2019s injury.\u201d La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 2315.6. This statute is \u201cintended to allow recovery of bystander damages to compensate for the immediate shock of witnessing a traumatic event which caused the direct victim immediate harm that is severe and apparent.\u201d <em>Tra-han v. McManus, </em>728 So.2d 1273, 1279 (La.1999). It is not intended to \u201ccompensate for the anguish and distress that normally accompany an injury to a loved one under all circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">To that end, a bystander seeking recovery under this statute must view the injury-causing event or demonstrate a close temporal proximity between the occurrence of the event and the bystander\u2019s arrival upon the scene. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that \u201c[t]he requirement of temporal proximity has always been at the root of allowing recovery for emotional distress caused by an injury to another\u201d); <em>see also Vero-line v. Priority One EMS, </em>18 So.3d 1273, 1275-76 (La.2009) (providing that a claimant who did not view the injury-causing event must \u201ccome upon the accident scene soon after it has occurred and before any substantial change has taken place in the victim\u2019s condition\u201d). Importantly, this statute provides the sole means of such recovery in Louisiana. <em>See </em>La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 2315.6 (\u201cDamages suffered as a result of mental anguish or emotional distress for injury to another shall be recovered only in accordance with this Article\u201d); <em>Trahan, </em>728 So.2d at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">The Siblings do not claim that they witnessed the shooting. Instead, relying on <em>Louviere v. Louviere, </em>839 So.2d 57, 73 (La.Ct.App.2002), the Siblings seek to satisfy the temporal proximity requirement based on the anguish and uncertainty they experienced for nearly a week between the time of the shooting and confirmation of Damond\u2019s death. The court in <em>Louviere </em>affirmed damages under Article 2315.6 to family members of hostages when those family members had witnessed the hostage situation unfold from \u201cmere yards away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Louviere </em>plaintiffs experienced a deadly situation, in real-time, and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>emotional distress resulted from their experience <em>at the scene </em>of an ongoing incident. <em>See id. </em>These circumstances fell within the ambit of Article 2315.6 because the harm complained of arose from a contemporaneous experience of \u201can event causing injury to another person.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Here, in contrast, the Siblings\u2019 \u201cprolonged anguish\u201d caused by uncertainty over Damond\u2019s fate does not establish their physical, temporal proximity to Damond\u2019s shooting. Any decision not to release information about Damond\u2019s identity or status does not qualify as an \u201cinjury-causing event [of] which the [Siblings were] contemporaneously aware [as having] caused harm to [Damond].\u201d <em>See Trahan, </em>728 So.2d at 1280. Although uncertainty as to their brother\u2019s condition no doubt caused the Siblings anguish and distress, they do not allege emotional distress based on a contemporaneous observation of the shooting, which is the legally relevant event (\u201cas a result of the other person\u2019s [Damond\u2019s] injury\u201d) under the bystander statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Finally, the Siblings contend that Milazzo\u2019s shooting of Damond constitutes a negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Siblings have waived this theory of relief, however, by raising it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Forbush v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>98 F.3d 817, 822 (5th Cir.1996). Even if the Siblings had properly asserted the claim in the district court, a theory of relief based on negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress is precluded by Article 2315.6, which, as noted above, provides the exclusive remedy for \u201cmental anguish or emotional distress for injury to another\u201d under Louisiana law. <em>See </em>La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 2315.6; <em>Trahan, </em>728 So.2d at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Accordingly, while no one disputes that the Siblings undoubtedly suffered emotional hardship due to the death of their brother,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they did not plead facts sufficient to prove an essential element of their claim under Louisiana\u2019s bystander statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b582-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-13\">. The order from which this appeal was taken was entered in June of 2012. We dismissed the original appeal from that order under Case No. 12-30704 because the June 2012 order left other parties in place and, therefore, was not a final order. Thereafter, on November 7, 2012, the district court disposed of the remaining parties such that the June 2012 order became final. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-20\">. The parties differ in their spelling of Milaz-zo's name. Because Milazzo is a defendant, we adopt the Defendants' spelling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">. Because Damond had surviving children, the Siblings do not assert a wrongful death or survival action claim. <em>See </em>La. Civ.Code Ann arts. 2315.1(A)(3) &amp; 2315.2(A)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
