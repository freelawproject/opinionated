Upon de novo review, <em>see McDade v. Astrue, </em>720 F.3d 994, 997-98 (8th Cir.2013), we find that the administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ\u2019s) decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Specifically, we find that (1) the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination is entitled to deference, <em>see Renstrom v. Astrue, </em>680 F.3d 1057, 1067 (8th Cir.2012); (2) Babcock failed to meet her burden of showing that she was disabled under Listing 9.08A, <em>see Carlson v. Astrue, </em>604 F.3d 589, 593 (8th Cir.2010) (burden is on claimant to establish she meets all criteria for listing); (3) the opinions of treating neurologist Bruce Robbins that Babcock met the criteria for Listing 9.08A, and about her residual functional capacity (RFC), were not entitled to great weight for the reasons the ALJ cited, <em>see McDade, </em>720 F.3d at 999-1000 (treating physician\u2019s opinion was properly discounted because it was unclear whether his use of term \u201cdisabled\u201d comported with use of term under Social Security Act and regulations, and it appeared to rely largely on claimant\u2019s own subjective reports of limitations and symptoms); <em>see also Wildman v. Astrue, </em>596 F.3d 959, 964 (8th Cir.2010) (treating physician\u2019s opinion properly discounted as it consisted of checklist forms, cited no medical evidence, and provided little to no explanation); and (4) the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination was based on consideration of the relevant factors and some medical evidence, as required, <em>see Myers v. Colvin, </em>721 F.3d 521, 527 (8th Cir.2013).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-17\">.
