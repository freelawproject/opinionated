Horn, denying Cai\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ai Lan Cai, </em>No. A087 767 412 (B.I.A. Sept. 14, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A087 767 412 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 12, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513-14 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">For applications like this one, governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of her account, and inconsistencies in her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(in); <em>Matter of J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (B.I.A.2007). Analyzed under these standards, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>In finding Cai not credible, the IJ reasonably relied on the inconsistency between her statement during a border interview that she feared religious persecution, and her subsequent claim based on a forced abortion. Contrary to Cai\u2019s contention that the interview was unreliable, the record of the interview, which sets forth the questions asked and Cai\u2019s responses, shows that she was asked questions designed to elicit the details of an asylum claim and there is no indication that she misunderstood the questions. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 181 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Further, the agency considered Cai\u2019s varying explanations for initially claiming that she had been persecuted on account of her religion\u2014that she was embarrassed, had not eaten, was confused, and was nervous\u2014and reasonably rejected them. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan, </em>432 F.3d at 397 n. 6 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that \u201can alien\u2019s mere recitation that he was nervous or felt pressured during an airport interview will not automatically prevent the IJ or BIA from relying on statements in such interviews when making adverse credibility determinations\u201d); <em>see also Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (under substantial evidence standard, agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Although Cai challenges the agency\u2019s determination that she provided inconsistent testimony as to whether she was asked for her birth permit before or after she was taken into a van, the record reflects that her testimony differed from her credible fear interview. While this inconsistency is quite minor, under the REAL ID Act, \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167 (emphasis in original). This is particularly so given Cai\u2019s failure to address the more substantial inconsistencies identified by the IJ\u2014 her statement in the credible fear interview that the abortion occurred in August 2007 when she was nine months pregnant, and not, as she testified at the hearing, in July 2007 when she was five months pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Cai is correct that the agency did not address the medical evidence supporting her claim. However, we presume that the agency \u201chas taken into account all of the evidence before [it], unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise,\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006). Here, Cai testified about the medical evidence at the merits hearing, and nothing in the record suggests, much less compels the conclusion, that the agency did not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Accordingly, under the totality of the circumstances, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Having reasonably found that Cai failed to establish eligibility for asylum on credibility grounds, the agency did not err in denying withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Finally, Cai has waived any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief by failing to raise this issue in her brief. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>quest for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
