Aug. 22, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A087 438 579 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 8, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Because petitioner challenges only the BIA\u2019s denial of remand and does not challenge the pretermission of her asylum application as untimely or the denial of CAT relief, we address only whether the BIA abused its discretion by denying petitioner\u2019s motion for remand to apply for withholding of removal based on her practice of Christianity. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005) (issues not raised in an opening brief are considered waived); <em>Li Yong Cao v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 151 (2d Cir.2005) (reviewing denial of remand for abuse of discretion). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the Board\u2019s decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or eonclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">To obtain remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel, a movant must establish that \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was so ineffective as to have impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.\u201d <em>Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Rabiu v. INS, </em>41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir.1994). This includes a showing that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that counsel\u2019s performance resulted in actual prejudice to the petitioner. <em>See Debeatham v. Holder, </em>602 F.3d 481, 486 (2d Cir.2010); <em>Esposito v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">Contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, the BIA did not engage in impermissible fact-finding when it independently assessed the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim to relief based on her religious affiliation. While the BIA may not engage in independent fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), we have recognized that fact-finding is necessary when evaluating motions to reopen or remand because that process requires consideration of allegedly new or previously unavailable evidence. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Li Yong Cao, </em>421 F.3d at 156-59. The BIA\u2019s determination on this point was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>a necessary part of evaluating whether petitioner was prejudiced by her former counsel\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Furthermore, the BIA did not err in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to remand to the IJ in order to assess whether she should be granted relief from removal due to her religious affiliation. In denying the motion, the BIA reasonably relied on inconsistencies in the record before it regarding petitioner\u2019s conversion to Christianity and the lack of evidence that she would be subject to persecution. The BIA also reasonably relied on the IJ\u2019s underlying adverse credibility determination, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). Thus the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to remand, <em>see Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 168 (noting that burden on applicant is heavier on motion to reopen and applicant must show that \u201cproffered new evidence would likely alter the result in her case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148 (2d Cir.2006), to challenge the BIA\u2019s consideration of the underlying adverse credibility determination is misplaced. In <em>Paul, </em>we held that the BIA abused its discretion by denying a motion to reopen based on changed country circumstances, where, despite an adverse credibility finding, the IJ had explicitly credited the movant\u2019s assertion regarding his religious affiliation that would likely result in persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 152-55. Here, unlike in <em>Paul, </em>the IJ did not find any aspect of petitioner\u2019s testimony credible, and the BIA reasonably relied on this general adverse credibility finding (along with other evidence) to find that petitioner did not adequately establish her religious affiliation. <em>See Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 146-49 (2d Cir.2007) (holding a general adverse credibility finding may justify a decision to reject other claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Because petitioner\u2019s assertion of ineffective counsel is based upon her former counsel\u2019s failure to raise her religious affiliation as grounds for relief, this claim also fails as the basis for remand. Even had prior counsel requested relief based on petitioner\u2019s religious affiliation, the BIA has determined this claim would have failed. Because a claim of ineffective counsel requires a showing of prejudice, <em>Jian Yun Zheng, </em>409 F.3d at 46, where, as here, the allegedly ineffective conduct would not have affected the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, that claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
