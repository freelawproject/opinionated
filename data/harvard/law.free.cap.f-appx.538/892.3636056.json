The district court correctly held that White abandoned all claims in his response to the Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion except for his claim against Officer Clower in his individual capacity. (Dkt. 24 at 5-6.) Although White appeals against all Defendants, he presents no argument that the City of LaGrange is liable. White argues only that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Clower individually on White\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim that Clower used excessive force in arresting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-22\">The district court held that Clower was entitled to qualified immunity because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Clower did not violate a clearly established right. White contends that the facts asserted in his affidavit show that Clower violated a clearly established constitutional right. After careful review, we conclude that the district court correctly held that no reasonable jury could believe White\u2019s affidavit. (Dkt. 24 at 4 n. 1.) <em>See Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 872, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1776, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (\u201cWhen opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for the purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
