On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in overruling his objection to a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior conviction in North Carolina for felony taking indecent liberties with a child. Carmona-Bello asks us to reconsider our decision in <em>United States v. Ramirez-Garcia, </em>646 F.3d 778 (11th Cir.2011), where we held that a violation of the North Carolina statute that prohibits taking indecent liberties with a minor constitutes sexual abuse of a minor, and, thus, a crime of violence for the purpose of applying an offense-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">\u201cUnder the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless or until it is overturned by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because our holding in <em>Ramirez-Garcia </em>is directly applicable to Carmona-Bello\u2019s case, and it has not been overturned by this court en banc or by the United States Supreme Court, we conclude that the district court correctly applied the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
