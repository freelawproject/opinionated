R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b828-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-20\">Roy Johnson appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging due process and other claims arising out of his termination as a building inspector with an agency of the County of Monterey. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-21\">The district court properly dismissed Johnson\u2019s due process claim because, despite several opportunities to amend, Johnson failed to allege that a County custom, policy, or practice was the moving force behind the alleged constitutional violation at issue. <em>See Blair v. City of Pomona, </em>223 F.3d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir.2000) (listing elements of a \u00a7 1983 claim against a local governmental entity); <em>see also Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (\u201cCongress did not intend municipalities to be held liable unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Johnson\u2019s due process claim with prejudice because Johnson failed to cure the defects identified by the court despite prior opportunities to amend and detailed instructions on what he needed to allege. <em>See Chodos v. West Publ\u2019g Co., </em>292 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth standard of review and noting that discretion to deny leave to amend is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>particularly broad where the plaintiff has previously obtained such leave).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s motion for reconsideration because Johnson failed to establish grounds for such relief. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir.1993) (setting forth standard of review and factors for reconsideration under Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) and 60(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Johnson\u2019s contentions regarding the evidence and documentation supporting his claims and the district court\u2019s allegedly improper cancellation of a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">We do not consider matters raised for the first time on appeal, such as the alleged involvement of \u201cOfficial Policy Makers\u201d on behalf of the County that allegedly transformed their conduct into \u201cOfficial Policy\u201d for purposes of a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Johnson\u2019s request for an injunction, set forth in his opening brief, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b828-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
