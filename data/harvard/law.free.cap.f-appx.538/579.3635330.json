Named plaintiffs Heather Clark, David Claxton, David Compton, and 112 other paramedics (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) sued their employer, Williamson County (\u201cthe County\u201d), alleging that it violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>by fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ing to pay them at least one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for overtime hours. The district court entered summary judgment for the County, adopting a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation concluding that the County\u2019s payment scheme complied with the FLSA under the FWW method. Plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal and contend that the County\u2019s compensation system was not a valid FWW system.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Am. Int\u2019l Specialty Lines Ins. Co. v. Rentech Steel LLC, </em>620 F.3d 558, 562 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Am. Int\u2019l Specialty Lines Ins. Co. v. Canal Indem. Co., </em>352 F.3d 254, 259-60 (5th Cir.2003)). Plaintiffs \u201cbear[ ] the burden of proving that the [County] failed to properly administer the FWW method.\u201d <em>Samson v. Apollo Res., Inc., </em>242 F.3d 629, 636 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Cash v. Conn Appliances, Inc., </em>2 F.Supp.2d 884, 896 (E.D.Tex.1997)). The magistrate judge determined that Plaintiffs could not meet this burden. The district court agreed with this decision, concluding that the magistrate judge\u2019s \u201capplication of the law and legal analysis in support of his conclusions [was] sufficient and appropriate.\u201d We agree. After reviewing the briefs and relevant law, examining pertinent portions of the record, and hearing oral argument, we conclude that the County is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
