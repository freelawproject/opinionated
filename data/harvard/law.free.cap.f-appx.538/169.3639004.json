We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Stone lost millions of dollars investing with Bear Stearns and filed a $7.6 million FINRA arbitration claim seeking to have Bearn Stearns held liable for his losses. The three arbitrators sanctioned Stone for discovery violations and ultimately unanimously rejected all of his claims. After the award was handed down, Stone researched the background of each of the arbitrators, Jerrilyn Marston, whose previously disclosed biography indicated that she had a \u201cFamily Member\u201d associated with the University of Pennsylvania. Mar-ston had disclosed to FINRA that her husband was a well-known professor of finance at the Wharton School and that he regularly lectured to brokerage firms, financial consultants, banks, and investors. FINRA never included this information in Marston\u2019s biography.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">Stone brought this action in the District Court contending that the award should be vacated because Marston had demonstrated \u201cevident partiality\u201d against him by virtue of her purported failure to disclose, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(2); the failure to disclose constituted \u201cmisbehavior\u201d under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3); and, Marston \u201cexceeded [her] powers\u201d as an arbitrator as provided in 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4) because FINRA improperly designated her as a \u201cpublic arbitrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-15\">The District Court, in a thoughtful and thorough opinion rejected Stone\u2019s arguments. The Court noted that arbitration awards are entitled to extreme deference, <em>Dluhos v. Strasberg, </em>321 F.3d 365, 370 (3d Cir.2003), and the statutory grounds for vacatur focus on \u201cegregious departures from the parties\u2019 agreed-upon arbitration.\u201d <em>Hall St. Assocs. v. Mattel, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 576, 586, 128 S.Ct. 1396, 170 L.Ed.2d 254 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">The Court not only took issue with Stone\u2019s contention that there was \u201cevident partially\u201d on the part of Marston, but also decided that Stone\u2019s belated raising of the issue constituted a waiver of any challenge he might have leveled against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">While the parties note that the concepts of \u201cevident partiality\u201d and \u201cwaiver\u201d could be further explored by our Court, we believe that this case does not provide the factual setting in which to do so. First, the facts here do not present a close case as to either issue. Second, there is nothing egregious about the award that was unanimously agreed upon by the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>tors. Lastly, the District Court\u2019s reasoning as to all of the arguments raised\u2014as set forth in its 35 page opinion\u2014is in no need of amplification or improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth by the District Court, we will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
