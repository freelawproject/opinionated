Wilson, Mississippi prisoner # 52274, moves to proceed in forma pau-peris (IFP) in his appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. The district court dismissed Wilson\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and imposed a \u00a7 1915(g) strike for the dismissal. The district court also denied Wilson\u2019s IFP motion, certifying that the appeal was frivolous and not taken in good faith. Wilson challenges the denial of IFP status by arguing that prison procedure in calculating the term of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>prisonment that he served in connection with a 1994 conviction of auto burglary interfered with his constitutional right of access to the courts. By moving in this court for leave to proceed IFP, Wilson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). An appeal is taken in good faith if it raises legal points that are arguable on the merits and thus non-frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The arguments presented by Wilson do not establish that the suit that forms the basis for his denial of access to the courts claim was a nonfrivolous legal claim, nor do his arguments indicate that the defendants denied his right of access to the courts. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Wilson failed to state a claim for the denial of access to the courts, as his claim for relief is not plausible on its face. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Wilson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and therefore is frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Ade-pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Wilson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
