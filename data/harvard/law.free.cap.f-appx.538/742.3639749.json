The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed a sentence of 21 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in imposing, as a special condition of supervised release, the requirement that Pargo undergo sex-offender treatment. The brief also states that Pargo believes he was incorrectly, classified as a Tier II sex offender for purposes of calculating his advisory Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-23\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the supervised-release condition. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(1)\u2014(3); <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>675 F.3d 1122, 1124-25 (8th Cir.2012) (standard of review). Specifically, Pargo\u2019s sex offense, although 14 years earlier, was against a minor, and his subsequent repeated convictions for failure to register, and his absconding, reflected impulsive behavior, poor decisionmaking, and a reluctance to comply with registration requirements. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>643 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir.2011) (requirements for district court to impose special condition of supervised release); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>655 F.3d 839, 845-46 (8th Cir.2011) (requiring sex-offender treatment as supervised-release condition for new failure-to-register offense was supported by record, which reflected history of avoiding sex-offender registration and committing sex offense against minor), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2712, 183 L.Ed.2d 66 (2012) (Mem.); <em>United States v. Smart, </em>472 F.3d 556, 559 (8th Cir.2006) (upholding supervised-release condition requiring defendant to undergo sex-offender treatment following conviction for being felon in possession of firearm, where defendant had earlier state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>convictions for sex offenses). We also conclude that Pargo\u2019s classification as a Tier II sex offender was not plain error. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16911(3) (defining Tier II sex offender); Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.345(l)(b) (1998) (defining criminal sexual conduct in the fourth degree); <em>United States v. Molnar, </em>590 F.3d 912, 914 (8th Cir.2010) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Finally, having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-20\">. The Honorable Stephanie M. Rose, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
