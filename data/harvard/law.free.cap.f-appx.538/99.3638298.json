We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\u201cWhen the BIA does not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, this Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review is limited to \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D), which we review de novo, <em>Guo Qi Wang v. Holder, </em>583 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir.2009). On review from the BIA\u2019s denial of a Section 212(h) waiver, our review is limited to the nondis-cretionary question of whether the alien is eligible for a waiver. <em>Sepulveda v. Gonzales, </em>407 F.3d 59, 62-63 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Here, Morris does not contest the underlying determination of inadmissibility under Section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). The BIA and IJ correctly determined that Morris was ineligible for a Section 212(h) waiver. Section 212(h) provides in relevant part that the attorney general may waive inadmissibility \u201cinsofar as it relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h); <em>see also Herrera-Molina v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2010). The record is clear, and it is beyond dispute, that Morris was convicted at least twice of criminal possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">As no waiver is available due to the multiple possession convictions, we do not reach Morris\u2019s arguments that the agency relied on improper documents to determine that he also had an aggravated felony conviction. We have considered all of Morris\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
