Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo questions of law, including constitutional claims. <em>Mohammed v. </em>Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Jacinto Hernandez\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely, where the motion was filed five years after proper notice of the final order of removal, and Jacinto Hernandez did not demonstrate grounds for any exception to the filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(l)-(2), 1003.38(e); <em>see also Singh v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 1170, 1172 (9th Cir.2007) (the BIA fulfills its statutory duty of service and complies with the federal regulations by mailing its decision to petitioner\u2019s address of record). It follows that Jacinto Hernandez\u2019s due process claim, which rests entirely on the failure to reopen, fails. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (an alien must show error and prejudice to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. <em>See MejiaHernandez v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 818, 823-24 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b819-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
