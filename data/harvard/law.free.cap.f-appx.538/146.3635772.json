Rowland appeals pro se from the order of the District Court dismissing his complaint. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-21\">Rowland, a Pennsylvania state prisoner, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against numerous employees of the Clinton County Correctional Facility (\u201cCCCF\u201d) and SCI-Roekview alleging that he received inadequate medical care at those facilities. In brief, Rowland alleges that he injured his left foot in December 2010 when a step collapsed at CCCF and that personnel at that facility told him to treat it by icing it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>and keeping it elevated. Rowland further alleges that he later received an x-ray in February 2011 while at SCI-Rockview, which revealed that his foot was broken, followed by a March 2011 videoconference with an outside orthopedic doctor, who told him that the break appeared to be healing and recommended that he not apply extreme force or pressure on his injured foot. Rowland alleges that he should have received an x-ray earlier and that his treatment was otherwise inadequate, though he does not claim that defendants should have provided him with any other kind of treatment in particular. The defendants filed motions to dismiss on various grounds, and the District Court granted their motions and dismissed Rowland\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) after concluding that it does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted and that amendment would be futile. Rowland appeals, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">After reviewing Rowland\u2019s complaint de novo, we will affirm for the reasons adequately and thoroughly explained by the District Court. In particular, we agree that Rowland\u2019s allegations, accepted as true, do not raise an inference that any defendant acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). To the contrary, Rowland\u2019s allegations make it clear that he received medical care for his foot, and neither his mere disagreement with that treatment nor its mere alleged inadequacy raises an inference of deliberate indifference. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 107, 97 S.Ct. 285 (explaining that \u201cthe question whether an X-ray or additional diagnostic techniques or forms of treatment is indicated is a classic example of a matter for medical judgment\u201d and that \u201c[a] medical decision not to order an X-ray ... does not represent cruel and unusual punishment\u201d because, at most, it might constitute malpractice). Thus, we agree with the District Court both that Rowland\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim and that any amendment of his complaint would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Rowland\u2019s cursory arguments in his notice of appeal lack merit. Rowland argues that the defendants\u2019 briefs in support of their motions to dismiss were late and that the District Court \u201cdisregarded\u201d his response in opposition to their motions, but we perceive no irregularity in that regard. Rowland also asserts that the District Court\u2019s \u201cassessment that a broken foot can be treated and healed by faulty verbal and written communication ... defies logic, medical treatment, and legal principles.\u201d The District Court, however, made no such assessment. Instead, the District Court examined Rowland\u2019s allegations regarding the assessments made and treatment provided by the medical defendants and properly concluded that they do not raise an inference of deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
