Mulligan, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ratna Subba, </em>No. A087 445 616 (B.I.A. Mar. 5, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A087 445 616 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 22, 2009). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). For applications such as Subba\u2019s, governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility determination on the \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant,\u201d as well as \u201cthe consistency of [the applicant\u2019s] statements with other evidence of record ..., without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). Here, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Subba challenges the agency\u2019s finding that her testimony about her attack by Maoists was inconsistent with a corroborative letter from a neighbor. However, as Subba testified that her neighbor witnessed the attack and \u201cknew\u201d the attackers were Maoists, but his letter stated that the attackers were an \u201cunknown group of people,\u201d the agency reasonably relied on this inconsistency in finding her not credible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Subba\u2019s explanation for the inconsistency\u2014that her neighbor was too afraid to identify the attackers in his letter\u2014is insufficient to compel a contrary conclusion because the explanation contradicts her testimony that the inconsistency was due to a translation mistake. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Subba\u2019s related argument that the agency overemphasized her neighbor\u2019s letter in finding her not credible, where she submitted other letters from family members and her political party corroborating her claim, is unpersuasive, as her neighbor purportedly had personal knowledge of the attack whereas they did not. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Matter of H-L-H- &amp; Z-Y-Z-, 25 </em>I. &amp; N. Dec. 209, 215 (BIA 2010), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, </em>677 F.3d 130 (2d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Subba also challenges the agency\u2019s demeanor findings that her testimony was \u201ccontrived\u201d and \u201cevasive\u201d as being \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d and legally erroneous. The IJ observed that during her hearing, Subba \u201cvery carefully dabbed her eyes ... in an attempt to appear upset and convey an expression of emotion,\u201d and provided evasive or nonresponsive answers to questions about her alleged Maoist attackers. Because these findings are tethered to the record, Subba\u2019s explanation that she simply intended to \u201cimpress the IJ with the pathos of her plight\u201d is insufficient to overcome the \u201cparticular deference\u201d due to 104,113 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">We have considered Subba\u2019s remaining arguments and find that they lack merit. Accordingly, as the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we will defer to that ruling. <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. As the only evidence of a threat to Subba\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination is dispositive of her claims for relief. <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
