We review de novo, <em>Geweke Ford v. St Joseph\u2019s Omni Preferred Care, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1355, 1357 (9th Cir.1997), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">In this context, an action to recover damages must be brought within two years of accrual, and an action to enforce an FCC order for payment must be brought within one year of the order. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 415(b), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">In <em>Davel Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Qwest Corp., </em>460 F.3d 1075 (9th Cir.2006), this court addressed the operation of \u00a7 415\u2019s time bar. The <em>Davel </em>court, agreeing with the D.C. Circuit, found Davel was on inquiry notice of its claims against Qwest beginning on the deadline by which Qwest failed to file fraud protection rates. <em>Id. </em>at 1091-92 (citing <em>Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co. v. F.C.C., </em>76 F.3d 1221 (D.C.Cir.1996)). The <em>Davel </em>court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-13\">As soon as Qwest failed to file fraud protection rates ... it was in technical non-compliance ... and Davel was on inquiry notice that it might be paying excessive rates for fraud protection.... The fact that, until Qwest filed its new fraud protection rates in 2003, Davel was <em>not </em>in a position to determine the precise amount of the overcharges, or even whether the charges were excessive at all, does not change this result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 1092 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">Here, NPCC\u2019s filing of the \u201cRate Case\u201d in 2001 is the most obvious example that NPCC was on notice of its claims against Qwest. The district court correctly found this date sufficient to trigger the running of the limitations period. We also note that Qwest\u2019s filing of new rates in the wake of the 2003 <em>Wisconsin Order, </em>and the PUC\u2019s approval of those rates, also put NPCC on notice as to its claims; the 2003 rates indisputably notified NPCC that the rates it was paying earlier were too high.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">NPCC raises a litany of reasons to support its failure to file the claims earlier. None are persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-17\">NPCC\u2019s separation of powers argument fails. Even if the district court lacked the power to determine actual NST compliance, that is, what rate would bring Qwest into compliance, that question bears only on damages and the court could still rightfully determine liability. <em>See Davel, </em>460 F.3d at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-18\">NPCC\u2019s administrative exhaustion argument fails. There is a difference between statutorily-required exhaustion, and exhaustion as a prudential doctrine. <em>See W. Radio Servs. Co. v. Qwest Corp., </em>530 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>1186, 1195-96 (9th Cir.2008). NPCC has pointed to no statntorily-imposed exhaustion requirement. <em>Cf. </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 (suit for damages actionable in <em>either </em>FCC or federal court). Nor has NPCC provided any authority to establish that if a prudential doctrine <em>might </em>have been invoked, it prevents accrual of that claim. <em>See, e.g., Castro-Cortez v. I.N.S., </em>239 F.3d 1037, 1047 (9th Cir.2001) (exhaustion of judicial and administrative remedies in \u00a7 2241 habeas case is prudential, and therefore subject to waiver of the requirement), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, </em>548 U.S. 30, 126 S.Ct. 2422, 165 L.Ed.2d 323 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">NPCC\u2019s ripeness argument also fails. While the ripeness doctrine precludes adjudicating premature disagreements over administrative policies before formal, final determination, <em>Pac. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 U.S. 190, 200-01, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983), the dispute here concerns Qwest\u2019s obligation to pay refunds, not the actual correctness of any determination as to proper NST rates by the Public Utility Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Finally, NPCC\u2019s reliance on the filed rate doctrine fails. The filed rate doctrine \u201cbars suits challenging rates which \u2018if successful, would have the effect of changing the filed [rate].\u2019 \u201d <em>Davel, </em>460 F.3d at 1084. Again, this suit does not challenge filed rates. Thus, none of NPCC\u2019s cited doctrines would have had the effect of preventing adjudication in federal court prior to the final determination of NST compliance, and therefore they fail to establish that NPCC\u2019s claims had not accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">NPCC then argues for the application of equitable tolling, an argument the district court properly rejected. NPCC was represented by counsel and, as discussed above, had knowledge of its possible claim. <em>See Johnson v. Henderson, </em>314 F.3d 409, 414 (9th Cir.2002) (equitable tolling looks to whether reasonable plaintiff would know of possible claim; retaining counsel typically ceases tolling). This case does not support application of judicial es-toppel either.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this case as time barred. We do not reach other issues briefed and argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">The parties\u2019 outstanding motions to strike are all DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ahh-dedup-0\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
