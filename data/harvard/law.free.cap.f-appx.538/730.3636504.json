Upon de novo review, we find that the administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ\u2019s) decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See Van Vickle v. Astrue, </em>539 F.3d 825, 828 &amp; n. 2 (8th Cir.2008). Specifically, we find that because the ALJ gave several valid reasons for her credibility determination, it is entitled to deference. <em>See Renstrom v. Astrue, </em>680 F.3d 1057, 1065 (8th Cir.2012). We disagree with Traylor that the ALJ, in determining residual functional capacity (RFC), was required to give substantial weight to the opinions of two chiropractors, especially given that there are no treatment records from the one chiropractor and that the other saw Christopher Traylor only once for testing and gave a statement unrelated to the disability applications at issue here. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1513(d), 416.913(d) (evidence from chiropractors may be used to show severity of claimant\u2019s impairment and how it affects claimant\u2019s ability to work); <em>see also Martise v. Astrue, </em>641 F.3d 909, 925 (8th Cir.2011) (in deciding how much weight to accord treating physician\u2019s opinion, ALJ must consider length of treatment and frequency of examinations); <em>Cox v. Barnhart, </em>345 F.3d 606, 608 (8th Cir.2003) (coneluso-ry statements by doctor, if unsupported by medical record, do not bind ALJ in his disability determination). Finally, we find that the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination is consistent with the medical evidence, <em>see Jones v. Astrue, </em>619 F.3d 963, 971 (8th Cir.2010) (ALJ is responsible for determining RFC based on all relevant evidence, including medical records, observations of treating physicians and others, and claimant\u2019s own description of his limitations; RFC must be supported by some medical evidence); and that, contrary to Traylor\u2019s contention, the vocational expert\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence, because it was based on a hypothetical that accounted for all of the proven impairments, <em>see Boettcher v. Astrue, </em>652 F.3d 860, 867-68 (8th Cir.2011). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-16\">. The Honorable H.
