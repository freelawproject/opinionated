Because she has not offered evidence showing that the workplace incidents in question had a racial character or purpose, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-19\">The hospital prevailed on summary judgment, so we recite the facts in the light most favorable to Lockhart, the non-moving party. <em>See Vance v. Ball State Univ., </em>646 F.3d 461, 465 (7th Cir.2011), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2434, 186 L.Ed.2d 565 (2013). Lockhart, an African American, worked as a monitor technician at the hospital\u2019s intermediate-care unit for about a year. As a monitor technician, she was responsible for keeping patients attached to telemetry monitors and tracking their heart rate and rhythm. Every four hours she was required to print a telestrip of a patient\u2019s heart rate and rhythm and then give that strip to the assigned nurse. If changes in the heart rate or rhythm required immediate attention, Lockhart was expected to inform the nurse. Several nurses complained, however, that Lockhart did not keep patients connected to the monitors or properly interpret the printouts. Lockhart accused these nurses of lying and blamed them for failing to do their jobs by not re-attaching the leads in her absence. The nurses typically rebuffed Lockhart and disparaged her job performance. Lockhart\u2019s repeated complaints to supervisors about the nurses\u2019 conduct went unheeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-25\">The most serious incident occurred when a male nurse confronted Lockhart over her informing a supervisor of his absence. The nurse physically blocked Lockhart from her workstation. He yelled at Lockhart; she yelled back. The nurse then moved out of Lockhart\u2019s way, hitting her arm in the process. Lockhart reported this incident, and a meeting was held to investigate. A witness downplayed any physical contact between the two as accidental, and both Lockhart and the nurse received written warnings for unprofessional conduct. Lockhart believed that the nurse should have been fired and that the investigating supervisor discriminated against African Americans. But she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>not tell anyone at the hospital of her suspicion that the supervisor and some of the nurses were motivated by race.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Lockhart resigned about a year after starting the job, filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, received a right-to-sue letter, and sued the hospital for race-based intentional discrimination, a hostile work environment, and retaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2, 2000e-3. After discovery, one day after the deadline set by the district court, the hospital moved for summary judgment. Lockhart, however, did not object to the late filing. The court gave her 90 days to respond, and she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The court then granted summary judgment to the hospital on all of the claims. With respect to the hostile-work-environment claim, the court concluded that Lock-hart had failed to present any evidence that the conduct of the nurses or supervisors \u201chad anything to do with race.\u201d The nurses\u2019 conduct may have been unprofessional, unkind, and aggressive, the court explained, but Lockhart did not show that she was the \u201ctarget\u201d of race-related behavior. The court also determined that Lock-hart failed to establish a prima facie case of intentional race discrimination. The court subsequently denied Lockhart\u2019s motion to reconsider\u2014challenging the court\u2019s willingness to consider the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment filed one day after the court\u2019s deadline\u2014on grounds that Lockhart was not prejudiced by the short delay and that Lockhart did not raise the issue at the hearing at which the defendants presented their summary-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">On appeal, Lockhart contests only the district court\u2019s ruling on her claim of a hostile work environment, pointing to evidence of the many contentious workplace encounters\u2014the nurses\u2019 insults and complaints, the supervisors\u2019 failure to stand up for her, and the physical confrontation with the male nurse. But as the district court properly explained, a claim of a hostile work environment required Lockhart to show more than that her workplace was contentious and inhospitable; she also had to show that the conduct of the nurses and the supervisors had \u201ca racial character or purpose.\u201d <em>Luckie v. Ameritech Corp., </em>389 F.3d 708, 713 (7th Cir.2004); <em>see Vance, </em>646 F.3d at 470. The insults that the nurses allegedly hurled at Lockhart targeted her shortcomings as a monitor technician, not her race. Similarly, with regard to the physical encounter with the male nurse, the record does not reflect that the nurse\u2019s conduct was motivated by race; Lockhart acknowledged at her deposition that this nurse was angry because he thought that she had told the charge nurse about his absenteeism. Likewise, there is nothing to suggest a racial motive on the part of the supervisor who investigated this altercation and disciplined both Lockhart and the nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Lockhart also argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying her motion to reconsider based on the hospital\u2019s untimely summary-judgment filing. But a motion under Rule 59(e) serves a limited function: \u201cto draw the district court\u2019s attention to a manifest error of law or fact or to newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Resnick, </em>594 F.3d 562, 568 (7th Cir.2010). As the district court observed, Lockhart did not object to the late filing until after the court entered summary judgment for the hospital. This is significant because a motion under Rule 59(e) \u201cdoes not allow a party to ... advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given district courts\u2019 broad discretion to manage their dockets, <em>see Keeton v. Morningstar, Inc., </em>667 F.3d 877, 884 (7th Cir.2012), the court here could not have abused its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>by accepting the late motion, especially since Lockhart was given ample time\u201490 days\u2014to respond to the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Lockhart\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred by not considering the hostile-workplace analysis set forth in <em>Ayissi-Etoh v. Fannie Mae, </em>712 F.3d 572 (D.C.Cir.2013), in which the D.C. Circuit reversed a grant of summary judgment on a hostile-work-environment claim. <em>Ayissi-Etoh, </em>however, not only was decided after the district court granted summary judgment, but also is distinguishable because the plaintiff there was subjected to explicit racial epithets and racially demeaning comments. <em>Id. </em>at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
