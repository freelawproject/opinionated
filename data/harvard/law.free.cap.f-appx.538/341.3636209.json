Pleasant seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders treating his Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion and his \u201c \u2018Notice of Hearing1 Motion to Remand\u201d as successive 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2013) motions, and dismissing the motions on that basis. The orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists, would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-22\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Pleasant has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-23\">Additionally, we construe Pleasant\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Wines-tock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-24\">(1) newly discovered evidence that ... would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-25\">(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-26\">28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255(h) (West Supp.2013). Pleasant\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these criteria. Therefore, we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
