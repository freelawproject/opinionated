BATCHELDER, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Christopher Tone, Paul and Sharon Taulbee, and Laura Sheldon, the Plaintiffs-Appellants, all purchased homes with loans made by banks and guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s (\u201cUSDA\u201d) Rural Housing Service (\u201cRHS\u201d) through its Guaranteed Loan Program (\u201cprogram\u201d). They fell behind on their mortgage payments and faced foreclosure. They sued the banks that made the loans and sued the Defendants-Appellees, including RHS; Thomas Vil-sack, Secretary of the USDA; Dallas Ton-sanger, Undersecretary for Rural Development at USDA; and Tammye Trevi\u00f1o, Administrator of RHS (\u201cAppellees\u201d), under the Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 <em>et seq., </em>and the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 <em>et seq. </em>The district courts dismissed the claims against the banks and the Appellees. Now, in this consolidated appeal, the Appellants continue to argue that the Appellees failed to take actions they should have taken to prevent foreclosure. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">The Appellants\u2019 circumstances are similar and undisputed. Tone purchased a home in 2007 with a loan from JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., guaranteed by RHS. Tone fell behind on his mortgage payments, and Chase eventually notified him of its intent to foreclose. Paul Taulbee purchased a home in 2006 with a loan from Villa Mortgage (the loan was later sold or assigned to U.S. Bank) and guaranteed by RHS. Taulbee fell behind on his mortgage payments, and U.S. Bank filed a complaint for foreclosure. Sheldon purchased a home in 2008 with a loan from J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., guaranteed by RHS. Sheldon fell behind on her mortgage payments, and Chase scheduled a foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">The Appellants\u2019 nearly identical complaints before the district courts claimed that the Appellees violated the Housing Act and the APA when they failed to implement various parts of the Housing Act that allegedly would have helped prevent foreclosure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellants made seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>claims, asserting that they should have received the benefits of (1) moratorium relief, (2) refinancing, (3) loan assignment and reamortization, (4) loss mitigation, (5) loan modification and partial claims, (6) an alleged statutory right to appeal lenders\u2019 decisions, and (7) constitutional due process. The Appellants sought declaratory judgments as well as injunctions, under the APA, that would require the Appellees to implement foreclosure-avoidance and loss-mitigation provisions of the Housing Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appellees moved the district courts to dismiss claims (1), (4), (6), and (7) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). They also argued that claims (1)-(6) should be dismissed for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The district courts dismissed claims (1) and (4) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and claims (2), (3), and (5) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. They dismissed claims (6) and (7) for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">On appeal, the Appellants continue to argue the seven claims outlined above. Despite the wording of individual provisions in the Housing Act, they argue that Congress\u2019s national housing policy, which prefaces the Housing Act and is found at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, eliminates the Appellees\u2019 discretion over whether to implement certain provisions of the Act. They argue that some of their claims should be addressed under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), not \u00a7 706(1). And they argue that their statutory and constitutional due-process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion under Rule 12(b)(1) to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Madison-Hughes v. Sha-lala, </em>80 F.3d 1121, 1123 (6th Cir.1996). \u2018We review de novo whether the district court properly dismissed a complaint pursuant to Rulel2(b)(6).\u201d <em>Ashland Hosp. Corp. v. Serv. Emps. Int\u2019l Union, Dist. 1199, </em>708 F.3d 737, 740 (6th Cir.2013). We also review de novo the dismissal of a claim for lack of standing. <em>Prime Media, Inc. v. City of Brentwood, </em>485 F.3d 343, 348 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">\u201cBecause this court\u2019s de novo review involves only application of legal propositions to the undisputed facts in the record, we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record even if different from the reasons of the district court.\u201d <em>Abercrom-bie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc., v. Am. Eagle Outfitters, Inc., </em>280 F.3d 619, 629 (6th Cir.2002). Before we may address a claim\u2019s merits, we must assess whether we have jurisdiction over that claim. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 101, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (finding there is no \u201cdoctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause. Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, 118 S.Ct. 1003 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). We cannot assume jurisdiction for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>of deciding the merits of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 94-95, 118 S.Ct. 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The district courts\u2019 opinions provide overviews of the Housing Act. The district court in <em>Tone </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">The Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cthe Housing Act\u201d), was enacted to promote \u201cthe elimination of substandard and other inadequate housing through the clearance of slums and blighted areas, and the realization as soon as possible of the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. In furtherance of that goal, Section 502(a) of the Housing Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (the \u201cSecretary\u201d) to make direct loans to borrowers seeking to finance affordable housing in rural areas. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(a). RHS, an agency within USDA, implements Section 502 programs. RHS acts as the lender and handles the servicing of Section 502(a) direct loans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">In 1990, Congress amended Section 502 of the Housing Act by adding subsection (h), entitled \u201cGuaranteed Loans.\u201d Among other things, this subsection authorizes RHS to guarantee a loan made by a commercial lender to low-income borrowers who wish to purchase or construct a single-family residence in a rural area. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h). RHS is authorized to guarantee a loan in an amount equal to 90 percent of the loan. <em>Id. </em>The commercial lender is responsible for the processing, servicing, and liquidation (if necessary) of the loan. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.309(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">In 2009, Congress passed the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, which amended section 502(h) and included additional protections against foreclosures of RHS guaranteed loans. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(13)-(17). Among other things, the amendments direct mortgagees to engage in loss mitigation actions upon default or imminent default of RHS guaranteed loans. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(13). The amendments also give RHS the authority to approve the modification of guaranteed loans that are in default or facing imminent default. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(14). The amendments give RHS the authority to establish a program for the payment of partial claims to mortgagees who agree to apply the claim amount to the payment of a loan in default or facing imminent default. <em>Id. </em>The amendments give RHS the authority to establish a program for the assignment of guaranteed loans to the Secretary \u201cupon the request of the mortgagee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(15). The amendments also give RHS the authority to guarantee a loan that is made to refinance an existing Section 502 direct or guaranteed loan. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(17). Generally, Plaintiffs claim that the Federal Defendants have failed to implement these additional protections against default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_k\"><em>Tone v. Vilsack, </em>No. 1:10CV891, 2012 WL 1229926, at *1-2 (S.D.Ohio Apr. 12, 2012); <em>see also Sheldon v. Vilsack, </em>No. 11-10487, 2012 WL 1068099, at *4-6 (E.D.Mich. Mar. 29, 2012) (explaining Housing Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">The Appellants\u2019 arguments draw from a portion of the Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, that contains a lengthy Congressional declaration of national housing objectives and policy spanning nearly 30 lines and containing multiple provisions. The Appellants rely on Congress\u2019s general goal of housing for every American family, and point to agencies\u2019 responsibility to act consistently with the housing policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">The Appellants seek judicial review under the APA of the Appellees\u2019 alleged fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ures to implement the Housing Act. Under certain circumstances, the APA gives courts the authority to \u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Before a court may act under \u00a7 706(1), \u201ca party must first clear the hurdle of [5 U.S.C.] \u00a7 701(a),\u201d which governs when courts may exercise judicial review over the actions or inactions of agencies. <em>See Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 828, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). Judicial review (and relief through \u00a7 706(1)) will be unavailable \u201cto the extent that (1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) <em>agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(l)-(2) (emphasis added); <em>see Heckler, </em>470 U.S. at 828, 105 S.Ct. 1649. \u201cAn agency action is committed to agency discretion by law if the statute does not provide a \u2018meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>Madison-Hughes, </em>80 F.3d at 1127 (quoting <em>Heckler, </em>470 U.S. at 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649). \u201cA meaningful standard does not exist where the applicable law is so broadly drawn that the court has no standard or substantive priorities against which to measure an agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We \u201cdo not have subject matter jurisdiction to review agency actions that are \u2018committed to agency discretion by law.\u2019\u201d <em>Madison-Hughes, </em>80 F.3d at 1127 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>What permits judicial review of agency action under \u00a7 701(a)(2) resembles what will enable a court to \u201ccompel agency action\u201d under \u00a7 706(1). \u201c[A] claim under \u00a7 706(1) can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a <em>discrete </em>agency action that it is <em>required to take.\u201d Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, </em>542 U.S. 55, 64, 124 S.Ct. 2873, 159 L.Ed.2d 137 (2004); <em>see id. </em>at 65, 124 S.Ct. 2373 (\u201cThe limitation to <em>required </em>agency action rules out judicial direction of even discrete agency action that is not demanded by law....\u201d). In other words, \u00a7 706(1) empowers a court to compel an agency to perform only \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d actions. <em>See id. </em>at 64, 124 S.Ct. 2373 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Because we lack subject-matter jurisdiction to review agency actions committed to agency discretion, <em>Madison-Hughes, </em>80 F.3d at 1127, it is necessary to assess whether the relevant provisions of the Housing Act give the Appellees discretion. If so, we lack authority to decide the Appellants\u2019 claims. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">The portion of the Housing Act relevant to the Appellants\u2019 first claim that the Appellants should have received \u201cmoratorium relief\" provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-12\">During any time that any such loan is outstanding, the Secretary <em>is authorized </em>under regulations to be prescribed by him to grant a moratorium upon the payment of interest and principal on such loan for so long a period as he deems necessary, upon a showing by the borrower that due to circumstances beyond his control, he is unable to continue making payments of such principal and interest when due without unduly impairing his standard of living.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1475(a) (emphasis added). Both district courts were right to focus on the statute\u2019s authorizing, not requiring, the Secretary to act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>so broadly drawn, we lack a meaningful standard against which to measure the Secretary\u2019s exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">But the Appellants argue that the housing policy, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, eliminates agency discretion with respect to the moratorium provision. They refer to Congress\u2019s \u201cgoal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They also quote a part of the housing policy that directs that federal agencies with responsibility for housing \u201cshall exercise their powers, functions, and duties under this or any other law, consistently with the national housing policy declared by this Act and in such manner as will facilitate sustained progress in attaining the national housing objective hereby established.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">What the Appellants point to in the housing policy Congress\u2019s general goal of facilitating housing for American families, and agencies\u2019 responsibility to act in accord with that goal does not provide us with a meaningful standard of review by which we can evaluate the Appellees\u2019 exercise of discretion. <em>See generally Norton, </em>542 U.S. at 65-66, 124 S.Ct. 2373 (finding that courts cannot apply \u00a7 706(1) to specific decisions committed to agency discretion even where Congress has provided a general objective for an agency to pursue).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Reading the moratorium provision in the context of the housing policy\u2019s general goal does not permit us to decide the Appellants\u2019 claim. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2); <em>Madison-Hughes, </em>80 F.3d at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">The Appellants\u2019 second claim is that they should have received refinancing under the Housing Act. This claim is based on three statutory provisions. The first provides that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Agriculture ... <em>is authorized </em>... to extend financial assistance ... for refinancing indebtedness which ... if not refinanced, is likely to result ... in the loss of the applicant\u2019s necessary dwelling.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471(a) (emphasis added). The second provides that \u201c[u]pon the request of the borrower, the Secretary shall ... guarantee a loan that is made to refinance an existing loan\u201d; but \u201c[t]he Secretary <em>may establish limitations </em>on the number of loans guaranteed under this paragraph, which shall be based on market conditions and other factors <em>as the Secretary considers appropriate.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(17)(A), (F) (emphases added). The third provides that \u201c[a]ny guaranteed loan under this subsection <em>may </em>be refinanced and extended <em>in accordance with terms and conditions that the Secretary shall prescribe.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(9) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">The Appellants dislike the Appellees\u2019 decisions not to offer refinancing for guaranteed loans under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1471(a) and 1472(h)(17), and argue that 42 U.S.C. 1472(h)(9), read in light of the housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>policy, requires refinancing. But, because the provisions denote discretion, and because as explained above with respect to the moratorium provision the relevant part of the housing policy does not provide a meaningful standard by which to adjudicate the alleged failure to provide refinancing, the district courts lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the Appellants\u2019 second claim. <em>See 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2); <em>MadisonHughes, </em>80 F.3d at 1127.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We affirm dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The Appellants\u2019 third claim relates to the assignment<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of loans. The Housing Act provides that \u201c[t]he Secretary <em>may </em>establish a program for assignment to the Secretary, upon request of the mortgagee, of a mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence guaranteed under this chapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(15)(A) (emphasis added). The Appellants argue that RHS\u2019s being assigned loans is not within the Appellees\u2019 discretion. But that argument ignores the Secretary\u2019s discretion over the establishment of an assignment program in the first place. We have no meaningful standard by which to adjudicate his choice not to establish such a program here. Nor does the housing policy cabin his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The Appellants\u2019 fourth claim alleges that the Appellees failed to require lenders to provide loss mitigation to borrowers. The relevant provision says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">Upon default or imminent default of any mortgage guaranteed under this subsection, mortgagees shall engage in loss mitigation actions for the purpose of providing an alternative to foreclosure (including actions such as special forbearance, loan modification, pre-foreclo-sure sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, as required, support for borrower housing counseling, subordinate lien resolution, and borrower relocation), <em>as provided for by the Secretary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(13) (emphasis added). Whether lenders engage in loss mitigation is up to the Secretary, and we have no meaningful standard by which to evaluate the Secretary\u2019s decision. Though the Appellants again point to the housing policy, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, they are for the same reasons outlined above mistaken to conclude that it enables our review. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">For the Appellants\u2019 fifth claim, which relates to loan modification and partial claims,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Appellants look to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(14):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-13\">The Secretary <em>may authorize </em>the modification of mortgages, and establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee ..., for mortgages that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>are in default or face imminent default, as defined by the Secretary. Any payment under such program directed to the mortgagee shall be made at the <em>sole discretion </em>of the Secretary and on terms and conditions acceptable to the Secretary. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(14) (emphasis added). Again, \u00a7 1472(h)(14) gives the Secretary discretion; we have no power to \u201ccompel agency action,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1), here.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In short, we affirm the district courts\u2019 judgments as to claims one through five on the basis that, because the Housing Act provides the Appellees with discretion, we lack jurisdiction to consider the Appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">. The district courts dismissed the Appellants\u2019 sixth and seventh claims, which relate to statutory and constitutional due process, because the Appellants did not demonstrate any injury in fact and so lack standing. Standing is an aspect of justici-ability, <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), and \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press,\u201d <em>Daimler-Chrysler Corp. v. Cuno, </em>547 U.S. 332, 335, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006). The question of standing asks whether a party has a sufficient stake in the controversy. <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 731-32, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). \u201cTypically ... the standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint\u2019s allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted.\u201d <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). There are three constitutional limitations on standing: injury in fact, causation, and redressability. <em>See Steel Co., </em>523 U.S. at 102-03, 118 S.Ct. 1003. Of particular relevance here is the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d requirement: \u201c[T]he plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (footnote, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">The portion of the Housing Act relevant to the Appellants\u2019 sixth claim provides that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">Secretary <em>shall have the power to ... </em>issue rules and regulations which assure that applicants denied assistance under this subchapter or persons or organizations whose assistance under this sub-chapter is being substantially reduced or terminated are given written notice of the reasons for denial, reduction or termination and are provided at least an opportunity to appeal an adverse decision ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1480(g) (emphasis added). The Appellants claim that the statute requires RHS to create an appeals process so that private lenders\u2019 decisions can be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Section 1480(g) places the issuance of rules and regulations squarely within the Secretary\u2019s discretion, and RHS has already established an appeals process that precludes borrowers\u2019 appealing lenders\u2019 decisions. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.399 (\u201cDecisions made by the Lender are not covered by this paragraph.... \u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1980.399(b)(2) (\u201cThe Lender\u2019s decision to deny servicing relief is not subject to appeal.\u201d). The Appellants can show no injury no invasion of a protected legal interest resulting from the way the Secretary chose to implement 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1480(g). The Appellants have no protected legal interest in an appeals process that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Secretary was authorized, but not obligated, to establish.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Appellant Sheldon<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> also claims that she has constitutionally protected property interests in \u201cvarious provisions\u201d in the Housing Act, and claims that she is entitled to notice of RHS\u2019s decisions and to appeal those decisions despite agency regulations that govern the guaranteed loan program and indicate the contrary. But she fails to show, specifically, how she suffered the injury in fact necessary for standing. If the Housing Act and APA required specific action of the Appellees under the provisions raised in claims one through six, her argument might have merit. Because no action was required, there was no injury in fact necessary for Sheldon to have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Tone and the Taulbees argue that the district court erred in denying their motion for leave to amend their complaint and that, if we rule in their favor, the district court should reconsider their motion.

But Sheldon never moved for l\u00e9ave to amend her complaint, so the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Winget v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>537 F.3d 565, 572 (6th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe district court does not abuse its discretion in failing to grant a party leave to amend where such leave is not sought.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgments of the district courts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-10\">. The Appellants also alleged that their respective banks breached their fiduciary duties by failing to offer or properly consider the Appellants for foreclosure avoidance and loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>mitigation options. The <em>Tone </em>district court granted Chase's and U.S. Bank's motions to dismiss, and the <em>Sheldon </em>district court granted Chase's motion for judgment on the pleadings.

The district court denied their motion for class certification as moot after it dismissed their case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b677-5\">.. On appeal, the Appellants argue that some of their claims should be evaluated under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), not \u00a7 706(1). We disagree. Though their complaints before the district courts cited \u00a7 706 without specifying subsections (1) or (2), their complaints and, when carefully analyzed, their arguments on appeal speak in terms of the Appellees' <em>failure </em>to act. Because the gravamen of the Appellants\u2019 claims is that the Appellees failed to act that agency action did not occur when and where it should have \u00a7 706(1) is the relevant provision. We note that both district courts already considered and correctly rejected analyzing the Appellants' claims under \u00a7 706(2) because the Appellants focused on the Appel-lees\u2019 alleged failure to act rather than on specific, affirmative agency action. <em>See Tone, </em>2012 WL 1229926, at *2 n. 2; <em>Sheldon, </em>2012 WL 1068099, at *6 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\">. In a footnote in <em>McCarthy v. Middle Tennessee Electric Membership Corp., </em>466 F.3d 399 (6th Cir.2006), we questioned but did not conclusively address whether three Supreme Court cases <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006), <em>Eberhart v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005) (per curiam), and <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004) invalidate Madison-Hughes's statement that courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to review agency decisions committed to agency discretion by law under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). <em>McCarthy, </em>466 F.3d at 406 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">These cases do not negate <em>Madison-Hughes </em>'s treatment of \u00a7 701(a)(2) as circumscribing subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Eberhart </em>and <em>Kontrick </em>both found that time limitations, in the contexts of criminal procedure rules <em>(Eberhart) </em>and of bankruptcy rules <em>(Kontrick), </em>were not properly labeled as \"jurisdictional,\u201d but instead were claim processing rules. <em>See Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 15-16, 126 S.Ct. 403; <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 453-55, 459-60, 124 S.Ct. 906. <em>Arbaugh </em>held that Title VII\u2019s employee numerosity requirement (that an \u201cemployer\u201d must have 15 or more employees for Title VII to apply, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b)), located in the definitions section of the statute, did not circumscribe subject matter jurisdiction, but rather related to the \"substantive adequacy\u201d of the plaintiff's claim. <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S. at 504, 126 S.Ct. 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\"><em>Arbaugh </em>provided a \"bright line\u201d test for identifying whether a statutory term is jurisdictional; \"If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue. But when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 126 S.Ct. 1235 (footnote and citation omitted); <em>see generally Shweika v.

In applying Arbaugh, we need not look in the statute for \"magic words\u201d that identify the requirement as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>requisite for jurisdiction. <em>See Sebelius v. Auburn Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>568 U.S.-,-, 133 S.Ct. 817, 824, 184 L.Ed.2d 627 (2013). Rather, \"our \u2018jurisdictional analysis must focus on the legal character of the requirement, which we discern[] by looking to the condition's text, context, and relevant historical treatment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shweika, </em>723 F.3d at 714-15 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.

Section 701(a)(2)'s requirement is neither a claim processing rule like the rules in <em>Eber-hart </em>and <em>Kontrick, </em>nor an element of a plaintiff's claim as was the employee numerosity definition in <em>Arbaugh. </em>It is a prescription that delineates the \"classes of cases (subject matter jurisdiction) ... falling within a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 455, 124 S.Ct. 906. In classes of cases where we have no meaningful standard by which to evaluate the agencies' exercise of discretion, we have no jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b678-14\">. We note that the district courts dismissed claims (2), (3), and (5) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, even though the courts generally pointed to the same rationale the Appellees\u2019 discretion under the Housing Act's provisions to justify dismissal here as they did to justify dismissal of claims (1) and (4) under Rule 12(b)(1). We address claims (2), (3), and (5) in the context of subject matter jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). Finding that, as we explain below, the Appellees\u2019 discretion defeats subject matter jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2), we need not address whether their discretion might create a Rule 12(b)(6) problem under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b678-15\">. The district courts provided another basis for dismissing the Appellants\u2019 moratorium claim: that RHS\u2019s interpretation of the \"such loan\u201d language in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1475(a) an interpretation that \"such loan\u201d refers only to direct loans, not guaranteed loans receives deference under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Because that interpretation makes a moratorium available only for direct loans, and because the Appellants held guaranteed loans, the district courts found that the Appellants failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We need not decide the issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\">. Our forcing the Appellees to implement the moratorium provision as well as other parts of the Housing Act which give the Appellees discretion in the manner the Appellants advocate might actually violate the housing policy. Part of the \"policy to be followed in attaining the national housing objective,\" which the Appellants leave unmentioned, is that \"private enterprise shall be encouraged to serve as large a part of the total need as it can.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. Any additional requirements placed on commercial lenders who participate in the program will increase the costs of making loans through the program. Increasing that cost could discourage private entities from serving \"as large a part of the total need\u201d as they otherwise would be willing to serve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\">. That RHS has implemented a refinancing program under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(h)(I7) for which the Appellants are ineligible does not change our analysis. We lack any meaningful standard by which to evaluate RHS's decision not to refinance loans of borrowers who are in arrears: nor could we, under \u00a7 706(1), compel RHS to refinance the Appellants\u2019 individual loans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">. The Appellants\u2019 third cause of action also refers to \"reamortization\u201d; the Appellants take issue with RHS\u2019s decision in 1991 to stop requiring commercial lenders to provide rea-mortization to borrowers. The Appellants would like RHS to reinstate its former requirement. They claim that RHS\u2019s dropping the requirement in 1991 is reviewable under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). But the Appellants give no authority to show that RHS\u2019s ceasing to require commercial lenders to reamortize guaranteed loans supports a claim under \u00a7 706(1) or (2), or that the Appellants may bring this claim now (twelve years after RHS exercised its discretion in this way).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b680-15\">.
