The district court denied Perkins\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-23\">Perkins merely states that he contests the district court\u2019s certification decision. He does not set forth the nature of the issues he intends to raise on appeal, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>he particularly fails to address the grounds upon which the district court dismissed his \u00a7 1983 complaint and denied his IFP motion. Consequently, Perkins has abandoned his district court claims, as well as any challenge to the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). As Perkins has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997). Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The district court dismissed Perkins\u2019s complaint without prejudice; however, because the complaint, as found by the district court, is premature under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and Perkins has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s decision, the dismissal should have been with prejudice. <em>See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 283-84 (5th Cir.1994). Although there is no cross-appeal, the dismissal of Perkins\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint is MODIFIED from \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d to \u201cwith prejudice as frivolous\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. <em>See Marts v. Hines, </em>117 F.3d 1504, 1505-06 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Perkins\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g), as does this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal. <em>See Ade-pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Perkins is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
