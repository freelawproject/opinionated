We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Garvin v. Spartanburg Cnty., </em>No. 7:13-cv-00454-DCN, 2013 WL 1404880 (D.S.C. filed Apr. 5 &amp; entered Apr. 9, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-16\"> Garvin also challenges the district court\u2019s post-judgment order denying as moot his motions requesting a bond hearing and for appointment of counsel. Garvin argues that he intended the bond hearing motion to be docketed in his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241 (West 2006 &amp; Supp.2013) action, <em>Garvin v. Wright, </em>No. 2:13-cv-00442-DCN-BHH (D.S.C.), rather than in this \u00a7 1983 case. In fact, the motion was docketed separately in each case and is still pending before the district court in Gar-vin's \u00a7 2241 proceeding. To the extent that Garvin intended his motion for appointment of counsel to be filed in his \u00a7 1983 action, the district court properly denied the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
