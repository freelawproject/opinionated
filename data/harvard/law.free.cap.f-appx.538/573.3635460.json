Alfonso GONZALEZ, also known as Flaco, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b601-8\">No. 12-20310</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"aoi-dedup-0\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b601-9\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b601-11\">Aug. 16, 2013.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-12\">Renata Ann Gowie, U.S. Attorney\u2019S Office, Houston, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-13\">David Adler, Bellaire, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-14\">Alfonso Gonzalez, FCI Pollock Medium, Pollock, LA, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b601-16\">Before KING, DAVIS, and ELROD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b601-17\">PER CURIAM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">The attorney appointed to represent Alfonso Gonzalez has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Gonzalez has not filed a response. Counsel\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal with the amended judgment and for this court to reconsider the <em>Anders </em>brief and motion to withdraw is GRANTED. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-23\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. The written judgment provides, confusingly, as to count three, that Gonzalez was convicted of \u201c[cjonspira-cy to possess a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>714 F.3d 873, 877 (5th Cir.2013). Count three of the indictment charged Gonzalez with conspiracy to use and carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, as set forth in counts one and two, and to possess the firearm in furtherance of such crimes, and Gonzalez pleaded guilty to the offense charged in the indictment. The judgment should be corrected to properly identify the offense of conviction on count three.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-24\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
