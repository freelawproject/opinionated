Panayoton\u2019s counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in counsel\u2019s view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asking this court to determine whether Panayoton received ineffective assistance of counsel. Panayoton has not filed a pro se supplemental brief, despite receiving notice of her right to do so, and the Government has declined to file a responsive brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-21\">Counsel questions whether Panayoton received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel because defense counsel failed to rebut the Government\u2019s argument at sentencing that Panayoton did not voluntarily disclose her crimes to law enforcement. In the absence of conclusive evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record, however, such claims are not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>680 F.3d 350, 359 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 376, 184 L.Ed.2d 222 (2012). Rather, \u201c[cjlaims of ineffective assistance of counsel are normally raised before the district court via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the record does not conclusively establish that counsel rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing, we decline to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>this claim on direct appeal. Although Pa-nayoton\u2019s claim is premature, she may, of course, reassert it in a \u00a7 2255 habeas motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Panayoton, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Panayo-ton requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Panayoton. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
