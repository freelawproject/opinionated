HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b864-23\">Luis Cisneros Ledesma appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>sentence modification pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), wherein he sought a reduction of his sentence based on Amendment 591 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). Exercising our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and construing Mr. Ledesma\u2019s pro se filings liberally, <em>see Garza v. Davis, </em>596 F.3d 1198, 1201 n. 2 (10th Cir.2010), we deny his request for <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFF\u2019) status and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">In 1998, a jury convicted Mr. Ledesma of one count of conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) included a finding that Mr. Ledes-ma\u2019s offense involved at least one kilogram of methamphetamine; it accordingly computed an advisory sentencing range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment under the Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In preparing the PSR, the probation officer applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3)(c)\u2014the appropriate Guideline for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)\u2014and cited evidence of multiple convictions in Mr. Ledesma\u2019s past.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Regarding those convictions, the government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1), alleging that Mr. Le-desma had previously been convicted of two felony drug offenses. In doing so, the government took the essential, predicate step that would oblige the district court\u2014 upon a subsequent judicial determination of the existence of those convictions\u2014to sentence Mr. Ledesma \u201cby reason\u201d of them \u201cto [the] increased punishment\u201d that was prescribed for the offense of conviction. <em>Id.; see id. </em>\u00a7 851(d)(1) (\u201cIf the person files no response to the information, or if the court determines, after hearing, that the person is subject to increased punishment by reason of prior convictions, the court <em>shall </em>proceed to impose sentence upon him as provided by this part.\u201d (emphasis added)). Mr. Ledesma did not dispute the existence of those prior convictions. <em>See </em>R., Vol. Ill, at 678 (\u201cAll the bad things on my record ... all that I did, all of it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">However, prior to sentencing, Mr. Ledesma entered into a stipulation with the government, for purposes of the sentencing enhancement triggered by the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 information, that his prior drug offenses should be treated as \u201ca single prior drug trafficking conviction,\u201d PSR, Sentencing Add., at i, because they \u201cstemmed from the same incident,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00b6 39, at 8. <em>See generally United States v. Beckstrom, </em>647 F.3d 1012, 1017 (10th Cir.2011) (\u201cOur circuit, like all others to have considered the issue, requires that the two convictions used to enhance a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) arise from <em>separate </em>\u2018criminal episodes.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">The district court adopted the PSR\u2019s findings at sentencing, effectively applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. And, after accepting the parties\u2019 stipulation, it found Mr. Ledesma was accountable for a single prior drug offense and accordingly imposed a manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>tory minimum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See generally </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (\u201cIf any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years and not more than life imprisonment....\u201d). A panel of our court affirmed Mr. Ledesma\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Ledesma, </em>208 F.3d 836, 2000 WL 155591, at *5 (10th Cir.2000) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Mr. Ledesma subsequently filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, seeking to vacate his conviction because (1) the indictment failed to specify the quantity of methamphetamine involved in his offense; and (2) in alleged contravention of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court, rather than the jury, determined the drug quantity. The district court concluded that Mr. Ledesma was procedurally barred from raising these issues for the first time on collateral review and that, in any event, his sentence comported with <em>Apprendi </em>because it was below the statutory maximum\u2014a term of life imprisonment. <em>See generally </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (providing a statutory maximum of life imprisonment). A panel of our court denied Mr. Ledesma\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and dismissed his appeal. <em>See United States v. Ledesma, </em>46 Fed.Appx. 604, 605 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Ten years later, Mr. Ledesma filed in the district court the instant motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), seeking a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 591 of the Guidelines. The district court denied his motion, and the instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Osborn, </em>679 F.3d 1193, 1195 (10th Cir.2012). However, we review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute or the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833, 837 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s sentence when the Guidelines range has been subsequently lowered by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>438 F.3d 1005, 1006-07 (10th Cir.2006). Mr. Ledesma argues that the district court abused its discretion insofar as it concluded that Amendment 591 did not authorize a reduction in his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(e)(2). However, we conclude that the district court persuasively explained why Amendment 591 does not affect Mr. Ledesma\u2019s sentence and correctly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Effective November 1, 2000, Amendment 591 revised two sections of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., app. C, amend. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>591 (2000). It first modified \u00a7 2D1.2 by clarifying that the enhanced penalties referenced in that section apply only when a defendant was convicted of one of the listed offenses in \u00a7 2D1.2. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>304 Fed.Appx. at 740. Because Mr. Ledes-ma\u2019s offense was not one \u201cinvolv[ing] a protected location or an underage or pregnant individual,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2 cmt. n. 1 (1995), this revision in no way impacted his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Amendment 591 also revised \u00a7 1B1.2 by instructing sentencing courts to apply the offense Guideline specified in the Statutory Index for the statute of conviction. <em>See United States v. Neilson, </em>721 F.3d 1185, 1189-90 (10th Cir.2013). As revised, the pertinent portion of \u00a7 IB 1.2 directs the sentencing court to \u201c[ determine the offense guideline section ... applicable to the offense of conviction\u201d and then \u201c[rjefer to the Statutory Index (Appendix A) to determine the Chapter Two offense guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a). As the First Circuit has explained, Amendment 591 was designed, <em>inter alia, </em>to stop sentencing courts from \u201cus[ing] a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct to select an offense guideline other than that referenced in the statutory index.\u201d <em>United States v. Hurley, </em>374 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Notwithstanding Mr. Ledesma\u2019s challenge, in effect, the district court followed the precise approach contemplated by Amendment 591. Under the 1995 edition of the Guidelines, individuals convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 841(a) and 841(b)(1)(A) are to be sentenced using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., app. A, at 382 (1995). This is the offense Guideline that the district court referenced <em>before </em>selecting the appropriate base offense level \u25a0within \u00a7 2D1.1. Because the district court effectively employed the approach prescribed by Amendment 591 in reaching Mr. Ledesma\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, we are hard-pressed to discern how the subsequent promulgation of Amendment 591 had any appreciable impact on his sentencing range, much less the necessary effect of lowering it. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Ledesma\u2019s motion for sentence modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Moreover, even if Mr. Ledesma could establish that Amendment 591 had the effect of lowering his advisory Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2014which, as noted, he cannot do\u2014we would still conclude that his motion was properly dismissed. His actual sentence was a function of the statutorily prescribed mandatory minimum, <em>not </em>the advisory Guidelines range; as a result\u2014depending on one\u2019s vantage point\u2014either the district court lacked the power to afford Mr. Ledesma effective relief or, alternatively, Mr. Ledesma lacked standing to challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s refusal to give him the benefit of the lowered Guidelines range (assumed to be) effected by Amendment 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">All of this becomes clear when we consider the realities of Mr. Ledesma\u2019s sentence. Specifically, upon the filing of the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 information, at sentencing, the district court made the requisite finding of fact regarding the existence of prior felony drug convictions. Critically, after establishing that Mr. Ledesma should be held accountable for one prior felony drug offense, the district court was <em>required </em>to impose a sentence at least equal to the twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence dictated by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Pay</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number><em>ton, </em>405 F.3d 1168, 1173 (10th Cir.2005) (\u201cBased on the admitted facts in [the defendant\u2019s] guilty plea, the district court had no discretion under the statute to do other than impose the mandatory minimum sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">By operation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), because that \u201cstatutorily required minimum sentence [was] greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range\u201d of 168 to 210 months, that mandatory minimum constituted Mr. Ledesma\u2019s \u201cguideline sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Wheeler, </em>230 F.3d 1194, 1196 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cIf the upper limit of the [Guidelines range is less than seven years, [the defendant] must be sentenced to the mandatory minimum seven-year sentence.\u201d). Ordinarily, \u201ca district court has no discretion to depart from a statutorily mandated minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, since statutory mi-nima were not rendered merely advisory by\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Cornelius, </em>696 F.3d 1307, 1326 (10th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In short, because the district court held Mr. Ledesma accountable for a prior felony drug offense, Mr. Ledesma\u2019s actual sentence was controlled by the statutorily prescribed mandatory minimum; his prescribed Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months ultimately did not provide even the advisory parameters of his sentence. Consequently, even if Amendment 591 had the effect of lowering Mr. Ledesma\u2019s advisory Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months (which it did not), this fact would essentially be irrelevant and would not avail Mr. Ledesma.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">That is, viewed one way, the district court (constrained by the mandatory minimum) could not afford Mr. Ledesma any effective relief and, thus, the matter was effectively moot. <em>Cf. United States v. McKissick, </em>204 F.3d 1282, 1302 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201c[B]ecause the statutory mandatory minimum sentence imposed in this case was life imprisonment, the- issue of whether the district court properly increased [the defendant\u2019s] sentencing guidelines range by two levels for possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 [2D1.1(b)(1) ] is moot.\u201d). <em>See generally United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1323 (10th Cir.2004) (\u201cAn issue becomes moot when it becomes impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatsoever on that issue....\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Or, viewed another way, and perhaps more precisely, Mr. Ledesma would not have standing on appeal to challenge the district court\u2019s refusal to implement any purported lowering effect of Amendment 591 on his Guidelines range, because the district court\u2019s decision would not actually have any detrimental effect on his sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Ramos, </em>695 F.3d 1035, 1045 (10th Cir.2012) (concluding that defendant lacked standing to challenge a mandatory-minimum provision when that provision \u201cdid not cause his sentencing injury\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 912, 184 L.Ed.2d 701 (2013). In sum, under this alternative reasoning, we also would be situated to uphold the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Ledesma\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Mr. Ledesma also contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Alleyne v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), requires his case to be remanded for resentencing. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court overruled <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), and held that \u201cany fact that increases [a] mandatory minimum [sentence] is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. We conclude, however, that Mr. Ledesma cannot prevail on this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Section 3582(c)(2) does not permit Mr. Ledesma to avail himself of subsequent case law developments; it \u201conly <em>expressly </em>allows a reduction where the Sentencing Commission, <em>not the Supreme Court, </em>has lowered the range.\u201d <em>Price, </em>438 F.3d at 1007 (second emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Blaze, </em>458 Fed.Appx. 749, 750 (10th Cir.2012) (\u201cWithout action by the Sentencing Commission, a Supreme Court decision\u2014even one with the effect of reducing a defendant\u2019s imprisonment range\u2014cannot satisfy the statutory criteria. Since [the defendant here] stakes his motion on a change in the case law ..., \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not applicable.\u201d (internal citations omitted)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the Sentencing Commission has not effectively lowered Mr. Ledesma\u2019s Guidelines range, irrespective of <em>Alleyne, </em>he is not entitled to a reduction in his sentence in this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">In order to qualify for IFP status, Mr. Ledesma must \u201cdemonstrate ... the existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Leyba, </em>543 F.3d 624, 627 (10th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Mr. Ledesma has failed to advance such an argument; thus, he is not entitled to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Ledesma\u2019s motion for sentence modification.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b864-16\"> The parties have not requested oral argument, and our examination of the briefs and appellate record leads us to conclude that oral argument will not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.

Mr. Ledesma's conviction became final before this effective date when the Supreme Court denied certiorari relief in June 2000. <em>Ledesma v.

Willis, </em>202 F.3d 1279, 1280-81 (10th Cir.2000) (discussing the finality of a case resulting from the denial of certiorari). However, Amendment 591 has been given retroactive effect. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>304 Fed.Appx. 739, 740 (10th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(c) (listing Amendment 591 among ''covered amendments\"); <em>id. </em>appl. n. 6 (\"Among the factors considered by the Commission in selecting the amendments included in subsection (c) were ... the difficulty of applying the amendment retroactively....\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">.
