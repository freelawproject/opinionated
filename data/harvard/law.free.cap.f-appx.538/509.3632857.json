Sosa-Nunez argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He specifically contends that the district court failed to adequately consider his benign motives for returning, his personal characteristics, or the fact that his illegal reentry offense was a non-violent crime. He further contends that the sentence imposed is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-24\">Generally, we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a significant procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If there is no error or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>error is harmless, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009). However, because Sosa-Nunez did not raise his substantive reasonableness argument in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, we generally will infer that the district court considered the sentencing factors set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines and \u00a7 3353(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). The record reflects that the district court expressly considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as Sosa-Nunez\u2019s arguments for mitigating his sentence but implicitly overruled his arguments and concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was adequate, fair, and reasonable. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, we have previously rejected the argument that a guidelines sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because illegal reentry is, as Sosa-Nunez puts it, merely a trespassing offense and not a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we decline Sosa-Nunez\u2019s invitation to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Furthermore, Sosa-Nunez\u2019s empirical data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67 n. 7. His sentence, which is at the top of the properly calculated guidelines range, is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 766 (5th Cir.2008). His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Sosa-Nunez has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred by sentencing him to a within-guidelines 30-month prison term. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
