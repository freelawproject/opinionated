Lassiter asserts that her sentence is plainly unreasonable because: it is above her advisory sentencing range and the district court\u2019s explanation for the sentence imposed allegedly did not justify such a high sentence; she was not convicted of the state crimes of which she was accused at the time of her revocation hearing; and she claims that the district court \u201cdid not appear to lend any weight to the fact that [ her] child suffered from leukemia and might need the assistance of his mother.\u201d Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">In reviewing a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release, this court \u201ctakes a more deferential appellate posture concerning issues of fact and the exercise of discretion than reasonableness review for guidelines sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 656 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we will affirm a supervised release revocation sentence if it is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 546 (4th Cir.2010). The first step is to determine whether the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 438 (4th Cir.2006). Only if the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable will the inquiry proceed to the second step, which is to determine whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court has considered the policy statements contained in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines and the applicable 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Supp.2013) factors, <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440, and has adequately explained the chosen sentence, although, it need not explain the sentence in as much detail as when imposing the original sentence. <em>Thompson, </em>595 F.3d at 547. When reviewing a sentence above the sentencing range, we \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). Although the <em>Carter </em>rationale applies to revocation hearings, \u201c[a] court need not be as detailed or specific when imposing a revocation sentence as it must be when imposing a post-conviction sentence!)]\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>595 F.3d at 547 (noting that a district court\u2019s reasoning may be \u201cclear from context\u201d and that the court\u2019s statements throughout the sentencing hearing may be considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">A sentence is substantively reasonable if the district court states a proper basis for its imposition of a sentence up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. Ultimately, however, the district court has broad discretion to revoke probation and impose a sentence up to that maximum. <em>Moulden, </em>478 F.3d at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We conclude that Lassiter\u2019s thirty-six-month sentence is not unreasonable. To the contrary, the district court correctly calculated the policy statement range, adequately explained its sentence, appropriately relied on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sentenced Lassiter to the statutory maximum applicable to her offense. Although the district court imposed a sentence above the advisory policy statement range, the district court noted that it was doing so because Lassiter egregiously breached the court\u2019s trust only five months after her release from prison. Moreover, although the district court heard Lassiter\u2019s arguments for leniency, it nonetheless found that the other factors in the case outweighed these circumstances; in conjunction with the nature and circumstances of Lassiter\u2019s scheme to defraud, considering Lassiter\u2019s criminal history, and \u201cconsidering the fact that a sentence of 36 months previously had no deterring effect whatsoever,\u201d the district court determined that a thirty-six-month above-sentencing range sentence was \u201cadequate, but not longer than necessary!)]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s rationale was justified and discern no procedural or substantive error in the imposition of Lassiter\u2019s sentence. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>ch. 7, pt. A(3)(b) (2012) (\u201c[A]t revocation, the court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust, while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator.\u201d). Having discerned no procedural or substantive error in the district court\u2019s imposition of a thirty-six-month sentence, \u201cit necessarily follows that [Lassiter\u2019s] sentence is not plainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
