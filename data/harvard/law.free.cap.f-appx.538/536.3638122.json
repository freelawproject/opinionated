Having conducted a de novo review of the matter, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying relief. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d)(2); <em>Carter v. Fenner, </em>136 F.3d 1000, 1005-06 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Latham v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>987 F.2d 1199, 1201-02, 1205-06 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Wilson v. Atwood Group, </em>725 F.2d 255, 257-58 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-23\">Duran\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion and his motion for recusal were both based on his assertion that the district court judge and other court officers in the Western District of Texas were members of a secret society whose purpose was to obtain and uphold the convictions of unwitting criminal defendants. Duran submitted documents that, contrary to his assertion, do not support his allegations. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Duran\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, <em>see Ross v. Marshall, </em>426 F.3d 745, 763 (5th Cir.2005), or in denying his motion for recusal, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), (b)(1); <em>Andrade v. Cho-jnacki, </em>338 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Trevino v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 173, 178 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-24\">Duran has not shown that there is a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-25\">We have previously warned Duran that sanctions would result if he persisted in filing frivolous pleadings. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>Duran, </em>406 Fed.Appx. 876, 877 (5th Cir.2010). Despite this warning, Duran filed frivolous motions in the district court, and he has filed this frivolous appeal. IT IS ORDERED that Duran is SANCTIONED in the amount of $100, payable to the clerk of this court. Until that sanction is paid, Duran may file no more appeals or initial pleadings challenging the validity of his conviction and sentence, whether those challenges are governed by \u00a7 2255 or any other statutory provision or rule, whether in this court or in any court under this court\u2019s jurisdiction, without first obtaining permission of this court or the forum court. Further, Duran is warned that unfounded accusations against the judiciary in his pleadings could also result in sanctions against him. See <em>Theriault v. Silber, </em>579 F.2d 302, 303-04 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION IMPOSED; NEW SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b564-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
