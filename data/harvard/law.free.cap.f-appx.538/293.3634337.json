We have reviewed the record and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s disability determination is limited to evaluating whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct law was applied. <em>See Johnson v. Barnhart, </em>434 F.3d 650, 653 (4th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2006)). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We do not reweigh evidence or make credibility determinations in evaluating whether a decision is supported by substantial evidence; \u201c[wjhere conflicting evidence allows reasonable minds to differ,\u201d we defer to the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Harris claims (1) that the magistrate judge erred in restricting his review after the second remand of Harris\u2019s petition solely to the issue of credibility; (2) that the district court should have remanded the case for the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) to consider the opinion of Dr. Holford, which was acquired only after the conclusion of administrative proceedings; and (3) that the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings with respect to the degree of pain suffered by Harris are both unclear and unsupported by substantial evidence. Having reviewed each of Harris\u2019 arguments in light of the record, we conclude that none of them suffices to disturb the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
