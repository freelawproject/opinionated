Citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.468, the district court revoked Seigfried\u2019s IFP status and ordered that Seigfried pay filing costs or have the suit dismissed as frivolous, reasoning that as an incarcerated felon he is ineligible to receive Social Security benefit payments. Seigfried appealed timely from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-19\">The district court\u2019s order denying Seig-fried leave to proceed IFP in the district court is a final appealable order. <em>See Roberts v. United States District Court, </em>339 U.S. 844, 845, 70 S.Ct. 954, 94 L.Ed. 1326 (1950); <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 201 (5th Cir.1997). By moving for leave to proceed IFP in this court, Seigfried challenges the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal from the order denying leave to proceed IFP in the district court is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F:3d at 202; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. RApp. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-20\">Seigfried\u2019s contention that \u00a7 404.468 does not bar a challenge to the denial of Social Security benefit payments for a period of disability preceding incarceration is not \u201cbased on an indisputably meritless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>legal theory;\u201d therefore, his position is not frivolous. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Seigfried has demonstrated that he is financially eligible to proceed IFP on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. His motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is therefore meritorious. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Accordingly, Seigfried\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is granted, the district court\u2019s order denying Seigfried leave to proceed IFP in the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">IFP MOTION GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
