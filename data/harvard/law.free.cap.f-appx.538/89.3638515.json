Aug. 25, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 345 231 (Immig. Ct. N.Y.C. June 8, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act, such as this one, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201c[A]n IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d). Here, the agency did not err in denying relief, as there was substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">The agency reasonably relied in part on Mushtaq\u2019s demeanor, finding that on numerous occasions Mushtaq paused prior to responding to questions, conveying the impression that his testimony had been scripted. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Mushtaq\u2019s credibility was also undermined by the fact that neither his original and amended asylum application nor his father\u2019s affidavit mentioned that Pakistani authorities came to Mushtaq\u2019s family\u2019s home on multiple occasions to search for him, as Mushtaq later testified. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 166 n. 3. A reasonable fact finder would not be compelled to credit Mushtaq\u2019s explanation for this omission. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was further supported by Mushtaq\u2019s failure to provide detailed testimony. \u201cWhere an applicant gives very spare testimony ... the IJ ... may fairly wonder whether the testimony is fabricated.\u201d <em>Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). As the agency found, Mushtaq, when questioned, was unable to describe the content of his political speeches. Although \u201ca finding of testimonial vagueness cannot, without more, support an adverse credibility determination unless government counsel or the IJ first attempts to solicit more detail from the alien,\u201d <em>Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir.2008), here, the IJ probed Mushtaq for additional details and, as noted above, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>not rely solely on vagueness to support the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Having already reasonably called Mush-taq\u2019s credibility into question, the agency permissibly relied on Mushtaq\u2019s failure to present evidence to corroborate the length of his hospital .stay, his marriage and application for asylum while living in Argentina, and the publication of his two newspaper articles criticizing Pakistan\u2019s military regime and advocating for democratic reform. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that agency may rely on lack of corroborative evidence where applicant\u2019s testimony is not otherwise credible). Although the IJ erred in finding that Mushtaq failed to testify that x-rays were taken of his right shoulder during his alleged one-week hospital stay, remand would be futile because there is little doubt that the agency would still find Mushtaq not credible even absent this factual error. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In sum, given the demeanor finding, the omissions, and the lack of detail and corroboration, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165-66. The adverse credibility determination is dispositive of Mushtaq\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, as those claims were all based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
