We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, and review de novo claims of due process violations. <em>Hama-zaspyan v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 744, 747 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Telluselle failed to maintain her F-l nonimmigrant status where she testified that she was not enrolled at Hawaii Pacific University or any other educational institution during the spring 2011 semester. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(f)(5)\u00ae (describing requirements for maintaining foreign student status, including \u201cpursuing a full course of study at an educational institution\u201d). The agency therefore properly found Telluselle removable for failing to maintain her nonimmigrant status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(C)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-25\">Telluselle\u2019s contention that she was denied due process during her removal proceedings is not supported by the record. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (due process claims require showing that proceedings were \u201cso fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-26\">Telluselle failed to raise in her opening brief, and therefore waived, any challenges to the BIA\u2019s determination that she is not eligible for relief from removal and to the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to remand. <em>See Lopez-Vasquez v. Holder, </em>706 F.3d 1072, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>1079-80 (9th Cir.2013) (a petitioner waives an issue by failing to raise it in the opening brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Telluselle\u2019s request that the court first review her civil lawsuit against Hawaii Pacific University or hold her ease in abeyance pending the results of her appeal of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Hawaii Pacific University is denied as moot. <em>See Telluselle v. Hawaii Pac. Univ., </em>No. 12-17191, 528 Fed.Appx. 739, 2013 WL 2953053 (9th Cir. June 17, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Telluselle\u2019s remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b778-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
