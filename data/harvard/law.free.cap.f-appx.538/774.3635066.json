Benavides, Senior Circuit Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b802-24\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-25\">A jury found Hung Van Tieu guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit access-device fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(b)(2); two counts of access-device fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1029(a)(2) and 2(a); and one count of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(a)(l) and 2(a). We have jurisdiction over Tieu\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate Tieu\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-26\">During the trial, on direct examination, Tieu\u2019s attorney questioned him regarding some of his actions that were not charged in the indictment. The district judge twice admonished the attorney \u201cnot to lead the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>witness\u201d and once not to repeat Tieu\u2019s testimony. Despite these admonishments, Tieu\u2019s attorney continued to ask leading questions and repeat Tieu\u2019s testimony. Immediately thereafter, the district judge interrupted the attorney to hold a sidebar, during which the judge told the attorney: \u201cI am just advising you on your questions and your statements to the witness before the questions. You are now abetting in perjury.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tieu\u2019s attorney ceased his direct examination of Tieu and unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial. The attorney subsequently suggested that the judge had created a conflict of interest between the attorney\u2019s personal interest and his interest in representing his client, and twice more unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial. The judge instructed the attorney that he had an obligation to continue his representation of Tieu, and the attorney did so, including conducting a redirect examination of Tieu.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Tieu argues on appeal that the judge\u2019s \u201cperjury\u201d comment created a conflict of interest for his attorney that adversely affected the attorney\u2019s performance, violating Tieu\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">\u201cIn order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on conflict of interest, a defendant must show that \u2018an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Miskinis, </em>966 F.2d 1268, 1268 (9th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 385, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980)); <em>see also Mannhalt v. Reed, </em>847 F.2d 576, 580 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cAlthough <em>Cuyler </em>involved a conflict of interest between clients, the presumption of prejudice extends to a conflict between a client and his lawyer\u2019s personal interest.\u201d). \u201cTo establish that a conflict of interest adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance, the defendant need only show that some effect on counsel\u2019s handling of particular aspects of the trial was likely.\u201d <em>Miskinis, </em>966 F.2d at 1268 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAlthough a defendant who raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is ordinarily required to show prejudice, prejudice is presumed if the alleged violation is based on an actual conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Here, the judge told Tieu\u2019s attorney\u2014in no uncertain terms\u2014that he was about to violate the law by questioning his client regarding certain conduct. Once the judge made this comment, Tieu\u2019s attorney was conflicted between his interest in avoiding his own possible exposure to criminal liability on the one hand, and his interest in continuing to deploy his planned trial strategy on Tieu\u2019s behalf, on the other. Therefore, there was an actual conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Further, the conflict likely had an adverse effect on the attorney\u2019s representation of Tieu. Tieu need only show that \u201csome effect on counsel\u2019s handling of particular aspects of the trial was likely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Tieu\u2019s attorney completely halted direct examination of Tieu when the judge made the unwarranted \u201cperjury\u201d comment. That Tieu\u2019s attorney continued to represent Tieu for the remainder of the trial, even conducting a redirect examination of Tieu, does not undermine the conclusion that the direct examination, at the very least, was adversely affected by the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Tieu\u2019s convictions are thus VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b802-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\">. Unbeknownst to counsel, the judge\u2019s admonishment apparently stemmed from a mis-recollection or misunderstanding of Tieu\u2019s testimony, during which the judge erroneously concluded that Tieu had admitted to certain facts pertaining to the charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-19\">. Because we vacate Tieu\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial on the basis of his claim regarding the \"perjury\u201d comment, we need not consider his claim that the district court abused its discretion by denying Tieu\u2019s pre-trial request for substitution of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
