We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-25\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b491-26\">LaBlanche brought this diversity suit pro se in the Southern District of Texas on behalf of her deceased son, Kent. In it, she alleged that Dr. Zulfiqar Ahmad, Doctors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>and Surgeons National Risk Retention Group (his insurer), and the State of Arizona (collectively, the \u201cdefendants\u201d) committed medical malpractice, medical fraud, and fraud of death certificate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All defendants filed motions to dismiss, which they served on LaBlanche by mailing them to the address she provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The district court granted Arizona\u2019s motion to dismiss after LaBlanche failed to respond to the motion and did not appear at the court\u2019s hearing on the issue. It based its dismissal on the State\u2019s sovereign immunity, as well as the court\u2019s lack of subject matter jurisdiction and La-Blanche\u2019s failure to state a claim and properly plead. One month later, the district court granted the other defendants\u2019 motions, to which LaBlanche also had failed to respond, for lack of personal jurisdiction over the doctor and his insurer and improper venue. It then issued final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">LaBlanche twice moved to vacate the district court\u2019s judgment, claiming that she was never served with defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. The district court ordered defendants to file proof of service. After reviewing their submissions, it found that defendants properly mailed their motions to the address LaBlanche provided. The district court concluded that, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b)(2)(C), service was complete upon mailing, and it must deny her motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">LaBlanche appeals the dismissals, arguing that the district court erred dismissing her claims because she did not receive notice of defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo.\u201d Boyd v. Driver, </em>579 F.3d 513, 515 (5th Cir.2009). La-Blanche does not challenge the substance of the district court\u2019s orders dismissing her claims, but contends that we should vacate the district court\u2019s judgment because the United States Postal Service \u201cnegligently delivered the certified mailed notices and dismissal motions to Plaintiff after the [hearing on Arizona\u2019s motion to dismiss,] which denied Plaintiff proper/sufficient notice and defense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b)(2)(C), a party properly serves a motion on its opponent by \u201cmailing it to the person\u2019s last known address\u2014in which event service is complete upon mailing.\u201d Such notice also comports with due process if it is \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 efforts to provide LaBlanche with notice complied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and were reasonably calculated to apprise her of their motions. The district court, therefore, did not err in dismissing LaBlanche\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">For the reasons given above, the district court\u2019s orders granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">. She had previously brought the same claims against Dr. Ahmad (but not the other defendants) in the Southern District, which the district court dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction three months before she filed the present suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">. Although LaBlanche's briefing is sparse, \"we liberally construe briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants and apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel.\u201d <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-14\">. She does not dispute that she received the notices before the deadline for filing her responses to Dr. Ahmad\u2019s and his insurer\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b492-15\">. There is no evidence on the record that defendants or the district court knew prior to judgment that defendants\u2019 attempts to provide notice failed. <em>Cf. Jones v. Flowers, </em>547 U.S. 220, 225-26, 126 S.Ct. 1708, 164 L.Ed.2d 415 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
