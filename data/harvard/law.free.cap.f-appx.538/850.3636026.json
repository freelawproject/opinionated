United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 181 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011). Daniels, who previously had filed an unsuccessful 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, claimed in his \u00a7 2241 petition that his sentence for a crack cocaine offense was unlawful because <em>DePierre </em>ruled that the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) was not synonymous with crack cocaine. The district court dismissed his petition after concluding that the claim did not satisfy the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause because Daniels had not shown that <em>DePierre </em>applied retroactively or rendered him actually innocent of his offenses. On appeal, Daniels argues that: (1) he could bring a petition under \u00a7 2241 because he satisfied the three-part test in <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999), and, therefore, had shown that the savings clause applied to his claim; (2) based on the Supreme Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of \u201ccocaine base\u201d in <em>DePierre, </em>he stands convicted of an offense involving a \u201cnonexistent substance\u201d because his indictment misrepresented the nature of his charges by stating that \u201ccocaine base\u201d was commonly known as crack; and (3) his conviction violates the Due Process Clause because he is actually innocent, and that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">The availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Challenges to the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself, are properly brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e), however, permits a federal prisoner, under very limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Under the savings clause, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). We recently held that the savings clause is a jurisdictional provision, meaning that a petitioner must show that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d before the district court has jurisdiction to review the \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Williams v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number><em>Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from us before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h). Standing alone, the restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). Consequently, a petitioner who has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion and been denied may not circumvent the Antiterrorism Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) successive-motion rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>While the scope of the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause has not been fully defined, we\u2019ve noted, in <em>dicta, </em>that a petitioner meets the requirements of the savings clause when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed the claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244; <em>see also Turner v. Warden Coleman FCI (Medium), </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333-34 (11th Cir.2013) (noting that the <em>Wofford </em>test was dicta).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">In <em>Williams, </em>we recently interpreted <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>holding as establishing two necessary, if not sufficient, conditions for a sentencing claim to be viable under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. 713 F.3d at 1343^14. First, the claim must be based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>Id. </em>Secondly, the Supreme Court \u201cmust have overturned a circuit precedent that squarely resolved the claim so that the petitioner had no genuine opportunity to raise it at trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, a petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3. \u201cEven if a petitioner succeeds in making <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>three-part showing, he would then need to demonstrate \u2018actual innocence\u2019 of the crime for which he was convicted to demonstrate an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>709 F.3d at 1334 n. 2. Actual innocence means factual innocence, not legal insufficiency. <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Here, the district court did not err in dismissing Daniels\u2019s petition. The claim that Daniels raises in his \u00a7 2241 petition addresses the legality of his sentence, not the execution of his sentence, and, therefore, it was within the scope of \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241. <em>See Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Because Daniels already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied, he was not permitted to circumvent the statutory restriction on successive \u00a7 2255 motions by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1308. In order to proceed under \u00a7 2241, Daniels needed to show that \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to challenge the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Daniels\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>DePierre </em>to argue that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate and ineffective\u201d to challenge the legality of his detention is unavailing. Contrary to Daniels\u2019s contentions, <em>DePierre </em>did not narrow the interpretation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) and hold that \u201ccocaine base\u201d can never be \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d but instead held that \u201ccocaine base\u201d includes not only \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>but all cocaine in its chemically basic form. <em>See DePierre, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2237 (\u201c[T]he term \u2018cocaine base\u2019 as used in \u00a7 841(b)(1) means not just \u2018crack cocaine,\u2019 but cocaine in its chemically basic form.\u201d). Accordingly, <em>DePierre </em>did not decriminalize Daniels\u2019s conduct, nor indicate that he was convicted of a non-existent offense or a \u201cnon-existent substance.\u201d <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. In any event, <em>DePierre </em>did not overturn \u201ca circuit precedent that squarely resolved the claim so that the petitioner had no genuine opportunity to raise it at trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion,\u201d since it merely involved the interpretation of a substantive criminal statute. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343-44; <em>see also DePierre, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2237.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Finally, although Daniels argues that his conviction violates the Due Process Clause because he is actually innocent and that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing, these arguments are moot because he has not met the threshold requirement for showing that the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause applies. Since Daniels fails to show that his claim satisfied the savings clause, he cannot proceed under \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. In short, the district court did not have jurisdiction over Daniels\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, and did not err in dismissing the petition. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
