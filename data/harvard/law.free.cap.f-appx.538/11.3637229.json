We review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor. <em>See Townsend v. Benjamin Enters., Inc., </em>679 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir.2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of the underlying proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">1. <em>Vagueness Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">A statute can be unconstitutionally vague if it (1) \u201cfails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,\u201d or (2) \u201cauthorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Hill v. Colorado, </em>530 U.S. 703, 732, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000); <em>accord VIP of Berlin, LLC v. Town of Berlin, </em>593 F.3d 179, 186-87, 191 (2d Cir.2010). \u201c[Ejconomic regulation,\u201d such as the statute at issue here, \u201cis subject to a less strict vagueness test,\u201d because it often has a narrow subject matter, and because a regulated business \u201cmay have the ability to clarify the meaning of the regulation by its own inquiry, or by resort to an administrative process.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 498, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">The 2011 Law states that \u201cAll Solid Waste generated within and/or collected within the County of Oswego shall be delivered to the County Solid Waste Facility.\u201d 2011 Law \u00a7 4(9)(a). Excepted from this requirement are \u201cRecyclable Materials\u201d\u2014including \u201cRecyclable Materials generated as a result of C &amp; D<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> activity\u201d\u2014 which may be taken to any facility, regardless of location, that provides for their \u201creuse, recovery, or Recycling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4(6)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">The district court upheld the 2011 Law against JWJ\u2019s vagueness challenge except insofar as \u00a7 2(25) permits the Director of Solid Waste Programs to determine which materials are recyclable on a \u201ccase by case basis,\u201d which procedure the district court held permit arbitrary enforcement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">JWJ argues on appeal that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as a whole because it denies people of ordinary intelligence an opportunity to understand whether \u201cC &amp; D Debris\u201d constitutes \u201cRecyclable Materials,\u201d which can be brought to any facility that provides for reuse, recovery, and recycling, including the private transfer station operated by JWJ, or \u201cSolid Waste,\u201d which\u2014if it originates in Oswego County\u2014must be brought to the County Solid Waste Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">In fact, the 2011 Law is not vague as to these questions. Section 4(10) reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-13\">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the source separation and marketing of Recyclable Materials from C &amp; D Debris or other Solid Waste at the point of collection, provided, however, that such Recyclable Materials are segregated in a suitable container and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>are not co-mingled with other Solid Wastes before transport to market. Recyclable Materials that are co-mingled with other Solid Wastes shall be subject to the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">By providing for the \u201cseparation ... of Recyclable Materials from C &amp; D Debris,\u201d <em>id., </em>the quoted statutory text makes clear that C &amp; D Debris is not, as JWJ contends, a subset of \u201cRecyclable Material.\u201d If C &amp; D Debris were merely a type of \u201cRecyclable Material,\u201d it would logically be impossible to \u201cseparate\u201d the two. Rather, C &amp; D Debris can consist of both recyclable and non-reeyclable material. These subcategories can be separated through \u201csource separation\u201d\u2014that is, through sorting before they are hauled. The final sentence of the quoted text indicates that unsorted C &amp; D Debris, because it commingles \u201cRecyclable Material\u201d and \u201cother Solid Wastes,\u201d is subject to the flow control provisions governing Solid Waste, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 4(9), which require that such waste be delivered to the County Solid Waste Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">JWJ also contends that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as to whether Recyclable Materials may be brought to a non-County facility, such as a private transfer station. In fact, the statute clearly permits the bringing of such materials to a non-County facility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6(c), 9(a)(i), so long as they are not \u201cdisposed [of] by depositing\u201d them there permanently, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6(f). Indeed, JWJ itself appears readily able to discern this meaning. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. 21 (\u201cJWJ agrees that the 2011 Law does not prohibit Recyclable Materials from being delivered to a transfer station. It only prohibits \u2018disposal by depositing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Recyclable Materials at a transfer station.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Because the 2011 Law thus provides \u201cpeople of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,\u201d <em>Hill v. Colorado, </em>530 U.S. at 732, 120 S.Ct. 2480, JWJ\u2019s void-for-vagueness challenge necessarily fails to meet the \u201cless strict\u201d standard applied to economic regulation, <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. at 498, 102 S.Ct. 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">2. <em>Takings Clause Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">JWJ argues that the district court erred in rejecting its takings claim as (1) unripe and (2) without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">Where \u201ca State provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,\u201d a \u201cproperty owner has not suffered a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until the owner has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain just compensation\u201d through that procedure. <em>Williamson Cnty. Reg\u2019l Planning Comm\u2019n v. Hamilton Bank, </em>473 U.S. 172, 195, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985); <em>accord Island Park, LLC v. CSX Transp., </em>559 F.3d 96, 109-10 (2d Cir.2009). Where the property owner has not availed itself of the state procedure, the claim is unripe. <em>See Island Park, LLC v. CSX Transp., </em>559 F.3d at 109.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">As the district court correctly held, New York provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation for the sort of taking at issue in this case. <em>See </em>N.Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Const, art. I, \u00a7 7(a) (establishing right to just compensation in takings cases); N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. Law art. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 501-14 (setting forth procedure for determining just compensation). JWJ having failed to employ these procedures, its claim is not ripe for federal review. <em>See Vandor, Inc. v. Militello, </em>301 F.3d 37, 39 (2d Cir.2002) (dismissing takings claim as unripe for failure to seek review in New York state court). We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss JWJ\u2019s takings claim on that ground without further need to address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">3. <em>Substantive Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">JWJ contends that the 2011 Law makes it prohibitively expensive to operate its transfer station, thereby depriving Hol-brook of his freedom \u201cto engage in any of the common occupations of life.\u201d <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). Precedent will not stretch that far. In the cases on which JWJ relies, the Supreme Court recognized a due process right to be free from government actions that <em>directly </em>restrict one\u2019s employment opportunities, either by regulating eligibility for professional employment, <em>see Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 573-74, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), or by refusing to rehire a former employee while making a \u201ccharge against him that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701. Due process has not been construed to preclude government actions that adversely affect a business\u2019s profitability. Accordingly, the district court correctly entered judgment in favor of defendants on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">4. <em>Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">JWJ brought, and now presses on appeal, a \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claim, arguing that competitor Syracuse Haulers is receiving more favorable treatment from the County because it is permitted to haul source-separated recyclable material (sorted from C &amp; D Debris) to a non-County facility, while JWJ may not haul TCOTC-separated C &amp; D Debris to a non-County facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u201c[C]lass-of-one plaintiffs must show an extremely high degree of similarity between themselves and the persons to whom they compare themselves.\u201d <em>Clubside, Inc. v. Valentin, </em>468 F.3d 144, 159 (2d Cir.2006) (requiring showing that \u201cno rational person could regard the circumstances of the plaintiff to differ from those of a comparator to a degree that would justify the differential treatment on the basis of a legitimate government policy\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). JWJ\u2019s circumstances are, in fact, materially different from those of Syracuse Haulers. The record indicates, and JWJ in its brief appears to accept, <em>see </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. 40, that Syracuse Haulers is hauling source-separated recyclable material, which the 2011 Law exempts from its flow control requirements, <em>see </em>2011 Law \u00a7 4(9)(a)(i). JWJ wishes to haul non-separated material, which the 2011 Law considers \u201cSolid Waste\u201d subject to the statute\u2019s flow control requirements. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4(10). JWJ\u2019s conclusory statement that no legitimate policy supports Oswego County\u2019s distinction between source separation and post-collection separation lacks any persuasive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">5. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">We have considered JWJ\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\">. Indeed, such a \u201dclarif[ication]\" took place here. Before bringing suit, JWJ corresponded with Oswego County and received the County\u2019s interpretation of the provisions at issue, which accords with our own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b40-14\">. The term \u201cC &amp; D\u201d refers to construction and demolition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-15\">. The County does not appeal from this ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\">. JWJ contends that we need not determine ripeness because the district court held its claim ripe in an earlier proceeding. <em>See JWJ Indus., Inc. v. Oswego Cnty., </em>No. 5:09 Civ. 0740 (NPM/DEP), 2009 WL 2163097 (N.D.N.Y. July 17, 2009). We are not persuaded. The holding to which plaintiffs refer was reached in another suit, challenging not the 2011 Law but an earlier version of that statute. <em>See id. </em>at * 1. In any event, the district court had \"discretion[ ]\u201d to \u201creconsider its own decisions prior to final judgment.\u201d <em>DiLaura v. Power Auth. of the State of N.Y., </em>982 F.2d 73, 76 (2d Cir.1992) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
