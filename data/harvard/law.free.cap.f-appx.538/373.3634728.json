She alleges that her former employer, EMJ Corporation (\u201cEMJ\u201d), terminated her because she complained about public displays of affection between a male supervisor and female coworker. Because Kummerle\u2019s pleadings fail to establish that she had a reasonable belief that EMJ\u2019s work environment violated Title VII, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">Kummerle asserts that her former supervisor, Ray Catlin (\u201cCatlin\u201d), and another employee, Daisy Owens (\u201cOwens\u201d), created a \u201csexually charged atmosphere\u201d at EMJ by frequently engaging in consensual intimate conduct (such as Catlin\u2019s rubbing Owens\u2019s back) in front of other employees. She contends that the public displays of affection, while not sexually explicit, were offensive to observers. In May 2011, Kummerle and another employee, Carolyn Paulus (\u201cPaulus\u201d), complained to EMJ\u2019s Chief Operating Officer about the discomfort they and other females in the office felt as a result of the behavior. Shortly thereafter, Kummerle was terminated by Catlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">Kummerle sued EMJ, asserting hostile work environment and retaliation claims under Title VII. After concluding that Kummerle failed to plead facts establishing a reasonable inference that either the unwelcome harassment was based on Kummerle\u2019s sex or that her belief that she was subjected to a hostile work environment was objectively reasonable, the district court dismissed both claims with prejudice. Kummerle appeals the dismissal of her retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings <em>de novo, </em>using the same standards applied to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 529 (5th Cir.2004). We accept a complaint\u2019s well-pleaded facts as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThreadbare recitals of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-24\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee who opposes an employment practice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>violates Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). To establish a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must plead facts showing that she had a reasonable belief that the employer was engaged in an unlawful employment practice. <em>Byers v. Dallas Morning News, </em>209 F.3d 419, 428 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Kummerle argues that she reasonably believed that the public displays of affection between Catlin and Owens created a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. We disagree. As adequately explained by the district court, Kummerle\u2019s pleadings contain no indication that the consensual intimate conduct between Catlin and Owens was either motivated by a discriminatory intent toward women or sufficiently egregious to come close to establishing an unlawful work environment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reasonableness of Kummerle\u2019s belief is further undermined by the fact that she fails to cite any case holding that public displays of affection in the workplace are sufficient to cause a violation of Title VII. <em>But cf. Bourbeau v. City of Chicopee, </em>445 F.Supp.2d 106, 113 (D.Mass.2006) (\u201cThe court is aware of no decision under Title VII ... which would extend hostile work environment protection to an employee ... who simply witnessed ... amorous contact [such as kissing, back rubbing, and intimate embracing] between two co-workers.\u201d). Offensive and unprofessional behavior by co-workers is not, alone, a violation of law. Therefore, the district court correctly held that Kummerle\u2019s retaliation claim fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-5\">. Contrary to Kummerle\u2019s assertions, the district court did not err by applying a \"reasonable person\" standard instead of a \"reasonable woman\" standard when it evaluated the hostility of the alleged harassment. <em>See, i.e., Butler v. Ysleta Indp. Sch. Dist., </em>161 F.3d 263, 269 (5th Cir.1998) (stating that a sexually objectionable environment must be \"one that a <em>reasonable person </em>would find hostile or abusive\u201d (quoting <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 787, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 2283, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998)) (emphasis added)). The term \u201creasonable person\u201d is a gender neutral way of referring to a \"reasonable woman\" or a \"reasonable man.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
