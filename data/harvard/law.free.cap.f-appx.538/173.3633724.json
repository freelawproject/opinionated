Over the course of the next two decades, he was adjudicated guilty of numerous New Jersey offenses, including shoplifting (first in 1994, and again in 1995), <em>see </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:20-ll(b)(l), and possessing a defaced firearm in 2010, <em>see </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:39-3(d). As a result of the firearms offense, the Government charged him with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-21\">Hawse conceded removability, but sought cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. Following a hearing, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) concluded that Hawse warranted a favorable exercise of discretion on his cancellation application, but determined that he was statutorily ineligible for such relief. Section 1229b(a) provides that the Attorney General may cancel the removal of an alien who, inter alia, \u201chas resided in the United States continuously for [seven] years after having been admitted in any status[.]\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). Continuous residence ends, however, when the alien commits an offense that renders him removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229b(d)(l)(B). Section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), in turn, provides that an alien is removable if, inter alia, he has been \u201cconvicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.\u201d The IJ found that Hawse\u2019s 1994 and 1995 shoplifting convictions constituted crimes involving moral turpitude that rendered him removable. Therefore, the IJ concluded, Hawse\u2019s period of continuous residence ended when he committed the second shoplifting offense in 1995, four years short of the requisite seven years of continuous residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">Hawse filed an administrative appeal challenging the IJ\u2019s determination that his shoplifting offenses cut off his period of continuous residence. In particular, Hawse argued that he was not \u201cconvicted of ... crimes\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) because his shoplifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>violations were not \u201ccrimes\u201d under New Jersey law, but rather \u201cdisorderly persons offenses.\u201d <em>See </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:20-11(c) (1994) (amended 2000) (\u201cAny person found guilty of [shoplifting] under subsection b. is a disorderly person.... \u201d); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:lAt(b) (\u201cDisorderly persons offenses ... are not crimes within the meaning of the Constitution of [New Jersey].\u201d). The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) rejected that argument, holding that Hawse\u2019s \u201cshoplifting violations constitute convictions under [\u00a7 1101(a)(48) (defining \u201cconviction\u201d for immigration purposes) ] and therefore crimes under [\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) ].\u201d This conclusion rested on the fact that the \u201cshoplifting statute at issue ... requires the State to demonstrate the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Accordingly, the BIA held that Hawse was statutorily ineligible for cancellation, and dismissed the appeal. Hawse filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We have jurisdiction over the petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). \u201cBecause the BIA issued its own decision, we review that decision, and not that of the IJ.\u201d <em>Sheriff v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>587 F.3d 584, 588 (3d Cir.2009) (citing <em>Ezeagwuna v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 116, 126 (3d Cir.2002)). \u201cThis Court reviews the BIA\u2019s legal determinations de novo, subject to the principles of deference articulated in <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).\u201d <em>Briseno-Flores v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 226, 228 (3d Cir.2007) (parallel citations omitted) (citing <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 347, 349 (3d Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Here, the BIA held that \u201cin order for the shoplifting offense at issue ... to constitute a \u2018crime\u2019 under [\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) ], the elements of such offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the conviction for such offense must constitute a \u2018conviction\u2019 under [\u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A) ].\u201d We recently reviewed identical reasoning in <em>Castillo v. Attorney General, </em>729 F.3d 296 (3d Cir.2013). Castillo, like Hawse, pleaded guilty to shoplifting under N.J. Stat. Ann \u00a7 2C:20\u201411(b)(1) in municipal court in the mid-1990s. <em>Id. </em>at 298-99. In both <em>Castillo </em>and this case, the Board relied on the definition of \u201cconviction\u201d in \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A), and the interpretation of that term in <em>In re Eslamizar, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 684 (BIA 2004), to conclude that a finding of guilt constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d as long as it is made beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Castillo, </em>729 F.3d at 300-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">We held in <em>Castillo, </em>however, that while it is a necessary condition that the finding of guilt be beyond a reasonable doubt, the better reading of <em>Eslamizar </em>requires a more \u201copen-ended\u201d inquiry into whether the proceeding was <em>criminal in nature </em>under the governing law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 306-07. The factors relevant to that inquiry include \u201chow the prosecuting jurisdiction characterized the offense at issue, the consequences of a finding of guilt, and the rights available to the accused as well as any other characteristics of the proceeding itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given that the Board did not employ this \u201cgeneral \u2018criminal proceeding<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> approach to \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A),\u201d and because its reading of <em>Eslamizar </em>was not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference, <em>see </em>footnote 1, <em>supra, </em>we remanded for the BIA to clarify or reconsider <em>Eslamizar </em>and address whether Castillo was \u201cconvicted of a crime\u201d under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). <em>Id. </em>at 306-07, 309-11. Given the similarities between <em>Castillo </em>and this case, we believe that a remand is appropriate here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we will grant the petition for review, vacate the order of the Board, and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\">. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that <em>Eslamizar </em>was \u201cdifficult to understand\u201d and had not been consistently applied by the BIA. <em>Castillo, </em>729 F.3d at 305-06, 308-11. Therefore, we determined that the decision was not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>Id. </em>at 308-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-16\">. Hawse's \"Motion to Amend to Introduce New Evidence\u201d is denied. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>Gomez-Zuluaga v. Att'y Gen., </em>527 F.3d 330, 340 (3d Cir.2008) (\"Our review is confined solely to the administrative record. ...\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
