We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>dence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Jimenez-Araujo testified that he worked on a construction projected awarded to his friend, the son of a government official. He further testified that unsuccessful construction bidders threatened and harmed him because they were upset that they did not win the construction project. The record does not compel the conclusion that these threats or harm, or any future harm Jimenez-Araujo fears, was or will be on account of a protected ground. <em>See Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (the REAL ID Act \u201crequires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d); <em>see also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (\u201c[T]he mere existence of a generalized \u2018political\u2019 motive underlying [the persecutors\u2019 actions] is inadequate to establish ... the proposition that [a petitioner] fears persecution <em>on account of </em>political opinion, as \u00a7 101(a)(42) requires.\u201d). We reject Jimenez-Araujo\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to consider his arguments regarding nexus. <em>See Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 990 (9th Cir.2010) (the BIA \u201cdoes not have to write an exegesis on every contention\u201d). In the absence of a nexus to a protected ground, Jimenez-Araujo\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Finally, Jimenez-Araujo failed to raise any substantive challenge to the denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not addressed in the argument portion of a brief are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b796-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
