We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">In 1990, Drake pled guilty to a felony\u2014 the knowing production without lawful authority of an identification document, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(1)\u2014in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. His complaint seeks a declaration that he nevertheless has \u201cthe right to possess, ship, receive, and own firearms,\u201d despite being a felon. <em>Cf </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (prohibiting felons from shipping or transporting firearms in interstate commerce and receiving firearms transported in interstate or foreign commerce). He claims that former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards pardoned him for his offense, resulting in a full restoration of his civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-20\">As we have told Drake previously, <em>see Drake v. United States, </em>249 Fed.Appx. 332, 332-33 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam), restoration of civil rights is a matter \u201cgoverned by the law of the convicting jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Beecham v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 368, 371, 114 S.Ct. 1669, 128 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). His putative Louisiana pardon has no bearing on the <em>federal </em>restrictions placed on him as a result of his <em>federal </em>conviction. Relief from disabilities imposed by federal law related to firearms ownership and possession is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c), which requires application to the Attorney General by those seeking such relief. Drake has made no such application, and the federal courts therefore lack jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Bean, </em>537 U.S. 71, 74, 123 S.Ct. 584, 154 L.Ed.2d 483 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-21\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b612-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
