Katrina Smith, executrix of Helen Cliette Houey\u2019s estate, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for TD Bank and dismissing Helen and Emmanuel Houey\u2019s complaint challenging the foreclosure of real property.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-24\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T] he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-27\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on February 5, 2013. The notice of appeal was filed on March 28, 2013. Because Smith failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-28\"> Smith has not appealed the district court's denial of her motion to intervene.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
