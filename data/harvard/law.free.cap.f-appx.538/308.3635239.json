Betskoff, Sr., appeals the district court\u2019s orders declining to remand to Maryland state court his suit against Bank of America, dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim, and denying his motion to reconsider. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-27\">Given that Betskoffs complaint established both diversity and federal question jurisdiction, the district court properly denied Betskoffs motion to remand the case to state court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>(b) (2006); <em>Francis v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>709 F.3d 362, 366-67 (4th Cir.2013). Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in exercising supplemental jurisdiction over his closely associated state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a) (2006); <em>Crosby v. City of Gastonia, </em>635 F.3d 634, 644 (4th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">We also conclude that the district court properly granted Bank of America\u2019s Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. As the district court observed, Betskoffs attempts to assert claims under the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act, Md. Code Ann., Com. Law \u00a7\u00a7 14-201 to 14-204 (LexisNexis 2005), the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Md.Code Ann., Com. Law \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 to 13-501 (LexisNexis 2005 &amp; Supp.2012), and the Truth In Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666h(a) (2006), must each fail because the statutory schemes in question protect only consumer credit transactions; they do not provide causes of action relating to credit transactions between corporate entities. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Com. Law \u00a7 14-201 (c) (LexisNexis 2005); Md.Code Ann., Com. Law \u00a7\u00a7 13-101(c)-(d), 13-303 (LexisNexis Supp.2012); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1603(1), 1666h(a) (2006). By Betskoffs own representation, the bank account involved in his suit is a corporate account belonging to a limited liability company, and the debt that was offset by Bank of America had accrued on a credit card associated with that corporate account. The three statutory schemes that he attempts to invoke are therefore inapplicable to his circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">As for Betskoffs state law conversion claim, we recognize that a defendant may commit conversion even if acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d and without \u201cany consciousness of wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Nickens v. Mount Vernon Realty Group, LLC, </em>429 Md. 53, 54 A.3d 742, 757 (2012) (citation omitted). Yet Betskoffs claim must fail because Maryland law established that money, as an intangible, is not subject to a claim for conversion unless \u201ca plaintiff can allege that the defendant converted specific segregated or identifiable funds.\u201d <em>Allied, Inv. Corp. v. Jasen, </em>354 Md. 547, 731 A.2d 957, 966 (1999); <em>see also Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Borzym, </em>379 Md. 249, 841 A.2d 828, 833 n. 3 (2004). Because Betskoffs funds were commingled with others not only when he deposited them into a third party\u2019s account but also when Bank of America used the account funds to offset the credit card delinquency, \u201cthe cash los[t] its specific identity\u201d such that, under Maryland law, it no longer retained the discrete, unitary identity necessary for Betskoffs interests in it to be redressed under a theory of conversion. <em>Allied Inv. Corp., </em>731 A.2d at 967; <em>Lasater v. Guttmann, </em>194 Md.App. 431, 5 A.3d 79, 88 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Finally, Betskoffs claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is also doomed, as Bank of America would not be liable even if it did what the complaint alleges: It would not be \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d for Bank of America to offset a debt associated with a bank account with funds that were deposited in that account, especially as Betskoff has admitted that Bank of America did not know the true source of the funds. <em>See Manikhi v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>360 Md. 333, 758 A.2d 95, 113 (2000) (discussing elements).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Accordingly, although we grant Betskoff leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument will not aid the deci-sional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
