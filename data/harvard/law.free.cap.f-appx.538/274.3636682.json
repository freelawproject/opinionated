Craine, </em>No. 10-752, 2013 WL 772961 (D.Md. Feb. 27, 2013), ECF No. 78 (the \u201cOpinion\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">On December 7, 2012, at the conclusion of a trial in the District of Maryland, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Fernandes on his \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim, awarding $12,700 in compensatory damages. Because he was the prevailing party, Fernandes was entitled to seek attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The applicable local rule required Fernandes to file any fee motion within fourteen days of the entry of judgment, which occurred on December 10, 2012. <em>See </em>D. Md. R. 109.2. The parties agree that, accounting for the intervening Christmas holiday, the deadline for submission of such a motion was December 26, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">Fernandes\u2019s lawyer did not learn of the judgment until December 27, 2012\u2014one day too\u2014late because the Notice of Electronic Filing (\u201cNEF\u201d) heralding the judgment had been diverted to his email system\u2019s \u201cjunk mail\u201d folder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On that date, Fernandes moved for a one-day extension of the deadline, simultaneously filing his fee request and a memorandum in support thereof. In his extension motion, Fernandes urged the district court to find that his neglect in filing a timely fee motion could be excused under the federal rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">The district court denied Fernandes\u2019s motions, explaining that the lawyer\u2019s failure to meet the filing deadline amounted to nothing more than \u201crun of the mill inattentiveness.\u201d Opinion 10. More specifically, the court observed that Fer-nandes\u2019s lawyer, an \u201cexperienced litigator,\u201d should have known that the federal courts generally enter a judgment contemporaneously with, or shortly following, the return of a verdict. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, according to the court, the lawyer should have monitored the status of the case by way of the court\u2019s electronic docket or by contacting his opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">We review the denial of a motion to extend a filing deadline for abuse of discretion. <em>See Thompson v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>76 F.3d 530, 534 (4th Cir.1996). \u201cAn error of law by a district court is by definition an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>tion Hunter v. Earthgrains Co. Bakery, </em>281 F.3d 144, 150 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">A party seeking an extension after missing a filing deadline must demonstrate that failure to act within the specified time was the result of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(b)(1)(B). Whether neglect is \u201cexcusable\u201d has been described by the Supreme Court as \u201cat bottom an equitable [inquiry], taking account of all relevant circumstances,\u201d including the following: (1) the danger of prejudice to the non-movant; (2) the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings; (3) the reason for the delay, including whether it was in the reasonable control of the movant; and (4) whether the movant acted in good faith. <em>Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>507 U.S. 380, 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">We have stressed that the third <em>Pioneer </em>factor\u2014the reason for the delay\u2014is the \u201cmost important.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>76 F.3d at 534.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sole reason for Fernandes\u2019s tardy submission was the email malfunction described above. In <em>Robinson v. Wix Filtration Corp., LLC, </em>we considered the responsibilities of counsel under arguably similar circumstances. <em>See </em>599 F.3d 403 (4th Cir.2010). Because of various computer problems, Robinson\u2019s lawyer failed to receive electronic notice of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment prior to its award. On appeal, we ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Robinson\u2019s motion to vacate the summary judgment. As we emphasized, however, the critical consideration was that the lawyer was aware of his computer troubles and made the \u201cstrategic decision\u201d to remain \u201cwillfully blind to whether the opposing side had filed a dispositive motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. Importantly, we declined to impose a \u201cgeneral duty to monitor dockets,\u201d limiting our ruling to the straightforward conclusion that \u201ccounsel cannot make the calculated choice to take no action with respect to his electronic inaccessibility ... and then avail himself of discretionary relief from the consequences of that choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In contrast to <em>Robinson, </em>there is nothing in this record suggesting that Fer-nandes\u2019s lawyer was aware of any computer problems, that he was willfully blind to the status of the electronic docket, or that he made a strategic choice to remain ignorant of the district court\u2019s judgment. Absent such a circumstance, requiring Fer-nandes\u2019s lawyer to \u201cstay apprised of the status of his case\u201d by manually checking the docket would engender a general duty to monitor\u2014the very obligation <em>Robinson </em>rejected. <em>See </em>Opinion 10. Thus, on the most important <em>Pioneer </em>factor, the court contravened our precedent, committing a legal error that, by definition, constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision and remand for such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>materials submitted and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-11\">. By agreement of the parties, the trial was conducted by a United States magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-12\">. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), which provides, in pertinent part, that \u2018\u2018[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [\u00a7 1983] ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b303-18\">. On appeal, Craine suggests that the record does not support the lawyer\u2019s explanation concerning misdelivery of the NEF. In the proceedings below, however, \"Craine [did] not argue, and [the district court did] not find, that counsel for Mr. Fernandes acted in bad faith.\u201d Opinion 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\">. It is apparent that the second <em>Pioneer </em>factor (length and impact of delay) and the fourth <em>Pioneer </em>factor (good faith) tend to favor Fer-nandes. As for the first <em>Pioneer </em>factor (prejudice), Craine does not appear to have shown that his ability to respond to the fee motion was compromised by Fernandes's one-day delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b304-11\">. Fernandes makes two other contentions on appeal: (1) that Craine\u2019s subsequent motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict reset the time for filing a fee motion, and (2) that the district court abused its discretion in declining to suspend the local rules on a showing of good cause. In light of our disposition of this appeal, we need not reach or assess either of those theories.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
