In this case, Mark Leyse ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>peals the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his Complaint against Bank of America (\u201cBoA\u201d), in which he alleged a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(B). For the reasons that follow, we will vacate and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">On March 11, 2005, DialAmericaMarketing, Inc. (\u201cDialAmerica\u201d), telephoned Leyse on his residential telephone line, which is also associated with Leyse\u2019s roommate, Genevieve Dutriaux. The call contained a prerecorded message, and Leyse alleges that the call violated the TCPA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This suit is based on that call and it is the third class action that Leyse and Dutriaux have pursued based on the same March 2005 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">On April 12, 2005, Dutriaux filed a putative TCPA class action in the Southern District of New York, No. 05 Civ. 3838 (the <em>\u201cDutriaux </em>\u201d action). The action was ultimately administratively closed on December 1, 2008, and neither Dutriaux nor BoA has sought to reopen the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">On March 10, 2009, Leyse filed a TCPA action against BoA in the Western District of North Carolina. BoA successfully moved to transfer the case to the Southern District of New York, which dismissed the suit. <em>Leyse v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>No. 09 Civ. 7654, 2010 WL 2382400 (S.D.N.Y. June 14, 2010) <em>(\u201cLeyse </em>/\u201d). In <em>Leyse I, </em>the district court concluded that Leyse was not the \u201ccalled party\u201d and, therefore, lacked standing to seek statutory damages under the TCPA. <em>Id. </em>Leyse appealed. However, on February 8, 2011, in response to BoA\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal based on N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 901(b), the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit summarily affirmed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Finally, on December 5, 2011, Leyse filed this action in the District of New Jersey <em>(\u201cLeyse II\u201d), </em>alleging the same claims, and based on the same set of facts, as the two prior actions. The District Court granted BoA\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that Leyse\u2019s claim is barred by collateral estoppel and by any potentially applicable statute of limitations. On April 24, 2013, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s order dismissing this appeal. However, Leyse thereafter moved for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc. For the reasons that follow, we will grant panel rehearing, vacate our previous order affirming the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">A. Collateral Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">The District Court ruled that Leyse\u2019s Complaint in this action is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Dismissal under the doctrine of collateral estoppel is appropriate where: \u201c \u2018(1) the issue sought to be precluded [is] the same as that involved in the prior action, (2) that issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>[was] actually litigated; (3) it [was] determined by a final and valid judgment; and (4) the determination [was] essential to the prior judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n, </em>288 F.3d 519, 525 (3d Cir.2002) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. Hyundai Merch. Marine, </em>63 F.3d 1227, 1231-32 (3d Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On rehearing, we agree with Leyse that collateral estoppel is not applicable here. \u201c[I]t is of the essence of estoppel by judgment that it is certain that the precise fact was determined by the former judgment.\u201d <em>De Sollar v. Hanscome, </em>158 U.S. 216, 221, 15 S.Ct. 816, 39 L.Ed. 956 (1895).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, there is at least some ambiguity as to whether the Second Circuit\u2019s summary affirmance rested on the \u201ccalled-party\u201d ground or on an issue of state law. <em>See Morse v. Republican Party of Va., </em>517 U.S. 186, 203 n. 21, 116 S.Ct. 1186, 134 L.Ed.2d 347 (1996) (\u201cA summary disposition affirms only the judgment of the court below, and no more may be read into our action than was essential to sustain that judgment.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Mandel v. Bradley, </em>432 U.S. 173, 176, 97 S.Ct. 2238, 53 L.Ed.2d 199 (1977) (\u201cBecause a summary affirmance is an affirmance of the judgment only, the rationale of the affirmance may not be gleaned solely from the opinion below.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The Second Circuit\u2019s summary affir-mance in <em>Leyse I </em>does not explicitly state the reason for the affirmance. However, the court cited <em>United States v. Monsalve, </em>388 F.3d 71, 73 (2d Cir.2004), as the reason it \u201cconstrue[d] [BoA\u2019s] motion as seeking summary affirmance.\u201d <em>Leyse v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>No. 10 Civ. 2735 (2d Cir. Feb. 8, 2011). In <em>Monsalve, </em>the court explained that it will \u201cconstrue a motion to dismiss an appeal as a motion for summary affirmance if the appeal presents <em>only frivolous issues.\u201d Monsalve, </em>388 F.3d at 73 (emphasis added). As BoA argued in its motion to dismiss (which the Second Circuit construed as a motion for summary affirmance), binding Second Circuit precedent then held that N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 901(b) bars plaintiffs from maintaining private TCPA class actions in federal court and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See Holster v. Gatco, Inc., </em>618 F.3d 214, 215-16, 218 (2d Cir.2010) (holding that N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 901(b) applies to TCPA actions in New York and prohibits class action suits seeking statutory damages), <em>abrogation recognized by Giovanniello v. ALM Media, LLC, </em>726 F.3d 106 (2d Cir.2013). Since binding precedent then supported BoA\u2019s N.Y. C.P.L.R. argument, it is quite possible that that was the reason the court determined the appeal was \u201cfrivolous\u201d and converted BoA\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal to a motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Moreover, the surrounding circumstances further undermine the likelihood that the Second Circuit relied on the called-party issue. First, the summary af-firmance was issued in response to BoA\u2019s motion to dismiss and the sole ground for that motion was the preclusion of such class actions contained in N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 901(b). Second, Leyse\u2019s petition for cer-tiorari to the Supreme Court focused entirely on the N.Y. C.P.L.R. issue and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>not- discuss the district court\u2019s ruling on the called-party issue. Finally, the N.Y. C.P.L.R. issue was fully briefed before the Second Circuit issued its summary affir-mance, but the called-party issue was not. This procedural background is sufficient by itself to undermine any suggestion that the called-party issue was fully litigated in <em>Leyse I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We realize that we have held that \u201cindependently sufficient alternative findings should be given preclusive effect.\u201d <em>Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc. v. L\u2019Oreal USA, Inc., 458 </em>F.3d 244, 255 (3d Cir.2006). However, that does not resolve the issue here because the Second Circuit did not base its summary affirmance on two independently sufficient alternative grounds. Rather, as we have explained, that court appears to have relied upon restrictions in New York practice requirements that prevent Leyse from basing a class action on the March phone call. Thus, it was not appropriate for the District Court to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel to bar this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">B. Statute of Limitations and <em>American Pipe </em>Tolling</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The District Court also determined that Leyse\u2019s Complaint must be dismissed because, regardless of whether the two-year period under New Jersey law or the four-year period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(a) applies to TCPA claims, Leyse\u2019s action is time-barred because his claim is not subject to tolling under the rule established in <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 </em>U.S. 538, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>American Pipe, </em>the filing of a class action complaint \u201ctolls the running of the statute [of limitations] for all purported members of the class who make timely motions to intervene after the court has found the suit inappropriate for class action status.\u201d 414 U.S. at 553. The Court later extended this holding to all asserted members of the class who file subsequent individual actions, not just intervenors. <em>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co. v. Parker, </em>462 U.S. 345, 350, 103 S.Ct. 2392, 76 L.Ed.2d 628 (1983). In <em>Yang v. Odom, </em>392 F.3d 97 (3d Cir.2004), we held that <em>\u201cAmerican Pipe </em>tolling applies to the filing of a new class action where certification was denied in the prior suit based on the lead plaintiffs\u2019 deficiencies as class representatives, but that <em>American Pipe </em>tolling does not apply where certification was denied based on deficiencies in the purported class itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Leyse\u2019s cause of action accrued on March 11, 2005 (the date of the alleged telephone call) but this suit <em>(Leyse </em>II) was not filed until nearly seven years later, on December 5, 2011. Thus, Leyse must rely on <em>American Pipe </em>tolling to save his claim from being time-barred. The District Court reasoned that \u201ctolling is inapplicable here because the class was never presented for certification in either the Dutriaux or the <em>[Leyse I] </em>Action.\u201d <em>Leyse v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>No. 11-7128, 2012 WL 2952428, at *6 (D.N.J. July 18, 2012). To support this conclusion, the District Court appears to rely on the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that commencement of a class action tolls the statute of limitations as to all asserted class members \u201c\u2018until class certification is denied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5 (quoting <em>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co., </em>462 U.S. at 354, 103 S.Ct. 2392, and citing <em>American Pipe, </em>414 U.S. at 552-54). The District Court also references our decisions holding that <em>American Pipe </em>tolls the statute of limitations for \u201ca later class action where the district court had, in a prior class action, declined to certify a class for reasons unrelated to the appropriateness of the substantive claims for certification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Yang, </em>392 F.3d at 104, and <em>McKowan Lowe &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Jasmine, Ltd., </em>295 F.3d 380, 386, 389 (3d Cir.2002)). The District Court cites to <em>In re Vertrue Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig., </em>712 F.Supp.2d 703, 717 (N.D.Ohio 2010), for the proposition that \u201c[d]ismissal of a claim is not akin to a ruling on class certification ... [and] [w]hether class treatment is appropriate is wholly independent of whether a claim succeeds on the merits.\u201d <em>Leyse II, </em>2012 WL 2952428, at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">However, neither the district court in the <em>Dutriaux </em>nor <em>Leyse I </em>action determined whether class certification is irrelevant for determining the applicability of <em>American Pipe </em>tolling. The Supreme Court has explained that it is \u201cthe <em>commencement </em>of a class action [that] suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class.\u201d <em>American Pipe, </em>414 U.S. at 554, 94 S.Ct. 756 (emphasis added); <em>see also McKowan, </em>295 F.3d at 382 (\u201cUnder the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>American Pipe .. ,,the filing of a class action complaint </em>tolls the statute of limitations for all members of the putative class ....\u201d) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement that class action tolling ends when class certification is denied does not require a formal motion for class certification, or any district court ruling on class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"A-7\">Moreover, the driving rationale for the <em>American Pipe </em>tolling rule would be severely undermined under the District Court\u2019s interpretation. <em>American Pipe </em>is compelled by the fact that class actions are \u201cdesigned to avoid, rather than encourage, unnecessary filing of repetitious papers and motions.\u201d <em>American Pipe, </em>414 U.S. at 550, 94 S.Ct. 756. The <em>American Pipe </em>rule is necessary to \u201cencourage[ ] unnamed plaintiffs to rely on the class action already filed on their behalf.\u201d <em>McKowan, </em>295 F.3d at 384.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we have explained, \u201c[i]f the claims of unnamed plaintiffs were not tolled, claimants would have an incentive to file claims themselves to protect their causes of action, \u2018precisely the multiplicity of activity which Rule 23 was designed to avoid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>American Pipe, </em>414 U.S. at 551, 94 S.Ct. 756).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">This concern is present from the commencement of the class action and remains until the propriety of maintaining the suit as a class action is determined.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has recently explained, \u201cit does not matter, under federal law, whether the first suit\u2019s status as a would-be class action ends by choice of the plaintiff (who may abandon the quest to represent a class or ... bow out altogether) or by choice of the judge.\u201d <em>Sawyer v. Atlas Heating &amp; Sheet Metal Works, Inc., </em>642 F.3d 560, 563 (7th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>2011). \u201cThe [Supreme] Court\u2019s goal of enabling members of a putative class to rely on a pending action to protect their interests can be achieved only if the way in which the first suit ends\u2014denial of class certification by the judge, abandonment by the plaintiff, or any other fashion\u2014is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">In the present case, the class action complaint in the <em>Dutriaux </em>action was filed on April 12, 2005. Because Leyse was a putative member of that alleged class, the statute of limitations on his claim was tolled from that date until the case was administratively closed on December 1, 2008. As we have just explained, the fact that the <em>Dutriaux </em>action\u2019s status as a would-be class action was terminated by administrative closure rather than denial of class certification is irrelevant to the issue of tolling under <em>American Pipe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We agree with the District Court, however, that the principles underlying <em>American Pipe </em>and its progeny do not allow Leyse to benefit from tolling based on the <em>Leyse I </em>action. As we explained, <em>American Pipe </em>was intended to prevent repetitious filings and to protect unnamed plaintiffs. This concern is not relevant with respect to the named plaintiff in the prior class action. Thus, we agree that the Supreme Court did not intend for <em>American Pipe </em>tolling to protect individuals like Leyse, who initiated the prior class action and was a named plaintiff in that prior suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">BoA also argues that Leyse cannot take advantage of any tolling from the <em>Du-triaux </em>action because he lacked standing as a called-party under the TCPA and was therefore not a member of the putative class in that case. This position is difficult to square with the fact that Leyse is a member of the putative class as alleged in the <em>Dutriaux </em>complaint, the district court in <em>Dutriaux </em>had not limited the class to exclude him, and, as explained above, the district court\u2019s holding in <em>Leyse I </em>that Leyse was not a called-party is not entitled to preclusive effect here, much less in <em>Du-triaux. </em>In any case, we need not address this argument in the context of tolling. On remand, if the District Court determines that Leyse lacks standing as a called-party, it would have to dismiss Leyse\u2019s complaint on that basis, independent of any implications for the applicability of <em>Amen-can Pipe </em>tolling. If the court determines that Leyse does have standing as a called-party, that determination would defeat BoA\u2019s argument that Leyse cannot benefit from tolling based on the <em>Dutriaux </em>action because he lacks standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court erred in holding that <em>American Pipe </em>tolling does not apply to Leyse\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">For the reasons set forth above, we will vacate the Order of the District Court dismissing Leyse\u2019s Complaint and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332(d)(2)(A). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s application of defensive collateral estoppel, <em>Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc. v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., </em>458 F.3d 244, 248 (3d Cir.2006), and statutes of limitations, <em>Nelson v.

Subject to exceptions not applicable here, the TCPA prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>the use of \"any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(B).

Because tolling is triggered only by timely service of the class action complaint on defendants by the named plaintiff, the tolling rule does not undermine the twin functions of statutes of limitations\u2014providing timely notice and avoiding stale claims. <em>See id. </em>at 554-55. However, although the lack of conflict between <em>American Pipe </em>and the functions of statutes of limitations supported the adoption of the class action tolling rule, the driving objective for the <em>American Pipe </em>rule is to prevent repetitious filings by protecting unnamed plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\">. We do not suggest, however, that tolling under <em>American Pipe </em>may extend beyond the initial denial of class certification by the district court. <em>See Yang, </em>392 F.3d at 102 (concluding that \"a final adverse determination of class claims\u201d occurred when the district court \"denied class certification with prejudice ... and the applicable tolling period ended that day.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">.
