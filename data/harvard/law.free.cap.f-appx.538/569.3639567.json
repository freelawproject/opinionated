He now petitions this court for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal from the decision of the IJ denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. He contends that his notice to appear did not comply with statutory notice requirements because it informed him that if he failed to appear at his hearing he \u201cmay\u201d be ordered removed despite that the relevant statute provides that an alien who fails to appear \u201cshall\u201d be ordered removed. Because the notice was inadequate, he reasons, he should not have been ordered removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Montes-Sanchez\u2019s notice to appear informed him that if he failed to attend his hearing, \u201ca removal order may be made by the [IJ] in [his] absence.\u201d We have rejected an alien\u2019s argument that a notice to appear containing this language did not properly advise him of the consequences of failing to appear. <em>See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 359 (5th Cir.2009). In any event, Montes-Sanchez has not put forward compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statute was incorrect. <em>See Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, </em>666 F.3d 948, 952 (5th Cir.2012). The notice to appear must inform the alien of, as relevant here, the consequences of failing to appear at the hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(G). If an alien is served with notice but fails to appear and \u201cif the [Government] establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable,\u201d then he \u201cshall be ordered removed in absentia.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). It was accurate for the notice to appear to inform Montes-San-chez that if he failed to appear, he \u201cmay\u201d be removed because failure to appear, by itself, was not sufficient to require removal\u2014the Government had to first establish that Montes-Sanchez was provided with notice and was removable. <em>See id.; United States v. Ramirez-Carcamo, </em>559 F.3d 384, 385 n. 1 (5th Cir.2009). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Montes-Sanchez\u2019s appeal. <em>See Rodriguez-Manzano, </em>666 F.3d at 952. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
