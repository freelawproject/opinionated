The magistrate judge, presiding with Stroble\u2019s consent, certified that any appeal would not be taken in good faith. By moving in this court for IFP status, Stroble is challenging that certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Stroble contends that he stated a cognizable First Amendment claim by alleging that prison officials improperly applied prison policy regarding the prohibition of sexually explicit materials and that he was consequently denied access to images that were permissible. A prison may impose regulations and policies that impinge on a prisoner\u2019s First Amendment rights if they are reasonably related to a legitimate pe-nological interest. <em>Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 820-21, 825-26 (5th Cir.1993). To further the legitimate interest in preventing deviate, criminal sexual behavior in the prison population, prison officials may limit prisoners\u2019 access to sexually explicit materials even if they are not obscene. <em>Thompson v. Patteson, </em>985 F.2d 202, 205-06 (5th Cir.1993). Though Stro-ble complains about prison officials\u2019 interpretation of the policy regarding sexually explicit images, prison rules \u201cnecessarily confer a certain degree of discretion on prison authorities\u201d to determine what constitutes impermissible sexually explicit material. <em>Id. </em>at 207. Moreover, even if the officials did not follow prison policy, this does not, in itself, amount to a constitutional violation. <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 681 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, this claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">To the extent that Stroble raised an equal protection claim, it also fails. Stro-ble has not alleged that prison officials withheld images based on an improper motive such as Stroble\u2019s race or religion; any particular instances of inconsistent outcomes alone do not provide a basis for relief. <em>Thompson, </em>985 F.2d at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Finally, Stroble alleged that prison officials denied him due process because the same officials that interpreted the prison policy also decided his appeal during the grievance process, but this claim is equally meritless. The purpose of due process is \u201cprotect a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement.\u201d <em>McFaul v. Valenzuela, </em>684 F.3d 564, 579 (5th Cir.2012). Stroble\u2019s allegation that the appeal process was unfair is insufficient to assert a due process violation because it identifies no substantive interest at stake and a prisoner has no constitutionally protected interest in having grievances resolved in a particular manner. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373-74 (5th Cir.2005). Moreover, as we have already explained, Stroble has not adequately alleged that the defendants violated any constitutionally protected interest that could from the basis of a due process claim. <em>See McFaul, </em>684 F.3d at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">Stroble\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2. The dismissal of Stroble\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of his appeal both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Stroble previously accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>mulated at least two strikes and has now, therefore, accumulated more than three strikes. <em>See Stroble v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, Institutional Div., </em>No. 12-11055, 2013 WL 1150062, at *2 (5th Cir. Mar. 21, 2013). Accordingly, he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
