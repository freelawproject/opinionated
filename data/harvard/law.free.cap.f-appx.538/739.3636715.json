Having carefully reviewed the record, we are satisfied that Caw\u2019s failure to establish the date on which PRA made the allegedly prohibited telephone call was fatal to his claim. <em>See Freyermuth v. Credit Bureau Servs., Inc., </em>248 F.3d 767, 770 (8th Cir.2001) (noting that appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing facts in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d) (stating that an action to enforce any liability created by the FDCPA may be brought within one year from the date on which the violation occurs). The evidence was sufficient to establish that there was no violation of the general or specific terms of the FDCPA, and summary judgment was proper. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-28\">. The Honorable Fernando J.
