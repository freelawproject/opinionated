For the reasons that follow, we will (1) reverse the District Court\u2019s April 5, 2012, order granting summary judgment in favor of U.S. Fire and Continental on Kelman\u2019s breach of contract claims, (2) affirm the District Court\u2019s April 5, 2012, order granting summary judgment in favor of U.S. Fire on Kel-man\u2019s bad faith claim, and (3) reverse the District Court\u2019s March 1, 2012, order denying Kelman\u2019s motion to amend its complaint against Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">A. Kelman\u2019s Furnace and the March 15, 2011, Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b204-17\">The glass melting furnace at the Kelman factory typically contained about 220 tons of molten glass stored at temperatures of 2300 to 2800 degrees farenheit. On March 15, 2011, at about 4:15 p.m., the north side of the furnace began to leak. The leak rapidly turned into a catastrophic event, spewing molten glass for several hours. The leak caused severe damage to the furnace and other equipment at the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-18\">At the time of the incident, the furnace had been in operation for about five years of its ten-year lifespan. Prior to March 15, 2011, Kelman had experienced at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>two other leaks in the furnace, although none was as severe. Kelman\u2019s furnace manager, Doug Hilliard, had expressed concerns about the condition of the furnace after leaks in April 2009 and June 2010. In May 2009, Kelman hired a consultant to evaluate the status and stability of the furnace. The consultant recommended several repairs. Kelman performed most of the repairs but declined to undertake some repairs that it claimed were not done in the industry and might cause the furnace to wear out faster. There is evidence in the record that all glass melting furnaces leak occasionally because their design requires gaps to accommodate the large expansions and contractions associated with the high temperature of the molten glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">B. The Insurance Policies</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Kelman purchased two insurance policies to cover risks associated with the furnace: (1) an \u201cAll Risk\u201d policy with U.S. Fire, and (2) an \u201cEquipment Breakdown\u201d policy with Continental. Kelman\u2019s \u201cAll Risk\u201d policy with U.S. Fire provided coverage for any \u201cCovered Causes of Loss,\u201d which coverage was defined as \u201cRisks of Direct Physical Loss unless the loss is ... excluded in Section B.\u201d The policy also contained an additional section titled \u201cAdditional Coverage Extensions,\u201d which provided coverage for, among other things, loss or damage from \u201ccovered water or other liquid, powder or molten material damage loss.\u201d The policy did not state whether \u201closs or damage\u201d in the Additional Coverage Extensions had the same meaning as \u201cCovered Causes of Loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Kelman\u2019s \u201cEquipment Breakdown\u201d policy with Continental provided coverage for any \u201c \u2018Breakdown\u2019 to \u2018Covered Equipment.\u2019 \u201d The policy defined \u201cBreakdown\u201d as a \u201csudden and accidental direct physical loss to \u2018Covered Equipment\u2019 .... \u201d The policy\u2019s definition of \u201cCovered Equipment\u201d included \u201cfurnaces, ovens and kilns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">C. Rejection of Kelman\u2019s Insurance Claims by U.S. Fire and Continental</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">After the March 15, 2011, incident, Kel-man filed claims with both U.S. Fire and Continental. On June 30, 2011, U.S. Fire denied coverage to Kelman based on the policy\u2019s Inherent Vice Exclusion, Wear and Tear Exclusion, and Design Defect Exclusion. US Fire also reserved the right to deny coverage if the loss was not a fortuitous event and noted that the loss might also be excluded under the Maintenance Exclusion or the Mechanical Breakdown Exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">Continental denied Kelman\u2019s claim on June 14, 2011, on the grounds that a \u201cBreakdown\u201d did not occur within the definition of Kelman\u2019s policy. However, a report prepared by Continental during the course of its investigation noted that David Bizzak, an engineer hired by Continental to evaluate the cause of the incident, relayed to a Continental investigator that \u201cbased on the facts as described to him this was definitely an occurrence that was sudden and accidental.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, a Continental subrogation specialist noted in the claim file on April 12, 2011: \u201cReviewed file notes and engineer report. Loss was deemed sudden and accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">On July 6, 2011, U.S. Fire filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to insure Kelman for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>damages and losses suffered in the March 15, 2011, incident. On August 23, 2011, Kelman filed a counterclaim asserting breach of contract and bad faith against U.S. Fire. On October 10, 2011, Kelman filed a Joinder Complaint against Continental asserting a breach of contract claim. On February 21, 2012\u2014eleven days after the close of discovery and nine days before summary judgment motions were due\u2014 Kelman filed a motion to amend its claims against Continental to include a count of bad faith. The District Court denied the motion on March 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Both U.S. Fire and Continental filed summary judgment motions, arguing that Kelman was not entitled to coverage under their respective policies and thus they did not breach their contracts with Kelman. US Fire\u2019s summary judgment motion also requested dismissal of Kelman\u2019s bad faith counterclaim. Kelman filed a cross-motion for summary judgment asserting that both U.S. Fire and Continental were hable under their respective policies. On April 5, 2012, the District Court granted the motions of U.S. Fire and Continental and denied Kelman\u2019s cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">III. Discussion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u201cWe review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard the District Court applied. Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact to be resolved and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Alcoa, Inc. v. United States, </em>509 F.3d 173, 175 (3d Cir.2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Kelman argues on appeal that the District Court erred by (1) granting summary judgment for U.S. Fire and Continental on Kelman\u2019s breach of contract claims, (2) granting summary judgment for U.S. Fire on Kelman\u2019s bad faith claim, and (3) denying Kelman\u2019s motion for leave to amend the third party complaint against Continental to assert a claim of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">A. Breach of Contract Claims Against U.S. Fire and Continental</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">1. Breach of Contract Claim Against U.S. Fire</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">The District Court granted summary judgment for U.S. Fire on the grounds that (1) the loss in question fell under the Inherent Vice Exclusion, and (2) because the loss in question fell under the Inherent Vice Exclusion, it also was not covered under the Additional Coverage Extensions. Kelman argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for U.S. Fire on these grounds. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">a. Inherent Vice Exclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">The Inherent Vice Exclusion in the U.S. Fire policy reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">B. Exclusions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-16\">2. We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-17\">d. (2) Rust, corrosion, decay, deterioration, hidden or latent defect, or any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-18\">The District Court found that the loss in question fell under the Inherent Vice Exclusion because the court identified the leaking of molten glass as the cause of the March 15, 2011, loss. However, the leaking of molten glass is a common and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>natural occurrence in glass melting furnaces. A catastrophic leak is not. The March 15, 2011, loss was not due to the expected occasional leaking of molten glass but to the catastrophic leak of large amounts of molten glass. Thus, the District Court erred in its conclusion that \u201cbecause the loss sustained by Kelman occurred as result of molten glass escaping the furnace, and because Kelman admitted that molten glass was an inherent risk to operating the furnace, the loss falls within U.S. Fire\u2019s inherent risk exclusion.\u201d This conclusion, under which any leak of molten glass would call for application of the Inherent Vice Exclusion, is too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Moreover, a glass furnace\u2019s susceptibility to leaks is not the type of loss causation that should invoke the Inherent Vice Exclusion. Even if the leaking of molten glass caused the loss, under this Court\u2019s precedent, the loss still would not fall under the Inherent Vice Exclusion. In <em>GTE Corp. v. Allendale Mutual Ins. Co., </em>we defined inherent vice as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">... [A] cause of loss ... [that] does not relate to an extraneous cause but to a loss entirely from internal decomposition or some quality which brings about its own injury or destruction.... In other words, the question is whether the insured property ... contain[s] its own seeds of destruction ... [or] was threatened by an outside natural force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">372 F.3d 598, 611 (3d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In that case, we held that the Year 2000(Y2K)-related data recognition problem in GTE Corporation\u2019s computer systems constituted an inherent vice because the systems contained their own \u2018seeds of destruction\u2019\u2014the two-digit date limitation, which precluded the systems from functioning properly on or after January 1, 2000. <em>Id. </em>Here, in contrast, the furnace\u2019s susceptibility to leaks did not preclude it from functioning properly. In fact, it is undisputed that leaks of molten glass from glass melting furnaces are common and natural; with proper maintenance and operation, a glass melting furnace will operate without incident, even with occasional leaks. Therefore, the leaking of molten glass, unlike the GTE computer systems\u2019 two-digit date limitation, is not a \u201cseed of destruction\u201d but part of the furnace\u2019s normal functioning. It is not an inherent vice.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Summary judgment on this ground was inappropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will reverse the order granting summary judgment to U.S. Fire on the breach of contract claim and remand the case to the District Court to grant judgment in favor of Kelman on the Inherent Vice Exclusion and to take further proceedings in regard to the other grounds for judgment asserted by U.S. Fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">b. Additional Coverage Extensions</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">The District Court held that the loss did not fall under the Additional Coverage Extensions because the policy unambiguously established that any loss that falls under an exclusion is not covered under the Additional Coverage Extensions. Because we conclude that the Inherent Vice Exclusion does not apply here, there is at this point no bar to applying the Additional Coverage Extensions. However, we do note that our review convinces us that the District Court may have erred in precluding an excluded loss from being covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the Additional Coverage Extensions. When an insurance policy contains general coverage provisions as well as a special coverage provision contained in an endorsement, it does not necessarily follow that the provisions of the main policy govern the endorsement. An endorsement to a policy may in fact provide coverage that is excluded by the language of the main policy. In this type of situation, we have held that \u201c[i]f there is a conflict between the terms of an endorsement and those in the body of the main policy, then the endorsement prevails, particularly when it favors the insured.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>655 F.2d 521, 524 (3d Cir.1981);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>see also Whole Enchilada, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Co. of Am., </em>581 F.Supp.2d 677, 691 (W.D.Pa.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The endorsement in question here is the Additional Coverage Extensions which provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">F. Additional Coverage Extensions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">2. Water Damage, Other Liquids, Powder or Molten Material Damage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP5\">If loss or damage caused by or resulting from <em>covered water or other liquid, powder or molten material </em>damage loss occurs, we will also pay the cost to tear out and replace any part of the building or structure to repair damage to the system or appliance from which ... the substance escapes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">(emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The District Court reasoned that a \u201ccovered ... molten material damage loss\u201d under the Additional Coverage Extensions must fall within the policy\u2019s definition for \u201cCovered Causes of Loss.\u201d This is not an accurate reading of the policy. In dropping the \u201cwater or other liquid, powder or\u201d language between \u201ccovered\u201d and \u201cmolten material,\u201d the District Court gave an unjustifiably expansive modifying power to the word \u201ccovered.\u201d The more reasonable interpretation is that \u201ccovered\u201d does not modify \u201cmolten material\u201d but modifies only \u201cwater\u201d because \u201ccovered\u201d is next to \u201cwater,\u201d and \u201cor\u201d is used twice, along with a comma, in the phrase to separate the other elements (\u201cor other liquid, powder or molten material\u201d) from \u201cwater.\u201d <em>See </em>Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner, <em>Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts </em>153 (2012) (\u201cWhen syntax involves something other than a parallel series of nouns or verbs, a prepositive or postpositive modifier normally applies only to the nearest reasonable referent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The importance of expressing whether or not \u201cwater\u201d damage is \u201ccovered\u201d can be seen from the fact that only certain types of water damage are covered by the policy. In the \u201cExclusions\u201d Section B.l.g., it is specified that \u201cwater\u201d damage loss caused by flood, surface water, waves, tides, tidal waves, overflow of any body of water, or their spray, mudslide, mudflow, water overflow from a sewer, drain, or sump, etc., is not covered. Because of the extensive range of \u201cnot covered\u201d water losses, it makes sense that the drafter of the Additional Coverage Extensions language wanted to expressly limit recovery for water damage under the Additional Coverage Extensions to \u201ccovered\u201d water damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">In addition, there is no indication that \u201closs\u201d in the Additional Coverage Extensions is the same as \u201closs\u201d as defined in \u201cCovered Causes of Loss.\u201d It is not clear whether the loss in question must fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>within the definition of \u201cCovered Causes of Loss,\u201d as the District Court held, or if <em>any </em>type of loss or damage is sufficient to trigger the Additional Coverage Extensions. Indeed, the fact that the Additional Coverage Extensions simply states \u201closs or damage\u201d rather than \u201cCovered Causes of Loss\u201d suggests that the Additional Coverage Extensions contemplate insurance coverage for a broader category of losses than the defined term of \u201cCovered Causes of Loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">2. Breach of Contract Claim Against Continental</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Kelman also argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for Continental on the breach of contract claim. Because we find that there is an issue of material fact regarding whether the loss was covered under Continental\u2019s \u201cEquipment Breakdown\u201d policy, we hold that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Under Continental\u2019s \u201cEquipment Breakdown\u201d policy, Kelman is entitled to coverage when a breakdown in its equipment occurs. The policy defines \u201cBreakdown\u201d as \u201csudden and accidental direct physical loss to \u2018Covered Equipment.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consistent with other cases applying Pennsylvania law, the District Court interpreted \u201csudden\u201d and \u201caccidental\u201d as meaning, respectively, \u201cabrupt\u201d and \u201cunexpected or unintended.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Cyclops Corp. v. Home Ins. Co., </em>352 F.Supp. 931, 934-37 (W.D.Pa.1973); <em>Lower Paxton Twp. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>383 Pa.Super. 558, 557 A.2d 393, 397-98 (1989). Because the District Court found that Kelman expected leaks to occur, the District Court held that the loss in question was not \u201csudden and accidental\u201d and thus was not covered under Continental\u2019s \u201cEquipment Breakdown\u201d policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The District Court\u2019s reasoning is erroneous. Despite recognizing that the relevant question is whether the nature of the loss, and not its underlying cause, was \u201csudden and accidental,\u201d the District Court based its holding on a finding that Kelman expected the leaks. However, whether or not a leak\u2014allegedly the cause of the loss\u2014was expected is not indicative of whether the loss was \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d Thus, the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the grounds that the loss was expected cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Furthermore, there exist material issues of fact as to whether the loss here was \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d The District Court held that Kelman expected the incident to occur based on the previous leaks that had occurred in the furnace and the furnace manager\u2019s statements expressing concern about the risk of another leak occurring. In so holding, the District Court overlooked two critical points. First, there are factual issues that remain as to exactly what Kelman expected. The furnace manager\u2019s concerns about potential leaks appear to have been about a part of the furnace different from the location of the leak on March 15, 2011. Further, while Kelman admitted that leaks in the furnace would happen, the anticipated severity of those leaks is in dispute. Thus, at the very least, there are factual issues as to what risks of loss and damage Kel-man expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Second, Kelman proffered evidence suggesting that the March 15, 2011, incident was, in fact, \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d Reports from Continental state that \u201cthis was definitely an occurrence that was sudden and accidental.\u201d Continental argues that this evidence is not trustworthy, but, at a minimum, viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Kelman, it is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>cient to show that there is a material issue of fact as to whether the incident was sudden and accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Consequently, we will reverse the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for U.S. Fire on the breach of contract claim and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">B. Kelman\u2019s Bad Faith Claim Against U.S. Fire</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Kelman also argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for U.S. Fire on Kelman\u2019s bad faith claim. We disagree. Under Pennsylvania law, an insured may recover damages against an insurer if the insurer has acted in bad faith. To prevail on a bad faith claim, the insured must prove two elements: \u201c(1) that the insurer did not have a reasonable basis for denying benefits under the policy; and (2) that the insurer knew of or recklessly disregarded its lack of a reasonable basis in denying the claim.\u201d <em>Nw. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Babayan, </em>430 F.3d 121, 137 (3d Cir.2005) (applying Pennsylvania law) (citation omitted). \u201cAlthough the insurer\u2019s conduct need not be fraudulent, mere negligence or bad judgment is not bad faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The insured must prove bad faith by clear and convincing evidence, and \u201cthe insured\u2019s burden in opposing a summary judgment motion brought by the insurer is commensurately high because the court must view the evidence presented in light of the substantive evidentiary burden at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This heightened evidentiary standard requires \u201cevidence so clear, direct, weighty and convincing as to enable a clear conviction, without hesitation, about whether or not the defendants acted in bad faith.\u201d <em>Post v. St. Paul Travelers Ins. Co., </em>691 F.3d 500, 523 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Kelman brings four allegations of bad faith against U.S. Fire: (1) U.S. Fire deliberately ignored facts that supported Kelman\u2019s claim of coverage; (2) U.S. Fire refused to evaluate coverage under the appropriate policy provisions; (3) U.S. Fire refused to reevaluate its position after facts favorable to Kelman\u2019s position emerged; and (4) U.S. Fire\u2019s conduct during the litigation forced Kelman to exhaust its financial resources. The District Court held that Kelman\u2019s success on the first and second allegations of bad faith was contingent on the outcome of the breach of contract claim against U.S. Fire. Consequently, because U.S. Fire prevailed on the contract issue, Kelman\u2019s first two bad faith allegations necessarily failed. As to the third basis, the District Court held that Kelman proffered insufficient evidence to support its claim. Finally, the District Court held that Kelman\u2019s fourth basis was not actionable under Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Notwithstanding our reversal of summary judgment on Kelman\u2019s breach of contract claim, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for U.S. Fire on Kelman\u2019s bad faith claim because Kelman cannot show clear and convincing evidence of bad faith for any of its four allegations of bad faith. Kelman points to U.S. Fire\u2019s invocation of several exclusions when it denied Kelman\u2019s claim\u2014including the \u201cWear and Tear, Corrosion and Deterioration Exclusion,\u201d \u201cFaulty, Inadequate or Defective Maintenance Exclusion,\u201d and \u201cInadequate or Defective Design Exclusion.\u201d Kelman then asserts that several of U.S. Fire\u2019s experts conceded that their study of the furnace and the March 15, 2011, incident suggested that those exclusions did not apply.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Without more, this proffer would not allow a jury to conclude by clear and convincing evidence that U.S. Fire\u2019s denial of the claim was unreasonable or that U.S. Fire knew or recklessly disregarded its lack of a reasonable basis to deny the claim. <em>See, e.g., Post, </em>691 F.3d at 525 (affirming grant of summary judgment to insurer where insured failed to present clear and convincing evidence of bad faith). The fatal defect in Kelman\u2019s claim is that it relies on the absence of evidence of good faith rather than clear and convincing evidence of bad faith. Consequently, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to U.S. Fire on Kelman\u2019s bad faith claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">C. Denial of Motion for Leave to Amend Kelman\u2019s Third Party Complaint Against Continental</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Finally, Kelman argues that the District Court erred in denying its motion for leave to amend its third party complaint against Continental. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that \u201cthe court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a). However, a district court may deny leave to amend a complaint where it is apparent from the record that \u201c(1) the moving party has demonstrated undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motives, (2) the amendment would be futile, or (3) the amendment would prejudice the other party.\u201d <em>Lake v. Arnold, </em>232 F.3d 360, 373 (3d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962)). We review a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Bjorgung v. Whitetail Resort, LP, </em>550 F.3d 263, 266 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Kelman moved for leave to amend its complaint to add a bad faith claim after Continental\u2019s corporate designee\u2019s February 2, 2012, deposition. Kelman asserts that it learned at that time that Continental had, among other things, misrepresented in its April 11, 2011, May 6, 2011, and June 9, 2011, letters that it was investigating Kelman\u2019s claim when in fact it did no investigation into the claim between March 24, 2011 and June 24, 2011. The District Court denied Kelman\u2019s motion on the grounds that (1) Kelman demonstrated undue delay in filing this motion on February 21, 2012 because Kelman received all of the information relevant to Continental\u2019s investigation in December 2011 when Continental produced its entire claim file pursuant Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26; (2) allowing the amendment would prejudice Continental because it would require discovery, which had closed on February 10, 2012, to be re-opened; and (3) the amendment would be likely be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">We hold that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Kelman\u2019s motion for leave to amend. First, Kelman did not demonstrate undue delay in filing the motion on February 21, 2012: although Kelman had previously obtained Continental\u2019s claim file, Kelman did not learn until February 2, 2012, that Continental falsely stated in its April 11, 2011, May 6, 2011, and June 9, 2011, letters that it was investigating Kelman\u2019s claim. Thus, Kelman was not aware of key facts underlying its bad faith claim until weeks before it filed the motion for leave to amend. <em>See Adams v. Gould, Inc., </em>739 F.2d 858, 868 (3d Cir.1984) (\u201cThe question of undue delay ... requires that we focus on the [party\u2019s] motives for not amending their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>complaint to assert this claim earlier....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Second, we are not convinced that allowing the amendment would be substantially prejudicial to Continental: Continental asserts generally that it would need additional discovery but does not identify any specific depositions or evidence that it would need to defend this claim. <em>See Bechtel v. Robinson, </em>886 F.2d 644, 652 (3d Cir.1989) (\u201cThis Court has interpreted these factors to emphasize that prejudice to the non-moving party is the touchstone for denial of the amendment. But the non-moving party must do more than merely claim prejudice.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Third, the District Court, in finding that the amendment would be futile, failed to establish that the complaint as amended would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., </em>114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir.1997) (\u201cIn assessing \u2018futility,\u2019 the district court applies the same standard of legal sufficiency as applies under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Kelman\u2019s motion for leave to amend its complaint against Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the District Court\u2019s April 5, 2012, order granting summary judgment in favor of U.S. Fire on the Inherent Vice Exclusion and remand for further proceedings on the breach of contract claim. We will reverse the District Court\u2019s April 5, 2012, order, granting summary judgment in favor of Continental and remand for further proceedings. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of U.S. Fire on Kelman\u2019s bad faith claim. We will reverse the District Court\u2019s March 1, 2012, order denying Kelman\u2019s motion to amend its complaint against Continental and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">.

US Fire additionally asserted that the loss is excluded under the Wear and Tear, Corrosion and Deterioration Exclusion, Faulty, Inadequate or Defective Maintenance Exclusion, and Inadequate or Defective Design Exclusion and that the loss is not covered because it was not fortuitous. Because the District Court decided the case on the Inherent Vice Exclusion, it did not go on to consider these other Exclusions. It may do so on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b208-9\">.
