Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand, <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005), and review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>id. </em>at 1097. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel where Zheng failed to comply with the requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the alleged ineffectiveness is not plain from the record. <em>See Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir.2004). We lack jurisdiction to review Zheng\u2019s unexhausted claim that the IJ erred in not granting her attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Zheng does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that she did not suffer past persecution. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Zheng did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on her claim that her two United States citizen children violate the family planning policy. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1022 (9th Cir.2006) (petitioner failed to show he would suffer harm rising to the level of persecution). We lack jurisdiction to review any contention about new harm Zheng might face that she did not raise to the BIA. <em>See Barron, </em>358 F.3d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Because Zheng failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, it follows that she has not met the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Finally, substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Zheng failed to establish that it is more likely than not she will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government of China. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b784-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
