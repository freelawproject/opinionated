We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). Because the parties are familiar with the history of the case, we need not recount it here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b776-24\">The bankruptcy court did not err in rejecting Coe\u2019s claim that the default judgment he secured against Fanday was non-dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-25\">There was no clear error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the break-up of Pellu Systems, Inc. was the result of poor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>planning and undercapitalization rather than a malicious intent on the part of Fanday. <em>See Brawders v. Cnty. of Ventura (In re </em>Brawders), 503 F.3d 856, 859 n. 1 (9th Cir.2007) (reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error). Coe presented no facts in support of a finding that Fanday\u2019s decision to halt participation in the business was motivated by a subjective intent to injure him. <em>See Carrillo v. Su (In re </em>Su), 290 F.3d 1140, 1142 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201c[Section] 523(a)(6)\u2019s willful injury requirement is met only when the debtor has a subjective motive to inflict injury or when the debtor believes that injury is substantially certain to result from his own conduct.\u201d). As to Coe\u2019s characterization of the evidence, \u201c[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Coe argument as to that Fanday\u2019s alleged commercialization of the Pellu formula is waived because Coe did not present it to the bankruptcy court. <em>El Paso v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc. (In re Am. W. Airlines, Inc.), </em>217 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The bankruptcy court did not err in rejecting Coe\u2019s claim that Fanday is not entitled to a discharge due to alleged violations of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) and 727(a)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">There was no clear error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that Fanday did not make a false oath at the creditors meeting. Coe produced no evidence supporting the claimed falsehoods. Because the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding that Coe failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Fanday \u201cmade a false oath in connection with the case,\u201d the bankruptcy court properly rejected Coe\u2019s claim that Fanday should be denied a discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A). <em>See Retz v. Samson (In re Retz), </em>606 F.3d 1189, 1197 (9th Cir.2010) (explaining the requirements for denying a debtor a discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Likewise, there was no clear error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that Fanday did not omit a material fact\u2014namely, intellectual property rights in the Pellu formula\u2014 from his bankruptcy schedules. Because the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding that Fanday did not omit material facts from his bankruptcy schedules, it did not err in rejecting Coe\u2019s claim that Fan-day should be denied a discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) or in rejecting Coe\u2019s claim that Fanday violated 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(4)(D) by knowingly and fraudulently withholding documentation relating to his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">Because the bankruptcy court properly rejected Coe\u2019s claims of nondischargeability, the wage garnishment issue is moot\u2014 the previously-garnished wages are in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Fanday\u2019s possession, and Coe is no longer entitled to collect them.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b776-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">. Coe argues that the bankruptcy court did not afford him enough time to address Pellu Systems's poorly developed business model. But the bankruptcy court's management of Coe's questioning was far from an abuse of discretion. <em>See FTC v. Enforma Natural Prods., Inc., </em>362 F.3d 1204, 1212 (9th Cir.2004) (reviewing lower courts' litigation management decisions for abuse of discretion); <em>Gen. Signal Corp. v. MCI Telecomms.
