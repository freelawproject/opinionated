We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition, reverse the Board\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">We review the agency\u2019s legal analysis de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Lopez-Rodriguez v. Mukasey, </em>536 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2008). Where, as here, the Board affirms the IJ, cites to <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872 (BIA 1994), and supplements with its own reasoning, we review both the Board\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Alt v. Holder, </em>637 F.3d 1025, 1028-29 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The exclusionary rule applies in immigration court only to evidence seized in connection with a Fourth Amendment violation that is an \u201cegregious\u201d one in which a government agent deliberately committed the violation or did so by conduct a reasonable officer should have known would violate the Constitution. <em>Lopez-Rodriguez, </em>536 F.3d at 1015-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Before taking an individual into custody, an immigration officer must be able to \u201carticulate objective facts providing a reasonable suspicion that the subject of the seizure was an alien illegally in this country.\u201d <em>Orhorhaghe v. I.N.S., </em>38 F.3d 488, 497 (9th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Benitez-Mendez v. I.N.S., </em>760 F.2d 907, 909 (9th Cir.1983) (internal brackets omitted)); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.8(c)(2)(i) (2013) (requiring immigration officers to have a \u201creason to believe that the person to be arrested ... is an alien illegally in the United States.\u201d). The specific, articulable facts \u201cmust provide a \u2018rational basis for separating out the illegal aliens from American citizens and legal aliens.\u2019 \u201d <em>Orhorhaghe, </em>38 F.3d at 497 (quoting <em>Nicacio v. I.N.S., </em>797 F.2d 700, 705 (9th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">The agency reasoned that <em>Orhorhaghe </em>is distinguishable because Armas was lawfully arrested by the San Francisco Police. However, Petitioner does not complain his <em>initial </em>arrest violated the Fourth Amendment, but rather his <em>federal </em>arrest occurred only because federal officials egregiously violated the Fourth Amendment, and the fruit of that violation should be suppressed. On this record, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">Agent Lawton\u2019s justification for issuing the detainer against Armas falls short of <em>Orhorhaghe\u2019s </em>requirement that immigration officials, prior to making an arrest, make some effort to determine not only an individual\u2019s citizenship, but also whether the individual is lawfully present in the United States. 38 F.3d at 497. Even the agency\u2019s own regulation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.8(c)(2)(i), imposes this duty on immigration officials. At the time of Petitioner\u2019s arrest, these authorities would have put a reasonable officer on notice that Petitioner\u2019s seizure violated the Fourth Amendment, and that is all that is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>quired under our case law to trigger the exclusionary rule in immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">We therefore grant the petition for review and reverse the agency\u2019s denial of Armas\u2019s motion to suppress and terminate. We remand to the agency with instructions to grant the motion to suppress and to terminate removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">PETITION GRANTED. ED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.
