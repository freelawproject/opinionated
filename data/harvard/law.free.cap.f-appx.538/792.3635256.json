We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Gomez-Yanez contends the district court procedurally erred by failing to correctly calculate the applicable Guidelines range and by not stating whether the fast-track departure recommended by the parties was included in the calculation. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Valencia-Barragan, </em>608 F.3d 1103, 1108 (9th Cir.2010), and find none. The record reflects that the court rejected the fast-track departure and properly calculated the Guidelines range without the departure. Further, any failure to reconcile the parties\u2019 calculations of Gomez-Yanez\u2019s criminal history score was harmless because the court used the lower score.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Gomez-Yanez also contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court improperly relied upon his unauthorized employment and made illogical inferences from his past criminal history. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Gomez-Yanez\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The record reflects that Gomez-Yanez\u2019s past employment and his history of driving under the influence were relevant to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, including the need to promote respect for the law, afford adequate deterrence, and protect the public. The within-Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b820-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
