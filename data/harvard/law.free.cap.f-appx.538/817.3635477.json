Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s finding that Petitioner\u2019s asylum application was untimely filed, because he failed to exhaust his arguments regarding the exceptions to the time bar. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, because any harm that occurred had no nexus to a protected ground. <em>See Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 854-56 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Ramos-Lopez v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 855, 858-62 (9th Cir.2009). We lack jurisdiction to consider Petitioner\u2019s argument regarding successful families as a social group because he failed to exhaust that argument. <em>See Barron, </em>358 F.3d at 677-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">Substantial evidence supports the denial of CAT relief, because Petitioner failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returns to Mexico. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b846-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
