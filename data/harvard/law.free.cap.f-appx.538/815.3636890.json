We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir.2003), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that he failed to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 785 (prima facie eligibility is demonstrated by showing a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(B). The immigration judge found Petitioner lacked good moral character in its underlying decision, and he did not challenge that finding either in his initial appeal to the BIA or in his later motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b843-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
