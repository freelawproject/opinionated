R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b780-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-20\">Carlos Figueroa-Macedo, a native and citizen of Argentina, petitions pro se for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissing his appeal from the decision of an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying his applications for cancellation of removal, asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and review for substantial evidence factual determinations. <em>Lopez-Cardona v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 1110, 1111 (9th Cir.2011). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-21\">The BIA correctly concluded that Figueroa-Macedo\u2019s 1996 conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 422, which resulted in a prison sentence of 365 days, constitutes a conviction for an aggravated-felony crime of violence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include a crime of violence (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16) for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year); <em>Rosales-Rosales v. Ashcroft, </em>347 F.3d 714, 717 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[California Penal Code] \u00a7 422 meets the definition of a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 as set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 16(a).\u201d). The validity of Figueroa-Macedo\u2019s 1996 conviction is not properly before us. <em>See Ramirez-Villalpando v. Holder, </em>645 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cA petitioner may not collaterally attack his state court conviction on a petition for review of a BIA decision.\u201d). Moreover, our case law forecloses Figueroa-Macedo\u2019s contentions that the current aggravated-felony definition is impermissibly retroactive. <em>See Alvarez-Barajas v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1050, 1054 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he expanded aggravated felony definition [at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) ] can be applied retroactively....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The BIA also correctly concluded that Figueroa-Macedo\u2019s aggravated-felony conviction renders him statutorily ineligible to seek asylum and cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i) (asylum), 1229b(a)(3) (cancellation of removal). In light of this threshold legal determination, the BIA did not need to consider the merits of Figueroa-Macedo\u2019s asylum application. <em>See Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 538 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Figueroa-Macedo\u2019s application for withholding of removal because evidence of changed country conditions rebutted the presumption that he would face a clear probability of suffering future persecution in Argentina, given that more than 22 years have passed since the underlying events occurred, the Argentine government has changed in the interim, and the country-conditions evidence in the record contains no reports of recent politically motivated persecution. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1230 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Figueroa-Macedo\u2019s application for protection under the CAT because he failed to demonstrate that he would more likely than not suffer torture involving sufficient state action in Argentina. <em>See Lopez-Cardona, </em>662 F.3d at 1114 (affirming a denial of deferral of removal under the CAT in the absence of evidence that feared persecutors were currently seeking to harm the petitioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Figueroa-Macedo waived his allegations of IJ bias by failing to raise the issue in his Opening Brief. <em>See Tijani v. Holder, </em>628 F.3d 1071, 1080 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201c[W]e generally will not take up arguments not raised in an alien\u2019s opening brief before this court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">We lack jurisdiction over Figueroa-Ma-cedo\u2019s challenges to the agency\u2019s determination that he was removable for the commission of two crimes involving moral turpitude, his equitable-estoppel arguments, his request for a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility, and his allegations regarding the IJ\u2019s misconstrual of his testimony, because he failed to exhaust these contentions. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWe lack jurisdiction to review legal claims not presented in an alien\u2019s administrative proceedings before the BIA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">To the extent that Figueroa-Macedo seeks to renew his request for a stay of removal, we deny the request as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">We treat Figueroa-Macedo\u2019s \u201cMotion to Show Cause,\u201d which he filed on January 4, 2013, as a request for leave to supplement his Reply Brief, and we grant the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b780-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
