It was noted that Powell\u2019s conviction was both an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>This, court lacks jurisdiction, except as provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (2006), to review the final order of removal of an alien convicted of certain enumerated crimes, including an aggravated felony or a controlled substance violation. Under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), this court retains jurisdiction \u201cto review factual determinations that trigger the jurisdiction-stripping provision, such as whether [Powell] [i]s an alien and whether []he has been convicted of an aggravated felony\u201d or controlled substance violation. <em>Ramtulla v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 202, 203 (4th Cir.2002). Once we confirm these two factual determinations, then, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D), we can only consider \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Turkson v. Holder, </em>667 F.3d 523, 527 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2006), an alien is removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission. Powell was first admitted to this country in 1984. Under INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (2006), an aggravated felony includes \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance ... including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18)[J\u201d Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2), a drug trafficking crime means any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. Under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, an alien is also removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance offense at any time after admission. Powell\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, for which he received a six year sentence, is clearly an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Thus, we have only jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims and questions of law. Powell claims he is not removable because he recited the military oath when he joined the United States Army and that by taking the oath he became a national of the United States. This claim is without merit, as this court has rejected a similar claim. <em>See Dragenice v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 183, 188 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Powell also contends he is eligible for relief from removal under Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)(1)(B) (2006). Powell did not raise this claim before the immigration judge or the Board. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), \u201c[a] court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right[.]\u201d This court has noted that \u201can alien who has failed to raise claims during an appeal to the [Board] has waived his right to raise those claims before a federal court on appeal of the [Board\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir.1990); <em>see also Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 544 (4th Cir.1999). Moreover, this court has held that it lacks jurisdiction to consider an argument not made before the Board. <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004). Because Powell did not apply for \u00a7 212(h) relief, we do not have jurisdiction to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Because Powell does not raise a color-able constitutional claim or a question of law, we deny the petition for review. We grant Powell\u2019s motion for in forma pauper-is status. We deny his second motion to stay and his motion to reconsider the denial of his first motion to stay. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
