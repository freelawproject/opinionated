We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and now reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-24\">Casillas argues that the district court should have suppressed his post-arrest statements because the interrogating ICE agents continued questioning him after he unambiguously invoked his right to remain silent multiple times; the agents failed to .adequately advise him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights; and his confession was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-25\">Without reaching any of the claimed <em>Miranda </em>violations, we conclude that Casil-las\u2019s confession was not voluntary under our clear precedent. <em>Brown v. Horell, </em>644 F.3d 969, 979 (9th Cir.2011). Right after Casillas signed the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form, Officer David Sanchez told him: \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t want to cooperate, you don\u2019t want to talk, you don\u2019t want\u2014no, well, they\u2019re going to say, \u2018This man doesn\u2019t have\u2014is not sorry about anything. Throw the\u2014the\u2014the\u2014the book at him.\u2019 Right?\u201d We have repeatedly found that a threat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>harsher treatment renders any subsequent confession involuntary. <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>34 F.3d 886, 890-92 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Collazo v. Estelle, </em>940 F.2d 411, 416-22 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc); <em>United States v. Tingle, </em>658 F.2d 1332, 1335-37 (9th Cir.1981). In <em>Harrison, </em>we held a confession was involuntary where an agent had informed the suspect that she might be facing up to 20 years in prison and threatened that he would inform the judge that she refused to cooperate. 34 F.3d at 890. We stated that \u201cthere are <em>no </em>circumstances in which law enforcement officers may suggest that a suspect\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent may result in harsher treatment by a court or prosecutor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Casillas\u2019s statement was an integral part of the government\u2019s case. Its use cannot be deemed harmless, and the government does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b779-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
