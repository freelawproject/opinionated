Rashid argues that the district court erred in several respects when determining his sentence. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">First, Rashid argues that the district court erred in determining drug quantity and in imposing enhancements for possession of a firearm and a leadership role in the offense. Rashid contends that the evidence supporting the district court\u2019s findings of fact did not bear the requisite indicia of reliability because the evidence was comprised primarily of hearsay statements from cooperating witnesses, each of whom Rashid claims had an incentive to exaggerate the extent of his criminal conduct. We conclude, however, that Rash-id\u2019s blanket assertion fails to show an abuse of discretion or clear error. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>609 F.3d 609, 612 (4th Cir.2010) (when assessing a challenge to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, factual findings are reviewed for clear error); <em>United States v. Rhynes, </em>206 F.3d 349, 383 (4th Cir.1999) (district court\u2019s determination that evidence is reliable enough to be relied on at sentencing is reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">A district court must find facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence and may accomplish this task by referencing a wide variety of informational sources. <em>Perez, </em>609 F.3d at 614; <em>see United States v. Tucker, </em>40.4 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972) (during sentencing, \u201ca judge may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider, or the source from which it may come\u201d). The sentencing court\u2019s inquiry is not subject to the rules of evidence and, instead, is constrained only by the Guidelines and due process, which both require that evidence considered at sentencing exhibit a \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to support its accuracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>438 F.3d 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 6A1.3, cmt. (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">In applying this standard, we have authorized district courts to consider uncorroborated hearsay when making factual findings at sentencing, appropriately reliable. Although such evidence so long as the hearsay evidence is <em>See, e.g., Perez, </em>609 F.3d at 618 n. 4. must go beyond wholly unsupported allegations, the evidence must only bear \u201csome minimal indicia of reliability\u201d to satisfy due process. <em>Rhynes, </em>206 F.3d at 383. Accordingly, contrary to Rashid\u2019s suggestion, the mere fact that information originated from an individual who may have had a motive to lie or embellish the truth does not automatically render that information uniquely suspect or otherwise incompetent for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990) (defendants have an \u201caffirmative duty to make a showing that the information in the presentence report is unreliable, and articulate the reasons why the facts contained therein are untrue or inaccurate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">During Rashid\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court appropriately ensured that the information on which the court ultimately relied was sufficiently dependable and accurate. Rashid has produced no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>authority suggesting that it was error for the district court to accomplish this task through the testimony of a law enforcement officer who was extensively involved in investigating Rashid and his coconspir-ators. <em>See United States v. Pratt, </em>553 F.3d 1165, 1170-71 (8th Cir.2009) (at sentencing, district court did not err in relying on hearsay statements of defendant\u2019s coconspirators as related through law enforcement officer where such statements were generally consistent with each other and other evidence). Rashid offered no evidence to contradict the information contained in his presentence report or otherwise support his contention that the information was unreliable. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s reliability determinations and findings of fact when sentencing Rashid are not tainted by an abuse of discretion or error, clear or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Nor do we find error in the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Rashid a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. As the district court explained, Rashid\u2019s extensive objections to the presentence report amounted to a denial of a majority of the conduct Rashid admitted in connection with his guilty plea. Accordingly, Rashid\u2019s claim that the district court penalized him for making good-faith objections to his presentence report rings hollow. <em>See United States v. McKenzie-Gude, </em>671 F.3d 452, 463 (4th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Because we also find that Rashid\u2019s below Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable, we affirm Rashid\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Susi, </em>674 F.3d 278, 289 (4th Cir.2012). We deny Rashid\u2019s pro se motions to supplement his counsel\u2019s reply brief and for the preparation of a transcript at the Government\u2019s expense. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
