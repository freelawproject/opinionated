Daley, Jr. appeals from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>as malicious under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and denial of his motion for reconsideration. Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Daley was a defendant in a criminal action in the District of Delaware. <em>See United States v. Richards, </em>D. Del.Crim. No. l:91-cr-00073. In January 2013, he filed a complaint against the defendants, alleging that they violated various court rules and obstructed justice during his criminal proceedings. He sought the issuance of subpoenas for the defendants to produce any records presented to the grand jury for \u201cindictment and the pretrial, hearing detention or arraignment, risk of flight, bail hearing.\u201d He also asked the District Court to initiate a criminal investigation into the defendants\u2019 alleged behavior. The District Court dismissed his complaint as malicious pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), nothing that it duplicated many of Daley\u2019s previous allegations in <em>Daley v. Court Reporter Records, </em>D. Del. Civ. No. l:10-cv-00313 and <em>Daley v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>D. Del. Civ. No. 1:09-cv-00218. Daley then filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">We first address the scope of our jurisdiction. Daley asserts that he seeks to appeal the denial of his motion for reconsideration; however, his notice of appeal also appears to refer to the District Court\u2019s underlying dismissal of his complaint. Here, the District Court\u2019s Memorandum Order, entered on May 7, 2013, did not satisfy Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a) (the \u201cSeparate Judgment Rule\u201d), which requires every judgment, except for those falling under specific exceptions that do not apply here, to be set forth in a separate document. To comply with Rule 58, an order must (1) be self-contained and separate from the opinion; (2) note the relief granted; and (3) omit or substantially omit the district court\u2019s reasons for disposing of the claims. <em>LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass\u2019n, </em>503 F.3d 217, 224 (3d Cir.2007). Here, the District Court\u2019s Memorandum Order contained its reasoning for dismissing Daley\u2019s complaint and therefore did not comply with Rule 58. Accordingly, it was considered entered on October 4, 2013, 150 days after its appearance on the civil docket. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c)(2). During this time, Daley filed his motion for reconsideration, and the District Court denied it. He filed his notice of appeal on August 8, 2013, well before October 4th. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Accordingly, it is timely as to both the dismissal of his complaint and the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">The District Court\u2019s dismissal of Daley\u2019s complaint as malicious under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) presents no substantial question for our consideration. \u201cA court that considers whether an action is malicious must, in accordance with the definition of the term \u2018malicious,\u2019 engage in a subjective inquiry into the litigant\u2019s motivations at the time of the filing of the lawsuit to determine whether the action is an attempt to vex, injure or harass the defendant.\u201d <em>Deutsch v. United States, 67 </em>F.3d 1080, 1086 (3d Cir.1995). Here, Da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ley\u2019s complaint was an attempt to harass the defendants, including the United States Attorney\u2019s Office that prosecuted him, regarding criminal proceedings that terminated over two decades ago. <em>See Tapia-Ortiz v. Winter, </em>185 F.3d 8, 11 (2d Cir.1999). Daley\u2019s complaint is also malicious as it repeats claims that he unsuccessfully previously litigated twice before in the District Court. <em>See Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 995 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Crisafi v. Holland, </em>655 F.2d 1305, 1309 (D.C.Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Finally, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Daley\u2019s motion for reconsideration, as it did not identify any of the grounds required for reconsideration. <em>Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>591 F.3d 666, 669 (3d Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Daley\u2019s complaint as malicious pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and denial of his motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">.
