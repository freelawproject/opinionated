We conclude that Nance is not entitled to mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">Mandamus relief is a drastic remedy and should be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>United States v. Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d 509, 516-17 (4th Cir.2003). Further, mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">The relief sought by Nance is not available by way of mandamus. Accordingly, although we grant Nance leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition for writ of mandamus. Nance\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and to amend the mandamus petition are denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
