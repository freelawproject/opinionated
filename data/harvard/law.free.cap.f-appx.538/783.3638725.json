We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim, and for an abuse of discretion the denial of leave to amend. <em>Wood v. City of San Diego, </em>678 F.3d 1075, 1080 (9th Cir.2012). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-23\">The district court properly dismissed Zochlinski\u2019s action because Zochlinski failed to allege sufficient facts to state one or more element of each claim against any defendant. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1986; <em>Thornton v. City of St. Helens, </em>425 F.3d 1158, 1166-67 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Cir.2005) (per curiam) (setting forth elements of equal protection claim); <em>Franklin v. Fox, </em>312 F.3d 423, 441 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth \u00a7 1983 conspiracy claim); <em>Thompson v. Davis, </em>295 F.3d 890, 895 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth claim under Americans with Disabilities Act) (per curiam); <em>see also Hebbe v. Pliler, </em>627 F.3d 338, 341-42 (9th Cir.2010) (though pro se pleadings are to be liberally construed, a plaintiff must nonetheless present factual allegations sufficient to state a plausible claim for relief); <em>Cholla Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that courts are not required to accept as true conclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The district court properly declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Zochlinski\u2019s state law claims after dismissing his federal claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Acri v. Varian Assocs., Inc., </em>114 F.3d 999, 1000 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc) (district court has discretion to keep, or decline to keep, state law claims under conditions set forth in \u00a7 1367(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Zochlinski leave to amend because amendment would have been futile. <em>See AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Dialysist West, Inc., </em>465 F.3d 946, 951 (9th Cir.2006) (district court need not grant leave to amend where amendment would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Zochlinski\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See Palmer v. Valdez, </em>560 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.2009) (setting forth standard of review and \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement for appointment of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Zochlinski\u2019s contentions regarding the district court\u2019s alleged failure to understand his allegations, to sua sponte remand his state law claims, and to consider a late-filed proposed second amended complaint are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Zochlinski\u2019s motion for oral argument, filed on August 22, 2011, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b811-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
