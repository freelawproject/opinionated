Ford Motor Co., </em>676 F.3d 318, 323 (3d Cir.2012). Summary judgment is only appropriate when there is no issue in dispute regarding any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>A grant of summary judgment is reviewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See id. </em>This means that all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the non-movant\u2019s favor. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-19\">Seagnelli and Hamill contend that the District Court erred because (A) there were genuine issues of fact concerning the existence of an implied or oral contract, (B) since there may have been a contract, their good faith and fair dealing claim should not have been dismissed, and (C) the Court decided genuine issues of fact and overlooked caselaw in dismissing their promissory estoppel claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-20\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-21\">Under New Jersey law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[a] contract arises from offer and acceptance, and must be sufficiently definite that the performance to be rendered by each party can be ascertained with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Baer v. Chase, </em>392 F.3d 609, 618-19 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Weichert Co. Realtors v. Ryan, </em>128 N.J. 427, 435, 608 A.2d 280 (1992)). A contract may be: (1) express, including oral or written, (2) implied-in-fact, and (3) implied-in-law. <em>See Wanaque Borough Sewerage Authority v. Township of West Milford, </em>144 N.J. 564, 574, 677 A.2d 747 (1996) (internal quotation omitted). A contract is \u201cexpress if the agreement is manifested in written or spoken words, and implied-in-fact if the agreement is manifested by conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, \u201c \u2018[cjontract implied-in-law\u2019 is a somewhat disfavored synonym for \u2018quasi-contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the so-called \u201cTroika\u201d had no enforceable contract, express or implied, because of insufficient certainty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the material terms of an alleged agreement. <em>See Morton v. 4 Orchard Land Trust, </em>180 N.J. 118, 849 A.2d 164, 170 (2004). The parties never agreed on a specific percentage of sale proceeds to be given to the Troika, nor when and how proceeds would be provided. <em>See Heim v. Shore, </em>56 N.J.Super. 62, 151 A.2d 556, 562 (N.J.App.Div.1959) (alleged agreement was too indefinite to constitute a contract because \u201cstill open for negotiation were the terms of payment, including the principal amount of the mortgage, the due date, the interest rate, and the usual provisions with respect to default in interest and taxes.\u201d). Rather than showing the existence of a contract, the draft agreements, oral com\u2022munications, and other conduct indicate that the Troika engaged in ongoing negotiations with Schiavone. Furthermore, the negotiations concerned forming an employment agreement with SCC, not Schiavone. Accordingly, the claim for breach of an implied or oral contract fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Under New Jersey law, every contract has an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>See Wilson, et al. v. Amerada Hess Corp., et al., </em>168 N.J. 236, 773 A.2d 1121, 1126-27 (2001) (internal quotation omitted). As explained by the District Court, Scagnelli and Hamill\u2019s claim under this theory fails because there was no contract from which an implied covenant could arise. <em>See Noye v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., </em>238 N.J.Super. 430, 570 A.2d 12 (N.J.App.Div.1990) (\u201cIn the absence of a contract, there can be no breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">\u201cPromissory estoppel is made up of four elements: (1) a clear and definite promise; (2) made with the expectations that the promisee will rely on it; (3) reasonable reliance; and (4) definite and substantial detriment.\u201d <em>Toll Bros., Inc., et al. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, et al., </em>194 N.J. 223, 944 A.2d 1, 19 (2008). \u201cUnder New Jersey law, the sine qua non of a promissory estoppel claim is a clear and definite promise.\u201d <em>Ross v. Celtron Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>494 F.Supp.2d 288, 296 (D.N.J.2007). As Judge Cooper clearly explained in her carefully crafted and thorough opinion, Scagnelli and Hamill\u2019s promissory estoppel claim fails because Schiavone\u2019s promise to \u201cdo something\u201d or \u201ctake care of\u2019 the Troika was vague in the extreme. <em>See Del Sontro v. Cendant Corp., </em>223 F.Supp.2d 563, 574 (D.N.J.2002) (\u201cIndefinite promises or promises subject to change by the promisor are not \u2018clear and definite\u2019 and cannot give rise to a claim of promissory estoppel.\u201d); <em>Automated Salvage Transport, Inc., etc., et al. v. NV Koninklijke KNP BT, et al., </em>106 F.Supp.2d 606, 622 (D.N.J.1999) (\u201cPlaintiffs point to many alleged misrepresentations made by [defendant]. They fail, however, to single out a <em>concrete </em>promise.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Accordingly, we will affirm the order granting summary judgment in favor of Schiavone.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-14\">. Carl Cosenzo was also a plaintiff but he did not appeal the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-15\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b221-22\">. The parties do no dispute that New Jersey law governs all claims in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
