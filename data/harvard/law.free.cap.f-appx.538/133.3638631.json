For the following reasons, we will deny the mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">In February 2013, Alford filed a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The respondents filed an answer in March 2013, and Alford filed his traverse in April 2013. Alford then filed a motion for summary judgment, which the District Court dismissed in May 2013. In July 2013, Alford\u2019s petition was transferred to Magistrate Judge Mehalchick for initial consideration. Since then, Alford has filed a motion to expedite and a motion for an evidentiary hearing. Those motions remain pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">A writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy available only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). A petitioner seeking mandamus relief must demonstrate that \u201c(1) no other adequate means exist to attain the relief he desires, (2) the party\u2019s right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable, and (3) the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry, </em>558 U.S. 183, 190, 130 S.Ct. 705, 175 L.Ed.2d 657 (2010) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted). While the \u2022 management of the docket is within a district court\u2019s sound discretion, <em>see In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982), mandamus may be warranted where a district court\u2019s delay is tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction, <em>see Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Although Alford\u2019s petition appears ripe for consideration, we are not presented with any evidence of extraordinary delay, nor do we have reason to believe that there will be delay going forward, particularly in light of the District Court\u2019s recent adjudication of Alford\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its recent referral of his petition to Magistrate Judge Mehal-chick. In short, because the delay about which Alford complains is not \u201ctantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79, we will deny his petition for a writ of mandamus. We deny Alford\u2019s motion for bail and release, and we deny as moot Alford\u2019s motions asking us to dispose of his mandamus petition and grant him a writ of mandamus or a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
