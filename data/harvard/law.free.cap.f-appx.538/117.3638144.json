City Nov. 9, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have considered both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">For asylum applications, like Jiang\u2019s, governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, \u201c[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d the plausibility of her account, and inconsistencies in her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). We \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make\u201d such a ruling. <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. In this case, the agency reasonably based its adverse credibility determination on Jiang\u2019s demeanor, vague testimony, and lack of responsive replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The IJ stated in her decision that Jiang\u2019s testimony was often non-responsive to the question asked, that Jiang took \u201can inordinately long time\u201d to answer questions, that her demeanor appeared as though she was \u201cdesperately trying to remember\u201d what her testimony was \u201csupposed\u201d to be, and that she answered some questions in a long narrative, as if she was afraid she would otherwise forget the rest of her statement. The transcript of Jiang\u2019s testimony supports the IJ\u2019s findings. Jiang testified in a vague, non-responsive, and verging on incoherent manner regarding her detention by the Chinese police for her practice of Falun Gong, the illness that led her to practice Falun Gong, her protests in front of the Chinese consulate in New York, and when and how she met her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Because the REAL ID Act permits the agency to base a credibility finding on such problems, and as the problems are evident from the transcript throughout the proceedings, a totality of the circumstances supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, based on Jiang\u2019s vague and unresponsive testimony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Furthermore, because the only evidence of a threat to Jiang\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on her claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
