We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Garcia v. Holder, </em>621 F.3d 906, 912 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Mejia-Mora filed a timely motion to reopen with new, previously unavailable, evidence of hardship to his United States citizen daughter to support his application for cancellation of removal. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Mejia-Mora\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that the new evidence of his daughter\u2019s diagnosis with Bell\u2019s palsy was insufficient to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 912-913.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b836-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
