(\u201cEli Lilly\u201d) on the ground that Dagliano\u2019s product liability action was barred by the statute of limitations. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Allianz Ins. Co. v. Lerner, </em>416 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cWe will affirm the judgment only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, reliance upon conclusory statements or mere allegations is insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion. <em>See Gan v. City of New York, </em>996 F.2d 522, 532 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">Dagliano, an incarcerated individual residing in Virginia, alleged that he was prescribed Zyprexa, an anti-psychotic drug manufactured by Eli Lilly, in March 2003, and that Zyprexa caused him to suffer from fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite and abdominal pains. In December 2003, Dag-liano ceased taking Zyprexa because he believed that it caused his stomach pain, and in May 2007, Dagliano filed suit in this case. The district court granted Eli Lilly\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>motion for summary judgment, finding that Virginia\u2019s two-year statute of limitations on product liability suits applied and that the statute of limitations had run between Dagliano\u2019s alleged injury in 2003 and his filing of the instant suit in 2007. The district court also found that Dagliano had not put forth any evidence supporting his claim that the statute of limitations should have been tolled by his alleged disability or his incarceration or that the statute of limitations should have extended based on Eli Lilly\u2019s alleged fraudulent concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">While we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s February 29, 2012 Memorandum Order and Judgment, we write to clarify one point in the district court\u2019s analysis. The district court found that New York law requires it to perform an \u201cinterest analysis to determine which jurisdiction has the greatest interest in having its law applied to the case.\u201d App. at 280. While this is true in most contexts, the interest analysis does not apply to statutes of limitations. <em>See </em>N.Y. C.P.L.R. 202; <em>Stuart v. Am. Cyanamid Co., </em>158 F.3d 622, 626 (2d Cir.1998). Thus, even though the district court misstated the general rule, its conclusion that Virginia\u2019s two-year statute of limitations applied under New York law was correct, as New York\u2019s so-called \u201cborrowing statute\u201d provides that a suit by a non-resident bringing a cause of action that accrues outside of New York \u201ccannot be commenced after the expiration of the time limited by the laws of either [New York] <em>or </em>the place without the state where the cause of action accrued.\u201d N.Y. C.P.L.R. 202 (emphasis added). In tort cases, \u201ca cause of action accrues at the time and in the place of the injury.\u201d <em>Global Fin. Corp. v. Triarc Corp., </em>93 N.Y.2d 525, 529, 693 N.Y.S.2d 479, 715 N.E.2d 482 (1999). Here, Dagliano\u2019s cause of action accrued in Virginia because he took Zyprexa and suffered his alleged injury there. Because Virginia\u2019s two-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions, see Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-243(A), is shorter than New York\u2019s three-year statute of limitations, see N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214(5). New York\u2019s borrowing statute requires application of Virginia\u2019s two-year statute of limitations, which the district court properly applied in finding Dagliano\u2019s suit time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Additionally, to the extent that Dagliano has put forward on appeal new evidence supporting his claim that the statute of limitations should have been tolled by his alleged disability, that evidence is not properly before this Court and will not be considered. <em>See Int\u2019l Bus. Machines Corp. v. Edelstein, </em>526 F.2d 37, 45 (2d Cir.1975). We have considered all of Dag-liano\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED. Dagliano has moved for a \u201cstipulation of facts.\u201d It is further ORDERED that the motion is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
