We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In the days following Hurricane Katrina, Mitchell, then an officer of the New Orleans Police Department, was patrolling with another officer when Danny Ray Brumfield (Brumfield) made an effort to flag down the police car. During the ensuing confrontation, Mitchell shot and killed Brumfield. The Brumfield family subsequently filed a wrongful-death lawsuit and deposed Mitchell, who made several statements that were contradicted by other evidence, including that he exited the car to check Brumfield\u2019s pulse after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">A grand jury indicted Mitchell on two counts of obstruction of an official proceeding in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(c)(2) and two counts of perjury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. After a jury trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of obstruction and one of perjury, both stemming from Mitchell\u2019s statement that he exited the car. The district court denied Mitchell\u2019s motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">Mitchell first contends that the district court erred under <em>Brady v. Maryland</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>when it denied him a new trial or a continuance after the Government disclosed exculpatory material five days before trial. When the Government makes a late disclosure of <em>Brady </em>material, \u201cthe inquiry is whether the defendant was prejudiced.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no prejudice if the defendant was able \u201cto put [the material] to effective use at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, Mitchell had five days to prepare, used the <em>Brady </em>material during cross-examination, and was acquitted of the counts related to that material. Because Mitchell effectively used the material at trial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he was not prejudiced, and the district court did not err in denying the motion for a new trial. For the same reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mitchell\u2019s motion for a continuance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">Likewise, there is no merit to Mitchell\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find his statement either false or material. Evidence is sufficient if \u201cwhen reviewed in the light most favorable to the government with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in support of a conviction, [it] allows a rational fact finder to find every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to falsity, five Government witnesses agreed that Mitchell did not exit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the car, and the Government offered evidence demonstrating that Mitchell\u2019s own story was inconsistent. As to materiality, the civil complaint requested punitive damages and alleged that Mitchell committed willful misconduct. Thus, the statement was relevant to whether Mitchell acted in bad faith, and it could have influenced a punitive damages award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We reject Mitchell\u2019s argument that his convictions were multiplicitous; they were not, as \u201ceach charge requires proof of an element that the other does not.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, Mitchell has waived any argument that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial because he cites no authority in support of this contention.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
