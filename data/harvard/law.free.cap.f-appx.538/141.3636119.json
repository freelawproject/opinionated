Since filing his mandamus petition, he has moved for expedited and emergency consideration of his mandamus petition and motion to proceed in forma pauperis. For the following reasons, we will deny the mandamus petition, as well as his motions for expedited and emergency consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-22\">Mandamus is a \u201cdrastic remedy\u201d available in extraordinary circumstances only. <em>In re: Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). A petitioner seeking the writ \u201cmust have no other adequate means to obtain the desired relief, and must show that the right to issuance is clear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996), <em>superseded in part on other grounds by </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 24.1(c) (1997). Generally, a court\u2019s management of its docket is discretionary, <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982), and there is no \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to have a district court handle a case in a certain manner, <em>see Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 36, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (per curiam). However, mandamus may be warranted when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>district court\u2019s delay \u201cis tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The delay complained of by Kokinda is not tantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction. Kokinda filed his habeas petition in April 2013, and then filed various amendments, revisions and supplemental pleadings in May, June, and July 2013. In July 2013, he filed a petition for release on bail pending the District Court\u2019s adjudication of his habeas petition. Upon the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\u2019s motion, the Magistrate Judge to whom the case had been transferred extended the Commonwealth\u2019s time to file a response to November 5, 2013. In August 2013, Ko-kinda filed yet another motion to amend his habeas petition, as well as a motion to supplement his petition for release on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Because Kokinda sought mandamus relief less than five months after he filed his habeas petition, and because even less time had passed since he filed a motion for release on bail, the delay \u201cdoes not yet rise to the level of a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(denying a mandamus petition where the district court had not ruled on petitioner\u2019s motion in four months). We are fully confident that the District Court will adjudicate Kokinda\u2019s habeas and bail petitions without undue delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Accordingly, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus. His motions for expedited and emergency consideration are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
