In previously granting a prior Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Cleco, the district court dismissed Culbert\u2019s Title VII claims, state law claims, and ADEA claims, leaving now only the district court\u2019s February 18, 2013 judgment that dismissed with prejudice Culbert\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claims grounded in failure to promote, pay discrimination, racial discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">We have reviewed the respective positions of the parties on appeal as set forth in their briefs and the record on appeal, including the district court\u2019s lengthy and comprehensive Memorandum Ruling on which its grant of Cleco\u2019s second Motion for Summary Judgment is based. Disagreeing with Culbert\u2019s contentions that the district court erred in granting Cleco\u2019s second Motion for Summary Judgment and that the conflicting evidence raises genuine issues of material fact, we con-elude in our de novo review that the district court\u2019s grant of Cleco\u2019s second Motion for Summary Judgment was not reversible error. Accordingly, the aforesaid Judgment of February 18, 2013 dismissing all remaining claims of Culbert against Cleco is</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-24\">. Neither Culbert nor Cleco has requested oral argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
