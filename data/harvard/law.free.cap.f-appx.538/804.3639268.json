We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), <em>Andrews v. Cervantes, 493 </em>F.3d 1047, 1052 (9th Cir.2007), and for an abuse of discretion its denial of leave to proceed in forma pauperis, <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. Doe, </em>920 F.2d 614, 616 (9th Cir.1990). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Parks\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis because at least three of Parks\u2019s prior \u00a7 1983 actions were dismissed on the basis that they were frivolous or failed to state a claim, and Parks did not provide sufficient allegations to show that he was \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d at the time he lodged the complaint. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see also Andrews, </em>493 F.3d at 1055 (an exception to the three-strikes rule exists only where \u201cthe complaint makes a plausible allegation that the prisoner faced \u2018imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d at the time of filing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Parks\u2019s contentions that the district court violated his due process rights by failing to order service on defendants in a timely manner is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b832-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
