June 29, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A087 462 999 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 8, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Because Liu filed his application for relief after May 11, 2005, we apply the credibility standard imposed by the REAL ID Act of 2005 (\u201cREAL ID Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B. 119 Stat 302 (2005). Under that standard, considering the totality of the circumstances, an IJ may base an adverse credibility determination on any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in an asylum applicant\u2019s statements without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Where, as here, \u201cthe BIA agrees with an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and adopts particular parts of the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 166 (2d Cir.2008) (Per curiam). We review adverse credibility determinations under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zheng v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 277, 284 (2d Cir.2009). Here, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on specific inconsistencies, supported by the administrative record, both within Liu\u2019s testimony and between Liu\u2019s testimony and his asylum application. In particular, the agency properly concluded that Liu gave inconsistent testimony regarding whether he disclosed to family planning officials where his wife was hiding at the time he was detained and whether he had any contact with family planning officials after his release from detention. A reasonable fact finder would not be compelled to credit Liu\u2019s explanation for these inconsistencies. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The record also supports the agency\u2019s finding that while Liu testified that his wife had an IUD inserted after her second pregnancy had been aborted, Liu\u2019s written asylum application and his wife\u2019s letter omitted this detail. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 166 n. 3 (\u201c[An] omission in a document submitted to corroborate the applicant\u2019s testimony, like a direct inconsistency ... can serve as a proper basis for an adverse credibility determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Although Liu argues that the discrepancies were too minor to support an adverse credibility determination, \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The IJ\u2019s decision is not without flaw, in that the IJ erred in finding that Liu\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his asylum application with respect to whether family planning officials continued to target Liu following his arrival in the United States, but remand would be futile because \u201cthere is no realistic possibility that, absent the errors, the IJ or BIA would have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Ultimately, because a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude to the contrary, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>534 F.3d at 165-66. The adverse credibility determination is dispositive of Liu\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal, as both claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
