Harrison pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement in which he waived the right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">Harrison argues that the Government breached its plea agreement when the United States Probation Officer applied the career offender enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, thereby, in his view, failing to provide the required notice that it intended to seek an increased mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. He contends that prior to his guilty plea, the Government wrote to his attorney and explained that it would agree not to seek an adjustment based on the career offender enhancement, contingent upon Harrison\u2019s agreement to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-19\">The Government contends that nothing in the plea agreement addressed whether Harrison would receive a career offender enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines. The Government argues that Harrison is confusing a <em>statutory </em>sentence enhancement under \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 851 with the career-offender <em>guideline </em>enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-20\">Although Harrison waived his right to appeal his sentence in his plea agreement, we have held that \u201can alleged breach of a plea agreement may be raised despite a waiver provision.\u201d <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>624 F.3d 241, 244 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>United States v. Keresztury, </em>293 F.3d 750, 755-57 (5th Cir.2002)). As a general rule, whether the Government breached a plea agreement is a question of law subject to de novo review, but in this case our review is limited to plain error because Harrison did not raise the breach issue in the district court. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001). To prevail on plain error review, Harrison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>must show that an error occurred, that the error was clear or obvious, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). In those circumstances, we still must determine whether to exercise discretion to correct the error. <em>United States v. Escalante-Reyes, </em>689 F.3d 415, 425 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In determining whether the Government has breached a plea agreement, we examine whether the Government\u2019s conduct is consistent with the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement. <em>United States v. Pizzolato, </em>655 F.3d 403, 409 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1126, 181 L.Ed.2d 1004 (2012). The defendant has the burden of establishing the facts showing a breach. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Although it is not part of the written plea agreement, the Government agreed in e-mail correspondence with Harrison\u2019s counsel that although \u201cthe government has the option of filing a notice of enhancement pursuant to 21 U.S.C. section 851, in which case the statutory mandatory minimum sentence would be increased from 5 years to 10 years, and the term of supervised release would be increased from 4 to 8 years\u201d the Government would \u201cagree not to file a notice of enhancement if your client pleads promptly, i.e. before the next Ellis deadline.\u201d The correspondence did not mention the career offender enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The record shows that the Government complied with its agreement not to seek a statutory sentence enhancement under \u00a7 851. The Government correctly argues that a statutory sentence enhancement under \u00a7 841(b) and \u00a7 851 is different from a career offender sentence enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Guidelines. Harrison\u2019s sentence was enhanced under \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 841(b), and he therefore was not entitled to notice under \u00a7 851. <em>See United States v. Marshall, </em>910 F.2d 1241, 1245 (5th Cir.1990). Harrison \u201ccould not have reasonably understood the plea agreement\u201d as prohibiting the career offender enhancement. <em>See Pizzolato, </em>655 F.3d at 410. Harrison has not demonstrated plain error in the application of the career offender guideline under his plea agreement. <em>See Reeves, </em>255 F.3d at 210. We therefore do not need to address Harrison\u2019s argument about whether the inclusion of the career-offender enhancement in the Pre-Sentence Report at the direction of the United States Probation Office could qualify as a \u201cGovernment breach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The Government argues that Harrison\u2019s appeal waiver should be enforced and his appeal should be dismissed. Harrison has the right to appeal in order to challenge his appeal waiver on grounds of breach of the plea agreement by the Government. <em>See Roberts, </em>624 F.3d at 244. However, having determined that the Government did not breach the plea agreement, Harrison may not appeal his sentence. <em>See Keresztury, </em>293 F.3d at 756-57 (distinguishing issue of breach of plea agreement from sentencing issue); <em>Pizzolato, </em>655 F.3d at 411-12 (determining that Government did not breach the plea agreement and that the appeal waiver thus applied to the sentencing challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Although Harrison does not clearly delineate a sentencing issue separate from his argument that the Government breached the plea agreement, he does argue that the career offender enhancement was improper and that the district court lacked the authority to enhance his sentence based upon a prior conviction because the Government failed to comply with the notice procedures of \u00a7 851. He asks that his case be remanded to the district court for a new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Because the Government did not breach the plea agreement, the appeal waiver is enforced to preclude consideration of this sentencing issue. However, because Harrison had the right to appeal to challenge the appeal waiver in the plea agreement based on a breach, we do not dismiss the appeal, but we affirm his sentence. <em>See Roberts, </em>624 F.3d at 244; <em>Pizzolato, </em>655 F.3d at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
