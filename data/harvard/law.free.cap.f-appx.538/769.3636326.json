We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Sadewo established changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely asylum application. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5). Accordingly, Sade-wo\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the harm Sadewo suffered in Indonesia does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 975-76 (9th Cir.2009). Further, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that, even under a disfavored group analysis, Sadewo failed to show sufficient individualized risk to establish that it is more likely than not he would be persecuted if removed to Indonesia. <em>See id. </em>at 979; <em>see also Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1066 (\u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of removal will need to adduce a considerably larger quantum of individualized-risk evidence to prevail than would an asylum applicant\u201d). We reject Sadewo\u2019s contention that the BIA applied the disfavored group analysis incorrectly. Accordingly, Sadewo\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
