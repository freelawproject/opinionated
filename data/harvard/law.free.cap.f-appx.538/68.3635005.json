Dec. 29, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A200 729 952 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 10, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>We review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The agency\u2019s decision must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Jiang challenges the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based on his demeanor, inconsistent and implausible testimony, application omissions, and insufficient corroboration. We afford \u201cparticular deference to credibility determinations that are based on [an] adjudicator\u2019s observation of [an] applicant\u2019s demeanor\u201d because \u201cthe IJ\u2019s ability to observe the witness\u2019s demeanor places [the IJ] in the best position to evaluate whether apparent problems in the witness\u2019s testimony suggest a lack of credibility.\u201d <em>Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir.2005). As Jiang does not allege that the demeanor findings were based on a misstatement in the record, <em>cf. Li Zu Guan v. INS, </em>453 F.3d 129, 139-40 (2d Cir.2006), we will defer to the agency\u2019s determination that his testimony was \u201cevasive [and] unresponsive\u201d on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We can be \u201cstill more confident\u201d of the agency\u2019s demeanor finding when it is \u201csupported by specific examples of inconsistent testimony.\u201d <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006). Here, contrary to Jiang\u2019s contention, the agency reasonably relied on his inconsistent testimony about his business license in finding that he was not credible. For instance, his testimony that the license expired in October 2008 was inconsistent with evidence he submitted indicating the expiration date was December 31, 2008, and the agency did not err when it determined that Jiang\u2019s explanation for the inconsistency that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d was implausible, given the importance of the business license to his claim that he was persecuted. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167; <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Jiang complains that these inconsistencies were not \u201ccentral\u201d to his claim of persecution. However, because Jiang\u2019s application is governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may base a determination that the applicant lacked credibility under the totality of the circumstances on the \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant,] ... the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s ... account,\u201d and \u201cthe consistency of [the applicant\u2019s] statements with other evidence of record ... <em>without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (emphasis added); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(C); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">In addition, the agency did not err in finding that Jiang\u2019s omission of an important fact from his application, namely that government officials threatened to shut down his business in retaliation for his complaint on the pretext that his license had expired, undermined his credibility. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167; <em>Xu Duan Dong v. Ashcroft, </em>406 F.3d 110, 111\u2014 12 (2d Cir.2005). Jiang also failed to corroborate his claim before the IJ with reasonably available evidence; for example, he failed to provide any record of a medical examination by a doctor in the United States that would support his claim that he had suffered certain injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Lastly, Jiang contends that the IJ and BIA were required to separately consider the merits of his claim for CAT relief. However, as Jiang fails to allege an independent factual predicate for relief apart from his incredible testimony, and as the only evidence for his CAT claim depended on his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case is dispositive of his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, <em>and </em>CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 157 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] petition for CAT relief may fail because of an adverse credibility ruling rendered in the asylum context where the factual basis for the [applicant\u2019s] CAT claim was the same as that rejected in his asylum petition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We have considered Jiang\u2019s remaining arguments, including his alleged due process violation, and find that they lack merit. <em>See Burger v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 131, 134 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, </em>531 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir.2008). For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. Although Jiang presented certain medical records to the BIA on appeal, the BIA is not permitted to consider new evidence and is not required to remand for further fact-finding if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the new evidence could have been presented at the earlier hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
