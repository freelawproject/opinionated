R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b838-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-26\">Mohyedine Kaskas, a native and citizen of Lebanon, petitions for review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Because there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s decision, we deny the petition. As the parties are familiar with the facts, procedural history, and arguments, we will not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The evidence does not compel the conclusion that the harm suffered by Kaskas constituted past persecution. Kaskas did hot testify as to severe physical harm, nor did he provide any documentation to corroborate his claims of harm rising to the level of past persecution. An asylum applicant\u2019s testimony \u201cmay be sufficient to sustain the applicant\u2019s burden without corroboration, but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant\u2019s testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). As Kaskas\u2019-re-sponses did not satisfy this requirement, the record does not compel this Court to disturb the BIA\u2019s finding of no past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">We do not have jurisdiction to review Kaskas\u2019 claim of economic persecution because he did not exhaust his remedies by raising the issue of economic persecution before the IJ or the BIA, as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Even if we did have jurisdiction, however, Kaskas has not provided evidence that the closure of the bakery more than a year after Kaskas\u2019 departure from Lebanon was a direct result of economic persecution. <em>Cf. Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1075-76 (9th Cir.2004). Without a specific showing of \u201csubstantial economic deprivation that constitutes a threat to life or freedom,\u201d any harm Kaskas may have suffered or may suffer in the future is most likely \u201cmere economic disadvantage.\u201d <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that, while the government\u2019s seizure of petitioner\u2019s father\u2019s business was \u201creprehensible,\u201d it did not threaten petitioner\u2019s life or freedom and did not compel a finding of past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Additionally, even if the harm to Kaskas had risen to the level of persecution, Kas-kas did not show that the harm was on account of a protected ground. Kaskas admitted that he was not a member, affiliate, or financier of a political party, and he failed to establish membership in any particular social group. None of his similarly situated family members who remained in Lebanon had been harmed since his departure. Evidence also suggested that his fears of returning to Lebanon were based on general civil unrest and \u201cchaotic conditions.\u201d <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1179-80 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (\u201cWe have consistently held that a general, undifferentiated claim [of violence] does not render an alien eligible for asylum.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The standard of proof to establish eligibility for withholding of removal is \u201c \u2018a more stringent\u2019 standard of proof than is required for asylum,\u201d and requires the applicant to \u201cestablish a \u2018clear probability that he would be persecuted were he to be deported[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1202-03 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 655 (9th Cir.2000)). \u201c[F]ailure to satisfy the lesser standard of proof required to establish eligibility for asylum necessarily results in a failure to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of [removal] as well.\u201d <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995). As there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s determination that Kaskas did not qualify for asylum, we will not disturb the BIA\u2019s finding that he also does not qualify for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Finally, the record does not compel this Court to disturb the BIA\u2019s holding that Kaskas failed to show he would more likely than not suffer an \u201cextreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment, by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity,\u201d if removed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b838-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
