He argues that his sentence is plainly erroneous because the district court did not offer adequate reasons for its choice of sentence and effectively denied him credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, because Fuentes-Gonzalez failed to raise any objection to his sentence, we review his challenges to it for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To meet this standard, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If this showing is made, we have the discretion to correct the error, but will do so only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">First, Fuentes-Gonzalez argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not give adequate reasons to explain why it varied to the extent it did. Our review of the record belies this assertion and shows that the district court chose the sentence it found most appropriate in light of Fuentes-Gonzalez\u2019s prior offenses, the danger he posed to society, and the need for deterrence. The district court\u2019s explanation for the sentence imposed was proper because it was \u201cfact-specific and consistent with the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 3553(a).\u201d <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Fuentes-Gonzalez\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Kirkpatrick, </em>589 F.3d 414, 415-16 (7th Cir.2009), is misplaced because that case is materially distinguishable. Unlike <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing sentence were not conelusional and do not indicate that the sentence was arbitrarily chosen. We need not address Fuentes-Gonzalez\u2019s challenge to his sentence as the result of an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 because the sentence may be affirmed on the alternate basis that it was an upward variance warranted by \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656-59 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Likewise unavailing is Fuentes-Gonzalez\u2019s argument that his sentence is substantively erroneous because the district court\u2019s decision to impose the statutory maximum sentence effectively denied him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. District courts may upwardly depart when sentencing defendants who have received acceptance of responsibility adjustments. <em>See United States v. ZelayaRosales, </em>707 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433-34, 443 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 346-48 (5th Cir.2006). Fuentes-Gonzalez has shown no error, plain or otherwise, in connection with his sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
