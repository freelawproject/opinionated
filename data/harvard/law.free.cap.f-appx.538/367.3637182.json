Dingess under the Black Lung Benefits Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901-945 (West 2007 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2013). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-20\">We review the Board\u2019s and the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and \u201cindependently] review ... the record to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 207-08 (4th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla\u2019; it is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). In conducting this review, we confine ourselves to the grounds on which the Board based its decision. <em>Daniels Co. v. Mitchell, </em>479 F.3d 321, 329 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-21\">Subject to the substantial evidence requirement, we defer to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations and \u201cevaluation of the proper weight to accord conflicting medical opinions.\u201d <em>Harman Mining Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>678 F.3d 305, 310 (4th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ALJ is not bound to accept any medical expert opinion but \u201cmust evaluate the evidence, weigh it, and draw his own conclusions,\u201d giving consideration to \u201cthe qualifications of the experts, the opinions\u2019 reasoning, their reliance on objectively determinable symptoms and established science, their detail of analysis, and their freedom from irrelevant distractions and prejudices.\u201d <em>Underwood v. Elkay Mining, Inc., </em>105 F.3d 946, 949, 951 (4th Cir.1997), <em>superseded on other grounds as stated in Elm Grove Coal Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>480 F.3d 278, 287 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-22\">Because Dingess was employed in underground coal mines for fifteen or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>years, had at least one chest x-ray interpreted as negative for complicated pneumoconiosis, and demonstrated that he has a totally disabling pulmonary impairment, he is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that he is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(c)(4); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(a) (2013). The burden then shifted to Employer to affirmatively \u201crebut such presumption only by establishing that (A) such miner does not ... have pneumoconiosis, or that (B) his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of, or in connection with, employment in a coal mine.\u201d 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(c)(4); <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(a); <em>Morrison v. Tenn. Consol. Coal Co., </em>644 F.3d 473, 479-80 (6th Cir.2011). Upon review of the evidence submitted in this case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Employer failed to affirmatively rebut the presumption. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2); <em>Harman Mining Co., </em>678 F.3d at 311. Thus, the ALJ did not err in awarding benefits under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Accordingly, we deny Employer\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-4\"> This presumption was restored by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.
