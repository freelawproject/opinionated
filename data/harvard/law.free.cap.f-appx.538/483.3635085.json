Plaintiffs sought compensation for having to evacuate their nearby houses and businesses, for the loss of and use of their houses and businesses, and for inconvenience, annoyance, lost earnings, and economic loss from business closures, plus exemplary damages. The district court adopted the thorough Memorandum and Recommendation of.the magistrate judge and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-23\">Regarding the negligence claim, the magistrate judge reasoned, in summary, \u201cthat Plaintiffs may not recover for annoyance and inconvenience without some physical injury and that the economic loss rule negates the existence of a duty on the part of Defendant to prevent Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining damages.\u201d Also, \u201cDefendant\u2019s alleged negligent conduct is not comparable to any category for which recovery has been allowed by any Texas court.\u201d Further, \u201c[i]n the absence of contractual privity and physical damage, the economic loss rule applies, and Plaintiffs are thus precluded from recovering their alleged economic damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-24\">We have reviewed the briefs, the applicable law, and pertinent portions of the record and have heard the arguments of counsel. The judgment of dismissal is fully consistent with current Texas law and is thus AFFIRMED, essentially for the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>sons carefully explained by the magistrate judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
