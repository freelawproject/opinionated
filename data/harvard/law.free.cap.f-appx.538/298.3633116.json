We have thoroughly reviewed the record and Umana-Hernandes\u2019 challenges to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1244.1 (2013) (defining felony for purposes of TPS eligibility) and find them without merit. Applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the two-step analysis prescribed by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we conclude that the agency\u2019s promulgation of the regulation was based on a reasonable interpretation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(c)(2)(B)(i) (2006) and was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (providing that a regulation promulgated to fill a gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress is \u201cgiven controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute\u201d); <em>Suisa v. Holder, </em>609 F.3d 314, 319 (4th Cir.2010) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>In re: Umana-Hernandes </em>(B.I.A. Dec. 27, 2012). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
