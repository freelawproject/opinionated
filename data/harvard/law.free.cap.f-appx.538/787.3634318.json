We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-23\">Nunez-Pompa contends that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) by not permitting him to present letters from his family in mitigation of his sentence. The government contends that this appeal should be dismissed based on a sentencing appeal waiver. We review de novo whether to enforce an appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Joyce, </em>357 F.3d 921, 922 (9th Cir.2004). This appeal falls within the scope of the appeal waiver, which covered any sentencing challenge. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA defendant\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights is enforceable if the language of the waiver encompasses his right to appeal on the grounds raised, and if the waiver was knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d). Contrary to Nunez-Pompa\u2019s contention, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>cause the waiver here unambiguously applies to the claim raised on appeal, <em>United States v. Petty, </em>80 F.3d 1384, 1387 (9th Cir.1996), does not compel a different result. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal based on the valid appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b815-24\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
