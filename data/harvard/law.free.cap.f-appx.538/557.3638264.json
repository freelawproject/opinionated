He contends that the district court erred in applying a 12-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) based on his June 2004 California conviction of possession of cocaine base for sale, for which he was sentenced to a 36-month term of probation with a condition that he serve 45 days in jail. Toledo argues that the prior conviction is not \u201ca felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less,\u201d as required under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), because there was not a condition that he serve at least 60 days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-22\">Although Toledo objected to application of the 12-level enhancement, plain error review applies because he is challenging the enhancement on a basis that differs from the objections he raised in the district court. <em>See United States v. Cabral </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 188-89 (5th Cir.1994). To demonstrate plain error, Toledo must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">As used in the applicable guideline, the term \u201c \u2018[sjentence imposed\u2019 has the meaning given the term \u2018sentence of imprisonment\u2019 in Application Note 2 and subsection (b) of \u00a7 4A1.2.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(vii)). A state sentence that is entirely probated, with no requirement of incarceration, does not constitute a term of imprisonment, as a defendant must have actually been incarcerated during some part of his sentence. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Parra, </em>581 F.3d 227, 229-30 (5th Cir.2009). \u201c[T]he question is whether any time was actually served on [the prior] sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 240 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Toledo\u2019s California sentence qualifies as a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d under the definition set forth in Application Note 2 and subsection (b) of \u00a7 4A1.2, as he was actually incarcerated during a part of his sentence. <em>See Rodriguez-Parra, </em>581 F.3d at 229-30; <em>Brown, </em>54 F.3d at 240. Toledo has not shown clear or obvious error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-23\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
