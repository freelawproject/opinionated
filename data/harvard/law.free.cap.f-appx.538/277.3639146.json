We have thoroughly reviewed the record, including the transcript, and Bang\u2019s supporting affidavits and evidence. We conclude that the record evidence does not compel a ruling contrary to any of the administrative findings of fact, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006), and that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-25\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Martha Bi Kum Epse Zie Bang </em>(B.I.A. Nov. 20, 2012). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-26\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
