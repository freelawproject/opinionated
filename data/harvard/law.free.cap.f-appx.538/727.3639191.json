The district court sentenced him to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment, within the guidelines imprisonment range of 70 to 87 months. He filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed lawyer asserts that the appeal is frivolous and moves to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Espinoza has not responded to counsel\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). We limit our review to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-24\">Counsel first informs us that Espinoza does not want to challenge his guilty plea. Thus the lawyer appropriately omits discussion about the plea colloquy and the voluntariness of Espinoza\u2019s plea. <em>See United States v. Konczak, </em>683 F.3d 348, 349 (7th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-71 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-26\">Counsel does evaluate whether Espinoza could challenge the district court\u2019s finding that his relevant conduct involved 5.25 kilograms of cocaine. As to four of those kilograms, Espinoza admitted only to negotiating their purchase for a later date, and a district court may consider negotiated quantities of undelivered drugs only if the defendant was \u201creasonably capable\u201d of purchasing the drugs. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12 (2011); <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>585 F.3d 1024, 1032 (7th Cir.2009). Given Espinoza\u2019s limited financial resources, counsel considers whether the court properly held him accountable for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>negotiated drug amount that he purportedly could not afford. But Espinoza waived any such argument on appeal when he decided at sentencing to withdraw his objection to the four-kilogram quantity (in order to prevent any inconsistency with the proffer statements he made to cooperate fully with the government, satisfy the \u201csafety valve\u201d requirements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a), and obtain a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(16)). <em>See United States v. Brodie, </em>507 F.3d 527, 530-32 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Staples, </em>202 F.3d 992, 995 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Counsel also addresses whether Espinoza could challenge his 78-month prison term as unreasonable. But the within-guidelines sentence is presumed reasonable, <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 350-51, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Aslan, </em>644 F.3d 526, 531-32 (7th Cir.2011), and we agree with counsel that the record presents no basis to set that presumption aside. The district court adequately addressed the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), noting Espinoza\u2019s clean criminal record and struggles with substance abuse, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), but emphasizing the need to protect the community from drug crimes, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), and hold Espinoza accountable for his actions, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
