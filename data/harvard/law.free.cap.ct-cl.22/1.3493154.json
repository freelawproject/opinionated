Cls. R., 340). Subsequently during the term, the law officers of the government move for a rehearing. All of the questions involved are reaTgued and reconsidered.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-12\">T. The French Spoliation Cases cannot be maintained as subjects of legal right founded on municipal law; but Congress with full knowledge of the law and the facts, directed that they be investigated and determined under a different and broader rule, viz, \u201c <em>According to the rules of laxo, municipal and international, amd the treaties of the United States applicable to the same,\u201d Act 20th January, </em>1885 (23 Stat. L., 283).</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-13\">II. The question, what are <em>\u201cx'alid claims to indemnity upon the French Gov-miment,\u201d </em>is international and not within the scope of ordinary judicial inquiry, and is to be measured by rules which relate to the rights and obligations of nations.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-14\">III. The purpose of the French Spoliation Act of 1885 is that the judicial shall assist the political branch of the Government in determining certain rights not enforceable in courts, but which are nevertheless obligatory under international law and the Constitution.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>IV.The court now adheres to its former conclusions (l) that the French depredations upon American commerce were illegal; (2) that the United \u00a1States hy the Treaty 1800 set off these claims against others \u201c maintained by France, and released them for a valuable consideration beneficial to this nation (3) that an appeal from a prize court is not an indispensable prerequisite to diplomatic interference and amid the circumstances is no defense in this case.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\">V.It is the purpose of the Spoliation Act that the court shall determine whether each claim brought before it is valid as against France, and whether the United States became liable over to the indi- . vidual.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\">VI.Neither original of the treaty of 1800 with France can be found; but the published copies differ only in the caption, which is not a part of a treaty, and is usually the work of an editor.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-8\">VII. The treaty was not a treaty of peace, nor did it conclude or recognize a state of war or a condition of hostilities. The decision in <em>Has v. Xingy </em>(4 Dallas, 37), and the statutes to which the decision refers, \u2022 examined and explained.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-11\">VIII. The treatyis not an adjudication of these claims adverse to this Government. Its own terms negative that assumption ; so do the negotiations which led to it, and so does the act 1885.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-13\">IX.The reprisals of this country upon France were most limited in their nature; were allowed by the natural laws of self-defense, and defined and regulated by acts of Congress which were defensive in character, allowing French merchantmen to pursue their voyages unmolested and to refit and provision in our ports.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-14\">X.The seizure of an American merchantman cannot be justified by the fact of her having been armed for defensive purposes. During the last century substantially all vessels were armed against pirates.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-15\">XI. Condemnations of prize courts are final in actions between individuals, and as to the vessels condemned, giving purchasers a good title as against all the world, but do not bind <em>foreign </em>nations <em>nor </em>bar claims valid by international law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-17\">XII. The rights of prize courts are the rights of the capturing states. Their decrees do not relieve the state from responsibility nor preclude other powers from seeking redress or investigating the captures <em>de novo.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-19\">XIII.The absence of a ship\u2019s papers may be punishable within local jurisdiction as a police measure, but never by absolute confiscation, if it be shown that the vessel was innocently pursuing a legitimate voyage.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-20\"><em>The Reporters\u2019 </em>statement of the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-21\">The cases now argued and submitted are the same as those determined at the last term (21 C.

After hearing the parties, their proofs and arguments, the court from the'evidence finds the facts to be as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-11\">I. In 1797 Thomas Stewart, a citizen of Charleston, S. C., was the owner of the ship Theresa. The Theresa was duly registered as a vessel of the United States. In the same year, under the command of James Brown, the master, she sailed, in ballast, upon a lawful voyage from London to \u00c9 antes, where she was to take in a cargo of salt. She bore a letter from Mr. King, the United States minister to Great Britain, to P. F. Dorbee, vice-consul of the United States at Nantes. Arriving at Nantes she was seized by the French marine officers, and, on April 25, 1798, condemned by the tribunal of commerce, whereby she became lost to the owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-12\">II. The Theresa was condemned \u201cupon the plea of the want of a muster-roll or <em>r\u00f3le d'\u00e9gidpage.\u201d </em>The legality of condemnation for this cause, the liability of France to make restitution, and the transfer of such liability to the United States by the operation of the treaty of 1800, were considered by the court and ruled upon adversely to the defendants in the case of <em>William Gray, Administrator, </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>No. 7 of these claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>III.

It is a prerogative of sovereignty to judge and determine conclusively whether war is justifiable; and when a\u2018sovereign so determines it is conclusive on the whole world. (Story on the Constitution, \u00a7 207.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-10\">6. France, at the time of the seizure of the property for which claim is made, was a sovereign nation, and, as such, had a right to determine conclusively as to the United States whether her status should be that of peace or war; and if the latter, whether it should be general or limited; and, in either event, the principles of international law applicable to the status she selected are those which should control in determining her liability for the property for which claim is made. <em>(The Charming </em>Betsey, 2 Crauch, 118; 1 id., 39-28 ; 3 Wheaton, 315.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-11\">7. That the deliberate act of France by which she authorized the seizure by force, the condemnation, and confiscation of the merchantmen and armed vessels of the United States, under which the property claimed in this case was seized, was the actual assertion and exercise of a belligerent power, and, as such, constituted a maritime war on her part against the United States. <em>(Bas </em>v, Tingy, 4'Dali., 39, 40, 41: Dana\u2019s Wheaton, \u00a7 291.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-12\">8.

That during the existence of a maritime war, if a vessel and cargo of a citizen be seized by one of the belligerents, and be not recaptured by one of his own nation, his title is gone ; and, unless,by the treaty which terminates the war the rights are reserved, or indemnity is provided for or received for the seizure, he has no valid claim for his loss.

The determination as to whether war is justifiable and exists belongs, under the United States Government, to the political departments of the Government, and their determination is conclusive as\" law on the judiciary. (2 Black, 670; 12 Wall., 702; 15 id., 560, 561.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\">11. If the political departments of the Government enact such laws, make such proclamations, as authorize the forcible capture of the property of another nation on the high seas, make conquests, and condemn the property captured as booty, it is a political determination of the existence of war.

The act of Congress of the 9th of July, 1798, and other similar acts, at ,and about the same time, in pursuance thereof, followed by the capture and condemnation of the property of the French, and other warlike acts of retaliation by force, is a conclusive determination by the political departments of the Government that war existed by the United States against France.* <em>(Bas </em>v. <em>Tingy, </em>4 Dali., 42,43, 44, 46; 1 Oranch, 28,31.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-8\">The syllabus in <em>Bas </em>v. <em>Tingy </em>is as follows :\u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-9\"><em>u </em>Under the seventh section of the <em>Act of March 2, </em>1799 (1 Stat. L., 716), France was to be deemed an'enemy of the United States in March, 1799, and a French privateer having captured an American vessel, a,public armed vessel of the United States was entitled to salvage or recapture.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-10\">The opinion declares as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-11\">\u00ab The decision of this question must depend upon another, which is whether, at the time of passing the act of Congress of the 2d of March, 1799, there subsisted a state of war between the two nations. It may, I believe, be safely laid down that every contention by force between two nations, in external matters, under the authority of their respective Governments, is not only war, but public war. If it be declared in form, it is called solemn, and is of the perfect kind; because one whole nation is at war with another whole nation, and all the members of the nation declaring war are authorized to commit hostilities against all the members of the other in every place and under every circumstance. In such a war all the members act under a general authority, and all the rights and consequences attach to their condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201c But hostilities may subsist between two na tions, more confined in its nature and extent, being limited as to places, persons, and things, and this is more properly termed imperfect war, because not solemn, and because those who are authorized to commit hostilities act under special .authority and can go no farther than to the extent of their commission. Still, however, it is public war, because it is an external contention by force between some of the members of the two nations, authorized by the legitimate powers. It is a war between the two nations, though all the members are not authorized to commit hostilities such as in a solemn war where the Government restrain the general power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\">\u201c Now, if this be the true definition of war, let us see what was the situation of the United States in relation to France. In March, 1799, Congress had raised an army, stopped all intercourse with France,, dissolved our treaty, built and equipped ships of war and commissioned private armed ships; enjoining the former and authorizing the latter to defend themselves against the armed ships of France; to attack them on the high seas, to subdue and take them as prize, and to recapture armed vessels found in their possession.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">\u201c What, then, is the evidence of legislative will ? Tn fact and in law we are at war. An American vessel fighting with a French vessel to subdue and make her prize is fighting with an enemy, accurately and technically speaking; and if this be not sufficient evidence of the legislative mind, it is explained in the same law. The sixth and the ninth sections of the act speak of prizes, which can only be of property taken at sea from an enemy, <em>-jure belli; </em>and the ninth section speaks of prizes taken from an enemy, in so many words, alluding to prizes which had been previously taken. But no prize could have been then taken except from France; prizes taken from France were, therefore, taken from the enemy. This, then, is a legislative interpretation of the word enemy; and if the enemy as to prizes, surely they preserve the same character as to recaptures. Besides, it may be fairly asked, Why should the rate of salvage be different in such a war as the present from the salvage in a war more solemn and general <em>\u00cd </em>And it must be recollected that the occasion of making the law of March, 1799, was not only to raise the salvage, but to apportion it to the hazard in which the property retaken was placed, a circumstance for which the former salvage law had not provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\">\u201c The two laws, on the whole, cannot be rendered consistent unless the court could wink so hard as not to see and know, that in fact in the view of Congress, and to every intent and purpose, the possession by a French armed vessel of an American vessel was the possession of an enemy, and, therefore, in my opinion, the decree of the Circuit Court ought to be affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">\u201c But by the acts of Congress an American vessel is author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ized: 1st. To resist the search of a French public vessel; 2d. To capture any vessel that should attempt by force to comppl submission to a search ; 3d. To recapture any American vessel seized by a French vessel; and 4th. To capture any French armed vessel wherever found on the high seas.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">\u201c An imperfect war, or a war as to certain objects and to a certain extent, exists between the two nations; and this modified warfare is authorized by the constitutional authority of our country. It is war <em>quoad hoc. </em>As far as Congress tolerated and authorized the war on our part, so far may we proceed in hostile operations. It is a maritime war, a war at sea as to certain purposes. The national armed vessels of France attack and capture the national armed vessels of the United States; and the national armed vessels are expressly authorized and directed to attack, subdue, and take the national armed vessels of France, and also to recapture American vessels.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">Now, is that the truth or is it false? Is that law to this court or is it not law; and was not that a capture exactly like this of the Sally ? But if it were a war and the laws of war apply, there was no title, no right of recovery whatever left in the owner of the Sally twenty-four hours after she was taken under general international law. Under our statute there was none at all, unless on recapture. The same view is expressed in another form by each and every justice in that cause. Now, if you will take that case and make any possible distinction between the case of <em>Bas </em>v. <em>Tingy </em>and this case at bar, it is more than I am capable of making on principle, because you will have to find it was captured just as the Sally was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">13. The United States having elected to redress the wrongs France had done her and her citizens by retaliation \u2014 a warlike measure \u2014 and having actually obtained redress in that way, cannot afterwards, in the absence of treaty stipulations, deny the justice of the judgment in this last and highest tribunal of nations, nor claim another remedy arid payment for the same wrong. (Treaty of 1800, Rev. Stat., \u00a7 225; Yattel, 437,438.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">14. The claim in this case, if any existed, having then been redressed by the war measures of retaliation as against France, is barred by the redress received in the judgment of that court of last resort.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-9\">15. When a sovereign appeals to the judgment of the tribunal of war, that ax&gt;peal is final and conclusive as to the parties in the controversy and all their citizens as to the subject-matter of the dispute, and is conclusively presumed to be fully executed in the treaty by which the appeal is terminated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-10\">1G. That by the treaty of 1800 as ratified, no rights of the citizen were reserved, nor any indemnity provided for or received ; but both the United States and France expressly renounced their respective pretensions to indemnity for past alleged wrongs committed by either.

That the very cause of the warlike measures determined upon by the United States as against France, which was terminated by the treaty of 1800, was the capture, condemnation, and destruction by the French of American vessels and cargoes, in which was included the property claimed by the petitioner in this case. (Rawle on the Constitution, 100.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">IS.

(Yattel, 402, 403.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">20. The fact that the United States did not require an indemnity of France for the spoliations committed on the commerce of her citizens does not impose on the United States the legal duty of paying all or any claims for which she as a sovereign did not see fit to demand indemnity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-8\">21. That the judgment of the political departments of the Government in making and ratifying the treaty of 1800 being a political act, and within the jurisdiction of the political departments, is, as law, conclusive on this court; and this court-is not empowered to reopen the justice or expedience of the treaty, nor to rejudge it on any grounds. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Suffolk Insurance Co., </em>13 Pet., 420; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>92 U.

That certain claims of American citizens have been re- . leased to France. This we established by the treaty of 1800,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-9\">and by the correspondence and negotiations relative thereto, as officially published in Ex. Doc. 102, 1st sess., 19th Oong.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-10\">II. That these claims for indemnity were valid against France, and that her liability for them was admitted by France.

Doc. 102.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-11\">III. That the United States released to France these claims of American citizens \u201cfor a valuable consideration for the public benefit,\u201d ignoring the rights of individual citizens who had suffered by the spoliations. This we have established by the treaty of 1800, and the correspondence and negotiations as to it, as published in Ex. Doc. 102, and the proceedings of the two nations as to its ratification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-12\">IY. That the release by France, of her claims fbr indemnity, for the failure to keep the treaties of 1778, and for making the Jay treaty, in \u00cd794, was to the United States a \u201cvaluable consideration,\u201d for their release to France of these claims of their citizens against her. This we have established by the official correspondence published in Ex. Doc. 102, and the treaties of 1778, and well recognized principles of the law of nations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-13\">Y. That whilst prize courts may hold themselves bound to administer the local laws and regulations of their own country, and whilst their own decrees are final as to property in <em>the </em>res, yet their judgment is the act of their government, and a valid diplomatic claim rests upon it, if the condemnation is in derogation of the law of nations or impairs a treaty. This we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>have established by decisions of our Supreme Court, and by the settled law of nations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-5\">VI. That in the treaty of 1800, the governments of the two countries came together in an adjustment of their differences or \u201c misunderstanding,\u201d as on the basis of the continued existence of the treaties of 1778, and agreed \u201c to negotiate further\u201d as to those treaties and the mutual claims for indemnity for their mutual violations of them; and subsequently, in its ratification, the United States secured a release from the future obligations of the treaties of 1778 and their liabilities for having failed to observe them, in consideration of a release to France of their claims for reclamation of American citizens. The bargain was not only a set-off of the mutual claims to indemnity, but a release to the United States from these treaties for the future.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">VII. That war leaves the right to captured property with the possessor at the time of the signing of the treaty; but in view of the fact that there had been no war, this treaty mutually restored all captures on hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-7\">VIII. That the question arises as to what cases come within the class of those released to France, in the bargain effected by the recision of the second article, and were therefore valid claims against France, and not excluded by the terms of the exceptions relating to the three other treaties, as declared in the terms of the jurisdictional act, referring these claims to this court. And the answer to this is, all <em>u </em>for illegal captures, detentions, seizures, condemnations, and confiscations, made prior to July 31,1801,\u201d which do not come within one of the three exceptions of the jurisdictional act, and which were made in- violation of the treaties between France and the United States, and in violation of the law of nations. And this answer must be applied to the state of facts established by the evidence in each particular case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-8\">IX. That most of these condemnations were based on the want of a r\u00f3le d\u2019\u00e9quipage, which was required by the ancient maritime regulations of France, and this regulation was reenacted after the treaties of 1778. The civil tribunals on appeal from the tribunals of commerce, held that this regulation was binding on the courts of France without regard either to the treaties or to the laws of nations. These condemnations, we maintain, were not only in violation of the treaty but of the law of nations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>X. That condemnations because the captain or mate was foreign-born, though a naturalized American citizen, were in violation of the law of nations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-5\">XI. That condemnations for running a blockade were unlawful, for it is a well-established historical fact that the French had not a blockade in the West Indies, and the very proclamations of blockade themselves, show that they were <em>brutum fulmen </em>and mere pretexts for making captures.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-6\">XII. That the few remaining captures were on the ground of carrying British productions or trading to British ports, both whereof are indisputably in violation of the treaty aud are in contravention of the law of nations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-7\">XIII. An illegal condemnation by a prize court is the act of the government of that court, and the valid basis of a diplomatic claim.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-8\"><em>Mr. William Gray, Mr. George S. Boutwell, Mr. Bdicard Lander, Mr. Lawrence Lewis, jr., Mr. Samuel Shelldbarger, Mr. Jere Wilson </em>and <em>Mr. Leonard Myers </em>were also heard in support of the position taken by the claimants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-9\">Argument of <em>Mr. B. Wilson </em>for the defendants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-10\">The third section of the jurisdictional act January 20, 1885, provides that this court \u201c shall decide upon the validity of said claims according to the rules of law, municipal and international, and the treaties of the United States applicable to the same, and shall report all such conclusions of fact and law as in their judgment may affect the liability of the United States therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-11\">By the sixth section it is provided that such finding and report shall be only advisory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-12\">Congress wants no information from the court, but positive fact and positive law, and when the court finds such a thing is the fact and such a principle is the established law, and so report to Congress, that body proposes to take action according to its own wisdom upon the report so made. For example, the Supreme Court, interpreting the acts of the political department, have settled the question as to war in all its bearings, and the law to be that it was such a war as authorized captures and condemnations as prize and made one government the enemy of the other. (4 Dallas, <em>38; 1 </em>Cranch, pp. 1-9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>31, 32, 39, 40, 41.) What more can be done but to report accordingly? Again, the Supreme Court <em>{Ware, Administrator, </em>v. <em>Hylton et al., </em>3 Dallas 258,1796) have settled the law of nations to be that treaties between sovereign powers when broken by one are voidable at the option of the other; and in <em>Chirac </em>v. <em>Chirac, </em>the same court, Marshall, Ch. J., delivering the opinion, held that in 1799 no treaty was in existence between France and the United States. (2 Wheaton, 272.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-5\">What can be done by this court but report that such is the law on that subject? In the same manner, by reference to standard authorities, should all other legal principles be ascertained and reported, as, for example, the <em>conclusiveness </em>of prize adjudications <em>{Cushing </em>v. <em>Laird, </em>107, U. S. R., pp. 69), and <em>invalidity </em>in <em>law </em>of claims, based either upon such adjudications (Lord Eldon in 2 Swanston, 576) or upon acts of war, and the necessity of <em>exhausting </em>remedies in the courts in such cases (other than <em>prize </em>cases, however) where valid claims <em>may </em>exist. All these things are settled <em>law, </em>and operate favorably to the United States in this matter. Special exemptions from the general law must be specially pleaded and proven. For example, if some of the captured were prevented from exhausting their remedies, and it appears that all were not, it is incumbent on each claimant to show that he was so prevented. The burden must be on some one to show it, and he who asserts a fact must prove it, and not he who denies it prove the negative. Most, practically all these claims would be invalid for want of exhaustion of remedies, if not already invalid because prize judgments are conclusive and final. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-6\">The facts to be reported are, of course, the when and how, where and .why, seizures and captures were made by the French. These being found, then the question of law arises, were they illegally made? Were they made in pursuance of international law ? It is not pretended that they were made without authority of French law. But it is pretended that France had no right under the law of nations to pass such laws. If this was pretended of the laws of Congress in 1798 authorizing condemnation of French property we should call the pretense an absurdity. However, were the laws illegal according to international law? Upon what alleged right of France were they based ? Evidently on the right, which every nation has, of using force to retaliate upon another nation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>which she believes to have deprived her of her rights secured by treaty, and to have wronged her otherwise. Was this using of force by France for such a purpose legal or illegal ? Yattel and Grotius, and other writers on the law of nations, tell us that such laws are proper, and that it is for every sovereign nation to decide for itself when they ought to be passed, not because might is right, but because there is nobody else to decide the question. If the law is'right and proper, was it legal to enforce it in the courts 1 To ask such a question is to answer it. The right of a sovereign to enact such laws is as well settled as any international question can be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-5\">When the commander of a French vessel captured an American vessel there was only one legal way to determine whether he had legally captured her, and whether she was <em>lawful </em>prize under the treaties and the law of nations, and that was by trial in a prize court of the captor\u2019s country; so says the law of nations. That trial and the finding were not only legal, but the only legal ones possible. Any other trial and a finding, in any other kind of court, in any other country, would have been illegal, but not this. This is another conclusion of the law of nations which affects the liability of the Government of the United States when subrogated to the liability of France. Prize judgments are not disregarded by international commissions created by the <em>consent </em>of nations, because they are, properly speaking, illegal, but for reasons of diplomacy and compromise. For example, the Alabama Commission, as one of the opposite counsel stated, disregarded decisions of the Supreme Court in prize cases. The reports of those Commissioners show that the correctness and legality of the court\u2019s decisions were not disputed, but <em>under the treaty </em>they were to decide according to <em>abstract justice </em>rather than according to <em>law. </em>Law works absolute justice in most cases, but fails to do so in the exceptional cases. Nations can <em>waive </em>their right to the enforcement of law in such exceptional cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-6\">This was proposed by American envoys for France to do in, 1800, but she refused because we did not agree to her propositions. In the Alabama cases the waiver was agreed upon. That consent could <em>rightly </em>have been withheld, and the <em>law </em>insisted on, but <em>policy </em>induced the contrary. To quote from the argument used in those cases:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-7\">\u201c It was further maintained on behalf of the claimants that,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>under the treaty of Washington, the Commissioners were not constituted a tribunal Miich in prize cases had a merely appellate jurisdiction to review the judgments of the prize court of last resort; that the Commissioners had, by the <em>terms </em>of the treaty, greater and more absolute power to do justice than was or could be exercised by the prize courts of the United States; and that even if the Commissioners should be satisfied that upon the record presented to the prize court, the facts disclosed <em>warranted </em>condemnation under the <em>law of nations, </em>yet if they found, under all the circumstances of the case, that in <em>justice and equity </em>the claimants were entitled to indemnity, it was their solemn duty to award it, even though it were in the face of the technical rule of the prize courts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">As stated, nations may waive their right under international law, and reach results mutually satisfactory by diplomacy, but diplomacy is not international law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">This can only be done by consent of sovereign nations, and money paid upon claims thus admitted or <em>created, </em>is a gift or donation for purely political and diplomatic reasons. (2 Swans-ton, 576). France did not waive her legal right as to the conclusiveness of the judgments of her prize courts, nor to the necessity for claimants to exkausttheir remedy by appeal oroth-erwise, nor as to the effect of the public maritime war between the two nations. She declined to waive these rights, because we refused to revive without modification the ancient treaties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">As to the alleged admissions and the statements made and omitted in the notes exchanged between the French and American negotiators of the treaty of 1800, embraced between pages 580 and 637, Senate Ex. Doc. 102,19th Cong., 1st sess., a perusal of those pages with care and anxiety does not reveal either the admissions or omissions relied on by claimants. Neither any waiving of the exhaustion of remedies by France, nor any admission of the validity of the claims, occurs anywhere in that negotiation. The various proposals and counter-proposals, being mere diplomatic chaffering, might explain, but could not alter, what was done. Claims for indemnities due <em>or </em>claimed were renounced (chat is, as the word means, withdrawn), and Congress has asked this court to determine, under international law and the treaties, which were also <em>law, </em>whether they were due or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">The American envoys (Ex. Doc. 102, 19th Cong., 1st sess., p. 587, &amp;c.) admitted the following rights of France under the law of nations by asking her to <em>waive them, </em>viz, the conclusive<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ness of prize judgments <em>(i. e., </em>tlieea?ciMSM&gt;0Messofprizejurisdiction in the <em>capturing </em>Government), the right to construe for itself the treaty of 1778, as to the <em>role d'\u00e9quipage </em>and the right to pass the retaliatory decree of January 18,1798. The principle of conclusiveness of judgments actualiy was incorporated in the treaties of 1800 (Art. 4) and 1803 (Art. 5), and the necessity for exhausting remedies into the latter' treaty (Art. 4), for payments were to be made in cases \u201c appealed within the time necessary.\u201d (See the treaty in French, 8 Stat. L.) The proposition to waive her rights was responded to by France with the proposition that the hostile measures, including the abrogation of treaties, must be <em>receded from; </em>for, of course, if the nations did not now agree that they had been at peace, no indemnities would be due for hostile acts. They must first of all settle what their status had been and was now \u2014 peace or war. If peace, what had been done that was of a hostile character' would thus be adjudged to be illegally and piratically done, and indemnities might be due; but if war, the ravages of <em>war </em>give rise to no indemnities. The two nations, disregarding the unauthorized makeshift reported by their respective agents in the second article, adopted the latter alternative \u2014 war, and no indemnities due. It had to be called war or piracy on both sides, and the President and Senate, with the concurrence of France, adjudged that it was not piracy, but war. The Chief Justice, Ellsworth, our principal envoy, had said to the President: \u201cHaving given your draft of instructions such perusal as the hurry and pressure of a court crowding two terms into one admits of, I remark, with all the freedom you invite, that to insist that the French Government acknowledge its orders to be piratical, or, which is the same, absolutely to pay for depredations committed under them, is, I believe, unusually degrading, and would probably defeat the negotiation, and <em>place us in the wrong. </em>(2 Flauders\u2019 Chief Justice, 236.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-4\">' One\u2019s eyes must be shut to all the rights of France as a sovereign, and all the plainest law of nations, and the decisions of our Supreme Court, not to see the <em>legality </em>of the laws passed by France in retaliation for our injuries to her and to force us to fulfill the treaties we had violated and refused to fulfill. The Supreme Court said the nations were in a state of <em>public war </em>authorized by <em>both </em>Governments. One of its reasons for deciding was, that war and only war, could justify the depreda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tions, confiscations, and bloodshed, on either side, and the) honor of both nations required it to be called war. Now, is/it not necessary to establish these eight propositions before-'declaring the condemnation of these ships illegal ? ' /</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-4\">(1) That the treaty did not require the crew-list 'when it mentioned the crew-list. /</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">(2) That the French court had no right to construe the treaty according to its own understanding of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">(3) That the French Government had no^right to pass the retaliatory decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">(4) That the French courts had no right to decide whether the French Government had such right under international law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-9\">(5) That the treaty, though violated by us, was still binding in all its details on France.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-10\">(6) That the treaty dispensed with all proofs except the passport, which it said <em>must </em>be on board.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-11\">(7) That the judgments of prize courts are not exclusive and conclusive against all the world.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-12\">(8) That there was peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-13\">Allow all of these eight propositions, and it may be admitted that the condemnation of these vessels was illegal. Deny any <em>one </em>of them, and these cases must fall to the ground. It is said by counsel that the decisions of the French courts as to these captures were always against the Americans. Perhaps international law was likewise against them. They were found violating belligerent rights of France. \u2022 But in no less than three out of the four or five cases exhibited here merely to show the jurisdiction of the court of cassation, the supreme court of error in France, the vessels of these Americans were released. But it is said the inferior tribunals at least-always decided against the captured. This is also erroneous, for we have here a list of cases from St. Domingo decided in 1797 and 1799, and out of a little over a hundred captures of suspected \"vessels there were thirty-three releases. It is in St. Domingo that the French are charged with being most lawless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-14\">In the midst of the most bitter war ever waged between France and England, the English courts never in any case disputed the conclusiveness of French prize judgments.

But Napoleon said that the injustice of the French laws, so far as they affected real neutrals,-was just retaliation as regarded the Americans, for their Jay treaty, and our Supreme Court, in that very case, decided that Frailee and America were enemies and at war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">The whole world, it is said, are <em>parties </em>to an admiralty cause, and, therefore, the whole world <em>is bound </em>by the decision.

(5 East., 155.) If the court comes to the conclusion that the vessel is not neutral,itis quite <em>immaterial </em>through what media it arrived at it. (Lord Mansfield, 2 Taunton, 85.) If infraction of treaty be the ground, the condemnation is legal and conclusive, although, where a treaty required certain documents on the ship, <em>municipal laws </em>were referred to as showing what the treaty required, and although the court \u2018coustrued the treaty iniquitously.\u2019 (Lord Ellenborough, 5 East., 99.) If the court, by the aid of the ordinances of its country, reached the conclusion that it was enemy property, it is conclusive. The sent ence is conclusive if based on breach of treaties, however there may nothave been sucha breach.

Harmony, peace, concession to the universal welfare of mankind ; that which in our municipal cases is called the policy of the law. It is the policy of the law of nations.

For instance: \u201c If the King of France shall complain of the unjustness of sentences which have been given concerning the ships or merchandise taken at sea (or of the wrong interpretation of the treaty by the courts), the King of Great Britain shall forthwith commission under his great seal nine of his privy counsel to adjudge such matters and to confirm or revoke these sentences.\u201d So we see that according to the theory of these treaties unless the Government of the captor does not choose to reverse the decision of his own courts their decisions stand conclusive against the other nations. Such is the law of nations as to prize judgments. This does not prevent a nation from claiming anything it may desire or another nation from granting what is claimed if it sees fit.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Dayis, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">This case, with others like it, was fully argued at the last term, and after careful study and industrious conference an opinion was delivered upon the general principles applicable to the claims as a class, while final and detailed findings were delayed, at the defendants\u2019 request, until after the summer recess. During this recess the law officers of the Government, diligently and jealously guarding the interests intrusted to them, have carefully studied not only the facts of the several cases, but have re-examined the general principles applicable to the claims as a class \u2014 principles understood to have been finally settled, so far as this court is concerned, by the former decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The defendants now move for a rehearing, and somewhat contrary to the usual practice, but in furtherance of the substantial ends of justice, a full, able, and learned argument, occupying nearly two weeks, has been had, in which all the questions heretofore considered have again been exhaustively discussed. Thus, upon a motion for permission to reargue the case, it has in fact been reargued, and in deciding the motion we act with all the light we should have received had the more technical course been pursued of first allowing the motion and then hearing-the reargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The learned Solicitor-General, who has personally appeared with the assistant attorney of the United States who so competently conducted the defense of these claims, takes as the text of his argument certain suggested conclusions of law, twenty-five in number, many of which may be readily admitted, either standing alone or in the connection in which they are used, without leading to a result different from that already reached by this court; while considered as a whole they form the successive links of a chain of argument which, if perfect, defeats all the claims submitted under the act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Many of the difficulties surrounding these cases will disappear under the touchstone of the jurisdictional act, for it must always be remembered that we are not now to decide in accordance with the general statutes giving us exclusive jurisdiction of actions between the citizen and his Government founded \u00aen contract, nor yet under the special jurisdiction conferred by such laws as the \u201c Bowman Act,\u201d by which, in aid of Congress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>we report facts to that body or its committees, and facts and law to the Executive Departments for their \u201c guidance and action\u201d; nor under the jurisdiction given by section 1063 of the Revised Statutes, which authorizes us'to proceed to final judgment in claims of a certain nature transmitted to us by the heads of the principal Executive Departments. In all these cases we sit as a court bound to administer the law found in the Constitution, statutes, and common law of the United States as interpreted by the Supreme Court, and, so far as we have yet seen, not one of the spoliation claims could have the slightest pretense of a successful result were the investigation to be measured by the standard set for us in other causes. It cannot be presumed that Congress, in passing the act of 1885, with full knowledge of the law and facts, intended an empty form; therefore it follows that they desired us not only to examine these claims, but to examine them in the light of some rule different from that upon which we must ordinarily proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The statute says that those citizens or their legal representatives who had \u201cvalid claims\u201d of a specified class upon the French Government, arising out of certain illegal acts committed prior to the ratification of the treaty of 1800, may apply to this court (\u00a7 1); we are then to determine the validity and amount of these claims \u201c according to the rules of law, municipal and international, and the treaties of the United States applicable to the same,\u201d but we cannot enter judgment; on the contrary, after the hearing we may only report to the Congress such conclusions of fact and law as in our opinion may affect the liability of the United States for these claims (\u00a7\u00a7 3 and 6), and this report is binding on neither the claimant nor the Congress (\u00a76).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The first question presented, then, is as to the validity of the claims against France. This is an international question not within the scope of ordinary judicial inquiry, and is to be measured by rules of law well known, thoroughly recognized, and often enforced, but which in the very nature of things are not, in the absence of special legislative authority, presented to, argued before, or passed upon by the judicial departments of Governments. These rules of law relate to the rights and obligations of nations, not to the title to property, nor to the rights of individuals between themselves, nor yet to the rights of individuals against their own Governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>While many of the propositions of the defense are in the abstract sound, they rest upon the basis that these claimants are prosecuting a legal right in a court of law acting under the usual common-law restrictions of such a tribunal sitting as a subordinate agent of the state with strictly defined procedure and jurisdiction. So far as power is concerned this court is not so sitting in these cases; \u201cjudicial power is the internal or civil branch of executive power exerting itself under such checks and controls as the legislative power has subjected it to\u201d (11 Rutherforth, 59); those checks and controls are well defined and well understood, and are such as operate to defeat in judicial tribunals diplomatic claims founded upon international right.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We are for the present, to a limited degree, absolved by express act of the legislature from these checks and controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">That is, we are to aid the political department of the Government, by its direction, in the disposal of contentions which arise from past international transactions, and while the claims of individuals now before us are not, from a judicial point of view, legal rights \u2014 that is, they do not constitute causes of action \u2014 they may be none the less rights; that is, they may be founded on law but not enforceable in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">We do not intend to assume any legislative function or to determine any abstract right, for our power is fixed and defined by the act of Congress, which authorizes no such course, but which does require something more than a bare opinion that there can be no recovery on these claims in the courts; that was known before the statute was passed, and the legislature have instructed us by that statute to advise them not as to the law enforceable in courts of law, not as to abstract rights, but as to the law enforceable within their own higher jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">We have already held that the depredations made by France upon our commerce were illegal, and notwithstanding the able argument of the defense, sustained by the results of most industrious investigation, we do not see reason for changing this conclusion. The quotations in our previous opinion show that the Government of the United States uniformly insisted upon the illegality of the conduct of France and never failed to demand redress; they show that France admitted the principle of the American contention; that Spain paid claims of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>class ; that England did the same, and that by the principles of the law of nations aside from any definite compact such as that of 1778, the injuries to our commerce afforded good foundation for diplomatic demand. Upon the second branch of the case we held, and in support of the position cited copiously from the contemporaneous negotiations and instructions of the American Secretaries of State, and from the correspondence and journals of the American ministers charged with the protection of American interests, that by the cancellation of the second article of the treaty of 1800 the United States set off the spoliation claims against those claims which France had against us, claims which our representatives thought of so much gravity and of so much value as to authorize an offer, refused by France, of many millions of francs for a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">It seems unnecessary to repeat those voluminous citations, or to add to them, from the mass of correspondence which we have read, extracts which would be merely cumulative. We have carefully re-examined the question in the light of the re-argument, and nevertheless adhere to the conclusions reached last term after exhaustive discussion by counsel and patient and laborious investigation by ourselves, that these claims (as a class) were valid obligations from France to the United States, that the latter surrendered them to France for a valuable consideration benefiting the nation, and that this use of the claims raised an obligation founded upon right, and upon the Constitution (which forbids the taking of private property for public use without compensation), to compensate the individual sufferers for the losses sustained by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We do not decide nor have we attempted to decide that the conduct of the Government after the Eevolution and prior to the treaty of 1800 was or was not wise, proper, or justifiable, questions which are within the domain of the historian, and have not been submitted to us; we advise, whether in performance of their public duties, and in protection of the commonwealth, and in carrying out the directions of those having the right to give them, or in fulfillment of the powers and obligations conferred and imposed by the Constitution and laws, the statesmen of that period took such action in relation to private rights as raised an oblig'ation on the part of the Government to compensate the citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>We are to see whether the claims urged on France were valid, whether each particular claim brought before us is one of the class defined in the statute, whether it was valid in law against France, and whether the United States became, by their action in 1800 and 1801, liable over to the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Government again urges that, as-there was war between the United States and France, the seizures were justifiable. This point we have so fully discussed in the opinion delivered at the last term that now it seems necessary only to sum up our conclusions and to consider one or two incidental points pressed with particular energy by the defense at this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">There were what were called by some \u201c hostilities,\u201d by others \u201c differences,\u201d by Congress \u201cthe system of predatory violence\u201d (1 Stat. L., 578), by Justice Patterson \u201c a qualified state of hostility,\u201d \u201cwar <em>quoad-hoc,\" </em>and by Justice Chase \u201c limited partial war.\u201d The executive department said the conduct of France would have justified a declaration of war, but the United States, \u201c desirous of maintaining peace,\u201d contented themselves \u201c with preparations for defense and measures calculated to defend their commerce\u201d (Doc. 102, p. 561), while the United States ministers, speaking of the American statutes, wrote that \u201cthey did not even authorize reprisals upon [French] merchantmen, but were restricted simply to the giving of safety to their own till a moment should arrive when their sufferings could be heard and redressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Congress did not consider war as existing, for every aggressive statute looked to the possibility of war in the future, making no provision for war in the present, and France, our supposed enemy, absolutely denied the existence of war. So then, the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of our Government recognized no war, no public solemn war, as existing, and the opposing party denied the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">It has been urged that the compact of 1800 was a treaty of peace; but we do not agree with this contention, for reasons which we give further on, after first considering the subordinate suggestion made relation to the caption of that treaty as found in print.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Curiously neither of the originals, that supposed to be in the custody of France nor that supposed to be in the Department of State, is obtainable. That belonging to this Government long since disappeared, and we are informed that a like fate-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>has befallen the French copy. We are therefore forced to turn to the copies in print in various compilations of treaties to see what assistance can be obtained from a careful comparison of them. No material difference appears anywhere but in the caption, and there we should expect to find it, as the caption is not part of the treaty, and is usually drawn to suit the taste of the editor. The caption in the Revised Statutes runs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">\u201c Convention of peace, commerce, and navigation with France, concluded at Paris September 30, 1800; ratification advised by Senate, with amendments, February 3, 1801; ratified by President February 18, 1801; ratified by First Consul of France, with Senate\u2019s amendments, &amp;c.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Marten\u2019s French collection of treaties contains the head-note, <em>\u201c </em>Convention entre la Republique Fran\u00a7aise et les Etats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique, sign\u00e9e le 30 Septembre, 1800,\u201d and the editor says he had not a copy from the original treaty, but relied upon another publication. Le Clerc has a brief caption containing the word u peace.\u201d The caption in the Bancroft Davis edition of treaties entitles the compact a <em>\u201c </em>Convention between the French Republic and the United States of America,\u201d and gives the dates of signature, exchange, and proclamation; while the caption in volume 8 of the Statutes at Large, prepared in 1846, runs simply as follows: \u201c Convention between the French Republic and the United States of America.\u201d It should be noticed as to this copy that the letter from the committees of Congress found at the beginning of volume 8 states that they <em>\u201c </em>learn that every law and treaty has been carefully collated with the originals in the Department of State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In Mr. Adams\u2019s message, dated December 15,1800, transmitting the treaty to Congress, the head-note is exactly as in volume 8 of the Statutes (2 F. R., 295).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">No inference, therefore, can be drawn from the caption, and the nature of the treaty must be gleaned from its contents, for if it concludes a war that fact will necessarily appear in some form as it does in the treaties of 1783 and 1814 with Great Britain, and in the treaty of 1848 with Mexico. The object of the treaty is stated to be a termination of the \u201c differences \u201d between the two countries, not of the \u201c war \u201d nor even of the \u00a3l hostilities \u201d alleged here to have existed between them. Next it should be observed, and this is a vital distinction, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>treaty is of limited duration; it is to be in force for eight years only. Article Y speaks of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d; and in the twenty-seven articles of the agreement, which cover the many different subjects at that time usually found in a treaty of amity and commerce, there is nothing to indicate that in the opinion of the parties there had been a public solemn war or that they were making a treaty of peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We are again cited to <em>Bas </em>v. <em>Tingy </em>(4 Dallas), a case which we considered very carefully in our previous opinion and from which we made very full quotation, holding that it decided the state of affairs under discussion to constitute partial war limited by the acts of Congress. The opinions of the Supreme Court speak very clearly as. to th\u00e9 relations of the nations, but it is well to bear distinctly in mind that the court was dealing not so much with broad principles of international law as with the interpretation of statutes. Tingy claimed salvage for the rescue of the Eliza from a French privateer, and this claim he based upon the seventh section of the- <em>Act March </em>2, 1799 (1 Stat. L., 716).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The act is eu titled \u201cAn act for the government of the Navy of the United States,\u201d and the seventh sectiou makes provision for salvage to naval vessels for American vessels retaken from France; in construing this statute the court referred to the act of June 13,1798, as explanatory of the relations between the United States and France. This latter act being \u201cAn act to suspend the commercial intercourse between the United States and France, and the dependencies thereof,\u201d does not in any way lead to the inference that public solemn war existed, for if such war existed a formal suspension of commercial relations would be unnecessary, and the contents of the statute negative the inference of war especially in the provision that no French vessels \u201c armed or unarmed, commissioned by or for or under the authority of the French Eepublic, or owned, fitted, hired, or employed by an3r person resident within the territory of that Eepublic, or any of the dependencies thereof, or sailing or coming therefrom, excepting any vessel to which the President of the United States shall grant a passport * * * shall be allowed an entry or to remain within the territory of the United States unless driven there by distress of weather or in want of provisions,\u201d and these distressed vessels are to be allowed to provision and refit (\u00a7 3), something certainly not permitted either in time of war or reprisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The <em>Act June </em>28,1798 (1 Stat. L., 574), also considered by the court, was intended as an addition to that of June 13,1798 (1 Stat. L., 565), and makes provision as to the amount of salvage to be received by American war vessels capturing French armed vessels during what the latter act describes as the \u201c aggressions, depredations, and hostilities \u201d encouraged and maintained \u201cby the Government of France,\u201d and which it does not describe as war.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The decision of the Supreme Court therefore goes to this extent and no more, that for the purpose of a recovery -of salvage France was an enemy to the extent the acts of Congress prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">It has been urged that the treaty of 1800 was a solemn adjudication of the claims adverse to this Government, but we are of opinion not only that this position is negatived by the treaty itself, but that the negotiations which preceded that contract, and which may very properly be referred to for explanation if there be ambiguity in the document, do not support such a contention. Those negotiations having been commented upon by us heretofore, we need not now repeat them, while as to the expunged second article of the treaty, that upon which this contention hangs, it is sufficient to note the statement that as the ministers were \u201c not able to agree respecting \u201d the' treaties of 1778 and 1788, nor upon the indemnities \u201c mutually due and claimed, the parties will negotiate further on these subjects at a convenient time.\u201d Meanwhile the treaties are to have no effect and the relations of the countries are to be governed by the treaty of 1800.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The claims made by France, for which the United States offered millions of francs for release, were national, and were based upon the provisions of the treaties of 1778. The claims for indemnity which we had constantly urged, and whose payment Pickering demanded as an ultimatum, were what are known as the \u201c spoliations claims.\u201d In the entire negotiation, as we have shown in our former opinions, French claims based upon treaty obligations, past and future, were set up against American claims for illegal seizures, condemnations, and confiscations.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">To be sure, Pickering makes a passing mention of national claims on the part of the United States, adding that, as national claims may probably be less definite than those of individuals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>and consequently more difficult to adjust, \u201c national claims may on both sides be relinquished.\u201d (Doc. 102, p. 566.) An examination of the negotiations will show that such claims on our side were not pressed, while on the French side they were strongly urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">No where is the contention more concisely formulated than in the communication of <em>J. </em>Bonaparte and his colleagues to the American Commissioners, wherein the French ultimata are set forth in tiiis form: \u201c Either the ancient treaties, with the privileges resulting from priority and the stipulation of reciprocal indemnities, or a new treaty assuring equality without indemnity.\u201d (Doc. 102, p. 618.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u201cAt the opening of the negotiation,\u201d said the Secretary of State to the American ministers, \u201c you will inform the French ministers that the United States expect from France, as an indispensable condition of the treaty, a stipulation to make to the citizens of the United States full compensation for all losses- and damages which they shall have sustained by reason of irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of their vessels and other property under color of authority or commissions from the French Bepublie or its agents \u201d (Doc. 102. p. 562); and he closed this instruction with several points \u201cto be considered as ultimata,\u201d the first of which was: \u201c That an article be inserted for establishing a board, with suitable powers to hear and determine the claims of our citizens for the causes herein-before expressed, and binding France to pay or secure payment of the sums which shall be awarded,\u201d while the second point prohibited recognition of the old treaties.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">There never was a substantial retreat on either side from these absolutely diverse positions, although there was considerable vacillation, until finally, in a spirit of patriotism, the representatives of the United States, abandoning Mr. Pickering\u2019s ultimata, consented to leave the question still open, as it is found in the second article of the treaty. That article) in terms,, admits that there existed differences as to the treaties of 1778, and in terms it states that indemnities are \u201c mutually due and claimed.\u201d If indemnities are mutually \u201c due\u201d and indemnities are mutually \u201cclaimed,\u201d the instructions and the negotiations prior to the treaty should show what those \u201c due\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>claimed\u201d indemnities are. They do show that upon one side they were claims for national indemnity under treaty obligations; on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>other side,'claims for indemnity for spoliations. As the treaty states that indemnities are \u201c claimed,\u201d and as it states that indemnities are \u201c due,\u201d we cannot agree that it operates as an adjudication of those claims upon which the indemnities are founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The jurisdictional act also negatives this assumption in its direction that we shall examine valid claims arising out of certain acts committed prior to the ratification of the treaty of 1800, thus negativing so far as this court is concerned any possible final adjudication by that international agreement. The statute instructs us not to investigate claims now valid against France, or claims which citizens now have against France, but valid claims which citizens \u201chad\u201d against France and which arose out of certain illegal acts committed prior to the treaty\u2019s ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">By the action of the President and Senate on the yne side, and of Napoleon on the other,' the second article was expunged from the treaty upon agreement that \u201c the two states renounce the respective pretensions which were its object.\u201d Thus, for the purpose of quieting the difficulties and dangers flowing from the treaties of 1778, to avoid the French claims, from which a release had been asked at an offered price of many million francs, to save the young Republic from internal dis.-sension and from danger from without, the American authorities surrendered to France the claims for spoliations upon which up to that moment they had most steadily and most strenuously insisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The alleged reprisals committed by this country upon French commerce were most limited in their nature, and hardly amounted to more than is allowed by the natural law of self-defense \u2014 that law which, by not obliging us to part with our lives, our limbs,.or orir property, allows us to defend our persons and our goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The reprisals were authorized and defined by acts of Congress, the first of which was passed iu June, 1798, and the last in January, 1799.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The <em>Act June </em>25, 1798 (1 Stat. L., 572) authorized \u201cthe defense\u201d of merchant vessels against \u201cFrench depredations,\u201d and to that end permitted the merchantman to oppose search, restraint, or seizure attempted by an armed French vessel, permitted the merclianr.man to repel by force any assault by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>such a French vessel, authorized him to capture such an assaulting vessel, and permitted the merchantman to retake any other American merchantman captured by any armed French vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The second section of this act, which provided for salvage, refers to the case of the capture of a French \u201carmed\u201d vessel, from which an assault or other hostility \u201cshall be first made\u201d; and section 3 requires a bond from armed merchantmen that they shall commit no \u201cunprovoked violence\u201d against the vessel of any nation in amity with the United States. Finally, the sixth section directs that when France shall stop the \u201clawless depredations and outrages hitherto encouraged and authorized by that Government against the merchant vessels of the United States, and shall cause the laws of nations to be observed,\u201d the President shall instruct the merchantmen to submit to search and to refrain from violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">As to the next act, passed, three days later (1 Stat. L., 574), it is only necessary to note that recaptures were to be restored after salvage paid the recaptors, nothing going to the Treasury. The 9th of July following an act was passed to \u201cprotect the commerce of the United States,\u201d which authorized the President to give private armed vessels the same license and authority to take armed vessels of France, and to recapture American vessels, as public armed vessels of the United States had by law (1 Stat. L., 578, \u00a7 2); \u201carmed\u201d French vessels captured to be absolutely forfeited to the capturing vessel, which should receive also just and reasonable salvage on all recaptures. (\u00a7\u00a7 5,0.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The license and authority given the public armed vessels of the United States are found in the first section of this act of 9th July, 1798, and also in a prior act entitled \u201cAn act more effectually to protect the commerce and coasts of the United States,\u201d approved May 28, 1798 (1 Stat. L., 561), which permitted the seizure only of such French armed vessels as had committed, or were hovering on our coasts for the purpose of committing, depredations on vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, and also permitted the recapture'of American vessels seized by the French. The act of July went further than this, and authorized the President to instruct the commanders of public armed vessels to \u201csubdue, seize, and take any armed French vessel which shall be found within the juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>diction of the United States, or elsewhere on the high seas.\u201dThe authority, therefore, given to armed merchantmen by this statute was to subdue, seize, and take any French \u201carmed\u201d vessel, and to recapture any American vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">These statutes seem to us not only defensive in their character, but also marked by self-restraint and calm judgment. Notwithstanding the persistent attacks by France upon the American mercantile marine, no permission is given in this legislation to injure French commerce; armed vessels only are to be seized, and American vessels may be recaptured; peaceable French merchantmen may pursue their voyages unmolested.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">A system of reprisals goes further than this, for it is based upon the principle of compensation, and is aggressive, not defensive, in spirit and intent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cBeprisals [says Vattel, lib. 2, p. 342] are used between nation and nation to do justice to themselves when they cannot otherwise obtain it. If a nation has. taken possession of what belongs to another; if it refuses to pay a debt, to repair an injury, to make a just satisfaction, the other may seize what belongs to it and apply it to its own advantage, till it has obtained what is due for interest and damage, or keep it as a pledge until full satisfaction has been made. In the last case it is rather a stoppage or a seizure than reprisals, but they are frequently confounded in common language.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Dr. Woolsey says reprisals consist in recovering what is our own by force, then in seizing an equivalent. We do not attempt to lay down any general rule of law on this question of reprisals, but a study of the authorities leads to tire conclusion that the action is affirmative and aggressive in character, having for its object compensation. The essence of reprisals has been said to be security \u2014 that is, the seizure of property for protection until just claims are settled, but we do not see that the principle of compensation is thereby changed, as the seizure of property for security must be directed by an effort to obtain security sufficient in amount to provide compensation should the demand for redress be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The statutes we have cited have no such object; they are not aggressive in tlieir provisions or in the power they give, but entirely defensive, except in the instance of seizing armed vessels or retaking captured American vessels. The aim of the statute is defense of our merchantmen, not depredations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>upon the commerce of France, nob compensation to the United States for losses already incurred, not security for demands heretofore made, but protection and safety in the future. It seems to us, therefore, that these acts lack the essential elements of statutes of reprisals. Two suggestions occur to us in concluding this point. If there were, a state of war or a state of reprisals existing, wliy should distressed French vessels be allowed to refit and provision in our ports as they were by the express provisions of the <em>Act January </em>30, 1799 (1 Stat. L., 614) ? The Government of the United States could not have considered that it was at war, or that a state of reprisals existed, for the instructions of Mr. Pickering, the Secretary of State, and the mouthpiece of the Government, entirely negative such a supposition. (Doc. 102, pp. 561 <em>et seq.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In the face of these statutes the seizure of a merchant vessel cannot be justified on the one ground that she was armed; and more especially is this true as to seizures during the period when these claims arose, a period when, to guard against the pirates of the Caribbean, of the Malay Archipelago, or of the Algerine coast, it was customary for merchant vesssls to carry ijome armament.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cThe\"laws of neutrality and nations, in no instance that I know of [says Judge Bee, in 1795, while holding the District Court of South Carolina], interdictneutral vessels from going to sea armed and fitted for defensive war. All American India.men are armed, and it is necessary they should be so. * * * When the wisdom of Congress substituted an embargo for a declaration of hostilities, preparations of this sort might have been seen in every State in the Union. From the instructions and circular letter to the different collectors, it was clear that the vessels of the belligerent powers alone were comprehended in the restrictions. Even they might arm for defense; and if, as respected French vessels, it should appear doubtful whether their equipment was applicable to war or commerce, such equipment was declared lawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Each case before the court must of course be examined separately upon the facts peculiar to it, and it is not impossible that such facts may be shown as to some of the private armed vessels of the United States as justified their seizure and condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The vessels whose cases are now decided were either unarmed or were armed for strictly defensive purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The jurisdictional act requires us to inquire into - illegal con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>detonations, and it is urged on behalf of the defendants that all condemnations by the French courts are final and conclusive upon this court if the French court had jurisdiction. Many citations are made in support of this contention, among them the case of <em>Baring and others </em>v. <em>The Royal Exchange Assurance Company </em>(5 East., 99 <em>et seq.), </em>which may be taken as a fair illustration.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The American ship Eosanna, insured by the defendants, was captured and condemned by the French, whereupon plaintiffs sued on the policy and recovered. Lord Ellenborough, Ch. J., interrupting the argument, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">\u201cDoes not this [French] sentence of condemnation proceed specifically on the ground of infraction of treaty between America and France in the ship not having those documents with which in the judgment of the French court the American was bound by treaty to be provided ? I do not say that they have construed the treaty rightly; on the contrary, suppose them to have construed it ever so iuiquitously; yet, having competent jurisdiction to construe the treaty, and having professed to do so, we [the court] are bound by that comity of nations which has always prevailed amongst civilized states to give credit to their adjudication where the same question arises here upon which the foreign court has decided. After arguing for hours, we must come to the same conclusion at last, that the French court has specifically condemned the vessel for an infraction of treaty which negatives the warranty of neutrality. Then, having distinctly adjudged the vessel to be good prize upon a ground within their jurisdiction, unless we deny their jurisdiction, we are bound to abide by that judgment. Whenever a case occurs of a condemnation by a foreign court on the ground of <em>ex parte </em>ordinances only, without drawing inferences from them to show an infraction of treaty between the nation of the captors and captured, and referring the judgment of the court to the breach of treaty, I shall be glad to hear the case argued, whether such ordinances are to be considered as furnishing rules of presumption only against the neutrality or as positive laws in themselves, binding other nations <em>proprio vigoreP</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The decision of the English court, then, goes to this extent, that in an action between individuals, the decree of the French court which had jurisdiction is final; so would it also be final as to the vessel, and the purchaser at the confiscation sale could rest upon the decree as good title against all the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">But all this does not affect the position of the United States Government against the Government of France.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Lord Ellenborough says that no matter how iniquitous the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>construction given the treaty by the French court, he, as a judge, is bound to follow it. But so is not the-Government of the United States. That Government could have objected either that the court was corrupt, or that there existed no treaty, or that there had been manifest error in construing it. All such questions may be outside the right of a court to consider, but they are within the right and form part of the duty of the political branch of the Government. If the French court, acting within its jurisdiction, construed the treaty iniquitously, the courts might not have power to remedy the wrong, but the owner had a right to appeal to his Government for redress, and that Government, when convinced of the justice of his complaint, was bound to endeavor to redress it.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The decree is an estoppel on the courts, but it is no estoppel on the Government; in fact, the right to'diplomatic interference arises only after the decree is rendered. Of course, precedents for cases of this kind are not to be found in the reports of courts, for no such case can, in the nature of things, come before a court unless by virtue of a special and peculiar statute, such as that under which we now act; but diplomatic history is full of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Butherforth (Institutes, vol. 2, ch. 9, p. 19), speaking of the right of a state to proceed in prize, says: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201cThis right of the state to which the captors belong to judge exclusively is not a complete jurisdiction. The captors, who are its own members, are bound to submit to its sentence, though this sentence should happen to be erroneous, because it has a complete jurisdiction over their persons. But the other parties in the controversy, as' they are members of another state, are only bound to submit to its sentence as far as this sentence is agreeable to the law of nations, or to particular treaties, because it has no jurisdiction over them in respect either of their persons or of the things that are the subject of the controversy. If justice, therefore, is not done them, they may apply to their own state for a remedy; which may consistently with the law of nations give them a remedy either by solemn war or by reprisals. (See Dana\u2019s Wheaton, 391.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">This brings us naturally to another point, admitted as a \u2022general principle, that appeal should be prosecuted to the court of last resort before there can be diplomatic intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The exceedingly able British-American Commission which, sat in Washington in 1872 not only unanimously decided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>they had jurisdiction in prize cases in which the decision of the ultimate appellate tribunal of the United States had been had, a conclusion in which even the agent of the United States concurred, but also that they had jurisdiction when the claimant had not pursued his remedy to the court of last resort, provided satisfactory reasons were given for the failure to appeal. (Papers relating to the Treaty of Washington, vol. 6, pp. 88-90.) To this last conclusion the American Commissioner dissented; but even he held that a misfeasance or default of the capturing Government, by which means an appeal was prevented, was sufficient to excuse the failure to appeal. (Id., 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The rights of the prize courts are the rights of the capturing-state. These courts are its agents, deputed by it to examine into the conduct of its own subjects before becoming answerable for what they have done, and the right ends when their conduct, has been thoroughly examined. Therefore the state has a right to require that the captor\u2019s acts be examined in all the ways which it has appointed for this purpose, and on this principle is founded the doctrine that the complainant, unless he exhaust his appeal, shall be held to confess the justice of the decision. This presupposes, first, that there are appellate courts; second, that they are open to the complainant freely and honestly. The captor has no right to insist for his own protection upon the fulfillment of a form which he by his own acts preven s.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">There is also a distinction, not often clearly drawn, between the validity of a claim <em>per se </em>and the right to enforcement. The justice of the claim is founded upon the injustice of the sentence. The appeal does not affect the merits of the claim; it does not palliate or destroy any wrong done; but it is simply a course provided for the captor\u2019s protection, that he may fully examine into the acts of his own agents, through his other agents, the courts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201c The whole proceeding, from the capture to the condemnation, is a compulsory proceeding <em>in invitum </em>by the state in its political capacity, in the exercise of war powers, for which it is responsible, as a body politic, to the state of which the owner of the property is a citizen.\u201d (Dana\u2019s Wheaton, note, 18G.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Therefore the capturing state may waive such a demand, and not insist upon exhausting its right to further investigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>and may waive it by failing to provide an appellate tribunal, or by preventing recourse to it, or in any other way which shows an intention not to insist upon this right of examination; but appeal or no appeal, the validity of the claim is founded upon the injustice to the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">All writers lay down the principle that appeal should be taken from the inferior to the superior tribunal before resort by the injured Government to measures of redress; but. this principle is always coupled with the extreme measures of war and reprisals (see Rutherforth, <em>supra; </em>Grotius, bk. 3, ch. 2, \u00a7\u00a7. 4, 5), and there is no assertion in the writers that illegal capture necessarily does not found an international claim even when appeal has not been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">It was notorious that justice could not be obtained in the French prize tribunals in existence at the time of those seizures. Mr. Pickering, writing to Mr. Pinckney in April, 1797, said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201cThe report of Mr. Mountflorence, which you transmitted, shows that the merchants in the ports of France who constitute the tribunal .of commerce in which our captured vessels are tried and, on the most frivolous and shameful pretenses, condemned, are often, if not commonly, owners of the privateers on whose prizes they decide.\u201d (Doc. 102, p. 165.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Consuls were at one time forbidden to appear before the tribunals in defense of absent owners. (Prizes Maritimes, vol. 2, pp. 317 <em>et seq.)</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Soon [says Cauchy], upon the occasion of the rupture with England, the signal was given for privateering. The French gave to it all that could encourage speculations half mercantile, half warlik; they put at the disposition of the owners part of the sailors of the fleet, even to strangers and neutrals ; they opened to them the storehouses of the state; they abandoned to the captors the total product of the captures, and they joined to that in certain cases premiums and rewards. They did more; they abolished with the offices of the admiralty the tribunal of prizes, and, in order to find judges more ready to sanction captures, they conferred upon the tribunals of commerce and of the district the judgment of these matters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">\u201c It was erroneously that they had represented the benefits of privateering as a source of riches and public prosperity. In order to make the fortunes of four or five ports, the privateers were reducing the whole of France, a country by nature agricultural aud industrial, so that she had neither raw materials for manufactures nor supplies for her navy, nor outlets for her products, for they kept away from our ports the neutral ves-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>seis which could alone supply the total absence of vessels sailing under the French flag.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">\u201cOn the other hand, were not the relations of the Republic with foreign Governments at the mercy of simple judges of commerce or of district, imprudently invested by the law with the terrible right to put France in a state of war against the wish and knowledge of her Government ? The Directory concluded that privateering, instead of receiving more extension and favor, ought to be restrained and regulated by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cBut this progress, forseen under the Directory, was not to be accomplished until after its fall. (Le Droit Maritime International, Eugene Cauchy, Paris, 1862, vol. 2, pp. 317, 318, 323-325.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">\u201cThe council of prizes, which was the supreme court of appeal in prize matters, was abolished in 1793. The 2!!th Germinal, year IV, the Council of Five Hundred passed a resolution thus expressed: \u2018The appeals from the tribunals of commerce in matters oft prize shall be carried to the tribunals of the departments.\u201d * * * Carried to the Council of the Ancients; this resolution was not opposed, and the 8th Flor\u00e9al, year IV, it was converted into law. One only remembers too well (adds M. Merlin) how disastrous were the results of this strange legislation. The tribunals paid no attention in their decrees to the relation of France with foreign powers, whence arose numerous and pressing claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">\u201cHowever, to palliate the political inconvenience that might flow from thus vesting ordinary tribunals with the cognizance of maritime prizes, it was thought sufficient to authorize the commissaries near the civil tribunals to refer to the Government those matters which necessitated the interpretation of treaties, and in which the judgments of the tribunals might compromise the rights .of a friendly or neutral power; but experience was not long in demonstrating that this palliation was a vain remedy, and that the legislation ought to be deeply modified, the tribunals having shown the greatest hostility against the measure, some determining in spite of it the causes which the commissaries had referred to the Executive Directory; others denying to the commissaries of the Government the right to judge alone of the propriety or necessity of the reference. Matters had come to such a point that in the year VIII the minister of justice, Cambac\u00e9res, being instructed by the Consuls as to the amendments to be made to the legislation as to prizes, was authorized to say \u2018 that privateering had become a system of brigandage, because the laws which had been applied to it were insufficient and bad; that they had heard complaints raised in all directions by merchants and foreign ministers, and that nevertheless the Government, convinced of the justice of these complaints, had always been without power to do right.\u2019\u201d (Trait\u00e9 de Prises, Maritimes pas Pistoye et Du-vardy, Paris, 1858, vol. 2, pp. 157, 158.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The form and expense of appeal were useless, for it was not denied that the adjudications below were in accordance with French ordinances, while it was contended that they were in violation of the rights of neutrals, measured either by treaty provision or by the precepts of the law of nations. Municipal law is not a measure of international responsibility, but it is binding within the jurisdiction of the state upon all its subordinate agents, including the courts. The decree in one of the cases before us, which was appealed to the civil tribunal, shows the following as the grounds for affirming- the condemnation below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">\u201cThe tribunal * * * considering the rules of 1704,1744, 1778, prior as well as subsequent to the treaty between France and the United States of America, emphatically demand that all foreign ships shall be furnished with a <em>rile, </em>authenticated by the public officers of the neutral port whence they have set out, under pain of being good prize. Considering' that the execution of these regulations has been ordered by article <em>5 of </em>the law of the 14th of February, 1793; considering that a ship, which cannot be reputed neutral on account of a lack of papers sufficient to prove its neutrality, cannot be regarded but as an enemy, and, being so, its cargo is to be confiscated, according to the terms of article 7 of the ordinance of the marine of 1681 \u2014 title prize \u2014 says that it has been well judged by the judgment which has been appealed from, ami orders that it shall have its full and entire effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">So it appears that questions of treaty or international law were not ruled upon, the court being guided alone by the statutes of France. In the face of precedents of this kind an appeal was a vain and expensive form, as an affirmation of the judgment -below necessarily must follow. The cases were class cases, the condemnations (so far as we have yet seen) proceeded upon substantially the same grounds, and one appeal was decisive of all similar cases. The state\u2019s right of investigation had therefore, in effect, been satisfied when it had affirmed in one case the legal principles applicable to many others presenting the same facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">There were appeals also to the court of cassation, which were decided adversely to the claimant \u2014 necessarily so decided when the character and duty of the court are understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">When the jurisdiction of the court of cassation is invoked there must take place a preliminary argument to determine whether the court under the particular facts of the case has or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>has not jurisdiction. This settled in the affirmative by one of the divisions of the court known as the chamber of requests, the cause is referred either to the chamber of civil causes, or to the chamber of criminal causes, and the jurisdiction of these chambers is simply to secure uniformity in the construction of the statutes. Merlin says :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">' \u201c As resource to the cassation is only an extreme remedy which has no other object than the maintenance of the legislative authority and of the ordinances, it cannot be made use of under the simple pretext that a case has been ill-judged in the main.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The opinion of the council of state, dated January 18, 1806, speaking of the court of cassation, says :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cIf the forms have been violated [below] there is no judgment, properly speaking, and the court of cassation destroys an irregular decree. If, on the contrary, all the forms have been observed, the judgment is reputed to be truth itself. * * * If, then, a decree should be in formal opposition to a written provision of the law, the presumption of its justice disappears, for the law is and ought to be the justice of the tribunals; wherefore the court of cassation has the right to annul in this case the decrees of the courts. (See Merlin, E\u00e9pertoire de J urisprudence.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">What, then, could be the object of an appeal to the court of cassation when the court below had not misinterpreted the French law, especially as such an appeal would in no event have suspended the execution of the judgment ? (Code, art. 16, title, Courts and tribunals (1790), Tripier\u2019s edition, 1865.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The condition of affairs in regard to French courts is well illustrated by the letter from Pinckney, Marshall, and Gerry to the Secretary of State (October 22, 1797, Doc. 102, p. 467), wherein they quote their advocate as saying: \u201c It is obvious that the tribunal have received instructions from the officers of the Government to hasten their decisions, and that it was hardly worth while to plead, for all our petitions in cassation would be rejected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">In the colonies matters were still worse than in France (Tuck\u2019s Eeport, and citations therein, EL B. Ex. Doc. 194, 49th Cong. 1st sess.) and appeals were much more difficult. After the decision of a court, organized in some instances for the purpose of condemnation, by an officer of the Government, himself interested in privateers, or in some instances after a decision by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>that officer in person (id, p. 9), the only remedy was to obtain an appeal to the mother country. This trouble and expense were practically useless (see in this relation Skipwith to Berlier, Doc. 102, pp. 833, 834). Communication between France and the colonies was difficult; the masters of the seized vessels were poor and were often stripped by the privateers of what little they had.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The condition of French prize tribunals was so notorious as to cause a change in admiralty law, the reasons for which were thus expressed by Lord Stowell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201c It has certainly been the practice of this court, lately, to grant salvage on recapture of neutral property out of the hands of the French, and I see no reason at the present moment to depart from it. I know perfectly well that it is not the modern practice of the law of nations to grant salvage on recapture of neutral vessels, and upon this plain principle, that the liberation of a clear neiitral from the hand of the enemy is no essential service rendered to him, inasmuch as that sa,me enemy would be compelled by the tribunals of his own country, after he had carried the neutral into port, to release him, with costs and damages for the injurious seizure and detention. This proceeds upon the supposition that those tribunals would duly respect the obligations of the law of nations ; a presumption which, in the wars of civilized nations, each belligerent is bound to entertain in their respective dealings with neutrals. But it being notorious to all Europe,- in the present war, that there has been a constant struggle maintained between the governing powers of France, for the time being, and its maritime tribunals, which should most outrage the rights of neutral property \u2014 the one by its decrees, or the other by its decisions \u2014 the liberation of neutral property out of their possession has been deemed, not only in the judgment of our courts, but in that of neutrals themselves, a most substantial benefit conferred upon them, in .a delivery from danger against which no clearness and innocence of conduct could afford any protection. And a salvage for such service has not only been decreed, but thankfully paid, ever since these wild hostilities have been declared and practiced by France, against all acknowledged principles of the law of nations and of natural justice. When these lawless and irregular practices are shown to have ceased, the rule of paying salvage for the liberation of neutral property must cease likewise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201c No proof is offered that the maritime tribunals of France have, in any degree, corrected either the spirit or the form of their proceedings respecting neutral property generally; and, therefore, I shall not think myself authorized to depart from the practice that has been pursued, of awarding a salvage to the captors. <em>(The Onskan, </em>2 Robinson, 300, 301.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>And later he said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">&lt;! It is certainly true that the standing doctrine of the court has been that neutral property, taken out of the possession of the enemy, is not liable to salvage., It is the doctrine to which the court has invariably adhered till it was forced out of its course by the notorious irregularities of the French cruisers- and of the French Government, which proceeded, without any pretense of sanction from the law of nations, to condemn neutral property. On these grounds it was deemed not unreasonable by neutrals themselves that salvage should be paid for a deliverance from French capture. The rule obtained early in the war, and has continued to the present time. It is said that-a great alteration has taken place in the French proceedings, and that we are now to acknowledge a,sort of return of \u201c <em>Satur* nia </em>Reyna,.\u201d This court is not informed, in a satisfactory manner, that any such beneficial change has taken place in the administration of prize law in the tribunals of France; and, therefore, it will continue to make the same decree till the instructions of the superior court shall establish a different rule. <em>(.Eleonora, Oatharina, </em>4 Fob., 157.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">It is important to note that during the period of these seizures neither the Government of the United States, which consistently supported the claimants\u2019 contentions, nor the Government of France, from whom we were demanding redress, indicated the necessity of the form of appeal, nor later did the French, even in the long negotiations in which the validity of these claims was a principal subject of discussion, intimate in any way that they considered the appeal of importance or that they required it.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">We conclude, therefore, that under these exceptional circumstances a claim properly founded in law is not excluded from our jurisdiction because the supposed remedy by appeal was not exhausted, and this we hold upon two principal grounds: First, that by the action of the French Government such an appeal was useless or impracticable; second, that as between the United States and France such an appeal as a condition precedent to recovery was in effect waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The decree condemningthe Industry proceeds upon the theory that the vessel\u2019s <em>role $ equipage </em>was not in the form said to be required by article 25 of the treaty of February 6,1778, and also said to be required by certain French decrees declaring to be good and lawful prize every American vessel not having a <em>role </em>in a form prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Colloquially a <em>role d\u2019\u00e9quipage </em>is usually treated as a crew list, whereas in French law it is a more formal paper, with more extended requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">To the first of the propositions contained in the court\u2019s decree a very clear answer is found in the fact that the treaty does not demand, as we have already decided, that a crew list of any kind be carried on the vessel. Article 25 of that instrument calls for a \u201cletter or passport expressing the name, property, and bulk of the ship, as also the name and place of habitation of the master or commander of the said ship, that it may appear thereby that the ship really and truly belongs to the subjects of one of jhe parties; \u201d this passport to follow a form annexed to the treaty. The ship was also to have a certificate as to cargo, showing she was not carrying contraband; but this certificate is not brought in question in these cases. The treaty therefore required two documents: First, a passport; second, a certificate as to cargo. The form of passport annexed to the treaty runs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\u201cThe name of the master and the name, hailing port, and tonnage of the vessel are given, together with the name of the port in which she is lying, as well as that of the port to which she is bound; the general nature of her cargo is described, and it is made known and certified that permission has been given the master to proceed after he shall make oath that the vessel belongs to one or more American citizens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Up to this point, therefore, the passport\u2019s requirement is a description of the vessel and cargo, with the name of the master and a sworn statement as to the citizenship of the owners. Up to this point also the document follows exactly article 25 of the treaty, contains everything demanded by that article, and we are informed that it was the custom of the United States in the English version of the passport to halt at this point, while the versions in foreign languages contained the concluding portion, which we are now about to consider. ' (See original sea-letter of the Zebra; claim allowed under treaty of 1831; original MSS. Department of State.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The master \u201c will,\u201d it says further, keep the marine ordinances on board, in every port he \u201cshall\u201d show his sea-letter, \u201cshall\u201d give a faithful account of his voyage, and \u201cshall\u201d carry the colors of his country; and he shall (or will) enter in the proper office (remettra) what: \u2014 \u201ca list, signed and witnessed, containing the names and surnames, the places of birth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>abode of the crew of his ship and of all who shall embark on board her, whom he shall not take on board without the knowledge and permission of the officers of the marine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">There is no requirement here that the master shall carry on his vessel the document described, be it <em>role d\u2019\u00e9quipage </em>or crew list. The demand of this clause is that such a document be deposited or filed <em>(remis) </em>in a proper place, and whether this be done before or after the passport issue is not material. That instrument simply declares that such a list has been, or \u25a0at least will be, before sailing properly filed, not carried. (Doc. 102, pp. 467 and 564; 2 Prises Maritimes, 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The provision of Article IX of the treaty of 1788, relating as it does to consular rights in the arrest of deserting seamen, has no bearing upon this question. A semi-extraterritorial power is by that instrument given to French consular officers, and a way strictly marked out in which they shall pursue it; to arrest a deserter they must show him to be part of the vessel\u2019s crew, and this they must do by exhibiting \u201c the registers of the vessel or ship\u2019s roll.\u201d This is a specific agreement relating to a specific subject, and has no reference to condemnations.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Industry was -not condemned because the crew list had not been filed in the home port, but because the <em>rdle d\u2019\u00e9gtiipage </em>was not in form. The careful study and patient research of Government counsel have failed to develop any treaty requirement that such a document be carried on board the vessel, while the United States Government constantly and most peremptorily insisted that during all the period now under discussion the French demand was illegal and unauthorized by treaty or other law. The Pinckney mission told M. Bellamy in October, 1787 (Doc. 102, pp. 466,467), that none of our vessels had such a <em>role j </em>and that if they were to surrender the property taken from their fellow-citizens in cases where the vessel was not furnished with such a <em>role </em>the United States would become responsible for the property so surrendered, as \u201cit would be impossible to undertake to assert that there was any plausibility in the allegation that our treaty required a <em>role \u00daJ\u00e9quigiageP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Pickering\u2019s interesting instructions to the Ellsworth mission, dated October 22,1799 (Doc. 102, p. 561), contain a very definite statement of the position of the Government on this subject. He lays down as\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201cAn indispensable condition of the [proposed] treaty a stipulation to make to tbe citizens of the United States full compensation for all losses and damages which they shall have sustained by reason of irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of their vessels and other property. And all captures and condemnations are deemed irregular or illegal when contrary to the law of nations generally received and acknowledged in Europe, and to the stipulations in the treaty of amity and commerce of the 6th of February, 1778, fairly and ingenuously interpreted while that treaty remained in force, especially when made and pronounced:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u201c(1) Because the vessel\u2019s lading, or any part thereof, consisted of provisions or merchandise coming from England or her possessions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\"><em>u(2) </em>Because the vessels were not provided with the <em>roles Wequipage </em>prescribed by the laws of France, and which it has been pretended were also required by treaty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201c(3) Because sea-letters or other papers were wanting, or said to be wanting, when the property shall have been, or shall be, admitted or proved to be American. Such defect of papers, though it might justify the captors and exempt them from damages for bringing in such vessels for examination, could not with reason be a ground of condemnation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Further on in the instruction Mr. Pickering says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">\u201cThere never was, indeed, any intimation on the part of France from 1778, when the treaty of amity and commerce was made, until the passing of the decree of the Directory,in March, 1797, that a <em>role d\u2019\u00e9quipage, </em>other than the ship\u2019s roll or the shipping papers [see act 1790], would be required. It was then suddenly demanded, and the decree * * * was instantly enforced and became a snare to.the multitudes of American vessels, which, for want of previous notice, would not have on board the document in question, if their Government should permit them to receive a document which they were under no obligation to produce. For it cannot with any semblance of justice be pretended that the vessels of one nation are bound to furnish themselves with papers in forms prescribed by the laws of another. And if we resort to the treaty of 1778, or to the sea-letter or passport annexed to it, on which letter the Directory pretended to found their decree concerning the <em>role di equipage, </em>we shall see that these words are not to be found in either.\u201d (Id., 564.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">For the purpose of argument, however, we may for the moment admit the French contention in this matter \u2014 a contention now adopted by the defense \u2014 and concede that, by relation back through the passport to the twenty-fifth article of the treaty of 1878, it became the duty of the vessel\u2019s master not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>to file a crew list at the port of departure, but to carry on his vessel a <em>r\u00f3le d\u2019\u00e9quipage </em>drawn and certified in accordance with the ordinances and decrees of France, and not necessarily in accordance with the statutes of the United States, to which country his vessel belonged and of which country he was a citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The position being admitted, we must consider the amount of penalty which the vessel is to suffer if such a <em>role </em>be lacking. What penalty does the treaty impose? That instrument says nothing about a <em>r\u00f3le </em>or crew list, but demands a passport, which latter document it is urged requires the presence of a <em>r\u00f3le </em>on the vessel; the treaty penalty, therefore, for the lack of this <em>r\u00f3le, </em>not mentioned in the body of the instrument, cannot be greater than the penalty for the lack of the passport which is there mentioned. The object of the passport provision is clearly to be gathered from the wording of the treaty: \u201cTo the end that all manner of dissensions and quarrels may be avoided and prevented,\u201d the twenty-fifth article, it is provided that when either party is at war the vessels of the other shall be furnished with passports describing the name, property, and bulk of the ship, together with the name and abode of the master, so that it may appear that the vessel \u201c really and truly belongs to the subjects of one of the parties.\u201d Such is the substance of the twenty-fifth article, whos\u00e9 object as clearly expressed is not to affix penalties, but to avoid \u201c dissensions and quarrels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The twenty-seventh article provides, that if a merchant ship of either party meet a man-of-war or privateer of the other, the armed ship, \u201cfor the avoiding of any disorder,\u201d shall remain out of cannon-shot, send boats to the merchantman; put no more than two or three men on board, to whom the master shall show his passport; having done which he may pursue his voyage, and the vessel may not be molested or searched in any manner, nor chased, nor forced out of her course. The passport, then, being given for the purpose of preventing \u201c dissensions and quarrels,\u201d is by virtue of its presence alone to free the ship from search, chase, or forced deviation. No penalty is affixed for the lack of this passport other than what may be inferred, as, for example, that without it she would be liable to detention and search, and possibly to investigation by a prize court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>or other competent tribunal as to the honesty of her character and the innocence of her voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">No treaty penalty being affixed for the absence of a definitely prescribed document, how can one be held to exist for the absence of a subsidiary document which the treaty does not require the master to exhibit, even if its presence on board be necessary ? An American vessel boarded by a French officer need only, so says article 27, do one thing, need only show one paper, to wit, his passport <em>\u2022, </em>this done, he may immediately proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">No rule of international law has been called to our attention, and none is known to us, which, in the absence of specific agreement to the contrary, requires the presence on vessels of any particular document. Some papers undoubtedly should be carried for protection; that is, carried for the benefit of the ship, to divert suspicion, to avoid detention and delay, and to afford at least <em>prima facie </em>proof that she is what she pretends to be, an innocent vessel engaged in legitimate business. The nature and character of ships\u2019 papers is, however, usually a matter of municipal regulation to which foreign vessels must conform or incur certain reasonable penalties, enforceable within the territorial jurisdiction of the enacting Government. Many examples of municipal acts of this nature may be found in our own statute books.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Speaking, generally, however, aside from local regulations not enforceable by the Government of one nation over the vessels of another on the high seas, the class and kind of papers to be carried by a merchantman are prescribed by his own Government, and as between him and a foreign vessel of war these papers ar <em>prima facie </em>proof of innocence and honesty ; but as they are not conclusive on these points, so is their absence no more than the foundation of a reasonable suspicion deserving-inquiry into the true character of the vessel and voyage. (See, also, Merlin, 2 Frises Maritimes, 51.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201cIt is of the highest importance [says Ortolan] that a vessel be in position to prove her nationality. The flag- is the distinctive evident sign of the vessel\u2019s national character. Every state has its particular colors under which its citizens sail. * * * But this distinctive sign cannot be the only one, for if it were it would be easy to disguise the nationality of a vessel. Therefore, to provide clear proof of this nationality, ships\u2019 papers or sea-letters are required, with which every merchant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>man should he provided. The number, nature, and form of these papers are regulated by the law of each country, usually through the provisions of codes of maritime commerce. (R\u00e9-gles Internationales et Diplomatic de la Mer. Ortolan, vol. 1, p. 174.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\u201cThe right to visit [says Hautefeuille] must be confined to an ascertainment through examination of official papers of the nationality of the vessel met, and also in case she is bound to an enemy\u2019s port, whether faithful to her duty she carries no arms or munitions of war; that is, that she is not guilty of interference in the hostilities. These two single points ascertained, and that only by documents coming from the neutral sovereign, or his delegates, the cruiser should retire and allow the vessel, now recognized as neutral, to continue her voyage.\u201d (Hautefeuille, vol. 3, p. 428; Parsons-Shipping, vol. 2, pp. 475-477.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The lack of a particular ship\u2019s paper may be punishable under certain circumstances within local jurisdiction as a police measure, but never, so far as we know, by absolute confiscation when it is shown that the vessel is innocently pursuing a legitimate voyage. An accident is easily supposable by which, after leaving port, and while on the high seas, all the papers of a ship may by fire or water be destroyed. On that account is she to be confiscated ? We know of no rule of law, municipal or international, which would authorize such a course.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The Industry, it is said, did not have a proper <em>role \u00bfV equipage. </em>The treaty did not require any,, or, if it did, then it punished the lack of the <em>role </em>by detention, search, and inconvenience only. The crew list is a paper usually carried on a merchant vessel, but its absence is not, by internaSonal law, punishable by confiscation.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">After all the discussion between the two Governments in regard to the <em>role W equipage, </em>we find in article 4 of the treaty of 1800 provision for a passport identical in form with that of 1778, which could only have been so therein inserted because both Governments had agreed upon what had always been contended for by the United-States, and finally admitted by France, that this form imposed upon the shipmaster no obligation to carry on board his vessel the document technically known to the French law as a <em>role eVequipage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">That France came openly to this position is shown by various cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">In the case of the Louise (13 Thermidor, year IX) the council of prizes decided, that the laws of France relative to <em>r\u00f3les </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>d\u2019\u00e9quipage </em>should not be applied to foreign ships, it being sufficient that their <em>r\u00f3les </em>conformed to the laws of their own country. (Trait\u00e9 des Prises Maritimes, Pistoye et Duverdy, vol. 1, p. 484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In the cases of the Elizabeth (17 Pluviose, year VII) and of Les deux Amis (3 Messidor, year VIII) it was held that even a failure to produce a proper passport or sea-letter did not warrant condemnation if the neutrality of the vessel sufficiently appeared from other papers or indicia on board. (Id., pp. 439, 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The commissioner of the French Government very thoroughly presented this whole question in the case of the P\u00e9gou, on trial before the council of prizes. (Trait\u00e9 des Prises Mari-times, Pistoye et Duverdy, vol. 2, pp. 51 <em>et seq.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Among other things, he said that certainly the regulations of 1744 and 1778 and the orders of the Directory required <em>ar\u00f3le </em>d\u2019\u00e9quipage, certified by public officers at the port of departure. Certainly, also, the <em>role W\u00e9qulpage </em>is not set forth in the treaty of 1778 as among the documents required to show neutrality. Whether the treaty or the French decrees should prevail he does not decide, but starting with the principle that all questions of neutrality are questions of good faith, in which actual facts, not simply appearances, must be examined, he holds that the absence of a required document or an irregularity in form does not authorize condemnation-as prize. The truth must be sought, and that not by technical forms j simply omissions or irregularities should never obscure the truth if it be otherwise proved. The essential question is, whether the ship is or is not in fact neutral. It is not of importance that legislators have thought it their duty to require the presentation of particular papers ,\u2022 the severity of the legislators is always subordinate to the surrounding circumstances which alone lead to conviction. The neutrality should be proved, but this may be done notwithstanding the omission or irregularity of certain forms. On the other hand, fraud may be uncovered, though sought to be concealed under deceiving appearance. All thorns and all subtleties of law must be thrown aside \u201c <em>il faut proc\u00e9der par bonne et mure d\u00e9Ub\u00e9ration et y regarder par la conscience.\u201d </em>And the court followed his advice thus officially given.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">We are irresistibly forced to the conclusion that a condena-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>nation based simply on the absence of a <em>role d\u2019\u00e9quipage </em>or upon its informality was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We do not, however, hold that the absence or informality of a ship\u2019s paper may not create a suspicion calling for explanation, or that its absence or informality may not, in connection with other evidence, give good ground for investigation and suitable punishment. The cases now before us do not present this issue. In the case of the Industry, Benjamin Hawkes, master, for example, there is no allegation in the decree of the tribunal, nor is there anything in the proceedings tending to show that she was not what she pretended to be, an American vessel owned by citizens of the United States, honestly pursuing a legitimate and peaceful voyage. The grounds of condemnation were solely that the <em>role d\u2019\u00e9quipage </em>which the vessel had on board was not in form, being signed only by one notary public \u201cwithout the confirmation of witnesses,\u201d and there being written on the back of said r\u00f3l\u00e9 an unsigned certificate that a <em>r\u00e9le d\u2019\u00e9quipage </em>was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">It will probably become important to consider in the future the proposition of the defense that the captured vessel is required to prove her innocence \u2014 that is, that the <em>onus probmdi </em>rests upon her in prize proceedings. In this case, however, there is no allegation that the vessel was violating neutrality or violating any law of nations or any law of France, other than that which demanded a <em>r\u00f3le d\u2019\u00e9quipage </em>in a prescribed form. Consideration of this question is therefore reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Some of the points presented in the argument we do not consider more in detail, as they have either been discussed by us before, or, in our judgment, are decided in the conclusions we have reached upon other contentions to which they are subordinate.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">We thank counsel, both those representing the claimants and those who appeared in behalf of the Government, for the valuable assistance they have rendered the court by the thorough presentation of the many and complicated questions involved in these cases. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
