On appeal, the Guer-ras challenge the bankruptcy court and district court\u2019s determination that the debt in issue is dischargeable in bankruptcy. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">\n<em>A. Death of Veronica Guerra</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">This appeal arises out of the tragic 1996 death of the Guerras\u2019 newborn daughter, Veronica Guerra. During Mrs. Guerra\u2019s pregnancy, the Guerras had agreed with the Debtor that he would deliver their baby. They further agreed that, in the event the Debtor was unable to deliver the Guerras\u2019 baby, one of his partners would attend to the birth and Dr. Lourdes Ramon, a junior associate of the Debtor\u2019s, would not be involved. Nevertheless, when Mrs. Guerra was admitted to the hospital, Dr. Ramon attended to the birth. According to the Guerras, as a result of Dr. Ramon\u2019s negligence, Veronica Guerra sustained injuries during the delivery and died eleven days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">\n<em>B. State Court Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">In Florida state court, the Guerras filed a malpractice action against both the Debt- or and Dr. Ramon. On February 13, 2004, the jury in the state court action returned a verdict in favor of the Guerras and against the Debtor and Dr. Ramon. Specifically, the jury found: (1) that Dr. Ramon\u2019s negligence caused Veronica Guerra\u2019s death; (2) that there was no negligence by the Debtor with regard to Veronica Guerra\u2019s death; but (3) that the Debtor\u2019s breach of contract was a legal cause of Veronica Guerra\u2019s death. The jury awarded the Guerras $4.2 million, and the Florida state court entered final judgment against the Debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">\n<em>C.Bankruptcy Case and Adversary Proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">Meanwhile, on December 1, 2000, the Debtor had filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d). On February 26, 2001, the Guer-ras filed in the bankruptcy case an adversary proceeding against the Debtor. The Guerras\u2019 adversary complaint asserted that, pursuant to Florida Statutes \u00a7 458.320, the Debtor was obligated to establish a fund to pay claims arising out of his rendering of, or failure to render, medical care and services, and that the Debtor had a fiduciary duty to his patients to maintain a claims fund of $250,000 per claim or $750,000 in the aggregate. The Guerras alleged that the Debtor had not established the required fund and thus would not be able to pay the malpractice judgment against him. The Guerras essentially alleged that they had a non-dis-chargeable claim against the Debtor for the amount of the required claims fund to apply to the malpractice award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-15\">More specifically, the Guerras asserted that their claim was non-dischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(4). Section 523(a)(4) provides that debts \u201cfor fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity\u201d are non-dischargeable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>On March 21, 2001, the bankruptcy court entered an order abating the adversary proceeding pending the resolution of the state court litigation. On September 9, 2002, the Debtor filed a motion to dismiss the Guerras\u2019 adversary complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The Debtor argued, <em>inter aUty </em>that Florida Statutes \u00a7 458.320 is a regulatory statute and does not create a fiduciary duty or any technical trust between the Debtor and the Guerras, and thus the \u00a7 523(a)(4) exception to discharge does not apply to any debt between the Debtor and the Guerras.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a hearing, the bankruptcy court granted the Debtor\u2019s motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">The Guerras appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal to the district court, and the district court affirmed. The Guerras now appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">The Florida Financial Responsibility Act, Florida Statutes \u00a7 458.320, requires that to obtain a license a physician must maintain <em>either </em>malpractice insurance, <em>or </em>a letter of credit payable to the physician, <em>or </em>an escrow account of his own funds to demonstrate his financial responsibility in the event of a malpractice award against him. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 458.320(1). As did the bankruptcy court and the district court, we accept the allegations of the Guerras\u2019 adversary complaint as true and will assume that the Debtor failed to comply with his obligations under \u00a7 458.320 and that there is no claims fund, malpractice insurance, or letter of credit to satisfy a portion of the Guerras\u2019 $4.2 million judgment against the Debtor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-12\">Further, the Guerras\u2019 adversary complaint is not based on the Debtor\u2019s failure to obtain malpractice insurance or provide a letter of credit, but is based solely on the Debtor\u2019s not having established a claims fund under \u00a7 458.320 that could then be used to pay the Guerras\u2019 malpractice judgment. Thus, the only issue in this appeal is whether the Debtor\u2019s failure to maintain the claims fund under \u00a7 458.320 created a debt that falls within the \u00a7 523(a)(4) exception to discharge for debts for \u201cdefalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity.\u201d We first review prior judicial interpretation of the \u00a7 523(a)(4) exception and then apply it to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">\n<em>A. Non-dischargeable Debts Under \u00a7 523(a) (t\u00ed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">An individual debtor\u2019s pre-bank-ruptcy debts, including malpractice debts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>are generally dischargeable in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, and exceptions to discharge are construed narrowly. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a), (b); <em>Equitable Bank v. Miller (In re Miller), </em>39 F.3d 301, 304 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201c[C]ourts generally construe the statutory exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy liberally in favor of the debtor and recognize that the reasons for denying a discharge must be real and substantial, not merely technical and conjectural.\u201d) (quotation marks, citations, and punctuation omitted); <em>see also R.E. Am., Inc. v. Garver (In re Garver), </em>116 F.3d 176, 179 n. 6 (6th Cir.1997) (noting that all types of professional malpractice claims generally are dis-chargeable under the Bankruptcy Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">Although \u00a7 523(a)(4) establishes an exception to dischargeability for debts for \u201cdefalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,\u201d this exception is a narrow one. \u201cThe Supreme Court has consistently held that the term \u2018fiduciary\u2019 is not to be construed expansively, but instead is intended to refer to \u2018technical\u2019 trusts.\u201d <em>Quaif v. Johnson, 4 </em>F.3d 950, 953 (11th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Davis v. Aetna Acceptance Co., </em>293 U.S. 328, 55 S.Ct. 151, 79 L.Ed. 393 (1934), and other Supreme Court cases interpreting previous versions of the \u00a7 523(a)(4) exception, but noting that all versions have referred to \u201cdefalcation\u201d and to \u201cfiduciary capacity\u201d or \u201cfiduciary character\u201d); <em>see Commonwealth Land Title Co. v. Blaszak (In re Blaszak), </em>397 F.3d 386, 391 (6th Cir.2005) (noting that the term \u201cfiduciary capacity\u201d is construed more narrowly in the context of \u00a7 523(a)(4) than in other circumstances); <em>see also Lee-Benner v. Gergely (In re Gergely), </em>110 F.3d 1448, 1450-51 (9th Cir.1997) (noting that the doctor-patient relationship does not create a fiduciary relationship for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">In <em>Quaif, </em>this Court further noted that the 1934 <em>Davis </em>decision is the last Supreme Court case to speak to the issue and that the Supreme Court has left \u201cthe lower courts to struggle with the concept of \u2018technical\u2019 trusts.\u201d <em>Quaif, 4 </em>F.3d at 953. <em>Quaif </em>also discussed the trends in judicial interpretation of the \u00a7 523(a)(4) exception and noted that courts seemed to include the voluntary, express trust created by contract within the scope of \u201cfiduciary capacity\u201d as used in \u00a7 523(a)(4). <em>Id. </em>In contrast, courts have excluded the involuntary resulting or constructive trust, created by operation of law, from the scope of the exception. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, <em>Quaif </em>noted that cases have \u201calso articulated a requirement that the trust relationship have existed prior to the act which created the debt in order to fall within the statutory [fiduciary capacity] exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Matter of Angelle, </em>610 F.2d 1335 (5th Cir.1980)). Accordingly, \u201cconstructive\u201d or \u201cresulting\u201d trusts, which generally serve as a remedy for some dereliction of duty in a confidential relationship, do not fall within the \u00a7 523(a)(4) exception \u201cbecause the act which created the debt <em>simultaneously </em>created the trust relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Even if a fiduciary relationship exists prior to the act that created the debt, the next question under \u00a7 523(a)(4) is whether there was a \u201cdefalcation\u201d while acting in a fiduciary capacity. In <em>Quaif, </em>this Court further explained that \u201c \u2018[defalcation\u2019 refers to a failure to produce funds entrusted to a fiduciary,\u201d but that \u201cthe precise meaning of \u2018defalcation\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4) has never been entirely clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 955. <em>Quaif </em>observed that the best analysis of \u201cdefalcation\u201d is that of Judge Learned Hand in <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Herbst, </em>93 F.2d 510 (2d Cir.1937), in which \u201cJudge Hand concluded that while a purely innocent mistake by the fiduciary may be dischargeable, a \u2018defalcation\u2019 for purposes of this statute does not have to rise to the level of \u2018fraud,\u2019 \u2018embezzlement,\u2019 or even \u2018misappropriation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quaif, 4 </em>F.3d at 955 (citing <em>Central Hanover, </em>93 F.2d at 512). Indeed, \u201c[s]ome cases have read the term even more broadly, stating that even a purely innocent party can be deemed to have committed a defalcation for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Additionally, <em>Quaif </em>observed that statutorily created trusts \u201cfit into neither of the traditional categories\u201d of express trust or resulting or constructive trust and that courts had struggled with reconciling this new type of trust. <em>Id. </em>at 953-54. In <em>Quaif, </em>this Court addressed a Georgia statute, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-23-79, which required that premiums received by an insurance agent \u201cshall be accounted for <em>in his fiduciary capacity, </em>shall not be commingled with his personal funds, and shall be promptly accounted for and paid to the insurer, insured, or agent as entitled to such funds.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The <em>Quaif </em>court concluded that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-23-79, which expressly stated that premiums were held by an agent in his fiduciary capacity, created fiduciary duties on the part of the agent for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4). <em>Quaif, 4 </em>F.3d at 953-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">We now apply these general \u00a7 523(a)(4) principles to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">\n<em>B. Guerras\u2019Adversary Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">The Guerras do not contend that a physician-patient relationship creates fiduciary duties or that malpractice debts are generally non-dischargeable. Rather, they contend that the Debtor owed his patients a fiduciary duty, created by the Florida Financial Responsibility Act, Florida Statutes \u00a7 458.320, to maintain funds to satisfy malpractice debts. The Guerras argue that the Debtor breached that fiduciary duty by failing to maintain those funds and that the Guerras have a non-dischargeable claim against the Debtor for the amount of the required fund to pay their malpractice award. Thus, we examine whether \u00a7 458.320 creates a fiduciary duty or technical trust between the Debtor and the Guerras or even any debt between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">\u201cAs a condition of licensing and maintaining an active [medical] license,\u201d \u00a7 458.320 requires that a physician \u201cmust by one of the following methods demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board and the department financial responsibility to pay claims and costs ancillary thereto arising out of the rendering of, or failure to render, medical care or services\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-13\">(a) Establishing and maintaining an escrow account consisting of cash and assets eligible for deposit ... in the per claim amounts specified in paragraph (b)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>(b) Obtaining and maintaining professional liability coverage in an amount not less than $100,000 per claim, with a minimum annual aggregate of not less than $300,000 .... [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-4\">(c) Obtaining and maintaining an unexpired, irrevocable letter of credit, established pursuant to chapter 675, in an amount not less than $100,000 per claim, with a minimum aggregate availability of credit of not less than $300,000. The letter of credit must be payable to the physician as beneficiary upon presentment of a final judgment indicating liability and awarding damages to be paid by the physician or upon presentment of a settlement agreement ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 458.320(1). Thus, to obtain a medical license, \u00a7 458.320(1) requires that a physician maintain either an escrow account, professional liability coverage, or a letter of credit in an amount of $100,000 per claim with a minimum aggregate of $300,000. <em>Id. </em>As to physicians who have hospital staff privileges, such as the Debt- or here, \u00a7 458.320(2) increases those amounts to $250,000 per claim or $750,000 in the aggregate. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 458.320(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">On appeal, there is no dispute that the Debtor was required by Florida law to maintain an escrow fund, or malpractice coverage, or a letter of credit; nor is there any dispute that he failed to do so. However, for several reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 458.320 does not create a fiduciary duty or technical trust or even a debt between the Debtor and the Guerras for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">First, \u00a7 458.320 is a regulatory statute requiring that the Debtor demonstrate financial responsibility to the State to maintain his license and hospital staff privileges. It even offers physicians three options, including maintaining an escrow fund, to demonstrate financial responsibility. The statute does not create a relationship, much less a contractual or fiduciary duty or a technical trust between a physician and a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">Second, even to the extent a physician opts to create such a claims fund to satisfy the statute, the statute doe's not use the term \u201cfiduciary capacity,\u201d nor does it require a doctor to place funds \u201cin trust\u201d for the benefit of third party patients. The statute does not require the physician to hold and account for the funds to third party patients. The statute does not create any property right in a doctor\u2019s escrow fund in favor of a patient. Rather, the stated purpose of \u00a7 458.320 is to require physicians to \u201cdemonstrate to the satisfaction of the board and the department financial responsibility to pay claims and costs\u201d arising out of medical care. Put simply, \u00a7 458.320 requires that a physician demonstrate financial responsibility to the appropriate state licensing authorities through certain means, but it does not create in malpractice victims an entitlement to those means. <em>See Hanft v. Church (In re Hanft), </em>315 B.R. 617, 624 (S.D.Fla.2002) (\u201cPlainly, the ultimate purpose of [\u00a7 458.320] is to ensure that patients will be reimbursed for successful malpractice claims, but that does not mean that the patients are \u2018identifiable beneficiaries\u2019 as required for creation of a technical trust.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Third, \u201c[t]he definition of \u2018defalcation\u2019 as \u2018a failure to produce funds entrusted to a fiduciary,\u2019 <em>Quaif, </em>4 F.3d at 955, further compels the conclusion that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 458.320 does not create a fiduciary duty, because no funds are \u2018entrusted\u2019 to a doctor under the statute.\u201d <em>Hanft, </em>315 B.R. at 624. No funds were entrusted to the Debtor, and thus no fiduciary duty could be created with regard to entrusted funds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">The Guerras rely heavily on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Quaif </em>for the proposition that statutes such as \u00a7 458.320 create fiduciary duties. However, the Guerras\u2019 argument is misplaced. As noted earlier, the Georgia statute at issue in <em>Quaif </em>explicitly stated that agents were to hold and account for premiums in a fiduciary capacity. Here, as explained. above, nothing in \u00a7 458.320 suggests that any funds required to be maintained would be held in a fiduciary capacity. Nothing in \u00a7 458.320 requires the physician to perform any accounting to patients of any funds held to satisfy the \u00a7 458.320 regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Accordingly, the district court and bankruptcy court did not err in concluding that the Guerras\u2019 claim against the Debtor based on his failure to comply with \u00a7 458.320 falls outside the defalcation exception to discharge set forth in \u00a7 523(a)(4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of the Guerras\u2019 adversary complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">. Section 523(a)(4) provides: \"A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt \u2014 (4) for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">. The Debtor also argued that Florida Statutes \u00a7 458.320 did not apply because the Gu-erras\u2019 verdict against him was for breach of contract and not negligence. However, the bankruptcy court rejected this argument, and the Debtor does not raise this issue in this appeal. Thus, we will assume that the Guer-ras\u2019 $4.2 million judgment against the Debtor for breach of contract would fall within the \"rendering of, or failure to render, medical care and services\u201d language of \u00a7 458.320.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1050-16\">. In an appeal from a district court sitting as an appellate court in a bankruptcy case, this Court employs the same standards of review as the district court. <em>IBT Int'l, Inc. v. Northern (In re Int\u2019l Admin. Servs., Inc.), </em>408 F.3d 689, 698 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim, and like the bankruptcy court, we must accept the allegations in the adversary complaint as true and construe the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Hoffend v. Villa (In re Villa), </em>261 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir.2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>except such as ... were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity.\u201d Bankruptcy Act of 1898, \u00a7 17(a)(4), 52 Stat. 840, 851, formerly codified at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(4) (repealed 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">. In a similar vein, in evaluating the predecessor to \u00a7 523(a)(4), the Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>stated: \"It is not enough that by the very act of wrongdoing out of which the contested debt arose, the bankrupt has become chargeable as a trustee <em>ex maleficio. </em>He must have been a trustee before the wrong and without reference thereto.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>293 U.S. at 333, 55 S.Ct. at 154. That is, the language of the defalcation exception \"would seem to apply only to a debt created by a person who was already a fiduciary when the debt was created.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">The <em>Davis </em>court was interpreting Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 17(a)(4), formerly codified at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(4) (repealed 1978), a predecessor to \u00a7 523(a)(4). That section stated in pertinent part: \"A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all his provable debts, whether allowable in full or in part,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">. We note that the statute does not require that any malpractice award actually be satisfied by the escrow account used to satisfy the statute; a physician could choose to satisfy any malpractice judgment through other funds. A prevailing malpractice plaintiff does not have a claim or entitlement to the escrow account established under \u00a7 458.320, but rather would be a general creditor of the defendant physician, and the physician could pay the judgment with whatever funds he desires.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">. To the extent the Guerras argue that the act that created the debt was the malpractice judgment and that the debt is rendered non-dischargeable by the Debtor's failure to satisfy \u00a7 458.320, that argument lacks merit. Malpractice verdicts are dischargeable, and the Guerras do not argue otherwise. The failure to maintain a claims fund does not alter the nature of the dischargeable judgment debt. Further, the \u00a7 523(a)(4) exception to dis-chargeability addresses debts \"for fraud or defalcation,\u201d not for malpractice. The Guer-ras could have a non-dischargeable debt only if that debt was for defalcation of funds held in a fiduciary capacity. As explained above, \u00a7 458.320 does not create a fiduciary duty or even a debt for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">. In the district court, the Debtor argued that \u00a7 458.320 is a regulatory statute and creates no private right of action in the Guerras and that their adversary complaint fails to state a cause of action. The Debtor did not make this argument in the bankruptcy court and the district court did not address this issue but based its ruling on whether \u00a7 458.320 involved a fiduciary duty for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4). We need not and do not address whether any private right of action could exist under \u00a7 458.320 under any circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
