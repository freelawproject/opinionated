On appeal, he argues that the district court erred at sentencing by applying a 16-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), based on his prior deportation following convictions for felony crimes of violence, that is, attempted lewd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>acts upon a child and lewd acts upon a child, in violation of CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288. He also argues that his sentence is unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 961 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005). In reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness.\u201d). Our \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The relevant facts are straightforward. On May 3, 2005, in a superseding indictment, Ortiz-Delgado was indicted for unlawful reentry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). He pled guilty and proceeded to sentencing. According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Ortiz-Delgado, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United States in 1978 after which, in 1991, he obtained permanent resident status. In 1996, he pled guilty to attempted lewd acts with a child, a felony under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 288 and 664, and was sentenced to probation by the San Joaquin County Superi- or Court in Stockton, California. Two years later, in 1998, he pled guilty to the felony of lewd acts upon a child, in violation of Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 288, and was sentenced to 4 years\u2019 imprisonment by the Municipal Court of California, San Joaquin County, Lodi Judicial District. He was released from prison on parole in 2002, at which time he was deported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">He illegally reentered the United States in March 2004, allegedly for purposes of supporting his only child, who resides in Lodi, California. In May 2005, he was arrested for a traffic violation in DeKalb County, Georgia and was detained based on his immigration status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During a subsequent interview with agents from the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the DeKalb County Jail in Decatur, Georgia, Ortiz-Delgado admitted that he was a native and citizen of Mexico, he had previously been deported, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>had illegally reentered the United States. After confirming Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s identity, a search of his INS file revealed that he had neither requested nor obtained permission to reenter the United States legally-</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The PSI calculated a base offense level of eight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), and recommended a 16-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(a)(ii), because Ortiz-Delgado was deported after a conviction for a crime of violence, and a 3-level reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and timely notice of his intent to plead guilty. The PSI assessed six criminal history points for Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s previous felony convictions and three points because Ortiz-Delgado committed the instant offense while on parole and because the instant offense occurred less than two years following his release. With nine total criminal history points, Ortiz-Delgado had a criminal history category IV and faced an advisory Guidelines range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Ortiz-Delgado objected to the 16-level enhancement for deportation following a conviction for a crime of violence, arguing that his convictions for attempted lewd acts with a child and lewd acts upon a child did not fall within the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). At the sentencing hearing, the district court read the following portion of the criminal complaint from Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s 1998 conviction for lewd acts upon a child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">It is established that at the time and place aforesaid he did willfully and unlawfully and lewdly commit a lewd and lascivious act upon and with the body of Rachel, who was 14 years old, with the intent of arousing to, appealing to, gratifying the lust, passion and sexual desires of the defendant who was at least ten years older than the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The court then overruled Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s objection, noting that based on the caselaw of this Circuit and the particularity of the charge for which he was convicted, there was a factual basis for finding that his previous criminal conduct amounted to sexual abuse of a minor, which is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Before imposing a sentence, the court acknowledged its obligation to consider the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In support of mitigation, defense counsel asserted the following arguments': (1) that Ortiz-Delgado returned to the United States in order to provide child support for his only son, who resides in California; (2) that although he entered the United States illegally, while here, he had attempted to comply with the law by registering as a sex offender \u201cso that his whereabouts would be known, so that his activities would be known, and also so that the public would know where he was\u201d; and (3) that he would not come back to the United States and would do his best to provide for his son by working in Mexico. In support of the first argument, Ortiz-Delgado submitted an affidavit from the child\u2019s mother, who stated that to support his son, Ortiz-Delgado made monthly deposits to her bank account up until his arrest in March 2005. The district court also heard Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s personal apology for his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">After reviewing the record and considering the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court sentenced Ortiz-Delgado to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was within the advisory Guidelines range of 57 to 71 months. The district court stated that the sentence was based on \u201cthe seriousness of his record, the fact that some of our children are exposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>his lusts and the fact that he has repeatedly been unable to comply with the requirements of the law.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Ortiz-Delgado first argues that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement for deportation following conviction for a crime of violence because there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that his previous offense conduct constituted sexual abuse of a minor, and thus a crime of violence, within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) provides for a 16-level enhancement for a defendant who was previously deported after conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined as including \u201cforcible sex offenses, statutory rape, [and] sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Ortiz-Delgado argues that his 1998 conviction under CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288(a) and \u00a7 288(c)(1) for committing a lewd act on a child under the age of 14 is not a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 288 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">\u00a7 288. Lewd or lascivious acts involving children</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">(a) Any person who willfully and lewdly commits any lewd or lascivious act ... upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child who is under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that person or the child, is guilty of a felony</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-13\">(c) (1) Any person who commits an act described in subdivision (a) with the intent described in that subdivision, and the victim is a child of 14 or 15 years and that person is at least 10 years older than the child, is guilty of a public offense ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288. While the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 does not include specific, qualifying factors for \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d in its definition of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we have given that term its ordinary and everyday meaning. <em>See United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) (interpreting \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and accompanying definition and observing that \u201c[u]nless the language is ambiguous or the plain meaning leads to absurd results, the ordinary and everyday meaning of the statute controls\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">We have not had occasion to review the particular California statute under which Ortiz-Delgado was convicted, but in the context of Florida Statute \u00a7 800.04,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>criminalizes sexual offenses that do not rise to the level of rape or sexual battery and which are committed against children under the age of sixteen, we have held that \u201cthe phrase \u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019 means a perpetrator\u2019s physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d <em>Id.; Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 961 (holding that \u201cconviction for unlawful sexual activity with certain minors qualifies as a crime of violence within the [\u00a7 2L1.2 comment, n. l(B)(iii)] definition)\u201d. \u201cThe conclusion that \u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019 is not limited to physical abuse also recognizes an invidious aspect of the offense: that the act, which may or may not involve physical contact by the perpetrator, usually results in psychological injury for the victim, regardless of whether any physical injury was incurred.\u201d <em>Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">As in <em>Padilla-Reyes, </em>the plain language of the statute at issue here, CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288, qualifies Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s previous offense conduct as \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d and thus, a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Our conclusion is consistent with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the same California statute, also in the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) context. <em>See United States v. Medina-Maella, </em>351 F.3d 944, 947 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that prior felony conviction for lewd or lascivious acts upon a child under the age of 14 years, in violation of CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288(a), constituted a conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) providing for 16-level enhancement for offense of unlawful reentry into the United States, whether or not the offense included actual force as an element), <em>cert. denied, </em>542 U.S. 945, 124 S.Ct. 2927, 159 L.Ed.2d 827 (2004); <em>accord United States v. Teeples, </em>432 F.3d 1110, 1111 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Indeed, <em>every </em>other Circuit to have considered the issue of sexual acts on children for purposes of sentencing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) has held that such crimes qualify as \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d As the Fifth Circuit observed, \u201c[f]or purposes of determining \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u00a7 2L1.2, there is no such thing as nonviolent sexual abuse of a minor .... This court and others have held that sexual offenses by adults against children carry the inherent risk of force upon or injury to the child.\u201d <em>United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 317-19 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Garcia-Juarez, </em>421 F.3d 655, 658-59 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that prior conviction for Iowa offense of lascivious acts with a child constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and therefore a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275-76 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that prior conviction for North Carolina offense of taking indecent liberties with a child constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2). Ortiz-Delgado cites <em>no </em>caselaw holding that a crime such as his prior conviction does <em>not </em>constitute \u201csexual abuse of a child\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">Because the plain language of \u00a7 288 satisfies our definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and the district court based its finding solely on the statutory elements and the charging language of Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s previous convictions, we conclude that the 16-level enhancement was properly applied, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>As for Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence, onr review is guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. These factors include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-11\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-12\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Although sentencing courts must be <em>guided </em>by these factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that, <em>post-Booker, </em>district courts need not conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor and expound on how each factor played a role in the sentencing decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">Ortiz-Delgado faced an advisory Guidelines sentencing range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment. Before imposing sentence, the district court expressly acknowledged that \u201cas a result of <em>Booker </em>I am authorized to impose a sentence based on the 3553 factors, of which is not [sic] governed by the Guidelines, and indeed, the Guidelines in this case might constrain the court.\u201d Prior to imposing sentence, the court heard Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s mitigating circumstances and considered the supporting affidavit and Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s apology. These items all concerned \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a)(1), since they pertained to Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s desire to support his son, his attempt to comply with sex-offender registration requirements, and his promise never to return to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-17\">Moreover, in imposing the sentence, the court highlighted \u201cthe seriousness of [Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s] record, the fact that some of our children are exposed to his lusts and the fact that he has repeatedly been unable to comply with the requirements of the law.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2) (discussing factors pertaining to need for sentence im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>posed \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d and \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d). Indeed, the record reflects that Ortiz-Delgado is a repeat child sex offender who already has been ordered deported once from this country. He was on parole for one of his prior sex crimes when he illegally reentered this country and committed the underlying traffic violation. In short, it was well within the bounds of reasonableness to sentence him to a 60-month term, which we observe was at the <em>loiuer </em>end of the Guidelines range he faced at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Finally, the parties\u2019 arguments and the PSI\u2019s calculations outlined \u201cthe kinds of sentences available,\u201d as discussed in \u00a7 3553(a)(3), and the government correctly argued that a Guidelines sentence would act as a deterrent to other defendants, referenced in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) (discussing factor of deterring criminal conduct) &amp; (6) (enumerating need to avoid sentencing disparity).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On this record, Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s sentence, at the <em>lower </em>end of the Guidelines range, was reasonable under <em>Booker </em>and in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-8\">. We have jurisdiction to review the reasonableness of Ortiz-Delgado\u2019s sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2006) (rejecting government's threshold argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) to review a sentence within a correctly-calculated guideline range for reasonableness; concluding that \"a post <em>-Booker </em>appeal based on the 'unreasonableness' of a sentence, whether within or outside the advisory guidelines range, is an appeal asserting that the sentence was imposed in violation of law pursuant to \u00a7 3742(a)(1)\u201d). Pursuant to our well-established prior-precedent rule, this panel is <em>bound </em>to apply, and <em>may not </em>reconsider, <em>Martinez. See United States v.

We need not reach Ortiz-Delgado's argument concerning whether <em>attempted </em>commission of a lewd act, for which he was convicted in 1996, constitutes a \"crime of violence\u201d since \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) requires only one prior conviction to warrant application of the enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\">.

The record indicates that in finding that Ortiz-Delgado's previous conviction constituted sexual abuse of a minor, the district court relied <em>solely </em>on the plain meaning of the statutory elements and the criminal complaint.
