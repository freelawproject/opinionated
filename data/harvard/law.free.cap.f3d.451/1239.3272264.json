He contends that we should vacate his sentence and remand to the district court for re-sentencing because the sentence: (1) is excessive and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment; and (2) is unreasonable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">On January 12, 2005, Johnson was indicted for two counts of production of child pornography in violation of \u00a7 2251(a) (Counts 1 and 2), one count of possession of child pornography in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) (Count 3), and one count of distribution of child pornography in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(l) (Count 4). On April 8, 2005, Johnson pleaded guilty to Counts 1, 2, and 4, and the district court dismissed Count 3 upon motion of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">During the plea hearing, the government presented facts that it represented it could prove at trial and Johnson agreed to nearly all of those facts. The government stated that between January 2002 and January 2005, Johnson took sexually explicit photographs of two minor males, identified as Victim 1 and Victim 2. The government stated that Johnson produced computer images from the photographs and sent them to a recipient via America Online.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">The pre-sentence investigation report (PSI), prepared by a parole officer, elaborated on Johnson\u2019s offenses. According to the PSI, investigators determined that Johnson had produced at least 150 pornographic images and transmitted an unknown number of the images through the Internet. Investigators determined that Johnson had photographed Victim 1 from about the age of 8 until the age of 15, and Victim 2 between the ages of 14 and 16. Johnson had also photographed a third boy, Victim 3, between the ages of 13 and 14. Additionally, investigators concluded that Johnson had either possessed or transmitted at least twenty-four videos of children engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">In an interview with investigators, Victim 1 stated that he met Johnson when he was about 7 years old and that the two began engaging in sexual activity when the victim was 8. The sexual activity continued for about six years and the incidents were \u201ctoo many to count.\u201d Victim 1 reported that when he was about 9 years old, Johnson introduced him to two other adult men for sexual purposes. Victim 1 said he was given drugs by one or more of the men to induce him into having sex. Investigators determined that Johnson had taken an explicit photograph of Victim 1 with the men.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">Because Johnson\u2019s offenses involved separate harms to three victims, the PSI treated the offenses as separate count groups. The PSI recommended that Johnson\u2019s base offense level of 32 be increased to 46 because of the special characteristics of his conduct toward the three victims. The PSI advised that Johnson\u2019s offense level be decreased 3 levels to 43 for acceptance of responsibility and assisting authorities in the investigation pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(a) (Nov.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">The PSI also noted that Johnson had prior convictions in state court for two counts of engaging in a lewd act in the presence of a child. Notwithstanding that, the PSI showed that Johnson had no criminal history points, which established a criminal history category of I. The PSI recommended that Johnson\u2019s criminal history category be increased to V pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5(a)(2) because he was a repeat and dangerous sex offender against minors. With a total offense level of 43 and a criminal history category of V, the PSI stated that the appropriate guidelines range was life in prison. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), the PSI recommended that Johnson receive the statutorily authorized maximum sentence for each count and that the sentences run consecutively. That would amount to 50 years as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>to Count 1, 50 years as to Count 2, and 40 years as to Count 4, for a total of 140 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">At the August 25, 2005 sentencing proceeding, the district court decided that the PSI had correctly calculated Johnson\u2019s offense level and criminal history category and that his guidelines range was life in prison. Alternatively, the court noted that the PSI might have erred in considering as part of Johnson\u2019s relevant conduct his actions toward Victim 3, who was not mentioned in the indictment. The court noted that if the PSI had erred, Johnson\u2019s guidelines range would be 360 months to life. If that were the case, however, the court stated that an upward departure would be warranted pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 due to the seriousness and duration of the exploitation and Victim l\u2019s age when the exploitation began, among other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">The district court stated that Johnson \u201cneed[ed] to be incarcerated, if for no other reason, to protect young children.\u201d The court stated that it was \u201cmindful and thinking of the victims in this case, and the psychological damage that has been inflicted on them and the turmoil that they will experience as they grow older.\u201d The court considered 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including \u201cthe need to protect the public, to deter violations of the law, to reflect the seriousness of the offense of conviction, and to provide appropriate punishment.\u201d It sentenced Johnson to the statutorily authorized maximum sentences of 50, 50, and 40 years for each of the three counts with the terms to run consecutively for a total of 140 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">Johnson contends that we should vacate his sentence because it is excessive and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. He characterizes his 140-year sentence as \u201cgrossly\u201d disproportionate since he had only been convicted of two prior offenses, for which he successfully completed terms of probation. He argues that he is not the type of recidivist contemplated in <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 20, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 1185, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">Johnson did not raise this issue in the district court. However, we note that the court did not give him an opportunity to object to his sentence or the manner in which it was imposed, which is required by <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1103 (11th Cir.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds sub nom. United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc). Despite the court\u2019s <em>Jones </em>error, we will not remand on that basis because Johnson has not raised the <em>Jones </em>error on appeal and because the record is sufficient for meaningful appellate review of his Eighth Amendment argument. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>946 F.2d 122, 124 n. 1 (11th Cir.1991). Typically, when a defendant fails to object to an alleged error before the district court, we review the argument only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005). However, because the court did not give Johnson an opportunity to raise his Eighth Amendment objection, we will review <em>de novo </em>the legality of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1025 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">The Eighth Amendment provides that \u201c[ejxcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. VIII. The amendment \u201ccontains a narrow proportionality principle that applies to noncapital sentences.\u201d <em>Ewing, </em>538 U.S. at 20, 123 S.Ct. at 1185 (internal quotation marks omitted). Outside the context of capital punishment, there are few successful challenges to the proportionality of sentences. <em>Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1323. \u201cThis is so because we accord sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>stantial deference to Congress, as it possesses broad authority to determine the types and limits of punishments for crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">Consequently, a court \u201cmust make a threshold determination that the sentence imposed is grossly disproportionate to the offense committed.\u201d <em>Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1324. The defendant has the burden of making that showing. <em>See id. </em>at 1324 n. 4. If the sentence is grossly disproportionate, \u201cthe court must then consider the sentences imposed on others convicted in the same jurisdiction and the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1324. \u201cIn general, a sentence within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1024 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">Because a sentence within the statutory limits generally does not violate the Eighth Amendment, we consider what those limits are for Johnson\u2019s convictions. Johnson was convicted of two counts of producing child pornography in violation of \u00a7 2251(a). Each count carries a statutory maximum punishment of fifty years imprisonment if Johnson has a prior conviction \u201cunder the laws of any State relating to the sexual exploitation of children.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e). Johnson was also convicted of one count of distributing child pornography in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(l). That count carries a statutory maximum penalty of forty years imprisonment if Johnson had a prior conviction \u201cunder the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">Johnson was previously convicted in state court of two counts of performing a lewd act in front of a minor and therefore has prior state convictions related to the \u201csexual exploitation of children,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 2251(e), and \u201cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 2252A(b)(l). That means Johnson is subject to the statutory maximum penalty for each count for which he was convicted: 50 years as to the first count, 50 years as to the second count, and 40 years as to the final count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), \u201c[i]f the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.\u201d We have held that \u00a7 5G1.2(d) requires that sentences run consecutively to the extent necessary to reach the defendant\u2019s guidelines range. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>329 F.3d 1250, 1253-54 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Johnson does not dispute the life-in-prison guidelines range determined by the district court. Thus, under \u00a7 5G1.2(d) and <em>Davis, </em>Johnson\u2019s sentences must run consecutively to the extent necessary to reach a sentence of life in prison. <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d). The court sentenced Johnson within the limits imposed by the relevant statutes and guidelines when it sentenced Johnson to a 140-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-10\">Because the district court sentenced Johnson within the statutory limits, he has not made a threshold showing of dispro-portionality with respect to his sentence. <em>See Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1024; <em>see also Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1324. We need not consider the sentences imposed on others convicted in the same jurisdiction and the sentences imposed for commission of the same crimes in other jurisdictions. Johnson\u2019s sentence is severe, but not more severe than the life long psychological injury he inflicted upon his three young victims. His sentence is neither excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>nor cruel and unusual. <em>See Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1024. It does not violate the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Alternatively, Johnson contends that we should vacate his sentence because it is greater than necessary to serve the purposes listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and is therefore unreasonable. He argues that \u201ca thirty-year sentence would have reflected the seriousness of the offense, promoted respect for the law, provided just punishment, ... and protected the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">We review sentences imposed after <em>United States v. Booker </em>for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). We must determine whether the sentence imposed by the district court \u201cfails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201c[W]e recognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In imposing the sentence, a district court need not mention each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">At sentencing, the district court looked to \u00a7 3553(a) in determining Johnson\u2019s sentence. It considered \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) when explaining why Johnson needed to be imprisoned to protect young children. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (court shall consider the need for the sentence \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d). The court also considered \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when it noted the psychological damage Johnson had inflicted on his victims and emotional turmoil they will be faced with in the years to come. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (court shall consider the need for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d). Furthermore, the court sentenced Johnson to a term that was within his guidelines range. It is a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
