The stay granted by order of this court dated November 7, 1984 is vacated and defendant is directed to pay the plaintiff a counsel fee in the amount of $500 within 30 days after service upon him of a copy of the order to be made hereon, with notice of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Special Term correctly noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that defendant\u2019s answering papers \"failed to address the issue at hand\u201d and \"fail[ed] to demonstrate any viable reason that the relief sought [dental care] would not be in the best interest of the children of the parties\u201d. Accordingly, Special Term did not abuse its discretion in granting the plaintiff counsel fees without conducting a hearing <em>(cf. Ardito v Ardito, </em>97 AD2d 830; <em>Stern v Stern, </em>67 AD2d 253). Gibbons, J. P., Niehoff, Rubin and Kunzeman, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
