Pursuant to a plea bargain, he was sentenced to concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 8 to 16 years and lVs to 4 years, respectively. On appeal, defendant contends that the sentence is harsh and excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">During the plea proceeding, County Court advised defendant that as part of the plea bargain, he would waive a number of rights, including the right to appeal. Specifically, the court advised defendant that if he received the agreed-upon sentence, \u201cyou have got what you bargained for and in that event there is no right of appeal\u201d. Defendant acknowledged that he understood the effect of his waiver. Therefore, as a result of his knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to appeal, defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence is harsh and excessive has not been preserved for our review <em>(see, People v Leibach, </em>249 AD2d 636, <em>lv denied </em>92 NY2d 880).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Cardona, P. J., Yesawich Jr., Peters and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
