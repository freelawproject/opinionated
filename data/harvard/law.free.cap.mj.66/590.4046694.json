At the time, the appellant was a storekeeper with the responsibility to update a computer accounting program known as \u201cROM II\u201d that tracked financial transactions, including the price of soft drinks sold aboard ship. Another Sailor, Ship\u2019s Serviceman First Class (SHI) Shedrick D. Jones, was assigned as the \u201ccash collection agent,\u201d whose responsibility was to remove all of the money from the soda machines and then account for the proceeds in cash record logbooks. The appellant was responsible for transferring information from the cash record logbooks into ROM II, but at <em>no time </em>did he handle any cash from the soda machines. An audit of the ship\u2019s accounting data after the deployment revealed over $10,000.00 missing from the cash account.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The appellant was interviewed by law enforcement agents several times regarding his knowledge of the missing money from the soda machines. On 23 October 2003, the appellant provided a detailed statement to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) explaining the ROM II software and denying any knowledge of the theft. Appellate Exhibits XXII and XXIII. On 18 May 2004, the appellant was questioned by agents working for the ship\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division (CID), and the appellant again denied complicity in the theft. AE XXI.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The appellant was stationed onboard USS PINCKNEY (DDG 91) on 23 September 2004, when he was directed by his command master chief to report to NCIS for another interview regarding the theft. Over a period of 10 hours, the appellant was questioned by Special Agent (SA) Meulenberg, and voluntarily submitted to four polygraph examinations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> AE IV; Record at 138 \u2014 10. The appellant was informed after each of the first three tests that the results were \u201cinconclusive.\u201d After the fourth test, the appellant was told that he was being \u201cdeceptive,\u201d which he understood to mean he had failed the polygraph test. The appellant was then confronted by SA Meulenberg who accused the appellant of lying. Record at 138-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">The appellant testified that SA Meulenberg led him to believe that he would be convicted based upon the evidence of the failed polygraph. He further contends that SA Meulenberg told him if he admitted guilt, things would be easier for him, and that SA Meulenberg would be able to assist him. The appellant further testified that SA Meulenberg told him the results of the polygraph test would not be given to his command if he confessed to the crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 140 \u2014 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">SA Meulenberg testified that he did not tell the appellant he would be convicted at a court-martial based on the results of the polygraph, but he did tell the appellant that by making a statement and admitting guilt, SA Meulenberg would be able to make sure the appellant would have an opportunity to apologize and \u201clook like a good person that made a one-time mistake[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70. SA Meulenberg also testified that he never told the appellant the results of the polygraph would not be turned over to the appellant\u2019s command if he made a confession. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70. The appellant eventually signed a statement implicating SHI Jones in the theft, and admitted personally receiving between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>$5,000.00 and $6,000.00 of the stolen money.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prosecution Exhibit 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The appellant\u2019s confession was the only direct evidence of his guilt introduced by the Government at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defense timely moved to suppress the confession as involuntary under Rule for Courts-Martial 906, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.). AE X. When this motion was denied, the defense moved <em>in limine </em>to permit the introduction of evidence related to his polygraph examinations. AE VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Polygraph Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to allow evidence of his polygraph examinations focused on the circumstances surrounding the polygraph examinations and not on the specific results. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the defense argued that \u201cinformation about the polygraph would not be admitted to find truth or falsity\u201d but rather as evidence \u201cto show what may have motivated a false confession.\u201d Record at 174. It is abundantly clear from the record that the appellant did not seek to introduce evidence as to the scientific reliability or validity of polygraph examinations. On the contrary, the appellant argued that SA Meulenberg used the polygraph results as an investigative tool to convince the appellant that he was in serious trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The prosecution opposed the defense motion, citing Military Rule of Evidence 707(a), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.), which provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the results of a polygraph examination, the opinion of a polygraph examiner, or any reference to an offer to take, failure to take, or taking of a polygraph examination, shall not be admitted into evidence.\u201d While the prosecution acknowledged that the appellant has \u201ca right to discuss the circumstances of an interrogation\u201d under certain circumstances, the Government contended that permitting the appellant to testify regarding the polygraph examinations would be prohibited under the rule. Record at 178-79. The prosecution also contended that if the court allowed the appellant to testify about the polygraph examinations, it should be permitted to present rebuttal evidence to include the testimony of the polygraph examiner and the actual results. AE IX at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">The military judge ruled that the polygraph evidence sought by the appellant was inadmissible under Mil. R. Evid. 707 and <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998), and denied the defense motion <em>in limine </em>with the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">[A]dmission of polygraph evidence to show its bearing upon the accused\u2019s state of mind presents a double-edged sword, inviting rebuttal evidence concerning the scientific reliability of the test and the specific test results in this case, including the fact that the accused apparently failed the last test. Traveling down such a road would invade the province of the fact-finder in making credibility assessments and require extensive examination into purely collateral matters. <em>See Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 313, 118 S.Ct. 1261. Contrary to the defense assertion that the polygraph\u2019s reliability or its test results are wholly irrelevant in this case, the accused\u2019s decision to provide a statement to explain adverse tests results is probative only if he honestly believed that the test results were reliable or that others would likewise believe so. Delving into the questionable scientific reliability of the accused\u2019s polygraph exam and the proper interpretation of its results would be the natural corollary to the accused\u2019s assertion that the test influenced his decision to \u201cconfess\u201d his culpability to Special Agent [Meulenberg].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">Government Response to Court Order filed on 12 Feb 2008 producing CDR Redcliffs e<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>mail of 4 Aug 2005 at 2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The military judge stated that he would not \u201climit the accused\u2019s right to present relevant evidence pertaining to other circumstances\u201d related to his statement to NCIS, to include \u201ca general reference to the accused\u2019s belief that [SA Meulenberg] had confronted him with evidence of guilt which the accused felt was inaccurate and compelled him to dispute by making an \u2018absurd\u2019 confession.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We review a military judge\u2019s rulings on admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion, and that discretion is abused when evidence is admitted upon an erroneous view of the law. <em>United States v. Holt, </em>58 M.J. 227, 230-31 (C.A.A.F.2003) (citations omitted). This is a strict standard requiring more than a mere difference of opinion. <em>United States v. McElhaney, </em>54 M.J. 120, 130 (C.A.A.F.2000). In conducting our review, we <em>are </em>required <em>to </em>consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>United States v. Reister, </em>44 M.J. 409, 413 (C.A.A.F.1996). We conclude the military judge erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>because Mil. R. Evid. 707 is unconstitutional as applied to the narrow circumstances presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In <em>Scheffer, </em>the appellant sought to introduce evidence of an exculpatory polygraph and the opinion of a polygraph expert in order to bolster the credibility of his \u201cinnocent ingestion\u201d defense to the charge of wrongful use of methamphetamines. The trial judge, relying on Mil. R. Evid. 707, excluded all evidence concerning the polygraph and the defense\u2019s proposed polygraph expert. The case was affirmed by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals, but reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Our superior court stated that a <em>per se </em>exclusion of polygraph evidence, offered by an accused to rebut an attack on his credibility, violated the appellant\u2019s right to present a defense under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>44 M.J. 442, 445 (C.A.A.F. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that Mil. R. Evid. 707 did not abridge the service-member\u2019s right to present a defense. <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 317, 118 S.Ct. 1261. The Court held that, while a defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to present relevant evidence in his or her defense, that right \u201cis subject to reasonable restrictions\u201d imposed by state or federal rule makers in the form of rules excluding evidence from criminal trials. <em>Id. </em>at 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261. The Court went on to find that Mil. R. Evid. 707 \u201cis a rational and proportional means of advancing the legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 118 S.Ct. 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\"><em>Scheffer, </em>however, was a fractured decision with three separate opinions and shifting majorities. Writing for a four-justice plurality,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Justice Thomas found that Rule 707 serves three legitimate governmental interests \u201cin ensuring that reliable evidence is presented to the <em>trier of </em>fact in a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 118 S.Ct. 1261. First, it helps exclude unreliable evidence, as reflected by the lack of consensus within the scientific community over the reliability of polygraph examinations, and in the doubtful approach to such evidence by state and federal courts. <em>Id. </em>at 309, 312, 118 S.Ct. 1261. Second, it helps preserve \u201cthe jury\u2019s core function of making credibility determinations in criminal trials\u201d by not allowing polygraph evidence to cause \u201cjurors to abandon their duty to assess credibility and guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 118 S.Ct. 1261. Third, it helps \u201cavoid[ ] litigation over issues other than the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 118 S.Ct. 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Another four justices<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> agreed with the plurality\u2019s determination that Rule 707 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\u201cnot so arbitrary or disproportionate that it is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 118 S.Ct. 1261 (Kennedy, J., concurring). However, they specifically disavowed legitimate governmental interests two and three, <em>supra, </em>that allowing polygraph evidence would impermissibly invade the province of the trier of fact, and the concerns of allowing such evidence would lead to litigation of collateral issues at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 318-20,118 S.Ct. 1261. Moreover, these justices expressed \u201cdoubt ... that the rule of <em>per se </em>exclusion is wise,\u201d and observed that \u201csome later case might present a more compelling ease for introduction of the testimony than this one does.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 118 S.Ct. 1261. They also shared the view held by Justice Stevens, the lone dissenter, that \u201cthere is much inconsistency between the Government\u2019s extensive use of polygraphs to make vital security determinations and the argument it makes here, stressing the inaccuracy of these tests.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Reconciling these opinions, it is clear that a majority of eight justices believed Mil. R. Evid. 707 was not unconstitutional as applied to the facts of Scheffer\u2019s case. Just as clearly, though, a different majority of five justices have left open the possibility that Rule 707 might be unconstitutional when applied to different facts. In light of these reservations, we decline to adopt the Justice Thomas\u2019 plurality view of Rule 707 as a <em>per se </em>exclusion of polygraph examinations in virtually all its possible applications. <em>See </em>Edward J. Imwinkelreid, <em>A Defense of the Right to Present Defense Expert Testimony: The Flaws in the Plurality Opinion in United States v. Scheffer, </em>69 Tenn. L.Rev. 539, 543-44 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">As the Supreme Court has observed, a confession of the accused is strong evidence, and the accused should be afforded ample opportunity to confront it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">Confessions, even those that have been found to be voluntary, are not conclusive of guilt---- [Stripped of the power to describe to the jury the circumstances that prompted his confession, the defendant is effectively disabled from answering the one question every rational juror needs answered: If the defendant is innocent, why did he previously admit his guilt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-10\"><em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 683, 689-90, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986). The accused\u2019s interest in confronting his confession is particularly significant, as it is the accused who is the target of any criminal prosecution. <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 315-16, 118 S.Ct. 1261 (citing <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 52, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987)). To protect this interest, an accused \u201cought to be allowed \u2018to present his own version of events in his own words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>It is with this significant interest in mind that we consider whether the military judge erred by denying the appellant the ability to testify regarding the polygraph examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">As predicted by Justice Kennedy in his concurrence, the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Scheffer </em>does not address the situation we have in the present case. The military judge\u2019s application of Rule 707 clearly prevented the appellant from presenting factual matters \u2014 the numerous polygraph examinations and the polygraph examiner\u2019s characterizations of the results \u2014 which are extremely relevant in explaining the <em>res gestae </em>of his subsequent confession. Unlike the accused in <em>Scheffer, </em>the appellant was unable to testify himself about all relevant factual matters related to the polygraphs that led to his confession, and he did not attempt to bolster his own credibility by introducing an exculpatory polygraph and a polygraph expert to explain the results. Because the net effect of the military judge\u2019s application of Rule 707 prevented the appellant from testifying regarding this matter in his own behalf, we find it was \u201cdisproportionate to the purposes [the rule was] designed to serve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261 (quoting <em>Rock, </em>483 U.S. at 56,107 S.Ct. 2704). To the contrary, the military judge\u2019s application of the rule \u201cinfringed upon a weighty interest of the accused\u201d: his ability to testify in his own defense. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Our review of the record reveals the military judge\u2019s primary rationale for preventing admission of the polygraph evidence was based upon his concerns about the reliability of the evidence, and that the rebuttal evidence proffered by the Government would precipitate a \u201ctrial within a trial,\u201d if the appellant was allowed to attack the voluntariness of his confession by referencing the polygraph examinations. While we appreciate these concerns of the military judge related to the unreliability of polygraph examinations, it remains that a \u201clegitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence does not extend to <em>per se </em>exclusions [of evidence] that may be reliable in an individual case.\u201d <em>Rock, </em>483 U.S. at 61,107 S.Ct. 2704. Likewise, one court has recognized an exception to Rule 707\u2019s general exclusion when polygraph evidence is sought to be admitted by the prosecution to rebut an appellant\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe voluntariness of his admissions to the investigators.\u201d <em>United States v. Kawai, </em>63 M.J. 591, 596 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.2006)(citing <em>United States v. Gaines, </em>20 M.J. 668, 669 (A.F.C.M.R.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In <em>Gaines, </em>the accused sought to prohibit the Government from introducing evidence he had failed a polygraph examination, offered as rebuttal evidence to his claim that his confession was involuntary. Our sister court upheld the military judge\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>ruling that an exception exists for \u201cthe testimony of a polygraph examiner where the purpose of the testimony is to show the voluntariness of the accused\u2019s confession which followed the examination, rather than to reflect the truthfulness of the statements made to the examiner.\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>20 M.J. at 669 (citations omitted). The court reasoned that, assuming proper limiting instructions were given, \u201c[t]he general philosophy supporting such an admission is that it is important for the jury to weigh every motivating circumstance surrounding the eliciting of a confession and that this function outweighs the importance of any possible prejudice from a reference to its use.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">For the same reasons, we view this case as a situation \u201cin which taking a polygraph test and discussing the results with a suspect may be logically quite relevant in determining whether the suspect\u2019s subsequent statement to investigators was voluntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>53 M.J. 280, 284 (C.A.A.F.2000)(Everett, C.J., concurring in the result). The Government obtained the appellant\u2019s confession after employing a series of polygraph examinations as an investigatory tool. Under these circumstances, the appellant\u2019s understanding and perception of those polygraph examinations are important factual matters related to his confession. Even though the appellant was unsuccessful in suppressing his confession, he still had the right \u201cto present relevant evidence with respect to the voluntariness of the statement\u201d during the trial on the merits. Mil. R. Evtd. 304(e)(2). <em>See </em>Major Scott E. Reid, <em>Military Rule of Evidence 707 and the Art of Post-Polygraph Interrogation: A Proposed Amendment to the Blanket Exclusionary Rule, </em>2001 Army Law. 1, 5 (2001). Therefore, we hold that the appellant was denied this right when the military judge prohibited him from presenting factual evidence, relevant to his statement\u2019s voluntariness and credibility, in the form of his own testimony regarding the polygraph examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">Considering the strengths of the Government and defense cases, and the materiality and quality of the evidence in question, we find the appellant was prejudiced by the military judge\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. Kerr, </em>51 M.J. 401, 405 (C.A.A.F.1999) (citations omitted). Given the constitutional interests at stake when an accused is prohibited from testifying in his own defense, we do not believe the military judge\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Buenaventura, </em>45 M.J. 72, 79 (C.A.A.F.1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are set aside.

The NCIS polygraph log and the testimony of SA Meulenberg at the motion hearing both indicate three polygraphs. AE XII; Record at 68.

In addition to the confession, the Government presented evidence that the appellant had knowledge of the amount of cash collected by the ship\u2019s cash collection agent and that he should have noticed a significant shortfall; that the cash books were reporting sodas sold at 50 cents when they were actually being sold for 60 cents; that the USS BELLEAU WOOD was missing some amount of money in excess of $10,000.00; and that there were deposits to the appellant\u2019s checking account made from an ATM in Guam.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\">.
