Contrary to his pleas, Appellant was convicted of one specification of unauthorized absence, in violation of Article 86, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 886; one specification of attempted failure to obey a lawful order, in violation of Article 80, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 880; one specification of sodomy, in violation of Article 125, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 925; one specification of extortion, in violation of Article 127, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 927; and one specification of indecent assault, in violation of Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934. The court sentenced Appellant to a dismissal, confinement for six months, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances. The Convening Authority approved the sentence as adjudged.</p>\n<p id=\"ABn\">Before this Court, Appellant has assigned six errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amg\">I. The convictions for extortion, sodomy, and indecent assault must be reversed because the military judge violated Appellant\u2019s constitutional right to confront his accusers by limiting his cross-examination of SR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-9z\">II. If the findings for extortion and indecent assault are set aside, then the sodomy conviction, which is based on private consensual non-commercial activity between adults of equal rank, is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ado\">III. The extortion conviction must be overturned because the Government failed to prove that Appellant threatened SR with the intent to obtain sexual favors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJI\">IV. The conviction for going from an appointed place of duty cannot stand because the Government failed to prove that Appellant knew that his duty assignment required him to remain in Chase Hall after 2200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avs\">V. The evidence was factually insufficient to sustain the conviction for attempted violation of an order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsU\">VI. The Convening Authority erred in summarily denying Appellant\u2019s request to defer confinement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7Ja\">We summarily reject the third and fourth assigned errors. The evidence, though circumstantial, is sufficient to support the convictions. We will discuss the other assigned errors. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"ARx\">I</p>\n<p id=\"Adf\">Appellant asserts that the military judge erred in limiting his cross-examination of the complaining witness concerning the extortion, sodomy, and indecent assault specifications of which he was found guilty. We will review the military judge\u2019s decision <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>If error is found, we will reverse unless we find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">In May 2005, during the Coast Guard Academy\u2019s summer program, Appellant, a Coast Guard Academy cadet, and SR, a female Academy classmate, were assigned to neighboring cutters in Norfolk, Virginia. Appellant communicated with SR, letting her know that he was hearing rumors about her. They discussed the rumors, and SR told Appellant the story underlying the rumors. (R. at <em>878, </em>1320.) SR testified that she told Appellant a part of but not the whole situation; she lied to him by omitting details that would have painted her in a bad light. (R. at 878, 901-02.) Appellant assured her that he would counteract the rumors. (R. at 878, 1320. )</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">On 19 October 2005, Appellant communicated with SR to the effect that the rumors were still being talked about. Again they discussed the rumors, and this time SR told Appellant the complete story of what had happened. (R. at 880, 921,1321.) Appellant testified to the effect that his source had indicated the story was different from what she had originally told him, and that when she told him the complete story, it was indeed \u201cpretty substantially different.\u201d (R. at 1321. ) SR testified that, at that point, she thought if she did not tell him the whole story, he would stop helping her. (R. at 922.) Her actions in the complete story, she admitted, violated cadet regulations and possibly the UCMJ, but she understood at the time of trial that she would not be prosecuted for them. (R. at 899.) Once she told Appellant the whole story, she testified, he responded that he needed motivation to continue helping her. (R. at 880-81.) Later that evening, Appellant and SR engaged in sexual conduct that became the subject of the extortion, indecent assault, and sodomy charges against Appellant. (R. at 881-92.) SR maintained that the reason she engaged in the conduct was because she \u201cwas scared to upset him because he had a big secret of mine.\u201d (R. at 891.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Early in the trial, a closed Article 39(a) session was held pursuant to Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 412 to address the details of the story underlying the rumors, on which the defense proposed to cross-examine SR. * * * [REDACTED]* * * The military judge ruled that SR could be cross-examined concerning the lie in May, but that the details, as described in this paragraph, were not to be brought out.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">Appellant contends that the military judge\u2019s ruling was a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of Appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. In defense of the extortion, indecent assault, and sodomy charges, Appellant sought to convince the court members that SR was lying about her sexual encounter with Appellant, in particular falsely contending that it was not consensual, and that she was doing so to protect herself from discipline. This argument, he asserts, would have been much more persuasive had the members known that before 19 October, SR had been lying to Appellant * * *[REDACTED]* * *, and doing so to protect herself from discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">M.R.E. 412 renders evidence inadmissible that is offered to prove a complainant engaged in sexual behavior other than that involved in the alleged offense. M.R.E. 412(a)(1). However, it excepts, among other things, \u201cevidence the exclusion of which would violate the constitutional rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>accused.\u201d M.R.E. 412(b)(1)(C). An accused has the right to admission of such evidence if it is relevant, material, and favorable to his defense. <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>16 M.J. 1, 5 (C.M.A.1983) <em>(citing United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982)). \u201cFavorable\u201d is further interpreted as \u201cvital.\u201d <em>United States v. Banker, </em>60 M.J. 216, 222 (C.A.A.F. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Appellant was properly allowed to cross-examine SR concerning her May 2005 lie, pursuant to M.R.E. 608(b) and the Sixth Amendment. However, the right to confrontation is not absolute. \u201c[TJrial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant. And as we observed earlier this Term, \u2018the Confrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (citation omitted). The trial judge could properly restrict Appellant\u2019s cross-examination of SR on the basis of M.R.E. 412, excluding, as he did, the details of the May incident, unless those details were relevant, material, and vital to his case. <em>Dorsey, </em>16 M.J. at 5; <em>Banker, 60 </em>M.J. at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Appellant cites <em>United States v. Bahr, </em>33 M.J. 228 (C.M.A.1991), and <em>United States v. Moss, </em>63 M.J. 233 (C.A.A.F.2006), in support of his argument that the details of the May incident were constitutionally required to be admitted. In each of these cases, evidence of a complainant\u2019s motive to fabricate was proffered but excluded.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In both cases, the court held the exclusion was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">In <em>Bahr, </em>the accused was charged with sexual offenses against his 14-year-old daughter. The defense offered the daughter\u2019s diary, in which she expressed intense dislike of her mother, and proposed to cross-examine her on it to show that she hated her mother. The Court of Military Appeals agreed that this tended to show a motive to testify falsely against her father in order to hurt her mother. Admission of such evidence was required under M.R.E. 608(e) and the Sixth Amendment. 33 M.J. at 233. The defense further sought to cross-examine the child concerning prior false statements to her classmates about being raped by soldiers in Spain, which she had admitted to counsel were lies she had uttered to attract attention. Again, the court agreed that this line of cross-examination was admissible to show the prosecutrix had a second motive to testify falsely. <em>Id. </em>at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The accused in <em>Moss </em>was charged with sexual offenses against his 14-year-old niece. The defense sought to show that the niece fabricated the allegations so as to cast herself as a victim to gain favorable treatment from her parents, by cross-examining her and her mother on her acts of misbehavior and the resulting punishments, and on the improvement in the relationship with her parents after she reported the allegations. 63 M.J. at 235. In this case, too, CAAF held the proposed cross-examination should have been allowed, citing M.R.E. 608(c) and the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The circumstances of these cases are different from those of our case. The girls\u2019 claimed motives to fabricate, in order to retaliate against her mother and also to gain attention in the one case, and to divert attention from her own misdeeds in the other, were supported by direct evidence or evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>dence from an earlier parallel situation. In our case, the argument as to motivation is being made based on an earlier situation claimed to be parallel, but there is a significant difference between the two situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">It is clear that SR wanted Appellant\u2019s help in suppressing rumors concerning the May-2005 incident, and it is fair to argue that avoiding discipline was a factor motivating her to lie to Appellant about the details. The motive for SR to falsify the truth regarding the May incident can be directly linked to her concern for either UCMJ or administrative action against her * * *[REDACTED]* * *. There is no apparent similar motive to fabricate her story regarding the events on 19 October 2005. There is no evidence in the record, no suggestion, and no reason to believe that anyone knew about the 19 October conduct other than Appellant and SR, and thus no reason to believe a preemptive false report on her part would be useful to her. Since no one else knew about the events that took place in the cadet barracks that night, there was no reason for SR to be concerned -with either UCMJ or administrative action against her, and therefore no reason for her to falsify the information when she made her report<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or when she testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Appellant could have cross-examined her upon her motive for making that report, instead of relying solely on a claimed parallel with the May incident, but did not do so. Hence, there is no evidence at all of motive to fabricate, and the earlier situation is not parallel.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The military judge\u2019s ruling allowed Appellant to attack SR\u2019s credibility by means of showing a prior lie. It precluded Appellant from showing that the prior lie pertained to * * ^[REDACTED]* * *, but did not preclude Appellant from attempting to show, by other means, that SR had a motive to lie in her testimony against Appellant. Nor did it preclude Appellant from \u201cportray[ing] the witness as the architect of a scheme of false allegations intended to cover up her own misconduct,\u201d as the dissent complains. That the witness lied came into evidence (R. at 901), as did the fact that the lie pertained to her misconduct (R. at 899-901).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">We further disagree with the dissent that her testimony \u201ccreated a substantially different impression of her credibility than what the defense had tried to show \u2014 namely, that SR had knowingly provided Appellant with false information\u201d for the purpose of using him to counter a career-threatening rumor, impliedly by disseminating the false information. She testified on direct examination that she \u201cdid not tell [Appellant] the whole situation,\u201d but only \u201c[a] little bit of it.\u201d (R. at 878.) But she also admitted, under cross-examination, that she had lied to him, that the bits she had omitted painted her in a bad light. (R. at 901-02.) Appellant\u2019s testimony reflected that her statements to him had been \u201csubstantially different.\u201d (R. at 1321.) The military judge\u2019s ruling prevented the members from judging for themselves whether her behavior should be characterized as a lie or something less, but it did not prevent Appellant\u2019s defense counsel from arguing, as he did, that she admitted lying.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (R. at 1510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">As noted above, an accused has the right to admission of evidence despite M.R.E. 412 if it is relevant, material, and vital to his defense. <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>16 M.J. 1, 5 (C.M.A.1983); <em>United States v. Banker, </em>60 M.J. 216, 222 (C.A.A.F.2004). In this case, we find that the evidence sought to be admitted was no more than superficially relevant, was not material, and was not vital to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>defense. We find no error in the military judge\u2019s ruling against Appellant.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Appellant asserts that if he prevails on the previous assignment, clearly necessitating reversal of the extortion and indecent assault convictions, the sodomy conviction must also be reversed because it would be unconstitutional under <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In <em>United States v. Marcum, </em>60 M.J. 198, 206 (C.A.A.F.2004), the court held that <em>Lawrence </em>applies to the military, but Article 125, the UCMJ\u2019s punitive article on sodomy, is not facially unconstitutional. Rather, the court concluded \u201cthat its application must be addressed in context,\u201d that is, is it constitutional as applied? <em>Id. </em>The court set forth three questions to be considered.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">First, was the conduct that the accused was found guilty of committing of a nature to bring it within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court? Second, did the conduct encompass any behavior or factors identified by the Supreme Court as-outside the analysis in Lawrence? Third, are there additional factors relevant solely in the military environment that affect the nature and reach of the <em>Lawrence </em>liberty interest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 206-07 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">In the absence of the coercive element of extortion, Appellant\u2019s conduct might be characterized as private, consensual sexual activity between adults. We may assume, as the court did in <em>Marcum, </em>that the conduct would be within the <em>Lawrence </em>liberty interest. Since Appellant and SR were both first-class cadets and not in the same chain of command, unlike the situation in <em>Marcum, </em>we may also assume that the conduct would not encompass behavior or factors identified as being outside the <em>Lawrence </em>analysis. However, in the language of <em>United States v. Stirewalt, </em>60 M.J. 297, 304 (C.A.A.F.2004), Appellant\u2019s conduct \u201csquarely implicates the third prong of the framework.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">The Regulations for the Corps of Cadets includes an Article 4-5-05 entitled Sexual Misconduct. (Appellate Ex. XXIV.) Paragraph a.3 thereof prohibits sexual conduct on board military installations, which includes the Academy, even if between consenting cadets. We find that Appellant\u2019s conduct, as he testified to it (R. at 1326-27), was outside any protected liberty interest recognized in <em>Lawrence. See Stirewalt, </em>60 M.J. at 304 (liberty interest is considered \u201cin light of the established ... regulations and the clear military interests of discipline and order that they reflect\u201d). We note that a holding otherwise would apparently yield the anomalous result that the regulation would be enforceable as to all forms of sexual conduct except sodomy, as the Government pointed out at oral argument.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">The presence of the regulation readily distinguishes this case from those of the Army Court of Criminal Appeals opinions attached to Appellant\u2019s brief, in which in-barracks consensual sodomy convictions were overturned. In one of them, the opinion specifies that there was no evidence of a barracks policy prohibiting the conduct. <em>United States v. Meno, </em>ARMY 20000733, at 4 (A.Ct.Crim.App. Jun. 22, 2005) (per curiam). In the other, a guilty plea case, the accused had not admitted any facts that would take the case out of the <em>Lawrence </em>liberty interest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Bullock, </em>ARMY 20030534, at *5, 2006 WL 3490409 (A.Ct.Crim.App. Nov. 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>2004). We are not aware of any court-martial appellate decision overturning a sodomy conviction based on <em>Lawrence </em>when there was a regulation aside from Article 125, UCMJ, prohibiting the behavior.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Appellant was charged with violating an order prohibiting him from contact with cadets. He was convicted of an attempt to violate the order. He contends that the evidence was factually insufficient to support the conviction, in that his attempt to contact a cadet took place the day before the order was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The specification charges violation of a paragraph of a written order issued by the Commandant of Cadets on 7 December 2005, which is Prosecution Exhibit 4. It is styled as an amendment to a written order he had issued on 5 December 2005, which is Defense Exhibit F.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commandant of Cadets issued the written order of 5 December at the time Appellant was removed from the barracks. (R. at 820, 1351.) Appellant\u2019s acknowledgment of receipt is recorded on Defense Exhibit F at 0410 on \u201c5 DEC 05.\u201d The Commandant of Cadets issued the written order of 7 December after receiving legal advice (R. at 820), but the intent of the order had not changed (R. at 807). Appellant\u2019s acknowledgment of receipt is recorded on Prosecution Exhibit 4 at 1600 on \u201cDEC 05\u201d (sic). This order was issued after the Commandant of Cadets had referred allegations of sexual assault against Appellant to Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) for investigation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (R. at 814.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The order of 7 December alleged to have been violated reads, \u2018You are prohibited from any contact of any kind, directly or indirectly, through any source, or by any means, with Coast Guard Academy Cadets wherever they are located; to include text messages, emails, or phone calls.\u201d (Prosecution Ex. 4.) This differs from the order of 5 December by the added words, \u201cdirectly or indirectly, though any source, or by any means,\u201d and \u201cwherever they are located.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">The specification alleges violation of the order by, \u201con or about 16 December 2005, ... wrongfully sending an instant message to [KS], with the intention of having [KS] contact Cadet [KN, an Academy classmate of Appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">KS and KN were close friends. (R. at 408, 423, 496, 555; Defense Ex. A.) KS testified that she received an instant message from Appellant in December 2005. (R. at 519.) The text of the instant message is found in Prosecution Exhibit 1 without any marker as to date of origin, and includes the words, \u201cI need you to make sure that she knows that I hope that everything is physically and emotionally ok with her right now.\u201d KS understood this to mean Appellant wanted her to relay a message to KN. (R. at 519.) She saved it to her computer desktop, intending to relay it to KN, but when she realized that she would be unable to do so before taking a trip, she emailed the text to herself. (R. at 519-20.) Prosecution Exhibit 1 is a printout of the email, dated 16 December 2005. KS testified that she had received the instant message a few \u2014 less than ten \u2014 days before that. (R. at 560-61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Appellant testified that he had sent an instant message to KS on 6 December 2005 (R. at 1333), before receiving information that he was not supposed to contact any cadets <em>indirectly </em>(R. at 1351), but none after receiving the order the next day prohibiting <em>indirect </em>contact with KN (R. at 1334).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">Appellant argues that his testimony was certain as to the date he sent the message and KS\u2019s testimony was uncertain, and therefore his version must be accepted. Apparently the members did not believe Appellant\u2019s version and believed KS\u2019s testimony that she had received the instant message a few (less than ten) days before 16 December. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>We are satisfied that the evidence supports the finding that Appellant sent the instant message after he received the 7 December order.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Appellant asserts error on the part of the Convening Authority in summarily denying his request for deferment of the sentence to confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Shortly after the trial ended at 1856 hours on 28 June 2006, Appellant submitted a written request for a one-week deferment of the sentence of confinement. The Convening Authority memorialized his action on the request by writing on it, \u201cRequest Denied,\u201d his signature, and the date, \u201c06/28/06.\u201d This was error, as such action must not only be in writing, R.C.M. 1101(c)(3), but also \u201cmust include the reasons upon which the action is based.\u201d <em>United States v. Sloan, 35 </em>M.J. 4, 7 (C.M.A.1992). The Government concedes the error, but contends that Appellant is not entitled to relief. (Government Br. 14-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Appellant claims prejudice in that he was \u201cparaded in front of frenzied members of the media ... in what can only be described as a ... \u2018perp walk.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Appellant Br. 38.) The Government\u2019s affidavits contradict Appellant\u2019s version of events. This Court has extremely limited authority to resolve factual disputes that arise from post-trial submissions. <em>United States v. Ginn, </em>47 M.J. 236, 238 (C.A.A.F.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Nevertheless, assuming Appellant\u2019s version of the facts, we agree with the Government that no relief is due. We find that the Convening Authority\u2019s failure to state any reason for denying the deferment request, while error, was harmless. Appellant served the same amount of confinement he would have served if the deferment had been granted, albeit without a week of delay in its commencement. Assuming he suffered the humiliating and embarrassing experience he describes, we know of no precedent for relief, and we are not inclined to grant relief. <em>See United States v. Sloan, </em>35 M.J. 4 (C.M.A. 1992); <em>United States v. Brownd, </em>6 M.J. 338 (C.M.A.1979). Distasteful though it may be, we do not believe the criminal law has occasion to take cognizance of such an experience. In any event, there is no guarantee that a deferment of confinement would have avoided exposure to the media when he reported for confinement at the end of the deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">We have reviewed the record in accordance with Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.

It is undisputed that the details fall within Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 412\u2019s exclusion. Moreover, SR, a newly-commissioned Coast Guard officer at the time of trial, testified that she was still concerned about the story because \"I\u2019m afraid of rumors when I go from unit to unit.\u201d (R. at 877.) It is for this reason that we continue to treat the details as specified in M.R.E. 412(c), keeping them nonpublic, although M.R.E. 412 addresses itself to admission of evidence, implying that it applies at trials, and does not mention appellate proceedings.

She also testified that on 19 October, she said to him, \"I\u2019m not gonna ask you to lie for me.\u201d (R. at 903.) As the dissent notes, there is nothing to indicate just what she hoped for or expected him to do to \"squash\u201d or suppress rumors.

He went on to find that \"the minimal probative value of this evidence is outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice to [SRj\u2019s privacy interests [per M.R.E. 412(c)(3)] and the potential danger of sidetracking the [members\u2019] attention to a collateral issue [per M.R.E. 403].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b619-16\">.

I would find, however, that the military judge abused his discretion when he prohibited the defense from cross-examining SR on her false statement to Appellant * * ^[REDACTED]* * *, since this evidence was highly probative of the defense theory that SR engaged in a pattern of fabrication to avoid discipline. As discussed below, I believe that the military judge erred when he decided the admissibility of this evidence based on his own credibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>ty determination of the only two witnesses involved. The military judge also erred in not considering important factors that favored admission of the defense evidence, including that the Government made first use of evidence of SR\u2019s secret in its case-in-chief to prove that she was extorted and coerced into sexual relations with Appellant; that SR\u2019s credibility was a key element in an otherwise uncorroborated case; and that the strength of the Government\u2019s case turned on the members finding the presence of subtle psychological influences that overcame SR\u2019s will. The excessive restrictions imposed on Appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights allowed SR to testify through nonfactual euphemisms on critical issues related to the Government\u2019s proof and her own credibility, and allowed the Government to create a substantially different impression of her truthfulness than what the defense had sought to show through the excluded evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">It is well-settled that \u201ca primary interest secured by [the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment] is the right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965). \u201cCross-examination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.\u201d <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974). Moreover, \u201cthe exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316-17, 94 S.Ct. 1105. In military courts-martial, the right to attack the partiality of a witness is primarily secured under M.R.E. 608(c), which provides for the admission of evidence that shows bias, prejudice, or any motive to misrepresent through cross-examination of witnesses or extrinsic evidence. <em>See United States v. Hunter, </em>21 M.J. 240, 242 (C.M.A.1986); <em>United States v. Saferite, </em>59 M.J. 270 (C.A.A.F.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Although trial judges have broad discretion to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination to address concerns over harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant, this discretion is not without boundaries. Where the accuracy and truthfulness of the witness\u2019 testimony are \u201ckey elements\u201d in the Government\u2019s case, a trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the defendant to cross-examine the witness regarding possible bias, motive, or prejudice is a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 317-18, 94 S.Ct. 1105; <em>see also Saferite, </em>59 M.J. at 273 (\u201cEvidence of bias can be powerful impeachment.\u201d); <em>United States v. Moss, </em>63 M.J. 233, 236 (C.A.A.F. 2006) (\u2018When the military judge excludes evidence of bias, the exclusion raises issues regarding an accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bins, </em>43 M.J. 79, 84 (C.A.A.F.1995) (\u201cWhen the defense offers this evidence, it may deny confrontation rights to exclude it.\u201d); <em>United States v. Foster, </em>986 F.2d 541, 543 (D.C.Cir. 1993) (\u201cThe more important the witness to the government\u2019s case, the more important the defendant\u2019s right, derived \u00a1from the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, to cross-examine the witness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Evidence that SR had made * * ^REDACTED]* * * to Appellant should have been admissible at trial because the central issue was whether SR consented during their sexual encounter on 19 October 2005, and SR was the only Government witness on the issue of consent. The defense should have been able to show that because SR had falsely informed Appellant * * *[REDACTED]* * * in fabricating a false complaint of indecent assault against Appellant, where the motive underlying each statement was SR\u2019s fear of being disciplined. Here, the record of trial shows that SR relied on Appellant to contain rumors that were circulating over what prosecutors cryptically referred to as her \u201cbad situation\u201d or \u201csecret.\u201d (R. at 881, 901, 922-23.) Both SR\u2019s \u201cbad situation\u201d and her encounter with Appellant in Chase Hall involved a military nexus that, if disclosed, subjected SR to discipline. Both incidents were connected, in that the encounter in Chase Hall apparently was meant to secure Appellant\u2019s continued assistance in \u201csuppressing\u201d rumors regarding the earlier encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>I find it significant that the Government made first use of evidence of SR\u2019s secret during its case-in-chief. Although the prosecution was able to present evidence that SR was coerced into unwanted sexual relations with Appellant by the implied threat that he would reveal the facts of her \u201cbad situation,\u201d the defense was prohibited from showing that this same fear of disclosure weighed so heavily in SR\u2019s mind that she relied on Appellant to disseminate false information concerning her secret. The anomalous result was that the members heard only the Government\u2019s evidence on the question of SR\u2019s motivation in submitting to Appellant\u2019s advances, while the defense was unable to complete the picture by showing the depths of her fear and the lengths she allegedly had gone \u2014 and was prepared to go \u2014 to shield the facts of her misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">I disagree that the cross-examination allowed the defense was adequate to develop SR\u2019s motive to testify falsely against Appellant. The sexual encounter between SR and Appellant had many outward appearances of being consensual. The Government\u2019s case of indecent assault was not strong and turned on the members finding the existence of coercion that was sufficient to overcome the victim\u2019s will. Resolving this issue necessarily required the members to carefully evaluate the potentially subtle psychological pressure that resulted from Appellant\u2019s veiled threat to reveal the truth about SR\u2019s secret \u2014 a threat that Appellant denied making. Certainly, one explanation for SR\u2019s encounter with Appellant was that she felt coerced into unwanted sexual relations. Another entirely plausible explanation was that the encounter resulted from her own calculation that Appellant needed additional \u201cmotivation\u201d to continue spreading false information on her behalf.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both scenarios would account for the considerable pressure SR was under after Appellant informed her that rumors still were circulating about her secret, but the latter would not necessarily describe extortion or an indecent assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant could not develop this alternate scenario at trial because he was prohibited from adequately addressing SR\u2019s prior false statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">In addition, the Government offered no evidence of a fresh complaint and no other evidence to support SR\u2019s account of the incident involving Appellant. SR was the Government\u2019s key witness against Appellant \u2014 in fact, SR\u2019s testimony was the only evidence supporting Appellant\u2019s conviction on extortion and indecent assault. Moreover, her own testimony on the question of consent was far from conclusive. For example, although SR testified that at one point during their encounter she pushed Appellant\u2019s head aside and told him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d she also testified that they kissed each other and exchanged back massages; that he told her, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to\u201d; and that she thanked him for his support \u2014 presumably in reference to his assistance in defusing rumors regarding her secret. (R. at 885-86, 889-92, 914-17.) On the unusual facts of this case, it was essential that the defense be given wide latitude to explore SR\u2019s credibility, and to frilly develop any motive reasonably raised by the evidence that she would bring a false allegation of sexual assault against Appellant. <em>See Moss, 63 </em>M.J. at 236 (\u201crules of evidence should be read to allow liberal admission of bias-type evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">The members eventually did hear SR admit that her secret involved a violation of Cadet Regulations (R. at 899), and that she had misled Appellant about the circumstances, saying, \u201cYes, I did lie to him\u201d (R. at 901). In addition, defense counsel argued in closing that SR \u201cadmitted she lied to Cadet Smith.\u201d (R. at 1510.) This limited impeachment allowed the defense was inadequate given that a general attack on a witness\u2019 credibility is not the same as a showing of bias or motive. <em>See Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 316-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>17, 94 S.Ct. 1105. Here, the members never were able to place SR\u2019s admission that she had lied to Appellant in any factual context, because they never heard what the secret was or what she had lied about. The members only heard that SR had lied to Appellant in the past, not why she would have lied in bringing allegations against Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">More importantly, SR was able to minimize her he to Appellant by testifying that she had only omitted certain details from her account, saying, \u201cI just didn\u2019t tell him all that occurred,\u201d and also that she told him, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna ask you to lie for me.\u201d (R. at 902-03.) Her testimony on this point created a substantially different impression of her credibility than what the defense had tried to show \u2014 namely, that SR had knowingly provided Appellant with false information, which he then used to counter a career-threatening rumor. <em>See Olden v. Kentucky, </em>488 U.S. 227, 232, 109 S.Ct. 480, 102 L.Ed.2d 513 (1988) (defendant states a violation of Confrontation Clause if a \u201creasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of [the witness\u2019] credibility\u201d had excluded line of cross-examination been allowed). Establishing this point was essential, as the crux of Appellant\u2019s defense was that SR had followed a pattern of fabrication to avoid discipline that was revealed by like motives from a prior scheme. Given this record, where SR was able to downplay her lie as a mere omission of details, and the defense was not allowed to inform the members what SR had lied about or the lengths she was prepared to go to protect her career, the members may well have concluded that the defense was engaged in a \u201cspeculative and baseless line of attack on the credibility of an apparently blameless witness.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>415 U.S. at 318, 94 S.Ct. 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The military judge issued his ruling under M.R.E. 412, which broadly prohibits the introduction of evidence of a victim\u2019s past sexual behavior or sexual predisposition, unless the evidence fits into one of three narrow exceptions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant moved to admit the facts of SR\u2019s secret under M.R.E. 412(b)(1)(C), which provides an exception for \u201cevidence the exclusion of which would violate the constitutional rights of the accused.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Evidence that is offered under an enumerated exception to M.R.E. 412 shall be admitted if the military judge determines that the evidence is relevant and that the probative value outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice \u2014 i.e., prejudice to the privacy interests of the alleged victim. <em>See </em>M.R.E. 412(c)(3); <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>44 M.J. 174, 178 (C.A.A.F.1996). In addition, relevant evidence that is offered under the constitutionally required exception must be admitted if it is material and favorable to the defense, and therefore is necessary. <em>United States v. Banker, </em>60 M.J. 216, 222 (C.A.A.F. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In a detailed ruling, the military judge correctly determined that evidence of * * *[REDACTED]* * * was relevant evidence of SR\u2019s motive to make a false claim of indecent assault against Appellant, stating, \u201cI agree that this theory would be a valid reason for admitting this evidence under M.R.E. 412(b)(1)(G)....\u201d (Appellate Ex. CLIII at 3.) The military judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">* * \u2019\u201c[REDACTED]* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">However, the military judge then went on to conclude that the evidence had \u201clow\u201d probative value because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>[T]he evidence proffered that [SR] made these statements is not strong since it comes from the accused, who has an obvious bias. [SR]\u2019s written statement and Article 32 testimony on this point is not clear. She admitted at the Article 32 that she only partially confided in Cadet Smith in May and fully confided in him on October 19th; * * * [REDACTED] * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">I would find that the military judge erred when he decided the probative value of motive evidence based on his evaluation of the credibility of the only two witnesses involved. It is the members\u2019 role to determine whether a witness\u2019 testimony is credible or biased. <em>Bins, </em>43 M.J. at 85. \u201cIn applying M.R.E. 412, the judge is not asked to determine if the proffered evidence is true; it is for the members to weigh the evidence and determine its veracity.\u201d <em>Banker, </em>60 M.J. at 224. Accordingly, relevant and material evidence of * * * [REDACTED]* * * is no less admissible merely because it is offered through the testimony of the criminal accused. This is particularly so here, where SR \u2014 the only other witness to the conversation in issue\u2014 secured her unavailability to testify at the motions hearing by invoking her rights against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (R. at 79.) In a credibility contest between Appellant and SR, it should have been up to the members to resolve discrepancies in their respective accounts and decide whom to believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">As a second basis for excluding the defense evidence, the military judge concluded that SR\u2019s statement to Appellant was materially different from a report that she subsequently provided to investigators. The military judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">* * ^[REDACTED]* * *, this would have little value in proving that her <em>official </em>allegations against Cadet Smith <em>resulting in a public trial </em>are also false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">(Appellate Ex. CLIII at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">The military judge then concluded, \u201c[T]he minima] probative value of this evidence is outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice to [SR\u2019s] privacy interests and the potential danger of sidetracking the member\u2019s [sic] attention to a collateral issue____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">In a trial on charges of extortion and coerced sexual relations, I do not agree that the defense intrudes in a collateral matter by making an inquiry into facts that describe the victim\u2019s fear that her secret will be revealed. Proof of the secret\u2019s existence and the genuineness of SR\u2019s fear of disclosure were key issues in the Government\u2019s case against Appellant, and the defense had a right to explore them, subject to carefully tailored restrictions respecting SR\u2019s privacy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, by focusing on the confidential versus official nature of SR\u2019s two statements, the military judge overlooked the greater significance of the defense proffer. The defense theory was that SR\u2019s ultimate motive in avoiding discipline was revealed in her expectation that Appellant would place his reputation on the line and communicate false information to counter rumors then in circulation about her secret.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defense argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>this same motive was also present in her complaint against Appellant, and it seems an artificial distinction to say that the formality of the complaint process somehow altered SR\u2019s overriding concern for protecting her career. <em>Compare United States v. Bahr, </em>33 M.J. 228, 233 (C.M.A.1991) (error to exclude evidence of witness\u2019 prior false statements to classmates that she had been sexually assaulted; evidence was admissible to show witness\u2019 motive to testify falsely against accused in order to call attention to herself).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The majority largely sidesteps the problems with the M.R.E. 412 order and under its Article 66(c), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), authority concludes that the instant case involves non-parallel statements \u2014 an earlier statement to Appellant where avoiding discipline was a factor in SR\u2019s motivation to lie, and a second statement to law enforcement investigators where no such motive existed because nobody else knew about the encounter and SR had no reason to fear UCMJ action. The majority emphatically concludes that because SR had no possible motive to fabricate her allegations against Appellant, the earlier statement was not relevant and therefore was inadmissible at trial. The flaw in the majority\u2019s argument is the implicit assumption that no circumstances other than the <em>actual disclosure </em>of the facts surrounding the Chase Hall encounter could have provided SR with the motive to fabricate allegations of sexual assault. In my view, the timing, content, and circumstances surrounding SR\u2019s initial report to investigators all point to the making of an intrinsically unreliable statement, and provide sufficient grounds to question SR\u2019s motives in bringing her allegations against Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The record reveals that on 5 December 2005, Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) agents interviewed Appellant \u2014 the other person who knew of the Chase Hall encounter \u2014 as part of a large-scale probe into allegations of his sexual misconduct at the Coast Guard Academy. SR was not interviewed by CGIS until almost two months later, on 9 February 2006,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at which time she discussed her allegations against Appellant but specifically refused to address the details of her secret. SR\u2019s self-censored initial report reveals that she had made the understandable but nevertheless calculated decision to limit the disclosure of information that could be harmful to her career.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such a decision on SR\u2019s part following a considerable opportunity for reflection necessarily calls into question the completeness and reliability of her contemporaneous allegations against Appellant. Given the visibility of this dragnet investigation, the four-month delay between the Chase Hall encounter and SR\u2019s initial report, and her selective and continued withholding of facts that did not reflect favorably on her, it certainly was possible that SR fabricated or embellished details of her allegation against Appellant as a preemptive strike to avoid discipline, based on her <em>fear or expectation </em>that the true facts of their encounter, if not already known by investigators, likely would be discovered.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ingly, the two statements were \u201cparallel\u201d not because anyone else knew the facts, but because of the illegality of the encounters and SR\u2019s fear that the true facts <em>could </em>be discovered. Whether or not SR actually formed the motive to fabricate allegations against Appellant was an issue that the members should have decided at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Faced with a recalcitrant key witness who refused to testify at the motions hearing, the Government obtained a windfall through the erroneous application of M.R.E. 412. At trial, SR provided conclusory testimony regarding her \u201cbad situation\u201d and Appellant\u2019s prior role in \u201csquashing\u201d career-threatening rumors, for the purpose of showing that she was coerced into unwanted sexual relations after Appellant impliedly threatened to reveal the truth about her secret. On cross-examination, the defense was prohibited from addressing the facts of SR\u2019s \u201cbad situation\u201d or \u201csecret,\u201d and similarly was prohibited from eliciting factual testimony that would inform the members that Appellant\u2019s efforts to \u201csquash\u201d and \u201csuppress\u201d rumors specifically meant spreading false information provided by SR, on SR\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The result was that the Government was allowed to portray SR as an innocent victim of an extortionist plot, while the defense was not allowed to portray the witness as the architect of a scheme of false allegations intended to cover up her own misconduct. I cannot agree that SR\u2019s privacy interest in shielding her alleged false statements from inquiry was so important that it justified denying Appellant the opportunity to pierce the veneer of the Government\u2019s conclusory assertions that were used to convict him. I disagree with the notion that M.R.E. 412 was intended to allow the Government to prove the <em>carpus delicti </em>of the offenses through a witness indulging in euphemisms of doubtful legal sufficiency, particularly when they obseure facts that raise serious questions concerning her own credibility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">When a constitutional violation is shown, a case must be reversed unless the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Israel, </em>60 M.J. 485, 488 (C.A.A.F. 2005). In deciding whether or not the erroneous exclusion of evidence is harmless, the court must consider \u201cthe importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on materials points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and ... the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>United States v. Moss, </em>63 M.J. 233, 238 (C.A.A.F.2006) <em>(quoting Bahr, 33 </em>M.J. 228 at 234 <em>(quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431 (1986))). At trial, SR testified that on 19 October 2005, she had discussed her secret with Appellant in the mailroom; that Appellant had responded by indicating he needed \u201cmotivation\u201d to keep \u201chelping her\u201d by continuing to suppress rumors that were circulating about her; that she had replied by asking whether by \u201cmotivation\u201d he meant sex \u2014 a suggestion she says made him bristle; that Appellant later appeared in her room in Chase Hall on three separate occasions, where they posed together nude for a photograph and engaged in sexual activity; that the sexual encounter had in her mind provided the \u201cmotivation\u201d Appellant needed to continue to suppress her secret; and that although she never told Appellant to stop, she participated only out of fear that he would not keep her secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Appellant presented his case upon his own testimony, stating in substance that while he met SR in the mailroom on 19 October, he never extorted sexual favors from her and denied saying that he needed \u201cmotivation\u201d to continue suppressing rumors about SR\u2019s se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>cret. Appellant testified that they discussed getting together to pose for a nude photograph in her room; that after arriving in her room that evening, he took two digital photographs of them together, which he kept for safekeeping; and that he subsequently returned to her room on two additional occasions to exchange massages and perform consensual oral sodomy. Appellant admitted that SR was \u201ctense\u201d and \u201cstressed\u201d but claimed that the entire sexual encounter with SR was consensual. (R. at 1325.)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The difficulty accepting Appellant\u2019s account of a consensual encounter with SR is that it makes little intuitive sense given the lack of any evidence of a relationship or any rational explanation for its spontaneous nature. In short, Appellant\u2019s testimony is remarkable in its failure to explain SR\u2019s actions in the absence of at least some undue influence. In this failure, however, lies the major flaw in the military judge\u2019s M.R.E. 412 order. Appellant\u2019s account of an almost spontaneous consensual encounter with SR would be difficult to believe unless the members were informed of SR\u2019s prior false claim and were able to understand the depths of her concern for protecting her career. Only if informed of SR\u2019s prior scheme would the members have considered the possibility that her encounter with Appellant in October 2005 resulted not so much from coercion, but rather from her own calculation that she needed to ensure his continued cooperation in keeping her prior misconduct secret. Only then would the members have considered the possibility that SR might have fabricated a false claim of sexual assault against Appellant as a preemptive strike, out of fear that the encounter would be discovered through an ongoing investigation. The erroneous M.R.E. 412 order deprived Appellant of his best defense to the charges involving SR. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>40 M.J. 77, 80 (C.M.A. 1994) (military judge committed reversible error by excluding evidence of victim\u2019s past sexual behavior under M.R.E. 412; case came down to a credibility contest between witnesses, and the excluded evidence \u201ccould have made [the accused\u2019s] otherwise incredible explanation believable\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>37 M.J. 352, 360 (C.M.A. 1993) (accused\u2019s constitutional right to present evidence of victim\u2019s extramarital affair improperly excluded under M.R.E. 412; excluded evidence would have revealed motive to provide false testimony in order to protect affair, victim was key witness in government\u2019s ease, and evidence of guilt was not overwhelming).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Here, the Government offered no other evidence to support SR\u2019s testimony that her sexual encounter with Appellant, which had many outward indicators of being consensual, actually resulted from coercion. The admission of evidence that SR had furnished Appellant with false information which he then used to counter a career-threatening rumor may well have cast doubt on the veracity of SR\u2019s testimony, and tipped the balance in favor of Appellant\u2019s version of events. Accordingly, I would find that the error in excluding this evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">I would affirm the findings of guilty to sodomy, attempted failure to obey a lawful order, and unauthorized absence. I would set aside the findings of guilty to extortion and indecent assault, and the sentence, and return the case to the Convening Authority for a rehearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-6\">. The defense attempted to develop this alternate theory during cross-examination of SR, but was hamstrung by its inability to speak directly to the facts of the prior false allegation. (R. at 903.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">. In fact, the Government, in apparent acknowledgment of the subtle psychological pressures at work, responsibly determined that it would not charge Appellant with <em>forcible </em>sodomy. In its answer and brief, the Government explained, \u201c[a]s a practical matter, it would be difficult to convict someone of <em>forcible </em>sodomy on these facts, however, that does not mean that the conduct was <em>consensual.\" </em>(Government Br. 7.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-5\">. M.R.E. 412 is modeled after Federal Rule of Evidence 412 and is intended to protect victims of sexual offenses from degrading and embarrassing disclosure of intimate details of their private lives while preserving the constitutional rights of the accused to present a defense. Appendix 22 at A22-36, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\">. I agree with the majority that the trial defense team did not precisely address the admissibility of the evidence in terms of SR\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d to fabricate. Indeed, it appears that the defense objection has assumed greater clarity and focus on appeal. The defense, however, did argue at trial that the evidence implicated Appellant\u2019s confrontation rights to show the witness\u2019s \"biases and ... credibility,\u201d in that it revealed SR's \u201cpattern\" of claiming that * * \u2019\u201c[REDACTED]* * * when disclosure could be damaging to her career. (R. at 97-98.) By focusing on SR\u2019s conscious decision to lie under similar circumstances in order to avoid punishment, the defense adequately raised the issue of SR's motive to fabricate allegations against Appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">. Because SR refused to testify, the military judge based his findings on Appellant\u2019s in-court testimony, SR\u2019s prior written statement, and the non-verbatim summary of her Article 32 testimony. Based on my review of the complete record, I would find that there was at least a reasonable probability that SR provided Appellant with a false account of her secret \u2014 * * * [REDACTED]* * * \u2014 -which he then used to counter rumors on her behalf. Appellant\u2019s testimony concerning their initial conversation was partially corroborated in several key respects by SR\u2019s trial testimony, including her admission that the conversation took place, that she had \u2018\u2018lied\u2019\u2019 to Appellant by omitting details that presented her in a \u201cbad light,\u201d and that Appellant had assisted her by \"squashing\" rumors of her secret. (R. at 878, 901-02.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b625-16\">. The military judge clearly recognized the relevance of the content of the secret to the extortion and indecent assault offenses, observing, \"[I]f the secret is about something that is completely inconsequential, it makes it less likely that [SR] would have been willing to do something against her will.\" (R. at 112.) Ultimately, however, the Government was able to prove both the existence and importance of the secret through the witness\u2019s layering on of additional conclusory statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b625-17\">. There is no dispute that SR did not actively seek out Appellant to lie for her concerning her secret. However, after furnishing Appellant with an allegedly false account of her secret, SR apparently did nothing to discourage Appellant from using that information to counter rumors that were in circulation. In fact, SR\u2019s approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>of Appellant\u2019s efforts to \u201chelp her\u201d by suppressing rumors was reflected in her own trial testimony (R. at 901, 922-23, 926), and Appellant's threatened withholding of that assistance ultimately formed the basis of the Government\u2019s extortion charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">. The record does not disclose whether SR voluntarily came forward or was first approached by CGIS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. In her signed statement to CGIS dated 15 February 2006, SR also indicated, \"A situation occurred, that I do not which [sic] to discuss, which led to rumors (which were grossly exaggerated).\u201d (Appellate Ex. XVII, Enclosure 13 at 1; Appellate Ex. XXI at 2.) SR\u2019s clear attempt to downplay the rumors while at the same time refusing to address them indicates, in my mind at least, a concern for UCMJ or administrative action, if not a desire to deflect official interest in her own behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b626-12\">. Given the ongoing CGIS investigation, there certainly would have been risks to SR in not stepping forward at all. SR likely had no way of knowing if Appellant had already reported their encounter to CGIS agents, leaving the possibility of an unrebutted, potentially career-threatening allegation of sexual misconduct in the hands of authorities. There also was the risk that Appellant might decide to cooperate with authorities and make a preemptive disclosure at a future time. The argument that the record completely foreclosed the possibility of fabrication by SR would make more sense if SR had made a prompt and complete report of her allegations against Appellant at a time prior to the CGIS investigation. That did not happen in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b627-5\">. The record of trial is devoid of any facts that would have explained to the members what these words actually meant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. Certainly there were less burdensome remedies available to the military judge that could have protected the legitimate privacy interests of the victim in this case. The military judge could have fashioned an order restricting the defense from probing the intimate and personal details of the secret, focusing instead on the nature of the encounter * * * [REDACTED] * * *. In addition, the military judge could have closed the proceeding during testimony on the May 2005 incident to protect the victim from undue embarrassment or humiliation. The military judge also could have provided instructions to the members limiting the improper use of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
