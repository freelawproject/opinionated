On 17 April 2007, a panel of this court specified four additional issues.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 25 September 2007, a panel of this court found merit in the appellant\u2019s first assignment of error challenging the legality of the Government\u2019s consent search of his residence in light of <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 164 L.Ed.2d 208 (2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The panel held that \u201cthe search of the appellant\u2019s residence was unreasonable ... and that the exclusionary rule\u2019s remedial objectives outweigh \u2018its substantial social costs\u2019 in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court set aside the findings and sentence and authorized a rehearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On 25 October 2007, the Government filed a motion for <em>en banc </em>reconsideration of the panel decision, which the appellant opposed. On 10 December 2007, this court granted the Government\u2019s motion for <em>en banc </em>reconsideration and directed oral argument on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">a. Whether the search of the appellant\u2019s residence, with the consent of the appellant\u2019s wife, was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution when the appellant had previously objected to such a search; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-14\">b. Whether the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule applies to the evidence seized from the appellant\u2019s home, rendering that evidence admissible at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">On 13 February 2007, oral argument was conducted at Georgetown University Law Center as part of this court\u2019s outreach program.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">We have considered the various pleadings and the very detailed and helpful oral argument. We conclude that the search of the appellant\u2019s residence, with the consent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>appellant\u2019s wife, was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution notwithstanding the appellant\u2019s prior objection to such a search. We further find that even if law enforcement\u2019s reliance on the wife\u2019s consent to search was unreasonable, that the evidence obtained from the search of the appellant\u2019s residence would be admissible under the doctrine of inevitable discovery. We conclude that the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant was committed. Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 859(a) and 866(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Background<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The appellant was the head court reporter at the Marine Corps Base, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, Law Center. The victim, Sergeant (Sgt) E, was the appellant\u2019s subordinate in the court reporting shop. The appellant\u2019s family served as Sgt E\u2019s sponsor and provided lodging for the victim and her son pending her assignment to housing. While residing with the appellant\u2019s family, Sgt E became aware that the appellant used small discreet surveillance equipment to watch the family dog. Moreover, Sgt E was aware of the appellant\u2019s high degree of technical electronic expertise. Over time, the appellant developed and expressed more than a professional interest in the victim, but that interest was not reciprocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The appellant placed a micro-surveillance camera in a hollowed-out electric razor and placed the razor in the work-place bathroom shared by the appellant, the victim, and a military judge. The camera was powered by batteries and transmitted a live video signal to a receiver attached to a video cassette recorder (VCR) located on the appellant\u2019s desk, a few feet from the shared bathroom. The transmitted images were recorded onto a VHS-format video tape in the VCR and later transferred to a computer hard drive in the appellant\u2019s home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">On 18 May 2004, the victim noticed an electric razor with no power plug sitting in the shared bathroom. She picked it up and discovered it was very light and did not work. Suspicious, she believed it might contain a covert video camera. She believed she had seen the same razor on other occasions and that the empty power plug hole was always oriented toward the toilet. The victim opened the razor and discovered a micro-surveillance camera pointing out where the power plug should have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">The victim immediately suspected the appellant. She called the appellant\u2019s wife to report her discovery and to recommend that Mrs. Weston not let her husband \u201clock himself in the computer room.\u201d Immediately following this phone call, Sgt E called the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) and reported the incident. She gave an oral statement of the circumstances of her discovery. Over the next several minutes, the victim received several telephone calls or text messages from the appellant\u2019s wife. At one point, the appellant\u2019s wife stated that the receiver for the camera was in their home and that everything was \u201calright.\u201d In addition, the appellant left several messages on her home telephone-recording device saying that he needed to speak to her and \u201cwill you just give me one minute? Please, just one minute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Based on the information provided by the victim, CID Agent Grimes contacted his civilian supervisor, Agent Stevenson. CID sent a military policeman (MP) to the appellant\u2019s on-base residence where the MP informed the appellant\u2019s wife that CID would like the appellant to come in for an interview. The appellant and his wife drove to CID together and voluntarily presented a functional electric razor, a receiver, and recording equipment to Agent Stevenson. This equipment was not requested by CID. The appellant and his wife stated that the presence of the \u201cfake electric razor\u201d in the bathroom was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\u201cpure accident\u201d and that the appellant had \u201cmistakenly taken the wrong razor to work that day.\u201d The appellant and his wife were then separated and placed in different interview rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">At one point during the separate interviews, Agent Stevenson asked the appellant for consent to search his residence. The appellant refused. Shortly thereafter, Agent Stevenson went to the appellant\u2019s wife, and read and explained to her a Permissive Authorization for Search and Seizure (PASS). The appellant\u2019s wife made 14 separate initials on the form including a correction to the color of one of the family cars. She was clearly apprised of what her husband was accused of from various sources including both the victim and Agent Stevenson. The appellant\u2019s wife appeared anxious to provide information to have the situation defused and dismissed. Agent Stevenson obtained her consent to search the family residence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At this point, Mrs. Weston did not ask whether her husband had been asked for his consent, and the agent did not volunteer the fact that her husband had refused to give consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Agent Stevenson, the appellant\u2019s wife, and other security personnel proceeded to the appellant\u2019s house. Prior to entering the home, one of the CID agents called the duty trial counsel and briefed him on the situation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The attorney agreed they could conduct the search based on the wife\u2019s consent. The agents entered the home and, with Mrs. Weston\u2019s permission, asked the appellant\u2019s children questions relevant to their inquiry. Following this, with Mrs. Weston\u2019s assistance,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> CID agents executed the consent search.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Approximately 20 minutes into the search, the appellant\u2019s wife received a phone call from an attorney friend of the family who asked whether the family was well. Mrs. Weston replied that they were and expressed no concern that anything was amiss vis-a-vis the police search. Two to three minutes later, the attorney called again to advise Mrs. Weston that the search was not in the family\u2019s best interest and that she could terminate it if she wished. Mrs. Weston asked Agent Stevenson if her husband had also authorized the search and was informed he had not. At this point, Mrs. Weston terminated her consent to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">Prior to Mrs. Weston\u2019s termination of consent, the CID had already seized two computers and multiple media storage devices. Mrs. Weston initially demanded the agents leave the seized material. The CID agents again called the duty trial counsel for advice and were informed it was lawful for them to remove evidentiary items that had already been seized at the time Mrs. Weston withdrew her consent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After conferring with her attorney-friend on the phone, Mrs. Weston yielded and permitted the agents to depart with the seized items.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">The seized items were properly logged into CID custody but were not immediately searched. Twenty-nine days later, CID obtained a written authorization from the commanding general to search the appellant\u2019s personal computer. A forensic laboratory executed the search and retrieved 31 deleted videos and still images of the victim in various states of undress in the shared bathroom at the law center. Also retrieved were three deleted photographs depicting the inside of the victim\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">Legality of the Search</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">A military judge\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed for an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of discretion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The military judge\u2019s \u201c[fjindings of fact will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous or unsupported by the record.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We review conclusions of law de novo.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2018We will reverse for an abuse of discretion if the military judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous or if his decision is influenced by an erroneous view of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The appellant does not challenge the accuracy of the military judge\u2019s findings of fact. Having carefully reviewed the record, we concur with the appellant\u2019s assessment and adopt the military judge\u2019s findings of fact as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches by Government actors in areas and places where a reasonable person would have an expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The \u201ctouchstone\u201d of the Fourth Amendment is \u201creasonableness.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Reasonableness is measured in objective terms by the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">A search of a person\u2019s home without a warrant is ordinarily unreasonable, <em>per </em>se.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Various exceptions to this general rule exist however. One such exception is when an individual possessing apparent authority over the premises to be searched voluntarily consents to a search of the premises.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the instant case, the Government argues that, because the appellant\u2019s wife voluntarily consented to the CID search, the warrantless search of their home was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In his first assignment of error, the appellant claims that the search conducted in reliance on his wife\u2019s consent was unreasonable in light of the appellant\u2019s emphatic refusal to consent to the search. In support, the appellant cites the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Randolph. </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief and Assignments of Error of 12 Sep 2006 at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">In <em>Randolph, </em>police were called to the Randolph home for a domestic dispute. Randolph\u2019s wife, in her husband\u2019s presence, told the police that Randolph was a cocaine user and that there was evidence of such in the house. Randolph, standing literally at the threshold of his house, unequivocally refused to consent to a search of the house. His wife, however, readily gave consent to search and led an officer to Randolph\u2019s bedroom, where a section of a drinking straw with a powdery drug residue was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">When considering the validity of the search based on the wife\u2019s consent, the Court applied a \u201cwidely-shared social expectations\u201d test to determine if the wife\u2019s consent could override the husband\u2019s objections under the circumstances. The Court determined it could not. The Court held that, since the wife had no recognized authority in law or social practice to prevail over her husband\u2019s contemporaneous objection, her disputed invitation, without more, gave police no better claim to reasonableness in entering than they would have had in the absence of any consent at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">The Government asserts that <em>Randolph </em>is inapposite because, in the instant case, the appellant was not physically present at the threshold of the residence when he denied consent. This, the Government argues, is a critical distinction. Government Answer dated 23 Oct 2006 at 4. The Government asserts that the appropriate precedent to apply regarding an appellant who is not physically present at the threshold of his home is <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>In <em>Matlock, </em>law enforcement officers arrested the defendant, a bank robbery suspect, in the yard in front of his house. Without asking the defendant whether he would consent to a search, he was placed in a police car. Officers went to the door of the house and were admitted by a woman. The officers told her that they were looking for money and a gun and asked if they could search the house. She consented to a search, including the bedroom she shared with the defendant. The Supreme Court upheld the search noting that \u201cthe consent of one who possesses common authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, non-consenting person with whom that authority is shared.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that a person who shares premises with another \u201cassumes the risk\u201d that, in his absence, the other party will consent to a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">We begin our analysis by noting that the Court in Randolph expressly disavowed any intention of undercutting the continuing viability of <em>Matlock.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court drew what it characterized as a \u201cfine line\u201d and made the following distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenant\u2019s permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not invited to take part in the threshold colloquy, loses out.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Physical presence at the threshold of the residence, therefore, was critical to the <em>Randolph </em>decision and that decision strongly suggests that it should be to our own analysis. Such an inference is also consistent with the Court\u2019s declaration that <em>Matlock </em>continues as viable precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The Court in <em>Randolph </em>also notes that the fine line drawn between the facts of Randolph and <em>Matlock </em>is justified \u201cso long as there is no evidence that the police ... removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection____\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In <em>Matlock, </em>the police placed the suspect under arrest in a police vehicle and thereby, as a practical matter, deprived him of the opportunity to object at the threshold. As the Court upheld the consent search in <em>Matlock, </em>it appears that the motive for removing a suspect from the scene of the search is key. We, interpret <em>Randolph, </em>consistent with <em>Matlock, </em>to say that removal of an accused from his threshold becomes problematic if the purpose of removing him was to deprive him of the opportunity to object to the search. If the purpose was to effect a lawful arrest, as in <em>Matlock, </em>the removal is justified and not a subterfuge to prevent an opportunity for an accused to exercise his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">In the instant case, we note that the appellant and his wife were not arrested but rather voluntarily drove themselves to CID in order to provide what they perceived as proof of his innocence. There is no evidence that CID agents purposefully drew the appellant away from his home in order to deny him the opportunity to object to a search at the threshold. CID had a legitimate investigatory interest in speaking with the appellant and his wife about the victim\u2019s allegations. We further note that the CID agents twice contacted the duty trial counsel to verify that they were proceeding in a lawful manner. Finally, we note that separating potential witnesses for questioning is a routine police practice. Having carefully reviewed the record, we find no evidence that the CID agents removed the appellant from his home or that they separated him from his wife at the CID office for an improper ulteri- or motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">The appellant also asserts in his brief that Mrs. Weston was \u201cunaware that her husband had refused consent\u201d when she granted her consent to the search of her home. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 7. The implication of the appellant\u2019s argument is that CID\u2019s failure to inform his wife somehow rendered her consent involuntary. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">We determine voluntariness from all the circumstances.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Our superior court recently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>adopted <em>the Air </em>Force court\u2019s non-exhaustive list of factors with respect to voluntariness of consent which we have applied to the instant ease.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Based on these factors, the voluntariness of Mrs. Weston\u2019s consent to the search seems clear. Mrs. Weston went to the police station in her own vehicle of her own <em>free will </em>for the expressed purpose of clearing her husband of what she apparently believed were unfounded charges arising from a misunderstanding. She was free to leave at any time. On her own initiative, she brought what she believed were relevant exculpatory electronic items from her home, which she presented to CID. She reviewed the PASS form and initialed it in 14 separate places indicating her understanding of the agent\u2019s request. After arriving at her home with CID agents, Mrs. Weston readily allowed agents to ask her children relevant questions. During the search, she provided a box to carry seized items from the house and during her initial telephone conversation with her attorney-friend; she stated that everything was alright. We find no evidence that she did not fully and completely understand what she was consenting to.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Separate from the voluntariness issue is the Fourth Amendment impact of the appellant\u2019s unambiguous refusal to consent to the search. In <em>Matlock, </em>the accused, arrested and placed in a police car, was never asked to consent to the search of his house. In <em>Illinois v. </em>Rodriguez<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>, a woman with apparent authority admitted police to an apartment in which the sleeping suspect was never asked to consent. In each instance, the Court affirmed the police entry onto the premises and subsequent search notwithstanding the fact that law enforcement officers in each instance <em>could have </em>asked the suspect for permission but elected not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">It is important to note that the majority opinion in <em>Randolph </em>declared the continued viability of <em>Matlock </em>and <em>Rodriguez. </em>It is also important to observe that, unlike Randolph, the CID agents in the instant case were not faced with a \u201csocial custom dilemma, where two physically present co-tenants have contemporaneous competing interests and one consents to a search, while the other objects.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The social custom dilemma in <em>Randolph </em>arose from an open and very public verbal dispute between a husband and wife at the threshold of their home and in the presence of the police. This is a far different situation from the case at bar where the appellant and his wife were interviewed separately and did not engage in a public dispute on their doorstep.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The lack of an open and public dispute between the appellant and his wife significantly diminishes the social custom rationale articulated in <em>Randolph. </em>There is no widely-shared social expectation that a reasonable third party, invited into a home by one of the residents, would decline that invitation merely because he or she was aware that an absent co-tenant objected to their presence. While some reasonable people might think better of visiting a residence if they knew an absent co-tenant did not want them, other reasonable people would have no such qualms. Consequently, it cannot be said there exists a widely-shared social expectation that the reasonable invitee would not accept the invitation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In this regard, we note that Justice Breyer in his concurrence expressly observed that the Court\u2019s opinion \u201cdoes not apply where the objector is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>present and objecting\u201d and that \u201cwere the circumstances to change significantly, so should the result.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We conclude that the Court in <em>Randolph </em>was carefully carving out a narrow exception to the general rule of \u201cassumed risk\u201d in third-party consent cases stated in <em>Matlock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Our narrow interpretation of <em>Randolph </em>appears to be shared by our superior court as well as a majority of federal courts that have considered <em>Randolph </em>in a variety of factual scenarios.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We acknowledge, however, that only two of the federal circuit cases involved defendants who, like the appellant, actively objected to the search of their home. These circuit courts split on the issue.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">As the appellant was not present at the threshold of his home when he expressed his objection to the CID search, we find that there was no \u201csocial dilemma\u201d and that he assumed the risk that his wife might for her own reasons permit such a search. We further find that the search was lawful based on Mrs. Weston\u2019s voluntary consent. Therefore, we hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion when he denied the appellant\u2019s suppression motion. We are cognizant that an objecting, non-present appellant is a case of first impression to our court and to a lesser degree within the federal circuits. Such a lack of clear precedent is not evident, however, with respect to inevitable discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">Inevitable Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the search was illegal and that the exclusionary rule should apply, we agree with the military judge that the computer evidence seized would in any case be admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Military Rule of Evidence 311(b)(2), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.) codifies this exception, stating that evidence that was obtained as a result of an unlawful search or seizure may be used when the evidence would have been obtained even if such unlawful search or seizure had not been made.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> When the Government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that routine procedures of a law enforcement agency would inevitably find the same evidence, the rule of inevitable discovery applies even in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the absence of a prior or parallel investigation.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In determining whether the computer would \u201cinevitably\u201d have been properly seized, independent of an improper initial search or seizure, we consider the totality of the circumstances. The relevant facts are those that existed at the time of the initial search and seizure on 18 May 2004. On that day, the victim brought the \u201cgutted\u201d electric razor containing a micro-camera to Agent Grimes. Sgt E told him that she recognized the razor as belonging to the appellant because she had seen him bring it to the office several times. She also told Agent Grimes that the appellant had knowledge of computers and surveillance equipment. She knew this because the appellant had shown her surveillance equipment at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Agent Stevenson was a civilian CID investigator who supervised Agent Grimes. Agent Grimes was her trainee and the \u201cduty investigator\u201d on 18 May 2004. Both were present at the CID office when the appellant and his wife arrived and were placed in separate interview rooms. Agent Stevenson interviewed both the appellant and his wife, and obtained Mrs. Weston\u2019s consent to a search of her home. At this point, Agent(s) Stevenson, Grimes, and Gasper went with Mrs. Weston to her home to conduct the consent search at issue in this case. Before entering the home, Agent Gasper contacted the trial counsel by phone to brief him. The attorney was readily available at that time and was again consulted by phone during the search. Agent Stevenson directed the search of the home and the seizure of the computer by Agent Gasper and she told the other agents when to \u201cwrap everything up.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Notwithstanding Mrs. Weston\u2019s assertion to the contrary, the weight of the evidence indicates that the agents did not turn on the computer prior to or after seizing it, in part, because they were aware of the need for a separate search authorization to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">Agent Grimes\u2019 testimony reveals that he knew a warrant was required to examine the contents of the computer and that he knew the process for getting a warrant.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> His testimony specifically revealed that he knew probable cause had to be established and he knew he had to coordinate through the staff judge advocate\u2019s (SJA) office to the commanding general (CG) or other authorizing official. He also knew where the CG\u2019s office was located.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> It is clear that an established process for obtaining search authorizations existed at Marine Corps Base Hawaii and that this process was used by Agent Grimes to secure authorization to search the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">Under these facts, had Mrs. Weston not consented to the initial search, it is reasonable to conclude that Agent Stevenson would probably have maintained the temporary control she had over the suspect and his house and she would have expedited efforts to obtain a proper search authorization based on the existing probable cause. It would be wholly unreasonable to conclude that Agent Stevenson would have simply abandoned her efforts to find and secure the computer in the face of a lack of consent.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> It is equally unreasonable to conclude that she would not have applied her superior knowledge and experience in using the existing and available resources, including the trial counsel, to quickly obtain a search authorization had that, in fact, been necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">The fact that, having secured the computer, Agent Stevenson elected to delegate responsibility to her trainee to obtain a warrant to search the contents of the seized computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>is of little moment. Tasking a subordinate to obtain a search warrant when the computer evidence is already safe and secure in the CID evidence locker has far less urgency than the situation that would have existed had Mrs. Weston declined to consent to the initial search. Having found by a preponderance of the evidence that the Government would inevitably have obtained authorization to seize the appellant\u2019s computer in a timely manner, we further find that the military judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Findings Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The appellant also raises three assignments of error relating to the military judge\u2019s instructions on findings. Specifically, the appellant asserts that the military judge\u2019s instructions concerning the elements of the specification under Charge II (housebreaking) and Specifications 1 and 2 under Charge III (invasion of privacy) were incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">At trial, the appellant failed to object to any of the military judge\u2019s instructions. Such failure to object constitutes waiver of the objection in the absence of plain error.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> To establish plain error, the appellant must demonstrate that there was error, that the error was plain or obvious, and that the error materially prejudiced the appellant\u2019s substantial rights.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We review a military judge\u2019s instructions <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The military judge correctly instructed the members of the elements of the charged offense of housebreaking.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The military judge then listed the elements of the underlying offense of invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The military judge also instructed the members that \u201cas a matter of law\u201d the offense charged is most closely analogous to the military offense of disorderly conduct. He then proceeded to give the members several definitions relating to disorderly conduct. He did not, however, give any of the elements of the latter offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">Based on these facts, the appellant now argues that the military judge\u2019s use of the language \u201cas a matter of law\u201d virtually equated the elements of disorderly conduct with invasion of privacy and that \u201cit is entirely possible\u201d that the appellant was convicted for unlawfully entering the victims home to commit disorderly conduct which is a totally different offense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">The appellant\u2019s argument ignores the military judge\u2019s clear instruction that the members could only convict the appellant if they found beyond a reasonable doubt that, <em>inter alia, </em>the appellant entered the house for the purpose of committing an invasion of privacy. Further the military judge gave only definitions relating to disorderly conduct and did not provide the members with the actual elements of that offense. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that no reasonable member could have interpreted the military judge\u2019s instructions to permit a finding of guilty to housebreaking without finding that the appellant entered the victim\u2019s house with the intent to commit an invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the military judge erred, we hold the appellant\u2019s assertion of prejudice to be speculative at best. We, therefore, find that the appellant has not met his burden to demonstrate plain error.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Cruelty and Maltreatment</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The appellant asserts that the members were not properly instructed on the maximum possible sentence under Charge III (invasion of privacy). In this instance, the appellant properly objected at trial. We review a military judge\u2019s instructions <em>de </em>novo.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The appellant\u2019s offenses under Charge III (invasion of privacy) are not specifically listed in Part IV of the Manual for Courts-Martial. The maximum punishment for unlisted offenses is that which is provided in Part IV for the listed offenses to which the conduct was most \u201cclosely related.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> During the pre-sentencing portion of the trial, the military judge determined that the most closely related offense to the conduct alleged under Charge III was cruelty and maltreatment of a subordinate.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The appellant argues that the military judge erred in that the offense of disorderly conduct was more closely related.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In support of his assertion, the appellant relies upon two Army court cases. We do not find either of these cases persuasive as the victim in each instance was either a civilian or senior to the accused.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> In the instant ease, the victim worked directly for the appellant and had day to day contact with him. The direct senior subordinate relationship between the appellant and the victim is significant to our analysis. The appellant acknowledges that \u201cundoubtedly she experienced mental pain and/or suffering.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 17. The appellant\u2019s activities constituted a form of sexual harassment which caused the victim mental pain and anguish and as such his offense is more closely related to maltreatment of a subordinate. That she didn\u2019t experience this suffering until after the appellant\u2019s activities were revealed is of little moment. We find, therefore, that this assignment of error is without merit.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The court\u2019s opinion issued on 25 September 2007 is hereby set aside. The findings and the approved sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">Chief Judge RITTER, Senior Judge ROLPH, Senior Judge FELTHAM, Senior Judge WHITE, Judge O\u2019TOOLE, Judge KELLY, Judge MITCHELL, Judge VINCENT, Judge STOLASZ, and Judge COUCH concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\">. The appellant initially raised six assignments of error asserting that (1) the military judge\u2019s conclusion of law that consent to search the appellant's home was voluntary is erroneous in light of <em>Georgia v. Randolph; </em>(2) the military judge\u2019s instructions to the members concerning the elements of the specification under Charge II (housebreaking) were incorrect; (3) the military judge\u2019s instructions to the members concerning the elements of Specification 1 of Charge III (invasion of privacy) were incorrect; (4) the military judge\u2019s instructions to the members concerning the elements of Specification 2 of Charge III (invasion of privacy) were incorrect; (5) the military judge erred in determining, for purposes of sentencing, that the most closely related offense to Specification 1 of Charge III (invasion of privacy) was cruelty and maltreatment under Article 93, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 893; and (6) the combination of trial counsel's references to uncharged misconduct during direct testimony and closing argument unfairly inflamed the passions of the members into believing that the appellant is a sexual predator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">. (1) If the search of the appellant\u2019s residence was unreasonable in light of <em>Randolph, </em>are there any exceptions that would allow admission of the seized evidence; (2) if the initial search of the appellant\u2019s home was reasonable, whether the Government had authority to remove personal property from the appellant\u2019s home once the appellant\u2019s wife orally withdrew her written permission for the Government to \u201cremove and retain any property of papers found during the search\u201d as stated in the permissive authorization for search and seizure of 18 May 2004 (Appellate Exhibit IV at 19); (3) if the Government did not have authority to remove personal property from the appellant\u2019s home, whether there is an exception to the warrant requirement that made seizure of that personal property reasonable in light of <em>Illinois v. McArthur, </em>531 U.S. 326, 121 S.Ct. 946, 148 L.Ed.2d 838 (2001); and (4) if the search of the appellant\u2019s residence and the seizure of his personal property were unreasonable <em>ab initio </em>or after consent was withdrawn, and no exceptions to the warrant requirement are applicable, whether the exclusionary rule would be applied under the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-18\">. <em>United States v.
