The BTA predicated the increase on an appraisal offered by the Olmsted Falls Board of Education (\u201cschool board\u201d) at the hearing before the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d). The BTA rejected the BOR\u2019s valuation of the property at $325,000 and adopted a true value of $1,200,000 for the tax year 2003, a figure that represents an increase of 369 percent over the $325,000 value that the BTA attached to the property for the tax year 2002. M &amp; B Olmsted asserts that the BTA\u2019s determination of value should be reversed for two reasons: a lack of evidentiary support and inconsistency in the BTA\u2019s evaluation of appraisal evidence for successive tax years. Upon careful consideration of the record in the light of the appellant\u2019s contentions, we conclude that the BTA decision is reasonable and lawful and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">{\u00b6 2} At issue is the tax-year-2003 value of a 1.5674-acre parcel formed in 1998 when a larger tract was split into smaller lots. In September 1997, M &amp; B Olmsted\u2019s predecessor, Olmsted Holdings, L.L.C., purchased the original 10-acre tract for $225,000. At that time, the tract was improved with an aging middle-school complex consisting of a large two-story classroom building, two one-story classroom wings, and a gymnasium. The lot split created, among other parcels, the parcel at issue: a 1.5674-acre (68,258 square-foot) lot on which the two one-story classroom wings stood, and whose use as of the tax lien date was as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>daycare center operated by the property owner. The existing structures were renovated and joined together in a single building of 20,000 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 3} For tax year 1998, the BTA adopted the September 1997 sale price of $225,000 as the value of the original 10-acre property. <em>Olmsted Holdings, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(May 7, 2004), BTA Nos. 2002-M-2524, 2002-M-2546, 2002-M-2620, and 2002-M-2628 through 2632. For tax year 1999, the BTA adopted the value as determined by the BOR, $140,000, after determining that the evidence presented by the school board did not justify a different value. Id. at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 4} For the next tax year, 2000, the BOR valued the subject at $325,000, and the BTA reverted to that value after finding the school board\u2019s appraisal unreliable. <em>Olmsted Falls Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(June 11, 2004), BTA Nos. 2002-A-2617 and 2002-A-2618, at 11. The value of $325,000 carried forward to 2001 and 2002 because the complaint for tax year 2000 was treated as a continuing complaint pursuant to R.C. 5715.19(D). Id. at 4-5, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 5} The school board initiated the present case with a complaint against the county\u2019s valuation of the property for the 2003 tax year. The auditor had carried forward the $325,000 value to the 2003 year, and the school board sought an increase to $1,200,000. At the BOR, the school board presented the 1999 appraisal along with supplemental documentation of comparable sales.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BOR retained the auditor\u2019s value, and the school board appealed to the BTA, which adopted the school board\u2019s proposed value of $1,200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\n<em>Appraisal evidence in the previous cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 6} M &amp; B Olmsted places at issue the BTA\u2019s consideration of the appraisal in this case with its consideration of the appraisals the school board had offered previously. In support of the school board\u2019s complaint for tax year 1999, the BTA considered an appraisal report authored and certified by James T. Caldwell and Timothy C. Nash, which was prepared on July 19, 2002. That appraisal relied exclusively on a sales-comparison approach to arrive at a value of $325,000 for tax year 1999. The BTA rejected the appraisal, stating that the school board\u2019s appraisers \u201cfailed to consider the recent, comparable sales\u201d of the companion lots that had been subdivided out of the original 10-acre tract. <em>Olmsted Holdings, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(May 7, 2004), BTA Nos. 2002-M-2524, 2002-M-2546, 2002-M-2620, and 2002-M-2628 through 2632, at 13, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>{\u00b6 7} In support of its complaint for tax year 2000, the school board presented a new appraisal report and the testimony of its author, Timothy Nash, at the BTA hearing. Nash\u2019s report opined a value of $460,000 for tax year 2000, $800,000 for tax year 2001, and $1,200,000 for tax year 2002. The appraisal relied on sales-comparison approaches to derive values for 2000 and 2001. For 2002, the report reconciled a sales-comparison approach yielding a value of $1,200,000, and an income-capitalization approach that generated a value of $1,215,000, concluding that the value of the property was $1,200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 8} The BTA rejected this appraisal for several reasons. First, the board noted that the appraiser had not supplied interior photographs of the subject or the properties he utilized as comparable sales. Second, the board observed that the appraiser had not viewed the interiors of seven of the nine comparables. Third, the board faulted the appraiser for not verifying the terms of sales of the comparables or the status of their compliance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and with zoning restrictions. Fourth, the appraiser did not supply information concerning the renovation costs of the property at issue and the comparables, which deprived his adjustments of adequate support. Finally, the board renewed the objection that the appraiser did not consider the sales of the companion parcels. <em>Olmsted Falls Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(June 11, 2004), BTA Nos. 2002-A-2617 and 2002-A-2618, at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 9} With regard to the income-capitalization approach for tax year 2002, the board noted characteristics that called into question the comparability of the other properties as sources of rent. Id. at 11. Moreover, the board faulted Nash for not supplying information in support of vacancy/credit loss, expense, and capitalization rate. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\n<em>Appraisal evidence in the present case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 10} In the present case, Nash updated his report to opine a value of $1,200,000 for tax year 2003. Observing that Nash made no changes to the income-capitalization approach, the board declined to place any reliance on that portion of the appraisal. <em>Olmsted Falls Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Apr. 29, 2008), BTA No. 2005-H-1436, at 9. With respect to the sales-comparison approach, the board noted that the appraisal still lacked internal photos and internal inspection by the appraiser. But the board found that Nash, by contrast with the earlier appraisal, provided specific adjustments to account for the differences in the comparison properties, and the appraiser furnished more information generally, along with a number of additional comparable sales. Id. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 11} Also significant to the board was Nash\u2019s cost valuation of the land, which supported his conclusions, as well as the appraiser\u2019s testimony that the immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>area had become the focal point of the community as a result of the development of the adjacent parcels. Id. The BTA accordingly adopted the appraiser\u2019s valuation of the property at $1,200,000 for tax year 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 12} Under our cases, \u201c \u2018[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support,\u2019 \u201d the court will affirm. <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483. On the other hand, the court \u201c \u2018will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. Through its propositions of law, M &amp; B Olmsted advances two interrelated arguments, both asserting legal error in the BTA\u2019s determination of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 13} First, M <em>&amp; </em>B Olmsted argues that a principle of consistency from one tax year to the next precludes the BTA\u2019s determination in this case. Second, M &amp; B Olmsted contends that the BTA\u2019s determination of value is not supported by the evidence, given the appraisal presented in this case and its relationship to a similar appraisal that the BTA previously had rejected as not probative. We find that neither argument entitles M &amp; B Olmsted to a reversal of the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\n<em>No doctrine of estoppel or consistency barred the BTA\u2019s determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">{\u00b6 14} The value of the property as determined by the BTA rose from $325,000 for tax year 2002 to $1,200,000 for tax year 2003. M &amp; B Olmsted argues that this precipitous increase in value is not supported by the record and that it contravenes legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">{\u00b6 15} In its notice of appeal and its brief, M &amp; B Olmsted first contends that estoppel bars the BTA\u2019s determination in this case. At oral argument, counsel conceded that the case does not present a \u201cclassic\u201d type of estoppel. But the issue has been presented, and we therefore address it. We hold that collateral estoppel does not bar the board\u2019s determination of value in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">{\u00b6 16} First, we regard it as elemental that for purposes of any challenge to the valuation of real property, each tax year constitutes a new \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201ccause of action,\u201d such that the determination of value for one tax year does not operate as res judicata that would bar litigation of value as to the next tax year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>5715.19(A) and (D) (complaint against valuation pertains to \u201ccurrent\u201d tax year and any other years subject to \u201ccontinuing complaint\u201d rule); see <em>Std. Oil Co. v. Zangerle </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 505, 511, 514, 516, 26 O.O. 82, 49 N.E.2d 406 (language of Ohio statutes concerning determination of property value consistent with the proposition that \u201ceach year\u2019s taxes are the basis of a distinct and separate cause of action\u201d); accord <em>Freshwater v. Belmont Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 26, 28-29, 684 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 17} Second, M &amp; B Olmsted frames its argument as involving an \u201cestoppel.\u201d To be sure, we have acknowledged a narrow range of applicability for the doctrine of collateral estoppel in tax proceedings. See <em>Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 133, 135-136, 16 O.O.3d 150, 403 N.E.2d 996. For purposes of collateral estoppel, the ultimate issue of tax value in one tax year does not constitute the \u201csame issue\u201d as the ultimate issue of tax value in a different year. <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Dec. 28, 1993), Franklin App. 92AP-1715, 1993 WL 540285, at *3; accord <em>Hubbard Press v. Tracy </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 564, 565, 621 N.E.2d 396 (new determination of the ultimate issue of exempt status of real property not precluded by contrary determination of that issue in a prior tax year). But the determination in an earlier year of a discrete factual/legal issue that is common to successive tax years may bar relitigation of that discrete issue in the later years. <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. </em>at *3 (owner could not relitigate the issue of the arm\u2019s-length character of a particular sale of the property when the owner had litigated and lost that issue on a valuation complaint pertaining to a prior year).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 18} Applying these precepts, we conclude that M &amp; B Olmsted\u2019s collateral estoppel theory must fail because the taxpayer mistakenly equates the ultimate issue of property value for tax year 2002 with the issue of value for tax year 2003 as if they were the \u201csame issue.\u201d There is no collateral estoppel in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 19} We now turn to the contention on which M &amp; B Olmsted focuses its argument. Olmsted asserts first that the BTA is subject to a legal constraint of consistency when it determines the value of property in successive years: the determination of value for a later tax year may not deviate from the determination of value for an earlier tax year unless there is evidence showing a change of value from one year to the next. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 20} As a matter of both case law and elementary principles, each tax year should be determined based on the evidence presented to the assessor that pertains to that year. We have so held in the past. See <em>Freshwater, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 29, 684 N.E.2d 304 (\u201cWhen the BTA makes a determination of true value for a given year, such determination is to be based on the evidence presented to it in that case, uncontrolled by the value assessed for prior years\u201d); <em>Fawn Lake </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>Apts. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 609, 612, 710 N.E.2d 681 (party that challenges the county\u2019s valuation at the BTA need not prove that determination of value as to earlier tax year was wrong because the \u201cdetermination of taxable value as of a given tax lien date does not involve the valuation at a prior tax lien date\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 21} Moreover, our decision in <em>Freshwater </em>states the basic reason for this holding. To insist that the party who challenges the valuation of a parcel show a change from the value determined for a prior year would require that \u201cthe prior year\u2019s valuation should be deemed to be correct,\u201d and in actuality, it \u201cmay not be correct.\u201d 80 Ohio St.3d at 28, 684 N.E.2d 304. Quite simply, neither a board of revision, nor the BTA, nor this court has authority to adjudicate the value for a tax year that as a procedural matter, is not before the respective tribunal. See <em>Cleveland Mun. School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 404, 2005-Ohio-2285, 827 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 14. To presume that the earlier year\u2019s value was correct while having no authority to determine its validity would interfere with the statutory mandate that the assessor should determine the <em>correct </em>value <em>as of the tax-lien date of the current tax year. </em>R.C. 5715.19(A)(1)(d) (valuation complaint pertains to \u201cthe current tax year\u201d); <em>Olmsted Falls Village Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 552, 555, 664 N.E.2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 22} The present case exemplifies the point. The appraiser noted that after the split of the larger tract into the current adjacent parcels in 1998, the city of Olmsted Falls established its municipal offices, its police station, and its jails on one of the parcels, while another adjacent parcel is occupied by a community center. As the appraiser testified, \u201cWhere this was just a closed school facility, it\u2019s now the focal point of the whole neighborhood and the focal point of Olmsted Falls.\u201d Although this development of the adjacent parcels was already in progress during earlier years, the appraiser did not adequately document the increase in value of the parcel at issue. But once that sufficient documentation has been presented, the BTA must be free to draw the conclusions the evidence compels.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 23} Because it would interfere with the proper fact-finding function of the BTA, M <em>&amp; </em>B Olmsted\u2019s consistency doctrine must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\n<em>In weighing the evidence before it, the BTA is not bound by earlier decisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 24} M &amp; B Olmsted also argues that we should not defer to the BTA\u2019s evaluation of the evidence in this case because of the way it evaluated evidence on previous valuation complaints. In essence, M &amp; B Olmsted contends that with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>regard to how it evaluates the evidence of value before it, the BTA is subject to a legal constraint of consistency from one tax year to the next.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 25} We disagree. To impose such a consistency requirement would impair the BTA\u2019s plenary authority as a fact-finder to evaluate evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To be sure, consistency in the manner of evaluating evidence is desirable. But the concern for consistency is overridden by the imperative that the BTA correctly determine value in the case before it. To impose a consistency requirement would unduly inhibit the BTA\u2019s power to correct erroneous determinations it had made on earlier occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 26} In disposing of M &amp; B Olmsted\u2019s contentions in this regard, we adhere firmly to two well-settled precepts. First, we \u201c \u2018will not reverse the BTA\u2019s determination on credibility of witnesses and weight given to them testimony unless we find an abuse of * * * discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 309, 2007-Ohio-6, 859 N.E.2d 540, \u00b6 15 <em>(\u201cStrongsville </em>(2007)\u201d), quoting <em>Natl. Church Residence v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 397, 398, 653 N.E.2d 240. A mere allegation of inconsistency from one tax year to the next does not state a claim that discretion has been abused, because it is well settled that abuse of discretion requires the claimant to show an \u201c \u2018attitude [that] is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019\u201d <em>J.M. Smucker, L.L.C. v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-2073, 865 N.E.2d 866, \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 488, 490, 751 N.E.2d 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 27} Second, \u201c[w]ith respect to the valuation of real property, it is the \u2018BTA\u2019s task * * * to determine the fair market value of the property,\u2019 and that issue is \u2018a question of fact, the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strongsville </em>(2007), at \u00b6 22, quoting <em>DAK, PLL v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 84, 2005-Ohio-573, 822 N.E.2d 790, \u00b6 14. In the present case, the BTA determined that a portion of the appraisal evidence was probative of value for tax year 2003, even though similar evidence was not probative of value in prior years. The record shows at least some distinctions in the nature of the evidence presented, and we will not second-guess the precise weight that the BTA accords to each increment of evidence when it determines the value of real property. As in <em>Strongsville </em>(2007), we find that deference is proper because the BTA did not abuse its discretion in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 28} For all the foregoing reasons, the BTA\u2019s decision was reasonable and lawful, and we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b253-8\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\">.

To be sure, under certain circumstances R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) precludes the filing of a second valuation complaint within the same triennium.

We make no comment as to whether the BTA in fact applied different standards for evaluating the evidence in different tax years. We acknowledge that an intentional and arbitrary application of different standards in different cases would raise the question whether the BTA had abused its discretion. We see nothing in the present record, however, that raises such concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b253-9\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A91j\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">{\u00b6 29} For each year since 1997, when the parcel at issue was sold as part of a larger tract to its current owner, the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) has determined the value of the parcel. For 1999, that value was $140,000; for 2000, 2001, and 2002, it was $325,000. In each of those years, the school board presented an appraisal by Timothy Nash, and for each of those years, the BTA rejected the use of the appraisal. Then, in 2003, for the tax year at issue in this case, the BTA surprisingly finds persuasive a modified version of the same appraisal and adopts a value of $1,200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 30} This background suggests that something has gone wrong. Indeed it has. Although the majority correctly concludes that this case does not involve collateral estoppel or a presumption of validity as to a prior year\u2019s valuation, the case does involve the BTA improperly ignoring its own previous findings on specific issues that pertain to the value of the parcel at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">{\u00b6 31} First, the BTA decision that addresses the 1999 tax year specifically notes that the buildings on the original tract needed asbestos remediation, and there is no proof that that has occurred. <em>Olmsted Holdings, L.L.C. v.

Second, with respect to tax year 2002, the BTA specifically held that the school board\u2019s appraisal was not credible because the appraiser had not inspected the interior of most of the comparables. <em>Olmsted Falls Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(June 11, 2004), BTA Nos. 2002-A-2617 and 2002-A-2618, at 9-10. This constitutes a serious objection both in other decisions of the BTA and in the appraisal profession generally. See <em>Medusa Assoc. Ltd. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(May 18, 2007), BTA No. 2005-A-490, at 9; Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (13th Ed.2008) 233. Even though this deficiency persisted in the appraisal for tax year 2003, the BTA refused to attach the same significance to it. <em>Olmsted Falls Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty.

I would reverse and remand with instructions to retain the board of revision\u2019s valuation of $325,000.
