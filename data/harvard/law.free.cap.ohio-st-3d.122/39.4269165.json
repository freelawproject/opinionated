Appellant, John E. Wells Sr., failed to allege with the requisite factual specificity that he lacked an adequate remedy at law to raise his claim that he is entitled to a new sentencing entry that complies with Crim.R. 32(C). Inmates are required to plead specific facts rather than unsupported conclusions. <em>State ex rel. Kimbrough v. Greene, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 116, 2002-Ohio-7042, 781 N.E.2d 155, \u00b6 13. In the absence of pleading specific facts that he had requested that his trial court issue a revised sentencing entry, Wells had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by motion in the trial court. <em>Dunn v. Smith, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 364, 2008-Ohio-4565, 894 N.E.2d 312, \u00b6 8-9. Finally, Wells cannot add new matter to the record on appeal to attempt to establish that the trial court had, in fact, rejected his motions for resentencing. <em>Dzina v. Celebrezze, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 385, 2006-Ohio-1195, 843 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
