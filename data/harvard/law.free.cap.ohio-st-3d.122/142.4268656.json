The BTA based its determination of value on an appraisal report and testimony that Target presented to the board of revision (\u201cBOR\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">{\u00b6 2} The tax year at issue is 2005, and the property at issue consists of an 11.82-acre parcel improved in 1998 with a Target discount store that encompasses 122,522 square feet. The auditor valued the property at $8,188,290. The appraisal report that Target presented to the BOR relied principally on a sales-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>comparison approach that used \u201cbig box\u201d stores originally built to suit the needs of Kmart and Ames but later sold in the context of the bankruptcy of those retailers. The report concluded that the value of the property was $4,500,000 for 2005, and the BTA adopted that figure as the value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 3} The county advances two propositions of law, both of which fault the appraisal that the BTA relied upon for using sales of other properties that were, in the county\u2019s view, not comparable to the property at issue. Because we find that the BTA\u2019s decision is supported by reliable and probative evidence and is, given the evidence before the BTA, both reasonable and lawful, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">{\u00b6 4} On March 24, 2006, Target Corporation (formerly known as Dayton Hudson Corporation) initiated this case by filing a complaint that challenged the auditor\u2019s valuation. The auditor had determined a land value of $2,599,860 plus a $5,588,430 budding value for a total value of $8,188,290. The complaint requested a reduction in value to $5,000,000. At the hearing before the BOR on May 15, 2006, Target presented an appraisal report authored by Robin Lorms and Curtis Hannah, along with Hannah\u2019s testimony. The appraisal determined that the highest and best use of the property if vacant was retail use. As improved, the highest and best use was \u201ccontinued discount storeroom\u201d \u2014 but the appraisers qualified that finding by observing that the \u201cimprovements have significant obsolescence that is typical of most big box developments,\u201d a feature that \u201cresults in a market value which is significantly less than replacement cost less physical depreciation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">{\u00b6 5} Indeed, the topic of economic obsolescence dominates the appraisal report. Although big-box \u201cretailers thrive on efficiency, knowing that their stores are of identical dimensions for purposes of store design, product and display placement and restocking,\u201d from the standpoint of their marketability such big-box structures suffer \u201cfunctional and external obsolescence\u201d because \u201cfew retailers are capable of occupying a space of this size\u201d and accordingly \u201ctenants pay rents which are much lower than rents which would make new construction financially feasible.\u201d Moreover, the \u201c[c]osts to retrofit existing big boxes to accommodate the needs of \u2018first generation\u2019 retailers are too high for financial feasibility.\u201d After a lengthy discussion of big-box marketability, the appraisal states that \u201cthe fee simple market value of these properties is substantially lower than replacement costs, not only due to physical depreciation but also obsolescence. This obsolescence occurs the day they are completed[;] thus even brand new big box stores are worth less than their cost to rebuild.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">{\u00b6 6} These considerations guided the appraisers when they performed the sales-comparison and income-capitalization approaches to valuing the property. Namely, the appraisers selected both as sale and as rent comparables properties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>that had been either sold to second-generation users or leased to second-generation tenants. In particular, four stores \u2014 two abandoned Ames stores and two abandoned Kmarts \u2014 constituted the basis for the sales-comparison approach; that approach yielded a value of $4,500,000. As for rent comparables, the appraisers specifically rejected the use of new discount stores because they were either owner-occupied or leased on a build-to-suit basis. The income approach yielded a valuation of $3,800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 7} After performing an appraisal on the cost approach but rejecting it because of the external obsolescence, the appraisal report relied principally on the sales-comparison approach and viewed the income-capitalization approach as supporting the lower value for the property. As noted, the appraisal determined the value of the property to be $4,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 8} In its decision, the BOR retained the land value at $2,599,860 and reduced the building value to $5,059,520. This adjustment resulted in a total value of $7,659,380. Target appealed to the BTA, where the parties waived a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 9} The BTA reviewed the record and found no \u201cevidence or rationale which supports the BOR\u2019s decision to value the subject at $7,659,380.\u201d <em>Target Corp. v. Greene Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(May 27, 2008), BTA No. 2006-V-751, at 8. In its review of the appraisal, the BTA essentially agreed with the appraisers\u2019 emphasis on the sales-comparison approach. Id. at 11. The BTA specifically observed that the county \u201celected not to provide us with any competing market information that could allow us to come to a different conclusion concerning the subject\u2019s value.\u201d Id. at 12. Additionally, the board rejected the county\u2019s suggestion that the appraisal should have relied on first-generation leasing terms, in particular build-to-suit lease terms, based upon the absence of any evidence to support that theory. Id. The BTA found that Target\u2019s appraisal sustained its burden to show a value different from the one adopted by the BOR. Noting that the county had presented no evidence in rebuttal, the BTA adopted $4,500,000 as the value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 10} Under our cases, we \u201c \u2018will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. On the other hand, \u201c \u2018[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support\u2019 \u201d for the BTA\u2019s decision, we will affirm. Id., quoting <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483. Moreover, we \u201c \u2018will not reverse the BTA\u2019s determination on credibility of witnesses and weight given to their testimony unless we find an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>abuse of * * * discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 309, 2007-Ohio-6, 859 N.E.2d 540, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Natl. Church Residence v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 397, 398, 653 N.E.2d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 11} In this case, the county advances two grounds for reversing the BTA\u2019s decision. Both amount to objections to the manner in which the BTA evaluated the evidence before it, and therefore both must be reviewed with deference to the BTA\u2019s fact-finding. Because the BTA\u2019s decision is supported by reliable and probative evidence, and because the county presented no controverting evidence, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 12} First, the county asserts that the BTA should have used data from the first-generation sale prices and rentals rather than second-generation examples. But as the BTA observed, the appraisers\u2019 research \u201cdid not uncover any sales between first generation users,\u201d and the county \u201coffered no evidence of any sale or lease between first generation users.\u201d <em>Target Corp. v. Greene Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(May 27, 2008), BTA No. 2006-V-751, at 10. This left the record in a state that supported the BTA\u2019s conclusion that \u201csecond generation users are the most viable potential buyers/renters of big-box space.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 13} In particular, the county argues that the appraisal\u2019s reference to \u201csix first generation lease rates for Wal-Mart stores in Ohio\u201d and \u201cfour build-to-suit Kohl\u2019s leases\u201d presented the proper avenue for analyzing the value of the property at issue. The county cites the court\u2019s latest cases in which a recent, arm\u2019s-length sale price was deemed to constitute the value of the property and asserts that these cases support its position.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reject this contention for two reasons. First, the appraisal states specific reasons for not using the first-generation rents as comparable. Second, the case law the county focuses on involves properties encumbered with above-market leases. The present property is not so encumbered, and under these circumstances, comparability cannot be established without more evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 14} The county\u2019s second main argument relies on <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 181, 661 N.E.2d 1056. In <em>Meijer, </em>we affirmed a BTA decision that specifically rejected the type of functional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>obsolescence that Target\u2019s appraisers found to be present in this case. In the context of resolving a battle of appraisals, the BTA in <em>Meijer </em>declined to adopt the larger amount of obsolescence found by the owner\u2019s appraiser. The BTA found \u201cnothing about the present property which is obsolete or useless to the owner due to changing business conditions.\u201d <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Feb. 8, 1995), BTA Nos. 1993-M-731,1993-M-732, and 1993-M-733, at 28. Indeed, \u201c[t]he owner, by purchasing the land and constructing the building, evidences a market need for such a property. Therefore the costs of purchase and construction evidence that a prospective purchaser was willing to pay at least the costs of the property as newly constructed.\u201d Id. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 15} Although the owner argued that this reasoning constituted valuation in use prohibited by the Ohio Constitution, the BTA disagreed, citing our decision in <em>Dinner Bell Meats, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 270, 12 OBR 347, 466 N.E.2d 909. We affirmed the BTA. <em>Meijer, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 181, 661 N.E.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 16} In essence, the county\u2019s reliance on <em>Meijer </em>implicates the special-purpose-property doctrine that we articulated in <em>Dinner Bell Meats. </em>In that case, two competing appraisals employed differing cost approaches based on their respective findings that the property was \u201cspecial purpose\u201d in nature. Id. at 271, 12 OBR 347, 466 N.E.2d 909. We concluded that \u201cin utilizing the \u2018cost approach\u2019 for a \u2018special purpose\u2019 building,\u201d the appraiser \u201csimply considered the utility of the properties in conjunction with the highest and best use of the meatpacking facility.\u201d Id. at 272, 12 OBR 347, 466 N.E.2d 909. In so holding, we acknowledged the general principle that \u201c \u2018the special purpose exception is applied to a building in good condition being used currently and for the foreseeable future for the unique purpose for which it was built,\u2019 \u201d a doctrine necessary to prevent \u201cthe owner of a distinctive, but yet highly useful, building\u201d from \u201cescaping] full property tax liability.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Fed. Res. Bank of Minneapolis v. State </em>(Minn.1981), 313 N.W.2d 619, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 17} While one may speculate on whether, for purposes of tax valuation, the Target store at issue might validly be considered as special-purpose property, we have never in the past disturbed a determination of value by the BTA based on such speculation. To the contrary, each of the decisions in which we have alluded to the special-purpose doctrine involves an appraisal offered in support of the value that was ultimately determined and our affirmance of the BTA\u2019s reliance on that evidence. <em>Meijer, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 181, 661 N.E.2d 1056; <em>Dinner Bell Meats, </em>12 Ohio St.3d 270, 12 OBR 347, 466 N.E.2d 909; <em>Oakwood Club v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 241, 638 N.E.2d 547. Far from furnishing precedent for second-guessing the BTA, to date, our case law concerning special-purpose property has shown deference to the fact-finding expertise of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>tribunal. In the present case, as already discussed, the county presented no evidence in support of its theory that the Target store might qualify as special-purpose property.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 18} For all the foregoing reasons, the BTA reasonably and lawfully adopted the conclusion of value propounded by Target\u2019s appraiser. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-7\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aos\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\">. <em>Berea City School Dist.

Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 270, 272, 12 OBR 347, 466 N.E.2d 909, we held that \u201cin utilizing the \u2018cost approach\u2019 for a \u2018special purpose\u2019 building,\u201d the appraiser \u201csimply considered the utility of the properties in conjunction with the highest and best use\u201d of its current owner. We reasoned that \u201c \u2018the special purpose exception is applied to a building in good condition being used currently and for the foreseeable future for the unique purpose for which it was built,\u2019 \u201d a doctrine necessary to prevent \u201cthe owner of a distinctive, but yet highly useful, building\u201d from \u201cescap[ing] full property tax liability.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Fed. Res. Bank of Minneapolis v. State </em>(Minn.1981), 313 N.W.2d 619, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 20} Later, the BTA applied <em>Dinner Bell Meats </em>in <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Feb. 8, 1995), BTA Nos. 1993-M-731, 1993-M-732, and 1993-M-733. The BTA found \u201cnothing about the present property which is obsolete or useless to the owner,\u201d id. at 28, and held that \u201cthe costs of purchase and construction evidence that a prospective purchaser was willing to pay at least the costs of the property as newly constructed.\u201d Id. at 32. We affirmed the BTA. <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 181, 661 N.E.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 21} Like the meatpacking plant in <em>Dinner Bell Meats </em>and the big-box retail store in <em>Meijer, </em>the Target store in this case has been designed and constructed to suit its owner\u2019s particular business needs. Unlike the owners of the Kmart and Ames stores that Target\u2019s appraiser used as comparable properties, Target is a viable, going concern operating at many locations throughout the state. I believe the BTA erred by not viewing the evidence in light of the case law just cited.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Siegel, Siegel, Johnson &amp; Jennings Co., L.P.A., and Nicholas M.J. Ray, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-h\">James R. Gorry, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">{\u00b6 22} The majority opinion acknowledges the principles that we articulated in <em>Dinner Bell Meats </em>and <em>Meijer </em>but declines to apply them on the grounds that the county presented no evidence. I disagree because I think that auditors, boards, and courts should use common sense, and common sense dictates that Kmart and Ames stores sold out of bankruptcy are not similar to Meijer and Target stores that are still being operated by the successful retailers that built them. In light of that real-world distinction, I would hold that Target failed to discharge its burden to show that its store, constructed in 1998, had become obsolete by 2005. See <em>Rollman &amp; Sons Co. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1955), 163 Ohio St. 363, 56 O.O. 337, 127 N.E.2d 1, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cWhere a taxpayer asserts that functional depreciation should be considered in valuing his property for the purpose of taxation, the burden is upon the taxpayer to prove such depreciation\u201d). I also believe that the BTA erred by not giving sufficient weight to the cost approach in light of the case law. Accordingly, I would vacate the decision below and remand for consideration in light of <em>Dinner Bell Meats </em>and <em>Meijer. </em>I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
