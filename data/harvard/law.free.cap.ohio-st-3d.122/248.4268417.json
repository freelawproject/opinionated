First, we must determine whether a labor organization that obtains written authorization to represent one employee has standing as an \u201cinterested party\u201d to pursue violations of prevailing-wage law on behalf of any other employee on the project. Second, we must determine whether shop employees who work off-site manufacturing materials to be used in or in connection with a public improvement project are entitled to prevailing-wage rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>{\u00b6 2} For the reasons that follow, we hold that a labor organization that is an \u201cinterested party\u201d under R.C. 4115.03(F) may file a prevailing-wage complaint only on behalf of the employee who specifically authorized the action, and R.C. 4115.05 applies only to persons whose work is performed directly on the site of the public improvement project. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 3} Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Association, Local No. 33, appellee (\u201cLocal 33\u201d), is a bona fide labor organization that negotiates with employers concerning wages, hours, terms, and conditions of employment. Gene\u2019s Refrigeration, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., appellant (\u201cGene\u2019s\u201d), is a contractor as defined by Ohio Adm.Code 4101:9-4-02(H) that performs both field construction work and in-shop sheet-metal fabrication. Gene\u2019s was awarded a contract for the construction of the Grainger Fire Station (\u201cproject\u201d) located in Medina County, Ohio. The project was a public improvement within the meaning of Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage law, R.C. 4115.03 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 4} Local 33 filed a complaint against Gene\u2019s for violations of the prevailing-wage law on the Grainger project. Local 33 was not the bargaining representative for Gene\u2019s employees; however, it alleged that it had standing as an \u201cinterested party\u201d under R.C. 4115.03(F)(3) based upon the written authorization of Elie Cherfan, an employee in Gene\u2019s off-site fabrication shop. The complaint asserted multiple prevailing-wage violations by Gene\u2019s that involved reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and wage requirements on the entire project.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 5} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on two legal issues: whether Local 33 has standing to sue on behalf of anyone other than Elie Cherfan and whether the prevailing-wage law applies to employees who performed shop work off the project site. The trial court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">{\u00b6 6} The parties filed a joint motion to reconsider and stipulated to the following facts. Gene\u2019s performs both construction work on the site and sheet-metal fabrication of duct work in an off-site shop. Elie Cherfan was an employee of Gene\u2019s in the off-site fabrication shop. Gene\u2019s paid employees of its off-site fabrication shop, including Elie Cherfan, at regular nonprevailing-wage rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">{\u00b6 7} Elie Cherfan gave written authorization to Local 33 to represent him for purposes of bringing a prevailing-wage complaint and enforcement action. In July 2005, Local 33 filed an administrative prevailing-wage complaint as an interested party pursuant to R.C. 4115.16(A) with the director of the Ohio Department of Commerce, asserting violations of Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage law. After more than 60 days had elapsed from the date of filing with no ruling by the director, Local 33 filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Medina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>County as permitted by R.C. 4115.16(B) with similar allegations of prevailing-wage infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">{\u00b6 8} Upon reconsideration, a magistrate concluded that Elie Cherfan was the only employee of Gene\u2019s to expressly authorize Local 33 to represent him in this action. Thus, Local 33 had standing only on behalf of Elie Cherfan. Further, the shop work that Cherfan performed off-site from the public improvement project was not subject to the wage law. The magistrate granted Gene\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 9} The court of appeals reversed and remanded, concluding that Cherfan\u2019s written authorization allowing Local 33 to represent him was sufficient to impute standing to Local 33 with respect to the entire project and all of Gene\u2019s employees. Medina App. No. 06CA0104-M, 2008-0hio-1005, 2008 WL 623407, \u00b6 22. The court further held that R.C. 4115.05 expressly provides for payment of the prevailing wage to off-site employees, in particular, employees who fabricate materials to be used in or in connection with a public work. Thus, the court held, <em>Clymer v. Zane </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 359, 191 N.E. 123, has been superseded by the legislature. Id. at \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">(\u00b6 10} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal. 118 Ohio St.3d 1505, 2008-Ohio-3369, 889 N.E.2d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">II. Standing as an \u201cInterested Party\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 4115.16(A) authorizes an \u201cinterested party\u201d to file a complaint with the director of commerce alleging a prevailing-wage violation. R.C. 4115.16(B) authorizes the \u201cinterested party\u201d to file a complaint in the court of common pleas of the county in which the violation allegedly occurred if the director has not ruled on the merits within 60 days. An \u201cinterested party\u201d with respect to a particular public improvement is defined in R.C. 4115.03(F) as:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(1) Any person who submits a bid for the purpose of securing the award of a contract for construction of the public improvement;</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(2) Any person acting as a subcontractor of a person mentioned in division (F)(1) of this section;</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(3) <em>Any bona fide organization of labor which has as members </em>or <em>is authorized to represent employees of a person mentioned in division (F)(1) or (2) of this section </em>and which exists, in whole or in part, for the purpose of negotiating with employers concerning the wages, hours, or terms and conditions of employment of employees;</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(4) Any association having as members any of the persons mentioned in division (F)(1) or (2) of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>{\u00b6 16} The parties have stipulated that Local 33 is an interested party under R.C. 4115.03(F)(3) on behalf of Elie Cherfan. The issue before us is whether Local 33\u2019s status as an interested party based on Cherfan\u2019s authorization extends to apply to all employees of the employer on a projectwide basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Intenatl. Assn., Local Union No. 33 v. Mohawk Mechanical, Inc. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 611, 716 N.E.2d 198, we examined a union\u2019s status as an \u201cinterested party\u201d with respect to nonunion employees who worked for Mohawk, a subcontractor on a public improvement project. At the time, the union was attempting to organize Mohawk employees. When the union discovered that Mohawk was not paying prevailing wages to employees working on the project, it filed a complaint under R.C. 4115.16(A). Three Mohawk employees gave the union written authorization to pursue the action after it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 18} We held that the union had standing as an interested party. The employees worked for Mohawk, a subcontractor for \u201ca person mentioned in division (F)(1)\u201d of R.C. 4115.03, and although the union did not negotiate for these employees, at least three of them gave the union written authorization to represent them in the prevailing-wage action. Id. at 614, 716 N.E.2d 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">{\u00b6 19} The court of appeals in the instant case relied on the statement in <em>Mohawk </em>that \u201c[t]he statute does not require that a majority of employees authorize the representation\u201d to support its conclusion that Cherfan\u2019s written authorization alone is sufficient to allow Local 33 to represent all employees on the project. 2008-Ohio-1005, 2008 WL 623407, \u00b6 21, quoting <em>Mohawk, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 614, 716 N.E.2d 198. We do not read <em>Mohawk </em>so broadly. In <em>Mohawk, </em>the union had filed the complaint prior to obtaining authority from <em>any </em>employee. We decided that the written authorization of the three employees was sufficient for purposes of R.C. 4115.03(F)(3) and that the union need not have authorization from a majority of the employees or have represented the employees for purposes of collective bargaining in order to acquire \u201cinterested party\u201d status.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">{\u00b6 20} Furthermore, <em>Mohaivk </em>is distinguishable because the three Mohawk employees worked on the public improvement job site. Here, Cherfan is employed in an off-site shop and has not established that he is entitled to the prevailing wage. Thus, his ability to represent the interests of other employees on the project is even more tenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">{\u00b6 21} The definition of \u201cinterested party\u201d in R.C. 4115.03(F)(3) refers to an <em>\u201corganization </em>of labor which * * * is <em>authorized to represent </em>employees of a person mentioned in division (F)(1) or (2),\u201d as opposed to union members. (Emphasis added.) Thus, the union is an interested party for and may act on behalf of the employee who expressly authorized the union to act. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the text of Cherfan\u2019s authorization expressly designates Local 33 to represent only Cherfan:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cOf my own free will, I hereby authorize Sheet Metal Workers Local 33, its agents and/or representatives <em>to represent me </em>in all matters pertaining to my claims regarding any and all prevailing wage issues * * *. This authorization * * * is effective as of the date I signed it and will remain in effect until I revoke it in writing.\u201d (Emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 23} The dissent in <em>Mohawk </em>aptly explained that an employee\u2019s authorization \u201cis analogous to the creation of an attorney-in-fact relationship.\u201d <em>Mohawk, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 616, 716 N.E.2d 198 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting). To allow the union to bring a complaint on behalf of employees who did not authorize the union to act on their behalf would violate the employees\u2019 right to select their own legal counsel or labor representative. Thus, one employee\u2019s authorization does not extend to all remaining employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 24} Cherfan\u2019s authorization does not confer interested-party status upon Local 33 to pursue prevailing-wage violations on a projectwide basis for employees other than Cherfan. Cherfan\u2019s authorization does not convey carte blanche to the union to pursue claims on behalf of persons who have not agreed to such actions. Therefore, we hold that a labor organization that obtains written authorization to represent one employee does not have standing as an \u201cinterested party\u201d under R.C. 4115.03(F) to pursue violations of the prevailing-wage law on behalf of any other employee on the project, and we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on this issue. Local 33 has standing to pursue prevailing-wage claims on behalf of Cherfan only.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">III. Prevailing Wage</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">{\u00b625} Next, we must determine whether the prevailing-wage law, R.C. 4115.05, applies to an employee whose work is not performed on the actual project site but who works on materials that will be used in or in connection with the project. Local 33 has filed a prevailing-wage claim on behalf of Cherfan. We must decide whether Cherfan, who fabricated ductwork for the project at Gene\u2019s off-site fabrication shop, is entitled to the prevailing wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">{\u00b626} \u201cThe prevailing wage statutes, R.C. 4115.03 through R.C. 4115.16, require contractors and subcontractors for public improvement projects to pay laborers and mechanics the so-called prevailing wage in the locality where the project is to be performed.\u201d <em>J.A. Croson Co. v. J.A. Guy, Inc. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 346, 349, 691 N.E.2d 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">{\u00b627} Gene\u2019s contends that the prevailing-wage law applies only to work performed on the project site, citing <em>Clymer v. Zane, </em>128 Ohio St. 359, 191 N.E. 123, in which this court held that persons who were working off-site in a gravel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>pit were not employees on the public improvement highway project (entitled to the prevailing wage) even though the project\u2019s contractor owned and operated the gravel pit and its materials were used on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 28} The court of appeals in this case concluded that the prevailing-wage statutes were amended the year following <em>Clymer </em>to expressly recognize an off-site employee\u2019s right to be paid at the prevailing rate, thus superseding <em>Clymer. </em>2008-Ohio-1005, 2008 WL 623407, \u00b6 33. The appellate court interpreted the current version of R.C. 4115.05 as mandating prevailing wages for labor \u201cupon any material to be used in or in connection with a public work,\u201d including work that is not performed on the project site. Id. at \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 29} There is no reference in R.C. 4115.05 to where the work must be performed, i.e., whether it must be directly on the project site or be performed off-site. When a statute is subject to varying interpretations, it is ambiguous and we must construe it in a manner that carries out the intent of the General Assembly. <em>Harris v. Van Hoose </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 24, 26, 550 N.E.2d 461. We look to the language of the statute, the circumstances under which the statute was enacted, legislative history, and the consequences of a particular construction when determining the intention of the legislature. R.C. 1.49; <em>Cleveland Mobile Radio Sales, Inc. v. Verizon Wireless, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 394, 2007-Ohio-2203, 865 N.E.2d 1275, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\n<em>A. History of Prevailing-Wage Legislation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">{\u00b6 30} Ohio enacted its first prevailing-wage statutes in 1931 \u201c[t]o establish a fair rate of wages to be paid to workmen and mechanics employed in construction of public improvements.\u201d H.B. No. 3, 114 Ohio Laws 116. The new legislation closely resembled the federal Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, 46 Stat. 1494, which required that laborers or mechanics employed by the contractor or any subcontractor in the construction, alteration, or repair of any public buildings be paid not less than the prevailing rate of wages for work of a similar nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">{\u00b6 31} In 1932, Ohio\u2019s attorney general issued an opinion that the statutory minimum-wage rate did not apply to workers who merely furnish or deliver materials to the construction project (but do not install or fabricate). 1932 Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 4836. In 1934, this court decided <em>Clymer, </em>which held that persons working off-site in a gravel pit are not considered employees on a public highway project that used the gravel and are not entitled to the prevailing wage. <em>Clymer, </em>128 Ohio St. 359, 191 N.E. 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">{\u00b6 32} In 1935, the General Assembly amended the prevailing-wage law, adding the \u201cmaterial to be used\u201d language that now appears in R.C. 4115.05 and is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>issue here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The amendment does not reflect any legislative history or explanation for the changes. There is no indication that the amendment was intended to legislatively overrule or supersede <em>Clymer, </em>and Local 33 offers no support for that assertion. Although R.C. 4115.05 has since been amended several times since 1935, the \u201cmaterial to be used\u201d language at issue has remained consistent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\n<em>B. Statutory Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">{\u00b6 33} The appellate court relied upon the language in the sixth paragraph of R.C. 4115.05: \u201cThe prevailing rate of wages to be paid for a legal day\u2019s work, to laborers, workers, or mechanics, <em>upon any material to be used in or in connection with a public work, </em>shall be not less than the prevailing rate of wages payable for a day\u2019s work in the same trade or occupation in the locality within the state where such public work is being performed and where the material in its final or completed form is to be situated, erected, or used.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 4115.05 does not specifically refer to persons whose work is conducted away from or off the project site. Other paragraphs within R.C. 4115.05 and elsewhere in the prevailing-wage statutory scheme, however, provide insight into the scope of the law. First, R.C. 4115.05 provides that \u201c[t]he prevailing rate of wages to be paid * * * to laborers, workers, or mechanics <em>upon public works </em>shall not be less * * * than the prevailing rate of wages then payable in the same trade or occupation in the locality where such public work is being performed * * and \u201c[e]very contract for a public work shall contain a provision that each laborer, worker, or mechanic, employed by such contractor, subcontractor, or other person <em>about or upon such public work, </em>shall be paid the prevailing rate of wages provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 35} In addition, R.C. 4115.10(A) provides that \u201c[a]ny employee <em>upon any public improvement </em>* * * who is paid less than the fixed rate of wages applicable thereto may recover * * * the difference between the fixed rate of wages and the amount paid * * (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4115.10(B) authorizes \u201c[a]ny employee <em>upon any public improvement </em>who is paid less than the prevailing rate\u201d to file a complaint with the director of commerce. (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4115.032 refers to \u201c[cjonstruction <em>on </em>any project\u201d and \u201ccontractors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>and subcontractors working <em>on </em>such projects\u201d who \u201cshall be subject to and comply with sections 4115.03 to 4115.16 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the law provides that only those on the job site may file a complaint and recover if prevailing wage is not paid, and only those working on the public improvement projects are subject to prevailing-wage statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">{\u00b6 36} In addition, the director of the Department of Commerce is charged with overseeing enforcement of prevailing-wage laws and with determining the applicable prevailing wage for a project. R.C. 4115.032. The schedule of rates must be posted \u201con the site of the work.\u201d R.C. 4115.07. Therefore, the isolated reference in R.C. 4115.05 to \u201cany material\u201d does not comport with the intent of the overall statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 37} In 1990, the Department of Commerce adopted administrative regulations, Ohio Adm.Code 4101:9 \u2014 4 et seq., to facilitate administering the prevailing-wage laws. These regulations were adopted following extensive hearings in which both industry employers and organized labor had opportunities to voice their concerns. They likewise refer to work performed <em>on </em>the job site and do not refer to off-site workers as being entitled to prevailing-wage rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">{\u00b6 38} Statutes and regulations that relate to the same general subject matter may be read in pari materia in order to discover and carry out legislative intent. <em>State ex rel. Ellis Super Valu, Inc. v. Indus. Comm., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 224, 2007-Ohio-4920, 874 N.E.2d 780, \u00b6 13. Construing the language of the entire prevailing-wage statutory scheme along with related regulations, we conclude that the General Assembly did not overrule <em>Clymer, </em>and R.C. 4115.05 does not mandate that prevailing wages be paid to persons who work off-site even if they are working on materials to be used on or in connection with the project. The phrase \u201cany material to be used upon or in connection with\u201d in R.C. 4115.05 must be interpreted as referring to materials on the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\n<em>C. Industry Custom and Practice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 39} Several labor and trade organizations filed amicus briefs in this case. They acknowledge that the construction industry has continued to follow <em>Clymer </em>since the laws were amended in 1935 and applies prevailing-wage laws only to workers <em>on </em>the project site. The position advocated by Local 33 and its amici constitutes a departure from current practice. If the General Assembly had intended to legislatively overrule <em>Clymer </em>and expand the prevailing-wage mandates more than 70 years ago, the applicability of the law would surely have been challenged before now. The appellate court\u2019s conclusion is contrary to current industry standards and practices that continue to apply <em>Clymer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\n<em>D. Unworkable Consequences</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">{\u00b6 40} The appellate court modified the prevailing-wage statute to create a rule for off-site workers. The appellate court tailored application of its interpretation to those off-site workers with an \u201cintimate connection\u201d between the material to be used in or in connection with the public work and the off-site work, thereby adding its own qualifications to the statutory language. The court reasoned that this would enable employers to trace materials made specifically for a particular public work for purposes of paying the off-site workers the prevailing wage. 2008-0hio-1005, 2008 WL 623407, at \u00b6 37. Thus, although the statute did not so specify, the court of appeals concluded, with respect to the off-site fabrication work, that the materials must be fabricated specifically for the project rather than prefabricated materials made in the ordinary course of business by suppliers for use by any and all purchasers. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 41} However, the dissenting judge in the appellate court questioned the majority\u2019s modified interpretation: \u201cThe majority attempts to limit the practical effects of its holding, but one might fairly ask at what point the fabrication process achieves the \u2018intimate connection\u2019 that the majority envisions. When a contractor produces duct work in the normal course of its business for its own use in construction activities, is the connection established when some of its materials are used in relation to a public improvement? Must the fabricator of materials that are incorporated in machines used in job assembly pay the prevailing wage because the machine is ultimately used \u2018in connection with a public work\u2019? When certain off-site employees are paid for fabrication of materials, how is the fraction of their time spent on those items that become part of a public improvement to be determined and compensated out of an entire working day? Must a contractor now record those fractions of working time spent by off-site employees whose work bears a tangential relationship to material used in public improvements? Simply put, the rule is unworkable.\u201d 2008-0hio-1005, 2008 WL 623407, \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 42} The rule created by the appellate court in this case changes the industry custom and practice in place since <em>Clymer. </em>It interjects uncertainty into a process by creating a new standard. However, the court is not the proper forum to determine these difficult policy issues raised by the parties and amici. These issues should be addressed by the General Assembly in a public forum with input from all competing interests, including all labor organizations affected. Such a departure from current prevailing-wage law, custom, and practice properly belongs in the legislative domain as a matter of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 43} Therefore, construing the prevailing-wage statutory scheme and administrative regulations in pari materia, and in conjunction with industry custom and practice, we hold that R.C. 4115.05 applies only to persons whose work is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>performed directly at the site of the public improvement project and that <em>Clymer v. Zane </em>has not been legislatively superseded.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 44} Local 33 is an interested party under R.C. 4115.03(F) on behalf of Elie Cherfan only, based upon his written authorization. This interested-party status does not extend to any other employee on a projectwide basis. In addition, R.C. 4115.05 applies only to persons whose work is performed directly on the site of the public improvement project. Because Elie Cherfan did not work on the project site, he is not entitled to the prevailing-wage rate. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b369-9\">Mover, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ACS\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">.

Being \u201cauthorized to represent employees\u201d makes a labor organization an \u201cinterested party\u201d under R.C. 4115.03(F). Then, we proceed to R.C. 4115.16(B). As an \u201cinterested party,\u201d that labor organization pursuant to R.C. 4115.16(B) \u201cmay file a complaint in the court of common pleas of the county in which the violation is alleged to have occurred.\u201d No statute limits a labor organization\u2019s standing to the person or persons who authorize the labor organization to represent employees. The authorization makes the labor organization an \u201cinterested party.\u201d The labor organization itself, upon filing, becomes the party in the lawsuit \u2014 notice that there is no \u201cet al.\u201d after the labor organization\u2019s name in our own ease heading. It is filing the complaint on behalf of itself; it is raising the issue of an employer\u2019s failure to pay the prevailing wage, in the same way a contractors\u2019 association could file a complaint pursuant to R.C. 4115.03(F)(4) \u2014 under which such an association is an \u201cinterested party\u201d \u2014 and 4115.16. Would the majority worry about how a contractors\u2019 association did not represent <em>any </em>of the workers who might benefit from a successful claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">{\u00b6 47} As for the prevailing-wage issue, let us look at the facts of this case. Gene\u2019s Refrigeration, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. (\u201cGene\u2019s\u201d) bid on the Granger fire station project. Gene\u2019s employees fabricated the ductwork that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>other Gene\u2019s employees would install. This ductwork was not purchased off the shelf from a vendor and was not already in Gene\u2019s inventory. It was specifically fabricated for this specific job.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">{\u00b6 48} We move to the statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cThe prevailing rate of wages to be paid for a legal day\u2019s work, to laborers, workers, or mechanics, <em>upon any material to be used in or in connection with a public work, </em>shall be not less than the prevailing rate of wages payable for a day\u2019s work in the same trade or occupation in the locality within the state where such public work is being performed and <em>where the material in its final or completed form is to be situated, erected, or used.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4115.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 50} The ductwork here was \u201cmaterial to be used in * * * a public work.\u201d We really need not go further. But the majority does; in its analysis of R.C. 4115.05, the majority installs ellipses where the statute establishes that the prevailing wage for work on materials used in connection with the public work shall be the prevailing wage in the locality \u201cwhere the material in its final or completed work or completed form is to be situated, erected, or used.\u201d The statute thus contemplates that some materials for a public work might sometimes be fabricated off-site and establishes that in such a case, the off-site work still qualifies for the prevailing wage; the wage to be paid is the prevailing wage in the locality of the public work. The majority willfully ignores that section of R.C. 4115.05 and instead embarks on jurisprudence by preposition, insisting that work \u201con\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d a public work connotes geographical presence rather than the purpose of the work. Under the majority\u2019s unique application of prepositions, working \u201con\u201d a judicial opinion would require the writer to perch atop his or her computer screen while crafting an opinion. The majority\u2019s locus focus is hocus pocus.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 51} The prevailing-wage statutory scheme at issue in this case is not ambiguous and does not require any divination of legislative intent. That the statute changed after this court\u2019s decision in <em>Clymer v. Zane </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 359, 191 N.E. 123, is remarkable only for the reason that <em>Clymer </em>is good precedent only for a statute that no longer exists. The statute changed after <em>Clymer </em>by adding the \u201cmaterial to be used\u201d language that is at issue in this case. The majority relates that \u201c[t]he amendment does not reflect any legislative history or explanation for the changes. There is no indication that the amendment was intended to legislatively overrule or supersede <em>Clymer, </em>and Local 33 offers no support for that assertion.\u201d Majority opinion, \u00b6 32. First, our job is to interpret the statute as written, not to puzzle over motivations. Second, statements of legislative intent and concomitant referrals to specific holdings of the Ohio Supreme Court are only recent developments. Legislative etiquette has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>changed; formerly, it was a cardinal sin to insert legislative intent into a bill, and that policy was strictly enforced by legislative leaders and by the Legislative Service Commission. If the General Assembly had intended to legislatively overrule <em>Clymer, </em>it certainly would <em>not </em>have said so.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHa\">Cosme, D\u2019Angelo &amp; Szollosi Co., L.P.A., and Joseph M.

But let us concern ourselves only with this case, not a parade of horribles. In this case, Gene\u2019s employees were working on site-specific fabrications; the material they created was for the public project and was not fungible. The employees at issue worked for Gene\u2019s, who was a winning bidder on the public project; they were not once- or twice-removed employees of other companies. Any speaker of English would agree that creating ductwork in an off-site shop for the Granger fire station project would be considered working \u201con\u201d the Granger fire station project. The only relevant question in this case is whether Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage statutes apply to the Gene\u2019s workers involved in preparing ductwork for installation in the Granger fire station. The answer is assuredly \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b372-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>McNamara <em>&amp; </em>McNamara, L.L.P., Keith McNamara, and Jonathan M.
