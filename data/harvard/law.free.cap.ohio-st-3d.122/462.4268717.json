Because the relator has established his entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief, we grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">Recall Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">{\u00b6 2} In 2008, the group known as Take Back Toledo requested a recall petition from Gerald E. Dendinger, the clerk of the Toledo City Council. In November 2008, the clerk sent the group a form for a recall petition. The petition form included the statement \u201cWhoever knowingly signed this petition more than once, signs a name other than his own, or signs when not a legal voter is liable to prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Carleton S. Finkbeiner, is the mayor of the city of Toledo. On April 9, 2009, Take Back Toledo submitted to the clerk of council a signed petition \u201cfor the recall of Carleton S. Finkbeiner who holds the office of Mayor in the City of Toledo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-16\">{\u00b6 4} The clerk of the city council sent the petition to respondents, the Lucas County Board of Elections and its members, to determine the validity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>signatures contained in the petition. Section 87A of the Toledo Charter requires valid signatures of 25 percent of the electors voting in the last city election or, in this case, 19,753 valid signatures, to certify the recall issue to the election ballot. The board examined most of the part-petitions submitted, including 39,994 signatures, and on April 17, it found 20,444 of those signatures to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 5} By letter dated April 20, Finkbeiner informed the clerk of council that he was challenging the sufficiency of the petition because it failed to state that election falsification is a fifth-degree felony. On that same day, however, the clerk certified the sufficiency of the recall petition to the board of elections and requested that the board hold the recall election at the November 3, 2009 general election. Finkbeiner administratively appealed the clerk\u2019s decision to the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, but that appeal has now been dismissed on the clerk\u2019s motion based on the common pleas court\u2019s determination that the decision was not appealable under R.C. Chapter 2506.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Protest and Board of Elections Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 6} On April 28, Finkbeiner filed a protest against the recall petition with the board of elections. Finkbeiner claimed that the petition was defective because (1) it lacked the election-falsification statement that he alleges is required by R.C. 3501.38(J), and (2) over 2,500 additional petition signatures were invalid, so the petition lacked sufficient valid signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 7} The board of elections held a hearing, including sworn testimony, on the protest on May 29 and June 9. On June 9, the board of elections denied Finkbeiner\u2019s protest and certified the recall issue for placement on the November 3, 2009 general election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Prohibition Action</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">{\u00b6 8} On June 23, Finkbeiner filed this original action for a writ of prohibition to prevent respondents from including the mayoral recall issue on the November 3, 2009 general election ballot. On July 16, respondents answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before this court for our S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) determination. Because this case involves the November 3 election, we expedite our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">{\u00b6 10} We must now determine whether dismissal, an alternative writ, or a peremptory writ is appropriate. S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5). Dismissal, which the board and its members request, is required if it appears beyond doubt, after presuming the truth of all material factual allegations of Finkbeiner\u2019s complaint and making all reasonable inferences in his favor, that he is not entitled to the requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>extraordinary relief in prohibition. <em>State ex rel. Mason v. Burnside, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1, 2007-Ohio-6754, 881 N.E.2d 224, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 11} If, however, after so construing Finkbeiner\u2019s complaint, it appears that his prohibition claim may have merit, the court will grant an alternative writ and issue a schedule for the presentation of evidence and briefs. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 12} Finally, if the pertinent facts are uncontroverted and it appears beyond doubt that Finkbeiner is entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition, a peremptory writ will be granted. <em>State ex rel. Sapp v. Franklin Cty. Court of Appeals, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637, 889 N.E.2d 500, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 13} With these standards guiding our S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) determination, we next consider Finkbeiner\u2019s prohibition claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Prohibition Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 14} Finkbeiner requests a writ of prohibition to prevent the board of elections and its members from placing the mayoral recall issue on the November 3, 2009 general election ballot. To be entitled to the writ, Finkbeiner must establish that (1) the board of elections and its members are about to exercise quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ will result in injury for which no adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Upper Arlington v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 478, 2008-Ohio-5093, 895 N.E.2d 177, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 15} Finkbeiner has established the first requirement for the writ because the board of elections \u201cexercised quasi-judicial authority by denying his protest after conducting a hearing that included sworn testimony.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Wellington v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 198, 2008-Ohio-5510, 897 N.E.2d 641, \u00b6 10. Therefore, the dispositive issue is whether Finkbeiner established the remaining prohibition requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Prohibition: Adequate Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">{\u00b6 16} To be entitled to the writ, Finkbeiner is required to establish the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Craig v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 158, 2008-Ohio-706, 882 N.E.2d 435, \u00b6 18, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">{\u00b6 17} Finkbeiner claims that he lacks an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. In their answer, respondents admit that this legal requirement has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">{\u00b6 18} Although this court is not bound by the parties\u2019 stipulation on this legal issue, we hold that the election was sufficiently imminent at the time the elections board denied Finkbeiner\u2019s protest and when Finkbeiner filed this prohibition action that he lacked an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>State ex rel. Thurn v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 289, 291-292, 649 N.E.2d 1205, quoting <em>State ex rel. Smart v. McKinley </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 5, 6, 18 O.O.3d 128, 412 N.E.2d 393 (\u201cConcerning the third prerequisite for a writ of prohibition, given the proximity of the election, an injunction would arguably not constitute an adequate remedy because any \u2018appellate process would last well past the election\u2019 \u201d); cf. <em>Tatman v. Fairfield Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 425, 2004-Ohio-3701, 811 N.E.2d 1130, \u00b6 18-19; <em>State ex rel. Gains v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1433, 2008-Ohio-4442, 893 N.E.2d 197; and <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-4334, 854 N.E.2d 1025, \u00b6 42-45, which are all cases in which the time periods before the pertinent elections were somewhat lengthier than those involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 19} In this regard, we are now about two months away from the date that absentee ballots must be printed and available for use. R.C. 3509.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 20} Furthermore, prospective relators in election-related cases should not be placed in an impossible situation. On the one hand, we have barred them from filing election-related actions if they do not bring their action with the requisite promptness. See, e.g., <em>Blankenship v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 567, 2004-Ohio-5596, 817 N.E.2d 382, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 12 (\u201c \u2018If relators do not act with the required promptness, laches may bar the action for extraordinary relief in an election-related matter\u2019 \u201d). If we were to hold now that Finkbeiner had an adequate remedy at law, we would be deciding that if relators act too quickly, their action is also barred because they have not filed it in the correct forum. Election-law precedent should not be constructed as an elaborate trap for the unwary. Prospective relators need not navigate between the Scylla of acting too slowly and the Charybdis of acting too quickly to have this court address the merits of their election-related prohibition claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 21} Therefore, as respondents admit, the election is sufficiently close so that Finkbeiner lacks an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law via an action for a prohibitory injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Prohibition: Unauthorized Exercise of Quasi-Judicial Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 22} For the remaining prohibition requirement that the board is about to exercise unauthorized judicial or quasi-judicial power, \u201cwe must determine whether the board [of elections] acted fraudulently or corruptly, abused its discretion, or clearly disregarded applicable law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Butler Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 63, 2006-Ohio-1292, 846 N.E.2d 8, \u00b6 23. There is no claim or evidence of fraud or corruption here, so Finkbeiner must establish that the board of elections abused its discretion or clearly disregarded applicable law by denying his protest and certifying the recall issue to the November 3 election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ballot. \u201cAn abuse of discretion implies an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable attitude.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cooker Restaurant Corp. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 302, 305, 686 N.E.2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 23} Finkbeiner claims that the board of elections abused its discretion and clearly disregarded R.C. 3501.38(J) in denying his protest and upholding the validity of the recall petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 3501.38 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cAll * * * petitions presented to or filed with * * * a board of elections or with any other public office * * * for the holding of an election on any issue shall * * * be governed by the following rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(J) All * * * petitions under this section shall be accompanied by the following statement in boldface capital letters: WHOEVER COMMITS ELECTION FALSIFICATION IS GUILTY OF A FELONY OF THE FIFTH DEGREE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 3501.38(J) is phrased in mandatory language and requires strict compliance. <em>State ex rel. Vickers v. Summit Cty. Council, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 204, 2002-Ohio-5583, 777 N.E.2d 830, \u00b632 (\u201cNeither R.C. 3501.38(J) nor 3599.36 expressly permits merely substantial compliance, so they require strict compliance\u201d); State ex <em>rel. Griffin v. Krumholtz </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 125, 126-127, 24 O.O.3d 234, 435 N.E.2d 1110 (referendum petition containing warning that \u201cwhoever knowingly signs the petition more than once, signs a name other than his own, or signs when not a legal voter, is liable to prosecution\u201d violated R.C. 3501.38(J), which required strict compliance with its election-falsification statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">{\u00b6 29} The recall petition did not comply with R.C. 3501.38(J). Instead, it contained language that is similar to the language the court held to be defective in <em>Griffin, </em>and the language was also not in boldface or capital letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">{\u00b6 30} Respondents argue that the recall petition did not need to comply with R.C. 3501.38(J), because the Toledo Charter does not require this election-falsification statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">{\u00b6 31} In assessing respondents\u2019 claim, we have consistently held that \u201c \u2018[municipal charters must be construed to give effect to all separate provisions and to harmonize them with statutory provisions whenever possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Commt. for the Proposed Ordinance to Repeal Ordinance No. 146-02, W. End Blight Designation v. Lakewood, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 252, 2003-Ohio-5771, 798 N.E.2d 362, \u00b6 20, quoting <em>State ex rel. Ditmars v. McSweeney </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 472, 477, 764 N.E.2d 971. Therefore, \u201c \u2018[i]n the absence of express language in a charter demonstrating a conflict with a statute, it is the duty of courts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>harmonize the provisions of the charter and statutes relating to the same matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. N. Olmsted v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 529, 533, 757 N.E.2d 314, quoting <em>State ex rel. Ryant Commt. v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 107, 112, 712 N.E.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 32} For the following reasons, R.C. 3501.38(J) is applicable to the mayoral recall petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 33} First, statutes like R.C. 3501.38(J) are incorporated by reference by Section 11 of the Toledo Charter, which provides, \u201cAll elections provided for by this Charter, whether for the choice of officers or the submission of questions to the voters, shall be conducted by the election authorities prescribed by general laws and <em>the provisions of the general laws of the State shall apply to all such elections except as provision is othenvise made by this Charter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 34} Provision for an election-falsification statement like that specified in R.C. 3501.38(J) is not \u201cotherwise made\u201d by the Toledo Charter. Instead, the recall provisions and other general petition-form requirements are silent on this issue. See Sections 87A, 92, and 93, Toledo Charter. In fact, as Finkbeiner notes, the Toledo voters repealed the applicability of certain recall-petition requirements in 1934 and rejected a 1959 amendment to reinstate these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 35} Second, we have specifically held that nonconflicting statutory requirements like the election-falsification statement in R.C. 3501.38(J) apply when neither the constitution nor the charter forbids their application. See <em>Vickers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 204, 2002-Ohio-5583, 777 N.E.2d 830, \u00b6 30-32, in which we also observed that the county charter incorporated general law relating to municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 36} Third, even assuming that the Toledo Charter\u2019s limited form requirements for recall petitions could be construed as comprehensive, because provisions relating to the election-falsification statement required by R.C. 3501.38(J) are not \u201cotherwise made\u201d by the charter, the statute applies. See <em>State ex rel. Citizens for a Better Beachwood v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 167, 169-170, 580 N.E.2d 1063 (while charter-referendum provisions are comprehensive and detailed, the charter is silent on the statutory requirement that copies of ordinances be filed with the city auditor, so the statute applies).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">{\u00b6 37} Fourth, our holding in <em>State ex rel. Blackman v. Hitte </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 156, 5 OBR 377, 449 N.E.2d 1279, does not require a contrary result. In that case, we held that the R.C. 3501.38(J) requirements on the recall petitions were inapplicable because (1) the charter provided only that the <em>conduct </em>of elections, and not the components of recall elections, follows state law if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>charter is silent, and (2) under R.C. 731.41, a municipal charter prevails over statutes in referenda. Id. at 158, 5 OBR 377, 449 N.E.2d 1279. Here, unlike the charter at issue in <em>Blackman, </em>Section 11 of the Toledo Charter incorporates general laws for all elections provided by charter and not merely the \u201cconducting\u201d of those elections. Moreover, a recall is not a referendum subject to R.C. 731.41 (\u201cSections 731.28 to 731.41, inclusive, of the Revised Code do not apply to any municipal corporation which adopts its own charter containing an initiative and referendum provision for its own ordinances and other legislative measures\u201d). Cf. Sections 81, 87A, and 92, Toledo Charter; see also <em>Citizens for Honest &amp; Responsible Govt. v. Secy, of State </em>(2000), 116 Nev. 939, 949, 11 P.3d 121 (\u201cThe interests served by the initiative and referendum process are sufficiently distinguishable from those involved in the recall process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 38} Finally, insofar as the recall petitioners relied on forms provided by the clerk of council that did not include the required election-falsification statement, election officials are not estopped from asserting defects in the forms. See <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 37. We will not construe Section 93 of the Toledo Charter, which provides that \u201call petition papers shall conform\u201d to the forms kept by the clerk of council, as superseding all applicable legal requirements, because that interpretation would accord the clerk unfettered authority to provide noncompliant forms without any legal consequence to the petitioners submitting them. We must construe the charter provisions to avoid such an unreasonable and absurd result. See <em>State ex rel. Webb v. Bliss, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 166, 2003-Ohio-3049, 789 N.E.2d 1102, \u00b622. Rather, this charter requirement should be construed in pari materia with other requirements, including the applicable statutory requirements, like the election-falsification statement required by R.C. 3501.38(J) and incorporated by Section 11 of the Toledo Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 39} Therefore, we hold that Finkbeiner has established that the board of elections abused its discretion and clearly disregarded applicable law \u2014 R.C. 3501.38(J) \u2014 by denying the protest challenging the validity of the recall petition. This application of R.C. 3501.38(J) to recall petitions gives effect to Section 11 of the Toledo Charter and harmonizes the charter with the statute. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Fite v. Aeh </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 684 N.E.2d 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 40} Therefore, Finkbeiner has proven his entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief. Respondents exercised quasi-judicial authority in denying his protest to the recall petition, the board\u2019s decision to deny the protest was legally unauthorized because the recall petition failed to comply with R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>3501.38(J), and Finkbeiner lacked an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b581-6\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b581-7\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell and Cupp, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b581-8\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMd\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 41} I respectfully dissent from the majority decision to grant a writ of prohibition for relator, Carleton S. Finkbeiner. While I agree that respondents, the Lucas County Board of Elections and its members, exercised quasi-judicial authority in denying Finkbeiner\u2019s protest to the recall petition against him and that the board\u2019s decision was legally unauthorized, I fail to see how he lacked an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, given the availability of a prohibitory injunction through a court of common pleas. Because Finkbeiner had an ample amount of time to seek such an injunction when he filed the present suit, I would dismiss the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">{\u00b6 42} Arguing that the recall petition against him was defective, Finkbeiner seeks a writ of prohibition to prevent respondents from placing the mayoral recall issue on the November 3, 2009 general election ballot. To be entitled to such a writ, Finkbeiner is required to establish, inter alia, that he lacked an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Craig v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 158, 2008-Ohio-706, 882 N.E.2d 435, \u00b6 18, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 43} Although the respondents stipulate that this factor is met, that stipulation, relating not to a factual issue but to a legal conclusion, is not binding on this court. See, e.g., <em>Aulizia v. Westfield Natl. Ins. Co., </em>Trumbull App. No. 2006-T-0057, 2007-Ohio-3017, 2007 WL 1732382, \u00b6 14, fn. 2, citing <em>Ish v. Crane </em>(1862), 13 Ohio St. 574 (\u201cWhile courts are ordinarily bound by the factual stipulations of litigants, courts are not bound in their determination of questions of law\u201d). Therefore, we should disregard the stipulation of the parties and apply our legal precedent to the facts presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">{\u00b6 44} We have decided several cases that directly address the issue of adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law in this context. These cases clearly demonstrate that a prohibitory injunction action is an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to correct an alleged error by an elections board in approving a petition, provided that an election is not imminent when the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>denies the protest or when the case challenging the decision is filed. See <em>Tatman v. Fairfield Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 425, 2004-Ohio-3701, 811 N.E.2d 1130, \u00b6 18-19; <em>State ex rel. Gains v. Mahoning Cty.

Bd. of Elections </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 291, 292, 530 N.E.2d 871 (\u201cProhibition does not lie to correct an allegedly erroneous exercise of properly assumed quasi-judicial authority by a board of elections in approving referendum petitions for the ballot; injunction is the proper remedy in such a case\u201d). It is well settled that this court lacks original jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief. Section 2(B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution; <em>State ex rel. Stine v. McCaw </em>(1939), 136 Ohio St. 41, 15 O.O. 538, 23 N.E.2d 631, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>Tatman, </em>the election was almost seven months away when the board denied relator\u2019s protest against a person\u2019s candidacy for county sheriff and was still over six months away when relator filed a prohibition action challenging the elections board\u2019s decision denying the protest. <em>Tatman, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 425, 2004-Ohio-3701, 811 N.E.2d 1130, \u00b6 44. We held that because the election was not an imminent election when the board denied relator\u2019s protest, dismissal of the election-related prohibition action was appropriate. Id. at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 46} Similarly, in <em>Gains, </em>the election was less than six months away when the board denied the relators\u2019 protest against a person\u2019s candidacy, and it was less than five months away when the relator filed a prohibition action to prevent the person\u2019s candidacy on an election ballot. Citing <em>Tatman, </em>we granted the board\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the prohibition action because relator \u201chas or had an adequate remedy at law by way of an action for a prohibitory injunction.\u201d 119 Ohio St.3d 1433, 2008-Ohio-4442, 893 N.E.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 47} This case raises comparable circumstances. When the board of elections denied Finkbeiner\u2019s protest, the November 3 election was almost five months away, and when Finkbeiner filed this prohibition action challenging the board\u2019s decision, the election was over four months away. Notably, Finkbeiner could have filed a protest against the petition when the petition was initially filed with the clerk of council on April 9, but he waited until eight days after the clerk\u2019s certification of the petition to the board of elections to do so and then waited another 14 days after the board\u2019s June 9 denial of his protest to file the prohibition action in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">(\u00b6 48} To be sure, we have \u201coften held in election cases that \u2018given the closeness of the election date * * *, relators lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law\u2019 because alternate remedies are not sufficiently speedy.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-4334, 854 N.E.2d 1025, \u00b6 42, quoting <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>rel. Brown v. Butler Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 63, 2006-Ohio-1292, 846 N.E.2d 8, \u00b6 22. The preeminent cases recognizing this general proposition are <em>State ex rel. Thurn v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 289, 291-292, 649 N.E.2d 1205, and <em>State ex rel. Smart v. McKinley </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 5, 6, 18 O.O.3d 128, 412 N.E.2d 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 49} These cases, however, are distinguishable. <em>Thum </em>was an expedited election case filed slightly more than a month before the election, and <em>Smart </em>was filed less than a month before the election. In addition, the sole case cited by Finkbeiner in support of his allegation that he lacks an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law was filed less than three months before the election. See <em>State ex rel. Shumate v. Portage Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 12, 591 N.E.2d 1194. By contrast, this case, which is not an expedited election case under S.Ct.Prac.R. X19),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not involve an election that was imminent at the time that the board denied the protest or when this case was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 50} I understand the concern raised in the majority opinion, that it is sometimes difficult for potential relators in election-related cases to know what remedies to seek and in what order. I do not agree, though, that the above interpretation would turn our election-law precedent into \u201can elaborate trap for the unwary.\u201d In fact, the majority opinion obfuscates the standard we have applied consistently to previous cases. It cannot be reasonably argued that if relator had filed a legal action soon after the board denied his protest, rather than the request for an extraordinary writ, he would have fallen into a \u201ctrap\u201d for the unwary. Such a legal action could have been resolved well before the distribution of ballots.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 51} As is often the case, the touchstone is reasonableness. An individual wishing to challenge an election-related decision is merely expected to assert his or her claims with reasonable diligence and to pursue remedies in their appropriate order. If, as is the case here, several months separate the alleged wrong and the election, and the ordinary course of law could yield an adequate result, the individual should exhaust those other options before seeking an extraordinary writ in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 52} It must be remembered that \u201c[e]xtraordinary writs * * * provide extraordinary, not alternative remedies * * *.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Talikka </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 109, 110, 642 N.E.2d 353. One may not pursue measures of last resort unless it is absolutely necessary to do so, and it was not necessary here; Finkbeiner could have obtained and can still receive relief elsewhere in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ordinary course of law. We serve no one by changing the application of our standards in order to resolve the merit issue raised by relator.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AKs\">Vorys, Safer, Seymour <em>&amp; </em>Pease, L.L.P., John J. Kulewicz, William J. Pohlman, Mary J. Henkel, Michael J. Hendershot, and Elizabeth A. Davis; and Law Office of Fritz Byers and Fritz Byers, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A8O\">Julia R. Bates, Lucas County Prosecuting Attorney, and John A. Borrell, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 53} Moreover, the majority\u2019s concerns of potential dismissal for failure to promptly file a challenge, thereby creating \u201can impossible situation\u201d for prospective relators, are overrated. While one who waits too long to bring a matter to this court\u2019s attention may risk the application of laches, that legal doctrine punishes only the dilatory, not the diligent. See <em>Blankenship v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 567, 2004-Ohio-5596, 817 N.E.2d 382, \u00b6 19. Laches will not affect a prospective relator unless he or she has unjustifiably ignored his potential claims; I fail to see how that doctrine affects our consideration of whether an otherwise diligent individual has properly exhausted his other remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 54} Therefore, based on our precedent in <em>Taiman </em>and <em>Gains, </em>I would dismiss this case because Finkbeiner had and continues to have an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by filing a common pleas court action for a prohibitory injunction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b584-7\">O\u2019Donnell and Cupp, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\">. Under this rule, original actions filed in this court relating to a pending election that are filed within 90 days prior to the election receive an expedited evidence and briefing schedule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
