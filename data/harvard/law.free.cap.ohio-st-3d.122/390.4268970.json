Fletcher of Northfield, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0030992, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1982. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline has recommended that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice for six months, staying the entire suspension on conditions of a monitored probation and no further misconduct, based on findings that respondent misused his client trust account and impermissibly provided financial assistance to a client. We agree that respondent breached ethical standards as found by the board and that a six-month conditionally stayed suspension is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with two counts of professional misconduct, alleging multiple violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the former Code of Professional Responsibility and the current Rules of Professional Conduct, effective February 1, 2007. The board initially considered the case on a consent-to-discipline agreement, filed pursuant to BCGD Proc.Reg. 11, in which the parties stipulated to facts and misconduct and proposed a six-month suspension of respondent\u2019s license, stayed on conditions of a one-year probation and no further misconduct. The board accepted the agreement and recommended that we impose the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">{\u00b6 3} Upon review of the board\u2019s certified report, we rejected the recommendation and returned the cause to the board \u201cfor further proceedings and consideration of a more severe sanction.\u201d See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fletcher, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1467, 2008-Ohio-4989, 894 N.E.2d 327. A three-member panel of the board thereafter heard the cause and, based on the parties\u2019 stipulations and respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>dent\u2019s testimony, made findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended a conditionally stayed six-month suspension. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and again recommended the suspension of respondent\u2019s license for six months, all stayed on conditions of monitored probation and no further misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 Misuse <em>of Client Trust Account</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent, who first entered the practice of law in Connecticut in 1975 and spent years as a corporate attorney and in association with a law firm, has more recently practiced on his own in the areas of criminal and traffic law, bankruptcy, divorce, personal injury, and Social Security disability. He has maintained an Interest on Lawyer\u2019s Trust Accounts (\u201cIOLTA\u201d) account since at least 1996, but according to his testimony, he has over the succeeding years only occasionally received funds from clients that had to be held in trust. Prior to February 1, 2007, before Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> specified that lawyers must maintain records to document the identity of client funds in an IOLTA account, respondent did not keep such records. And for more than a year after that date, respondent did not record disbursements and balances for each client as that rule requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 5} From at least 2002 until early August 2007, respondent did not maintain an operating account for his practice. He instead used his IOLTA account, in which he had commingled his own funds with funds belonging to clients, to pay business expenses. He also used his IOLTA account to pay personal expenses. Between January 2005 and January 2007, respondent wrote at least 150 checks to pay for personal and business expenses from his IOLTA account.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 6} From January 2005 through February 2007, respondent wrote 101 checks to himself from his IOLTA account without first verifying the amount in the account that belonged to him. On several occasions during this period, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>received cash from deposits made into his IOLTA account that he applied to incidental personal expenses. And twice during 2006, the account was overdrawn, once because of a small error in his addition and again because of a bank mistake. The mistakes triggered the bank\u2019s obligation under R.C. 4705.10(A)(4)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to notify disciplinary authorities, which led to these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">{\u00b6 7} After agreeing that respondent \u201cno longer engages in this conduct,\u201d the parties stipulated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct before February 1, 2007, as set forth in Count One violates the Code of Professional Responsibility * * *, specifically: DR 9-102(A) (all funds of clients paid to a lawyer shall be deposited in one or more identifiable bank accounts and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm shall be deposited therein); and DR 9-102(B)(3) (a lawyer shall maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct on and after February 1, 2007, as set forth in Count One violates the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically: ORPC 1.15(a) (A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in [a] lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property); and ORPC 1.15(a)(2) (a lawyer shall maintain a record for each client on whose behalf funds are held).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 10} The panel and board agreed that respondent violated the cited ethical standards. Because respondent\u2019s continued misuse of his IOLTA account violated DR 9-102(A) and (B)(3) and Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) and (a)(2), we accept the findings that he engaged in this misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 Financial <em>Assistance to a Client</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 11} While representing a client during 2006 in both bankruptcy and divorce proceedings, respondent loaned the client approximately $900 for personal expenses unrelated to either case. Respondent also cashed checks for the client\u2019s small cleaning company by first depositing the checks into his IOLTA account. For the check-cashing and loan service, the client occasionally paid respondent a $25 or $50 fee in addition to repaying the loan. Respondent did not maintain records of the money that he deposited for his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">{\u00b6 12} After agreeing that respondent \u201cno longer engages in this conduct,\u201d the parties stipulated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct before February 1, 2007, as set forth in Count Two herein violates the Code of Professional Responsibility * * *, specifically: DR 5-103(B) (a lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with litigation unrelated to court costs or litigation expenses) and [DR 9-102(B)(3)] (a lawyer shall maintain complete records of all funds, securities, and other properties of a client coming in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">{\u00b6 14} The panel and board agreed that respondent violated the cited ethical rules. Because respondent\u2019s continued financial assistance to his client and incomplete recordkeeping violated DR 5 \u2014 103(B) and 9 \u2014 102(B)(3), we accept the findings that he engaged in this misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 15} The parties proposed a one-year suspension of respondent\u2019s license, all stayed on the conditions that (1) he complete a one-year probation that would include monitoring of his IOLTA account by an attorney appointed by relator and (2) he commit no further misconduct. In deciding to recommend a six-month suspension, stayed on the suggested conditions, the board considered the stipulated mitigating factors that respondent had no prior disciplinary record, his misconduct was not the result of a selfish or dishonest motive, and he had cooperated fully in the disciplinary process. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), and (d). The board also observed that \u201c[n]o clients were harmed as a result of Respondent\u2019s misconduct.\u201d In addition, no evidence indicated to the board that respondent \u201cwas trying to hide or disguise income or assets for [the client] by depositing them into his IOLTA account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 16} We adopt the board\u2019s recommendation. Respondent assisted his client financially out of concern for the client\u2019s well-being, not for any illicit purpose. And though his poor accounting practices resulted from a complete lack of understanding and appreciation of his duty to safeguard client funds, it appears from the stipulations that he commingled a relatively small sum, and no one has accused him of misappropriation. Moreover, respondent has acknowledged his deficiencies and earnestly promised to find or accept help in properly managing his IOLTA account, operating bank account, and personal bank account. The board\u2019s recommendation will ensure that he does.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 17} Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months; however, the suspension is stayed on the conditions that (1) he complete a one-year probation including monitoring of his IOLTA account by an attorney appointed by relator and (2) he commit no further misconduct. If respondent fails to comply with the conditions of the stay, the stay will be lifted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>and respondent will serve the entire six-month suspension.
