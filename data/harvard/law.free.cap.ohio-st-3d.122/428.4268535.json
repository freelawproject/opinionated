Moritz has alleged that he was injured as a result of a violation of a specific safety requirement (\u201cVSSR\u201d) by appellant International Truck &amp; Engine Corporation (\u201cITE\u201d). Moritz prevailed administratively and at the court of appeals, and ITE has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>{\u00b6 2} On January 10, 2004, Moritz was using an overhead transport system to move a transmission from one area of the plant to another. Moritz had hooked a hoist to the transmission and was walking it to an assembly area when part of the system broke loose from the overhead trolley rails. It is unclear whether Moritz was struck by the swinging transmission or by one of the system\u2019s cross-members, but he was injured as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 3} Investigation revealed that before the mishap, the hoist had been sticking when manually pulled and ITE had attempted to correct that problem by replacing the Teflon rollers. In the process, however, the wrong nut was used to reattach the assembly. This eventually caused the accompanying bolt \u2014 and with it the assembly\u2019s cross-member \u2014 to dislodge, causing the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 4} After his workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed, Moritz filed a VSSR application. He alleged a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1-5-14(0(1), which requires that \u201cdefective * * * load-carrying equipment shall be repaired or replaced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 5} Appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio, through its staff hearing officer, found a violation of that section:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[T]he injured worker has presented sufficient evidence that the employer failed to correctly repair load carrying equipment. The employer replaced defective rollers which were attached to the overhead rail trolley which is connected to the hoist equipment, but the employer failed to correctly install the correct bolt which holds the system in place. The failure of the employer to properly repair the overhead trolley caused the bolt to dislodge which caused the hoist to swing out and strike the injured worker. The Staff Hearing Officer finds this failure to properly repair the overhead trolley system was the proximate cause of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">{\u00b6 7} Rehearing was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">{\u00b6 8} ITE filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County to compel the commission to vacate its order. ITE argued that it should not be assessed an additional amount for a VSSR for the inadvertent use of one improper nut/bolt unit in replacing the defective roller. The court of appeals disagreed, holding that \u201c[although [ITE] replaced the defective equipment, it did so improperly and only created a new defect that caused the injury.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Internatl. Truck &amp; Engine Corp. v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-547, 2008-Ohio-2953, 2008 WL 2440347, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">{\u00b6 9} ITE now appeals as of right to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">{\u00b6 10} The interpretation of a specific safety requirement lies exclusively with the commission. <em>State ex rel. Allied Wheel Prods., Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47, 50, 1 O.O.2d 190, 139 N.E.2d 41. The provision at issue, Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Adm.Code 4123:l-5-14(G)(l), states that \u201c[djefective * * * load-carrying equipment shall be repaired or replaced.\u201d A single issue is now presented: Did the commission abuse its discretion in concluding that ITE\u2019s corrective actions did not constitute a \u201crepair,\u201d for purposes of Ohio Adm.Code 4123:l-5-14(G)(l), when those actions created another defect that resulted in injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 11} In urging an affirmative response, ITE contends that the strict construction required for a specific safety requirement mandates a finding that it satisfied Ohio Adm.Code 4123:1 \u2014 5\u201414(G)(1). ITE misinterprets this tenet. <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216, declared that because an award for a VSSR was a penalty against the employer, specific safety requirements \u201cmust be strictly construed, and all reasonable doubts concerning the interpretation of the safety standard are to be construed against its <em>applicability </em>to the employer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) ITE does not deny that Ohio Adm.Code 4123:l-5-14(G)(l) applies to the load-carrying equipment at issue. It denies instead that it violated the regulation, which is a factual, not an interpretative question. ITE\u2019s position ignores our decision in <em>State ex rel. Supreme Bumpers, Inc. v. Indus. Comm., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 134, 2002-Ohio-7089, 781 N.E.2d 170, which explained that the rule of strict construction is one of \u201cstatutory, not evidentiary, interpretation, devised only as a guide to interpreting the specific requirements of a safety standard in VSSR claims.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 70. It \u201cpermits neither the commission nor a reviewing court to construe the <em>evidence </em>of a VSSR strictly in the employer\u2019s favor.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. Consequently, the rule does not apply in resolving factual disputes. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 12} ITE next challenges the commission\u2019s characterization of the relevant defect and ITE\u2019s response to it. ITE argues that if the defect was the sticking roller, it was promptly fixed without further problem with or to the roller. If, on the other hand, the defect was the incorrect nut/bolt assembly, that, too, was replaced as soon as ITE learned of it. According to ITE, this negates any possibility of a VSSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 13} ITE\u2019s position assumes the existence of a single defect \u2014 either the roller or the nut/bolt assembly. The commission, however, found two defects \u2014 the roller <em>and </em>the nut/bolt assembly. ITE created the second, independent defect when it attempted to correct the first. In defending this conclusion, the commission states that the transport system must be viewed as a whole \u2014 i.e., as \u201cload-carrying equipment\u201d \u2014 and not as its component parts. ITE\u2019s repair of a component part is irrelevant, the commission claims, if the load-carrying unit as a whole \u2014 the focus of the specific safety requirement \u2014 was still unsafe. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 14} ITE proposes that insertion of the wrong nut/bolt unit into the roller assembly was a negligent, not a deliberate, act, and that under <em>State ex rel. Gross v. Indus. Comm., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 249, 2007-Ohio-4916, 874 N.E.2d 1162, it cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>be penalized for noncompliance arising from mere negligence. <em>Gross, </em>however, is a temporary total disability case, not a VSSR case, and does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 15} In its final argument, ITE suggests that it made a good-faith effort to comply with the specific safety requirement and therefore no VSSR liability should attach. Prior decisions do not support this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>State ex rel. Supreme Bumpers, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 134, 2002-Ohio-7089, 781 N.E.2d 170, the employer tried to satisfy a specific safety requirement for minimizing air contaminants by installing exhaust hoods and applying liquid glue to the polishing wheels in its plating facility. Testimony established that despite these measures, nickel and chrome dust saturated the workplace. The dust caused a carcinoma that eventually killed an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 17} The commission found a VSSR despite the employer\u2019s measures. It found that although the employer\u2019s measures were enumerated in the Ohio Administrative Code as acceptable methods for reducing airborne particulates, they were not effective under the circumstances. We upheld that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 18} A similar result was reached by the Tenth District Court of Appeals in <em>State ex rel. Moore v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 29 Ohio App.3d 239, 29 OBR 301, 504 N.E.2d 1125. The relevant specific safety requirement listed many work activities, including chipping of various materials, for which eye protection was required that \u201ceffectively protect[ed] against the hazard involved.\u201d See former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-17(0(1) and (D)(2)(a), now found in 4123:1-5-17(0(1) and (D)(2)(a). It also required the employer to supply that protection to all employees working in proximity to the hazardous activity. See former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-17(D)(l), now found in 4123:l-5-17(D)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 19} Moore was working beside an employee who was chipping metal with a wood chisel. Moore had been given, and was wearing, protective glasses. The glasses, however, had no side shields and thus offered only limited protection. When his neighbor\u2019s chisel splintered, metal fragments flew sideways into Moore\u2019s eye, and he lost the eye as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">{\u00b6 20} The commission denied Moore\u2019s application for a VSSR award. Moore filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the court of common pleas, which granted the writ. The court concluded that even though the employer had provided safety glasses, they did not effectively protect Moore against the hazard to which he was exposed due to the lack of side shields. The court of appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">{\u00b6 21} In most of the VSSR cases that have come before us, the employer has made some effort to satisfy the applicable safety regulation. The cited cases, however, demonstrate that such attempts do not immunize an employer from a VSSR award when the efforts are inadequate and someone is injured.

Comm., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 298, 2006-Ohio-2421, 847 N.E.2d 427 (employer\u2019s elaborate system of alerting employees that high-voltage equipment had not been deactivated did not excuse the absence of personal protective gear required by specific safety requirement); <em>State ex rel.

Comm., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 315, 2006-Ohio-1060, 843 N.E.2d 761 (providing roofers with wood for slide guards that were never assembled did not satisfy the specific safety requirement, which required a catch platform, not slide guards); <em>State ex rel.

In this case, it concluded that ITE\u2019s corrective actions did not constitute the \u201crepair\u201d contemplated by Ohio Adm.Code 4123:l-5-14(G)(l) when those actions were improperly performed and resulted in injury. This is not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 23} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
