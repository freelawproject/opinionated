On December 19, 2006, the court of appeals granted the writ but denied appellants\u2019 request to certify the class. <em>State ex rel. Beck v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1094, 2006-Ohio-6730, 2006 WL 3719413. Appellants did not file an appeal from the ruling denying certification of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">{\u00b6 3} In February 2008, appellants filed in the court of appeals a motion for a status conference to review appellees\u2019 actions with regard to all of the individuals who would have been in the class had the class been certified. Noting that it had not upheld the request for class certification, the court of appeals denied the motion for status conference on February 29, 2008. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">{\u00b6 4} Appellants seek essentially through their appeal to now have the class certified. But the time for consideration of that matter expired in early 2007, when appellants failed to timely appeal from the court of appeals\u2019 denial of class certification, and this appeal is simply an attempt to circumvent the finality of that previous ruling.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AB9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Equal Justice Foundation and Judith B.
