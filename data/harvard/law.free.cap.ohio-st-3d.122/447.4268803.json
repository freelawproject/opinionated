The BTA rejected the appraisal Meijer offered and adopted an appraisal presented on behalf of the Licking Heights Local School District Board of Education (\u201cschool board\u201d). For purposes of this appeal, the most important difference between the two appraisals rests in the selection of comparable-sale properties and comparable-rent properties: the school board\u2019s appraiser utilized a range of properties that included \u201cbuild-to-suit\u201d properties that, unlike the property at issue, were not owned by the business that operated on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">{\u00b6 2} The school board contends that we should defer to the factual findings of the BTA. (The school board has also filed a cross-appeal, but has not set forth any propositions of law in support of that appeal. As a result, we regard the assignments of error in the cross-appeal as abandoned. See <em>E. Liverpool v. Columbiana Cty. Budget Comm., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1201, 2007-Ohio-5505, 876 N.E.2d 575, \u00b6 3.) For its part, Meijer asserts that the BTA violated prior holdings by this court and committed legal error in its evaluation of the evidence. We agree with the school board, and we therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">\n<em>A. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">{\u00b6 3} On March 25, 2004, Meijer filed a complaint against valuation with the Franklin County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) for the 2003 tax year. The property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>comprised 32.508 acres, consisting of a main parcel of 24.03 acres on which the Meijer store is situated and four adjacent outparcels: one 2.483-acre parcel sold to Max <em>&amp; </em>Erma\u2019s in late January 2003 as a site for a future restaurant; one parcel at the corner of East Broad Street and Waggoner Road, on which a Meijer service station and convenience store had been constructed; and two other parcels, one fronting Broad Street and the other Waggoner Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">{\u00b6 4} The most significant point of contention between the litigants lies in valuing the big-box Meijer store on the main parcel, a building that encompasses approximately 193,000 square feet and that Meijer built to its specifications. Construction occurred during 2001 and was completed in August 2002. For the tax year 2003, the auditor valued the property at $13,290,000 based on reconciling a cost and an income approach. Meijer\u2019s complaint asked for a reduction to $9,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">(\u00b6 5} Meijer presented the appraisal report and testimony of Robin Lorms to both the BOR and the BTA. The BOR declined to reduce the value of the property on two grounds. First, the BOR found that Meijer had declined to submit actual-cost information. Second, the BOR found Lorms\u2019s analysis to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 6} When Meijer appealed to the BTA, the school board presented the testimony and appraisal of Samuel Koon in opposition to Meijer\u2019s claim for reduction. Both Lorms and Koon used cost, income-capitalization, and sales-comparison approaches in their appraisal reports. Both relied most heavily on the values obtained from the income-capitalization and sales-comparison approaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\n<em>B. The conflicting appraisal evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ahh\">{\u00b6 7} The testimony of the appraisers, the expository passages of then-appraisal reports, and the values they determined for the property reflect a fundamental dispute. Lorms looked at the big-box store as adding only modest market value because the structure would not be easily adaptable to the needs of a potential buyer, a factor that he opined would impair the property\u2019s marketability. According to Lorms, most potential buyers would be hard-pressed to utilize such a large space for their own business and would probably have to significantly renovate or even tear down the existing structure in order to use the property. Lorms called this limitation on the property\u2019s marketability \u201cexternal obsolescence\u201d and looked at second-generation purchasers and tenants to determine value by the sales-comparison and income-capitalization approaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 8} By contrast, Koon looked at Meijer\u2019s own use as the touchstone for determining market rent and comparable sales. When asked, in the context of his income approach, who would lease the space, Koon answered: \u201cMeijer.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Accordingly, \u201cmarket rent\u201d for Koon consisted in part as what rent Meijer itself would be willing to pay to an owner other than itself. Comparable sales in Koon\u2019s view included sales by developers who built big-box retail facilities on a build-to-suit basis and then sold them to third parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 9} The selection of other properties as comparables by the two appraisers bears out this general point of contrast. For his sales-comparison approach, Lorms used eight properties that included four Kmarts that had been abandoned by that entity during its bankruptcy, two Ames stores that had also been abandoned during bankruptcy, a WalMart abandoned by the retailer when it moved into a new supereenter, and a Sam\u2019s Club that \u201cwent dark\u201d in 1995 and took five years to sell. On the other hand, Koon\u2019s comparable properties included seven properties, four of which were purchased subject to long-term leases. Koon opined that the value of the Meijer store is \u201cat a point which lies somewhere between selling prices of properties which are leased to first generation users * * * and prices of properties which are vacant and available for occupancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 10} Similar differences pervade the rent comparables used by the two appraisers. Lorms used a \u201cmarket rent\u201d approach that deliberately excluded data derived from build-to-suit leases and newly developed discount stores because under Lorms\u2019s theory, the rent in such cases reflected values other than market rent that pertained to the fee-simple estate. Koon took the contrary approach: by viewing Meijer itself as the potential lessee of the property, Koon justified using seven first-generation properties and five second-generation properties as rent comparables. The first-generation comparables were all build-to-suit properties. In those arrangements, an independent developer constructed the store to the retailer\u2019s specifications with a lease in place that provided recovery of costs and a profit. The developer was then the owner of the property and could continue to collect rent or resell the property with the lease in place to a new owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 11} In his report, Koon opined that \u201csecond-generation rents will never adequately reflect market rent\u201d for property such as that at issue. Koon emphasized the newness of the construction and stated that \u201cthe fact that the subject facility continues to operate under the auspice of its first generation user indicates that it possesses certain attributes which make it inherently more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>desirable than second-generation space.\u201d Accordingly, Koon opined that the market rent applicable to the property at issue \u201cis considered to lie somewhere between the ranges indicated by the first and second generation comparables, with a strong bias towards those rents indicated by the first generation lease comparables.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">(\u00b6 12} The appraisers\u2019 conflicting methodologies yielded significantly different valuations. Lorms\u2019s sales-comparison approach determined the value of all the parcels at issue (including the main parcel on which the Meijer store had been constructed) to be $8,800,000. Koon concluded that the value of the main parcel was $12,100,000, and by adding that figure to the value he derived for the adjacent service station and convenience store and other land, Koon arrived at a total value of $15,100,000 under the sales-comparison method.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 13} With regard to the income-capitalization approach, Lorms arrived at a value of $7,800,000 for all the parcels. Under this approach, Koon determined the value of the main parcel to be $11,600,000, and when added to the value of the other parcels, the value totaled $14,600,000. After reconciling the different approaches, Lorms certified a total value of $8,800,000, and Koon certified a total value of $14,850,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\n<em>C. The BTA\u2019s decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 14} While acknowledging that it had considered Lorms\u2019s theory of obsolescence as probative in other cases, the BTA stated that \u201cthis theory has not always been accepted by the board where it has been shown that the obsolescence factors advanced by the appraiser do not exist in a particular market.\u201d <em>Meijer Stores Ltd. Partnership v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(May 27, 2008), BTA Nos. 2005-T-441 and 2005-T-443, at 17. The BTA also cited <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 181, 661 N.E.2d 1056, as supporting the proposition that the proponent of functional and external obsolescence must shoulder the burden of establishing the obsolescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 15} After reviewing the competing appraisals, the BTA found itself \u201cunable to conclude * * * that Meijer has met this burden,\u201d inasmuch as \u201cMr. Lorms\u2019 facts and figures have been successfully refuted by the facts and figures presented by the [school board].\u201d <em>Meijer Stores Ltd., </em>BTA Nos. 2005-T-441 and 2005-T-443, at 18. In particular, the BTA quoted Koon\u2019s statements \u2014 quoted in part above \u2014 relating to why he emphasized first-generation rent as opposed to second-generation rent. Id. at 19. The BTA distinguished the present case from those cases in which obsolescence was considered an important factor in determining value. Namely, the present case involved \u201cnearly new improvements,\u201d and the property \u201cis located in a retail corridor that is both flourishing and growing.\u201d Id. Also significant was the superior quality of evidence in this case that supported a higher value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Finally, the BTA considered and rejected the school board\u2019s contention that the cost approach should be regarded as probative. It instead adopted Koon\u2019s valuation of $14,850,000 for tax year 2003 ($14,075,000<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>A. Meijer has not met its burden to show an abuse of discretion by the BTA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 17} We will \u201c \u2018reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. But \u201c \u2018[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support\u2019 \u201d for the BTA\u2019s decision, this court will affirm. Id., quoting <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483. More specifically, we \u201c \u2018will not reverse the BTA\u2019s determination on credibility of witnesses and weight given to their testimony unless we find an abuse of * * * discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 309, 2007-Ohio-6, 859 N.E.2d 540, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Natl. Church Residence v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 397, 398, 653 N.E.2d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 18} In the present case, the BTA weighed the probative value of two appraisals and found one to be more probative than the other. This decision rests within the core of the BTA\u2019s competence as fact-finder and deserves the highest degree of deference from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 19} Against this general principle of deference, Meijer criticizes the BTA\u2019s decision as being inconsistent with other BTA decisions wherein the BTA had accepted Lorms\u2019s appraisals of big-box properties and specifically found his analysis probative. However, as the BTA explained, some of the cases cited by Meijer were factually distinguishable from this case, and in the other cases, insufficient evidence had been presented to rebut Lorms\u2019s theory of obsolescence. <em>Meijer Stores Ltd. Partnership v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(May 27, 2008), BTA Nos. 2005-T-441 and 443, at 21-22. For example, in a case the BTA decided the same day it decided the present case, <em>Target Corp. v. Greene Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(May 27, 2008), BTA No. 2006-V-751, affirmed, 122 Ohio St.3d 142, 2009-Ohio-2492, 909 N.E.2d 605, the school board did not appear, and the county presented no evidence to counter the appraisal and testimony of Lorms. In the absence of contrary evidence, the BTA adopted the value as determined by Lorms, and we affirmed that decision. By contrast, in this case, the BTA found that the appraisal and testimony of Koon rebutted Lorms\u2019s appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Meijer also specifies a number of alleged deficiencies in Koon\u2019s appraisal and testimony. But determining the probative value of an appraiser\u2019s testimony lies within the competence of the BTA, and we will defer to the BTA\u2019s rejection of Meijer\u2019s contention in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\n<em>B. Meijer\u2019s specific legal objections to the BTA\u2019s decision have no merit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 21} Meijer argues that the value of its property should not be determined by comparing it to properties that are subject to long-term leases that are favorable to the owner. According to Meijer, such a comparison involves a valuation of a speculative \u201cleased fee\u201d interest rather than of the fee simple.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">(\u00b6 22} To be sure, the present case does not involve a build-to-suit situation. Meijer both owns and uses its property; it acquired the land and then constructed a store on it. By contrast, in the build-to-suit situation, the owner builds a structure to the tenant\u2019s specifications and then enjoys the benefit of rent under a long-term lease that provides the owner with recovery of the costs of construction and a profit. Alternatively, the owner can turn around and sell the property, and the price the property commands will be enhanced by the anticipated revenue stream from the lease. <em>AEI Net Lease Income &amp; Growth Fund v. Erie Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 563, 2008-Ohio-5203, 895 N.E.2d 830, \u00b6 13, citing <em>Rhodes v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 532, 2008-Ohio-1595, 885 N.E.2d 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 23} Although Meijer\u2019s property is currently not encumbered with a lease, Meijer\u2019s contention that its property cannot be compared to build-to-suit properties is mistaken. As recent cases have demonstrated, the possibility of encumbering a property like the one at issue here constitutes \u2014 as a purely factual matter \u2014 one method of realizing the value of legal ownership of the property. See <em>Cummins Property Servs., L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-Ohio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 27 (\u201cencumbering property typically represents an owner\u2019s attempt to realize the full value of the property\u201d); <em>AEI Net Lease Income &amp; Growth Fund, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 563, 2008-Ohio-5203, 895 N.E.2d 830, \u00b6 21 (sale-leaseback, in its totality, constituted an arm\u2019s-length transaction in which seller/lessee and buyer/lessor each pursued the objective to realize value of the realty). Moreover, by drawing the distinction between \u201cfee simple\u201d and \u201cleased fee,\u201d Meijer predicates its argument on a legal premise that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>our cases have rejected.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have held that a recent arm\u2019s-length sale price should not be adjusted to remove the economic effect of such encumbrances when they exist. <em>Cummins, </em>\u00b6 24. And we have also determined that a sale price does not have to be adjusted to remove the effect of above-market rent paid by a creditworthy tenant. <em>AEI, </em>\u00b6 12, 26, 30. It follows that an appraiser, when determining the value of Meijer\u2019s store, may take into account the possibility that at some point, the store could be held as a rental property subject to an above-market lease that would enhance its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 24} Meijer is also mistaken in arguing that the school board\u2019s appraisal essentially amounts to a constitutionally prohibited value-in-use appraisal. This court deemed unconstitutional a legislative act that required consideration of \u201ccurrent use\u201d to the exclusion of market value in the valuation of property. <em>State ex rel. Park Invest. Co. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 28, 30, 32, 61 O.O.2d 238, 289 N.E.2d 579. However, we have also held that the constitutional prohibition does not bar consideration of current-use value in the context of the \u201cspecial-purpose property\u201d doctrine. <em>Dinner Bell Meats, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 270, 271, 12 OBR 347, 466 N.E.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Dinner Bell Meats, </em>the appraisal adopted by the BTA employed a cost approach based on the appraiser\u2019s finding that the property was developed for a \u201cspecial purpose.\u201d Id. at 271, 12 OBR 347, 466 N.E.2d 909. In upholding the BTA\u2019s decision, we concluded that \u201cin utilizing the \u2018cost approach\u2019 for a \u2018special purpose\u2019 building, [the appraiser] simply considered the utility of the properties in conjunction with the highest and best use of the meatpacking facility.\u201d Id. at 272, 12 OBR 347, 466 N.E.2d 909. In so holding, we acknowledged that the present use of a property may be considered when \u201c \u2018a building in good condition [is] being used currently and for the foreseeable future for the unique purpose for which it was built\u2019 otherwise, \u201cthe owner of a distinctive, but yet highly useful, building [would be able] to escape full property tax liability.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Fed. Res. Bank of Minneapolis v. State </em>(Minn.1981), 313 N.W.2d 619, 623. We have followed the doctrine of <em>Dinner Bell Meats </em>in later cases, including a case involving the valuation of a Meijer store. See <em>Oakwood Club v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 241, 243-244, 638 N.E.2d 547; <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 181, 661 N.E.2d 1056.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AII\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Siegel, Siegel, Johnson &amp; Jennings Co., L.P.A., Nicholas M.J. Ray, and Jay P. Siegel, for appellant and cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">{\u00b6 26} Of particular importance here is the 1996 <em>Meijer </em>case, in which we affirmed a BTA decision against which were raised arguments similar to those advanced in this case. In the context of resolving a battle of appraisals, the BTA had in <em>Meijer </em>declined to adopt the larger amount of obsolescence found by the owner\u2019s appraiser. The BTA had found \u201cnothing about the present property which is obsolete or useless to the owner due to changing business conditions.\u201d <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. BA. of Revision </em>(Feb. 8, 1995), BTA Nos. 93-M-731, 93-M-732, and 93-M-733. Indeed, \u201c[t]he owner, by purchasing the land and constructing the building, evidences a market need for such a property. Therefore, the costs of purchase and construction evidence that a prospective purchaser was willing to pay at least the costs of the property as newly constructed.\u201d Id. Although the owner had argued that such reasoning constituted value-in-use appraisal prohibited by the Ohio Constitution, the BTA disagreed, citing the court\u2019s decision in <em>Dinner Bell Meats, </em>12 Ohio St.3d 270, 12 OBR 347, 466 N.E.2d 909. We affirmed the BTA. <em>Meijer, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 181, 661 N.E.2d 1056. Our reasoning in the 1996 <em>Meijer </em>case applies in this case as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 27} Finally, Meijer\u2019s citation of <em>Higbee Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. BA. of Revision, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 325, 2006-Ohio-2, 839 N.E.2d 385, is unavailing. In <em>Higbee, </em>the court rejected an appraiser\u2019s computation of obsolescence when that calculation rested upon the current owner\u2019s failure to meet sales goals it had set for itself. Id. \u00b6 43, 44. Our discussion of Meijer\u2019s other points shows that its reliance on <em>Higbee </em>is misplaced. <em>Higbee </em>did not involve a situation in which the improvement of the property enhanced its utility to the business that occupied the property while not greatly increasing its marketability. To the contrary, the record in <em>Higbee </em>showed that the occupant was underperforming at the location. And no evidence showed that special adaptation of the property had reduced its value in the eyes of potential buyers. Simply put, <em>Higbee </em>does not present the special-purpose situation and is not apposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 28} For the reasons stated above, we hold that the BTA did not abuse its discretion when it adopted the value as determined by the school board\u2019s appraisal, and we therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b566-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AiQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Rich &amp; Gillis Law Group, L.L.C., Jeffrey A.

Koon, who set the value at $16,000,000 under his cost approach, stated that he would need actual-cost figures \u201cas a check against the estimated construction costs,\u201d but that absent such figures, he could give only \u201cmarginal consideration\u201d to that approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-10\">.

Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826, militates in favor of Meijer\u2019s position: the \u201cfee simple estate is to be valued as if it were unencumbered.\u201d We have recently observed that our later case law raises a \u201cserious question\u201d whether the <em>Alliance Towers </em>pronouncement may still be applied. <em>Woda Ivy Glen Ltd.

The distinction between \u201cfee simple\u201d and \u201cleased fee\u201d is one drawn in the context of appraisal practice. See Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (13th Ed.2008) 114. The appraisal industry uses the term \u201cfee simple\u201d to refer to unencumbered property \u2014 or to property appraised as if it were unencumbered. Id. This distinction is not one recognized by the law, however. A \u201cfee simple\u201d may be absolute, conditional, or subject to defeasance, but the mere existence of encumbrances does not affect its status as fee simple.
