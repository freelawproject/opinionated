Because the Cincinnati City School District Board of Education, appellee, is an organization with more than 500 employees, it is not an eligible party for purposes of recovering attorney fees under R.C. 2335.39. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">{\u00b6 3} The Cincinnati school board filed an action against the appellants disputing the state\u2019s method of calculating certain funding to public school districts. The trial court granted relief to Cincinnati, and the Hamilton County Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. <em>Cincinnati City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Bd. of Edn., </em>176 Ohio App.3d 157, 2008-Ohio-1434, 891 N.E.2d 352. After this court agreed to review the case, the parties settled and the case was dismissed on the appellants\u2019 motion. 119 Ohio St.3d 1443, 2008-Ohio-4487, 893 N.E.2d 515; 119 Ohio St.3d 1498, 2008-Ohio-5500, 895 N.E.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">{\u00b6 4} Thereafter, the Cincinnati school board moved the trial court for an award of attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 2335.39 as a prevailing eligible party. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the board was not an \u201celigible party\u201d for a fee award, because a school board is an \u201corganization\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2335.39(A)(2). The court of appeals reversed and remanded. <em>Cincinnati City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Bd. of Edn. of Ohio, </em>176 Ohio App.3d 678, 2008-Ohio-2845, 893 N.E.2d 530. The appellate court concluded that the term \u201corganization\u201d in R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) was not intended to encompass entities such as a school board. Thus, the Cincinnati school board was not excluded from eligibility under R.C. 2335.39(A)(2). Id. at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">{\u00b6 5} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal. 120 Ohio St.3d 1416, 2008-0hio-6166, 897 N.E.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">{\u00b6 6} The school board\u2019s motion for attorney fees was based upon R.C. 2335.39(B)(1), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201cExcept as provided in divisions (B)(2) and (F) of this section, in a civil action, or appeal of a judgment in a civil action, to which the state is a party, or in an appeal of an adjudication order of an agency pursuant to section 119.12 of the Revised Code, the <em>prevailing eligible party </em>is entitled, upon filing a motion in accordance with this division, to compensation for fees incurred by that party in connection with the action or appeal. Compensation, when payable to a prevailing eligible party under this section, is in addition to any other costs and expenses that may be awarded to that party by the court pursuant to law or rule.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 8} To be entitled to an award of fees, a party must be a \u201cprevailing eligible party,\u201d which is defined as \u201can eligible party that prevails in an action or appeal involving the state.\u201d R.C. 2335.39(A)(5). An \u201celigible party\u201d is defined in terms of exclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(2) \u2018Eligible party\u2019 means a party to an action or appeal involving the state, other than the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(a) The state;</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(b) An individual whose net worth exceeded one million dollars at the time the action or appeal was filed;</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(c) A sole owner of an unincorporated business that had, or a partnership, corporation, association, or organization that had, a net worth exceeding five million dollars at the time the action or appeal was filed, except that an organization that is described in subsection 501(c)(3) and is tax exempt under subsection 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code shall not be excluded as an eligible party under this division because of its net worth;</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(d) A sole owner of an unincorporated business that employed, or a partnership, corporation, association, or organization that employed, more than five hundred persons at the time the action or appeal was filed.\u201d R.C. 2335.39(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">{\u00b6 14} The state opposed the school board\u2019s motion for attorney fees on the basis that it was not an eligible party because it is an \u201corganization that employed, more than five hundred persons at the time the action or appeal was filed.\u201d R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d). The narrow issue before us is whether the word \u201corganization\u201d in R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) encompasses a school district board of education.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2335.39 does not define \u201corganization.\u201d When a word is not defined, we use its common, ordinary, and accepted meaning unless it is contrary to clear legislative intent. <em>Hughes v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 47, 2007-Ohio-2877, 868 N.E.2d 246, \u00b6 14. We also read the word in context using rules of grammar and common usage. R.C. 1.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1590 defines organization as \u201ca group of people that has a more or less constant membership, a body of officers, a purpose and usu. a set of regulations.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1133 defines \u201corganization\u201d as \u201c[a] body of persons (such as a union or corporation) formed for a common purpose.\u201d See also American Heritage Dictionary (4th Ed.2000) 1239 (\u201cA group of persons organized for a particular purpose; an association\u201d). Thus, the common meaning of the term \u201corganization\u201d requires a group of members having a common purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 17} A school district board of education is a statutorily created entity composed of individual members responsible for governing a school district or educational service center. R.C. 3311.055. It is described as \u201ca body politic and corporate.\u201d R.C. 3313.17. Thus, the common, ordinary meaning of the word \u201corganization\u201d encompasses a school board.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 18} However, the Cincinnati school board contends that we must construe \u201corganization\u201d in the context of other entities listed in R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d). According to the board, because the words \u201corganization\u201d and \u201cassociation\u201d are expansive terms that follow more specifically named entities of unincorporated business, partnership, and corporation' \u2014 entities that the board contends are nongovernmental \u2014 \u201corganization\u201d in this context also refers only to nongovernmental entities. Similarly, the appellate court relied on the doctrine of ejusdem generis to conclude that a school board does not share similar characteristics with other entities listed in R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d), i.e., unincorporated business, partnership, corporation, association, so it is not an organization. 176 Ohio App.3d 678, 2008-Ohio-2845, 893 N.E.2d 530, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 19} We disagree. R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) excludes five broad categories or groups that may exist in various forms or for various purposes. These entities may be private or government groups. The statute includes no limitations, and we are constrained from adding or subtracting terms when construing statutory language. <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 361, 366, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613. The only applicable similarity that is required for purposes of R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) is the number of employees, i.e., more than 500 at the time the action or appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">{\u00b620} Furthermore, the doctrine of ejusdem generis does not operate to exclude a school board from being an organization for purposes of R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d). Under the doctrine, \u201cwhenever words of general meaning follow the enumeration of a particular class, then the general words are to be construed as limited to those things which pertain to the particularly enumerated class.\u201d <em>Akron Home Med. Servs., Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 107, 109, 25 OBR 155, 495 N.E.2d 417. See also <em>Moulton Gas Serv., Inc. v. Zaino, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 48, 2002-Ohio-5309, 776 N.E.2d 72, \u00b6 14. However, the terms \u201cpartner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ship,\u201d \u201ccorporation,\u201d and \u201cassociation\u201d are general terms just as \u201corganization\u201d is. Each is a general category having multiple subcategories. Thus, we do not agree with the appellate court\u2019s application of ejusdem generis to construe the word \u201corganization\u201d in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">{\u00b6 21} The school board also contends that R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(a) expressly excludes the state from being an eligible party, and \u201cstate\u201d as defined in R.C. 2743.01 (incorporated by reference in subsection (A)(6)) expressly excludes political subdivisions. Thus, according to the board, political subdivisions are not excluded from being eligible parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 22} In general, we agree that political subdivisions are not excluded under R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(a); however, we do not read this exclusion as broadly as the Cincinnati school board suggests to <em>include </em>all political subdivisions as eligible parties. That a political subdivision is not excluded under R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(a) does not determine eligibility if other statutory provisions apply to exclude a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 2335.39(A)(2) excludes from eligibility those who most likely have the ability to pay litigation costs: entities with a certain number of employees or net worth, wealthy individuals, and the state. The Cincinnati school board is an organization with more than 500 employees; thus, it is excluded from being an eligible party. This exclusion comports with the underlying purpose of this fee-shifting statute: to assist economically disadvantaged parties who have prevailed in proceedings in which the state is a party. See <em>Haghighi v. Moody, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 600, 2003-Ohio-2203, 789 N.E.2d 673, \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Spencer v. Natl. Labor Relations Bd. </em>(C.A.D.C.1983), 712 F.2d 539, 549 (\u201cR.C. 2335.39 is Ohio\u2019s version of the Federal Equal Access to Justice Act. It was passed to censure frivolous government action that coerces a party to resort to the courts to protect his or her rights. It serves to \u2018 \u201cencourage relatively impecunious private parties to challenge unreasonable or oppressive governmental behavior by relieving such parties of the fear of incurring large litigation expenses.\u201d \u2019 \u201d [Citations omitted] ).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 24} For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b673-9\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b673-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b673-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADNH\">dissenting.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A--D\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Bricker &amp; Eekler, L.L.P., Nicholas A.

Mizer, Solicitor General, Alexandra T. Schimmer, Chief Deputy Solicitor General, Stephen P. Carney, Deputy Solicitor, and Todd R. Marti and Jason Patrick Small, Assistant Solicitors, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">{\u00b6 25} I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Yes, \u201corganization\u201d is a rather general term, but it appears in R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) among a list of words describing voluntarily created business enterprises. In contrast, a local board of education is a statutorily created political subdivision. In regard to governmental entities, R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(a) excludes only \u201c[t]he state.\u201d R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(a) would have been the logical place to list other political subdivisions that were also excluded from an award of fees. Moreover, R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(c) also refers to an \u201corganization\u201d but speaks in terms of net worth and possible tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code. It\u2019s not talking about school boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 26} A board of education simply does not fit as an R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) exclusion. And if it doesn\u2019t fit, we must omit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
