Chapter 4112 applicable to a statutory claim for age discrimination brought by an employee claiming that he was wrongfully discharged from employment. The primary issue is whether defendant-appellant, United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d), is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on a claim of age discrimination brought by plaintiff-appellee, Robert Meyer. In particular, we must determine whether Meyer\u2019s age-discrimination claim under R.C. 4112.99 is foreclosed by R.C. 4112.14(C), which provides that a wrongful-discharge cause of action for age discrimination described in R.C. 4112.14(B) and the remedies available under R.C. 4112.01 to 4112.11 are not available when the \u201cdischarge has been arbitrated and has been found to be for just cause.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we conclude that R.C. 4112.14(C) does apply to bar Meyer\u2019s age-discrimination claim in the circumstances of this case. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on the issue we review.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">{\u00b6 2} UPS terminated Meyer\u2019s employment as a package-delivery driver on December 1, 2003. At the time of his discharge, Meyer was 48 years old and had worked for UPS for about 25 years. UPS had terminated Meyer\u2019s employment two previous times in 2003. But on both of those previous occasions, Meyer had filed a grievance, his discipline had been reduced to a suspension without pay, and he had returned to work after serving his suspension. However, Meyer\u2019s grievance over his December 1 discharge was denied, and his discharge was upheld by UPS\u2019s \u201cOhio Joint State Committee\u201d in January 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">{\u00b6 3} Meyer filed a complaint in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas on May 7, 2004, alleging that he had been wrongfully terminated in retaliation for filing several workers\u2019 compensation claims. Meyer raised two claims in his initial complaint going to the alleged retaliatory discharge: that UPS had violated R.C. 4123.90<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and had violated Ohio\u2019s public policy against terminating him for filing the workers\u2019 compensation claims. On September 10, 2004, the trial court denied UPS\u2019s motion to dismiss the R.C. 4123.90 claim, but it granted the motion as to the public-policy retaliatory-discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">{\u00b6 4} In July 2005, the trial court granted Meyer leave to file an amended complaint. In the amended complaint, he added a claim of age discrimination under R.C. 4112.99 and a claim of age discrimination in violation of Ohio\u2019s public policy. Meyer had been replaced by an employee who was in his early twenties.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">{\u00b6 5} On May 1, 2006, UPS moved for summary judgment on all of Meyer\u2019s claims. This motion was premised, in part, on the contention that R.C. 4112.14(C) barred all age-discrimination claims because the proceeding through which Meyer\u2019s grievance had been denied was the equivalent of arbitration and his termination had been upheld in that proceeding. The trial court denied UPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">{\u00b6 6} The case proceeded to a jury trial in August 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found in Meyer\u2019s favor on both his R.C. 4123.90 claim of workers\u2019 compensation retaliatory discharge and his R.C. 4112.99 claim of age discrimination. The trial court entered judgment on the jury verdicts. Meyer was awarded back pay of $113,592, other compensatory damages of $175,000, punitive damages of $25,000 on the age-discrimination claim, prejudgment interest of $47,616.03, and attorney fees and costs in the amount of $135,194.45. The trial court imposed post-judgment interest and ordered UPS to reinstate Meyer to his position. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Upon UPS\u2019s appeal, the First District Court of Appeals rejected several of UPS\u2019s arguments regarding the age-discrimination claim, including that the claim was barred by R.C. 4112.14(C). 174 Ohio App.3d 339, 2007-Ohio-7063, 882 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 16-30. Although the court of appeals held that the UPS grievance proceeding that upheld Meyer\u2019s termination was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of arbitration, it also ruled that the statute\u2019s bar is not applicable to an age-discrimination claim brought solely under R.C. 4112.99. Id. at \u00b6 28-30. However, the court concluded that Meyer was not entitled to a jury trial on his statutory workers\u2019 compensation retaliatory-discharge claim. The allowance of a jury trial on that claim tainted the entirety of the proceedings, the appellate court held, because the evidence presented to the jury went to both the retaliation claim and the age-discrimination claim, which were \u201cinextricably linked.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 2, 39-40, 46. The court reversed in total the judgment in favor of Meyer and remanded for further proceedings. Id. at \u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">{\u00b6 8} We accepted UPS\u2019s appeal under our discretionary jurisdiction for review of a single proposition of law: \u201cIn order to preserve the detailed framework for age discrimination claims that the General Assembly enacted, an age discrimination claim brought under the general language of R.C. 4112.99 is subject to the substantive provisions of R.C. 4112.02 and R.C. 4112.14.\u201d 118 Ohio St.3d 1432, 2008-Ohio-2595, 887 N.E.2d 1201. This appeal does not in any way implicate the R.C. 4123.90 claim for workers\u2019 compensation retaliation, which is subject to further proceedings below regardless of how the age-discrimination claim is resolved in this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">II. Relevant Statutes and Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\n<em>A. Statutes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 4112.02(A) generally prohibits discriminatory employment practices, including age discrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> R.C. 4112.02(N) specifically provides a right to file an age-discrimination action:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201cAn aggrieved individual may enforce the individual\u2019s rights relative to discrimination on the basis of age as provided for in this section by instituting a civil action, within one hundred eighty days after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice occurred, in any court with jurisdiction for any legal or equitable relief that will effectuate the individual\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cA person who files a civil action under this division is barred, with respect to the practices complained of, from instituting a civil action under section 4112.14 of the Revised Code and from filing a charge with the commission under section 4112.05 of the Revised Code.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 4112.14, which was at one time codified at R.C. 4101.17,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> addresses certain specific types of employment age discrimination. That statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(A) No employer shall discriminate in any job opening against any applicant or discharge without just cause any employee aged forty or older who is physically able to perform the duties and otherwise meets the established requirements of the job and laws pertaining to the relationship between employer and employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(B) Any person aged forty or older who is discriminated against in any job opening or discharged without just cause by an employer in violation of division (A) of this section may institute a civil action against the employer in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the court finds that an employer has discriminated on the basis of age, the court shall order an appropriate remedy which shall include reimbursement to the applicant or employee for the costs, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, of the action, or to reinstate the employee in the employee\u2019s former position with compensation for lost wages and any lost fringe benefits from the date of the illegal discharge and to reimburse the employee for the costs, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, of the action. The remedies available under this section are coexistent with remedies available pursuant to sections 4112.01 to 4112.11 of the Revised Code; except that any person instituting a civil action under this section is, with respect to the practices complained of, thereby barred from instituting a civil action under division (N) of section 4112.02 of the Revised Code or from filing a charge with the Ohio civil rights commission under section 4112.05 of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201c(C) The cause of action described in division (B) of this section and any remedies available pursuant to sections 4112.01 to 4112.11 of the Revised Code shall not be available in the case of discharges where <em>the employee has available to the employee the opportunity to arbitrate the discharge or where a discharge has been arbitrated and has been found to be for just cause.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 4112.99 provides in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cWhoever violates this chapter is subject to a civil action for damages, injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>B. Case law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\n<em>1. Elek v. Huntington Natl. Bank</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">(\u00b6 18} In <em>Elek v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 135, 135-136, 573 N.E.2d 1056, Elek filed an action in common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4112.99 for handicap discrimination, and the common pleas court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Upon review, this court stated that a plain reading of R.C. 4112.99 \u201cyields the unmistakable conclusion that a civil action is available to remedy any form of discrimination identified in R.C. Chapter 4112.\u201d Id. at 136, 573 N.E.2d 1056. We also noted that the statutory-construction rule of R.C. 1.47 \u201cspecifically directs courts to give effect to an entire statute\u201d and recognized that \u201cno other section of R.C. Chapter 4112 confers upon an alleged victim of handicap discrimination the right to pursue a civil action. Thus, there can be no conflict between R.C. 4112.99 and the provisions of a more specific subsection. In those instances where such alleged conflict may be presented, existing rules of statutory construction are available to address them (see, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 1.51 [special provision normally prevails over general provision] * * *).\u201d Id. at 137, 573 N.E.2d 1056. In addition, we observed in <em>Elek </em>that \u201cin the area of age discrimination there already exists a redundancy between R.C. 4112.02(N) and 4101.17 [now R.C. 4112.14].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\n<em>2. Bellian v. Bicron Corp.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Bellian v. Bicron Corp. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 517, 519, 634 N.E.2d 608, Bellian brought an age-discrimination claim pursuant to R.C. 4112.99 and argued that he need not comply with the 180-day statute of limitations of R.C. 4112.02(N) because he was not relying on that statute. Bellian asserted that because R.C. 4112.99 states no limitations period, he should be subject to the six-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.07. This court rejected that argument, holding at the syllabus that \u201c[a]ny age discrimination claim, premised on a violation described in R.C. Chapter 4112, must comply with the one-hundred-eighty-day statute of limitations period set forth in former R.C. 4112.02(N).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>{\u00b6 20} In reaching that conclusion, this court in <em>Bellian </em>noted that <em>Elek </em>had recognized that in some instances, R.C. 4112.99 might conflict with more specific provisions within R.C. Chapter 4112. In <em>Bellian, </em>we then applied a rule of statutory construction \u2014 R.C. 1.51 \u2014 mentioned in <em>Elek :</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[W]e have held that where there is no manifest legislative intent that the general provision prevail over the specific provision, the specific provision applies. <em>State v. Chippendale </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 118, 556 N.E.2d 1134. Here, R.C. 4112.99 is the more general statute. Consequently, R.C. 4112.99 prevails over R.C. 4112.02(N) only if there is a clear manifestation of legislative intent. Since the General Assembly has not shown such an intent, the specific provision, R.C. 4112.02(N), must be the only provision applied. Moreover, appellant alleged in Count I of his complaint that the \u2018[defendant and its agents have violated the provisions of Chapter 4112 of the Ohio Revised Code.\u2019 The only provision in R.C. Chapter 4112 that recognizes discrimination on the basis of age is R.C. 4112.02. Thus, regardless of whether appellant stated reliance on R.C. 4112.02 or 4112.99, he had to be referring to the form of age-based employment discrimination identified by R.C. 4112.02.\u201d 69 Ohio St.3d at 519, 634 N.E.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 22} Because R.C. 4101.17 had not yet been recodified as R.C. 4112.14 when <em>Bellian </em>was decided, this court\u2019s observation in <em>Bellian </em>that R.C. 4112.02 was the <em>only </em>specific provision in R.C. Chapter 4112 recognizing age discrimination was an accurate one at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\n<em>3. Cosgrove v. Williamsburg of Cincinnati Mgt. Co., Inc.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Cosgrove v. Williamsburg of Cincinnati Mgt. Co., Inc. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 281, 638 N.E.2d 991, Cosgrove asserted that her employment had been terminated because of her pregnancy and filed a sex-discrimination claim in common pleas court under R.C. 4112.99. In reversing the judgments of the courts below that the complaint was time-barred, this court held at the syllabus that \u201cR.C. 4112.99 is a remedial statute, and is thus subject to R.C. 2305.07\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.\u201d The lead opinion in <em>Cosgrove </em>relied in large part upon <em>Morris v. Kaiser Engineers, Inc. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 45, 14 OBR 440, 471 N.E.2d 471, paragraph two of the syllabus, which had considered what statute of limitations should apply to former R.C. 4101.17 (prior to that statute\u2019s recodification as R.C. 4112.14) and which had held that a six-year statute of limitations applied to an action for age discrimination in employment brought under former R.C. 4101.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">{\u00b6 24} A concurring opinion in <em>Cosgrove </em>specifically addressed the reasons why <em>Bellian </em>and <em>Cosgrove </em>were decided the way they were, thereby reconciling the holdings of the two cases. See 70 Ohio St.3d at 290-293, 638 N.E.2d 991 (Resnick, J., concurring). That concurring opinion in <em>Cosgrove </em>was joined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Chief Justice Moyer and by Justices A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, and Wright, and therefore expressed the view of five members of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">{\u00b6 25} Although both <em>Bellian </em>and <em>Cosgrove </em>involved plaintiffs who brought claims under R.C. 4112.99, this court held in those cases that different statutes of limitations applied. The key to the differing holdings, according to the <em>Cosgrove </em>concurrence, was that <em>Bellian </em>involved a claim of age discrimination, but the claim of the plaintiff in <em>Cosgrove </em>was for sex discrimination, and R.C. 4112.02(N)\u2019s 180-day statute of limitations for age-discrimination claims was inapplicable. Id. at 291, 638 N.E.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 26} There was \u201cno specific R.C. Chapter 4112 provision that conflicted] with R.C. 4112.99\u201d in <em>Cosgrove. </em>Id. at 292, 638 N.E.2d 991 (Resnick, J., concurring). Therefore, R.C. 4112.99 applied without being affected by any other statute within R.C. Chapter 4112. Id. Because R.C. 4112.99 does not provide its own statute of limitations, this court was required to \u201cchoose from among the various statutes of limitations contained elsewhere in the Revised Code on the basis of well-established statutory and common-law principles of construction,\u201d which yielded the \u201cunavoidable\u201d conclusion that Cosgrove\u2019s sex-discrimination claim was subject to R.C. 2305.07\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. at 292-293, 638 N.E.2d 991 (Resnick, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 27} The concurring opinion in <em>Cosgrove </em>observed that \u201cR.C. 4112.99 functions as a gap-filling provision, establishing civil liability for violations of rights for which no other provision for civil liability has been made.\u201d Id., 70 Ohio St.3d at 292, 638 N.E.2d 991.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\n<em>A. Structure of R.C. Chapter J\u00a1112 for age-discrimination claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">{\u00b6 28} A consideration of the foregoing authorities yields several conclusions regarding R.C. Chapter 4112 directly relevant to this case. Because age-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>discrimination claims <em>are </em>specifically addressed in R.C. Chapter 4112, it necessarily follows from <em>Elek, Bellian, </em>and <em>Cosgrove </em>that age-discrimination claims <em>are not </em>governed by the general gap-filling provisions of R.C. 4112.99. Rather, they are covered by the statutes in R.C. Chapter 4112 that are specific to age discrimination. The <em>Cosgrove </em>concurrence cogently explains why this result obtains, and it is fully consistent with <em>Elek </em>and <em>Bellian.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 29} Furthermore, contrary to Meyer\u2019s arguments, the fact that R.C. 4112.14 was not in R.C. Chapter 4112 when <em>Elek, Bellian, </em>and <em>Cosgrove </em>were decided is of no significance. The general accuracy of the reasoning of the <em>Cosgrove </em>concurrence remains sound. R.C. 4112.99 continues to function as a gap filler. Even if an age-discrimination claim is filed solely pursuant to R.C. 4112.99, that statute does not govern the specifics of the claim because there is no gap to fill for such a claim. As was true prior to R.C. 4112.14\u2019s incorporation into R.C. Chapter 4112, R.C. 4112.99 plays no specific role as to age-discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 30} The fundamental reasoning in <em>Bellian </em>regarding age-discrimination claims filed under R.C. 4112.99 retains its authority. It can readily be adapted to fit the current statutory framework because there are now two provisions in R.C. Chapter 4112 that specifically recognize court-filed actions for discrimination on the basis of age: R.C. 4112.02(N) and 4112.14. It is fully appropriate to incorporate R.C. 4112.14 into Bellian\u2019s stated reasoning, yielding the following (adjusted material in brackets): \u201cHere, R.C. 4112.99 is the more general statute. Consequently, R.C. 4112.99 prevails over R.C. 4112.02(N) [and 4112.14] only if there is a clear manifestation of legislative intent. Since the General Assembly has not shown such an intent, the specific provision^], R.C. 4112.02(N) [and 4112.14], must be the only provisions] applied. * * * The only provision^] in R.C. Chapter 4112 that recognize[ ] discrimination on the basis of age [are] R.C. 4112.02 [and 4112.14].\u201d Thus, even if a plaintiff states reliance on R.C. 4112.99, he or she is \u201creferring to the form[s] of age-based employment discrimination identified by R.C. 4112.02 [and 4112.14].\u201d <em>Bellian, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 519, 634 N.E.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 31} Related sections of the Revised Code must be construed together, and in cases involving statutory construction, \u201c \u2018our paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Buehler, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 114, 2007-Ohio-1246, 863 N.E.2d 124, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. See <em>D.A.B.E., Inc. v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Bd. of Health, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 250, 2002-Ohio-4172, 773 N.E.2d 536, \u00b6 28-29 (related statutory provisions must be construed in pari materia). We must \u201c \u2018avoid that construction which renders a provision meaningless or inoperative.\u2019 \u201d <em>D.A.B.E., Inc., </em>at \u00b6 26, quoting <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Spencer Twp. Rural School Disk Bd. of Edn. </em>(1917), 95 Ohio St. 367, 373, 116 N.E. 516; see R.C. 1.47. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>To allow the general provisions of R.C. 4112.99 to prevail over the specific provisions of R.C. 4112.02(N) and 4112.14 would ignore the relevant statutes and would turn the framework of R.C. Chapter 4112 relating to age-discrimination claims on its head. That R.C. 4112.08 requires a liberal construction of R.C. Chapter 4112 does not allow courts to ignore clear statutory directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 32} Consistently with the statutory framework for age-discrimination claims set forth within R.C. Chapter 4112, and with our precedents interpreting that framework, we hold that an age-discrimination claim brought pursuant to R.C. 4112.99 is subject to the substantive provisions of R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>B. Leininger v. Pioneer Natl. Latex</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 33} In <em>Leininger v. Pioneer Natl. Latex, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 311, 2007-Ohio-4921, 875 N.E.2d 36, at the syllabus, we recently held that \u201c[a] common-law tort claim for wrongful discharge based on Ohio\u2019s public policy against age discrimination does not exist, because the remedies in R.C. Chapter 4112 provide complete relief for a statutory claim for age discrimination.\u201d The court of appeals in the present case interpreted <em>Leininger </em>as establishing that an age-discrimination claim under R.C. 4112.99 is not subject to those provisions of R.C. Chapter 4112 that are specific to age discrimination. See 174 Ohio App.3d 339, 2007-Ohio-7063, 882 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 24, stating that this court in <em>Leininger, </em>at \u00b6 31, \u201creiterated its prior holding that had rejected the argument that the specific-remedies provisions of subsections within the chapter prevail over the more general provisions of R.C. 4112.99.\u201d However, the court of appeals\u2019 statement is a misreading of <em>Leininger </em>based on a failure to appreciate the specific context of Leininger\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Leininger, </em>we examined the statutory remedies available under R.C. Chapter 4112 in order to determine whether the jeopardy element, a prerequisite for recognizing a common-law public-policy claim for wrongful discharge, was met for a claim based on age discrimination. See <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 384, 639 N.E.2d 51, fn. 8; <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 69-70, 652 N.E.2d 653; <em>Wiles v. Medina Auto Paris, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526, \u00b6 15. The focus of our inquiry was whether the statutory remedies for employment-related age discrimination \u201cadequately protect society\u2019s interest by discouraging the wrongful conduct\u201d and thus render a public-policy wrongful-discharge claim unnecessary. <em>Leininger, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 311, 2007-Ohio-4921, 875 N.E.2d 36, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">{\u00b6 35} In deciding that question, we first discussed the remedy provisions of R.C. 4112.02(N), 4112.05(G), 4112.14(B), and 4112.99. Id. at \u00b6 29-30. We then stated that \u201cLeininger maintains that we should consider only the remedies in R.C. 4112.14 because it is a more specific statute regarding age discrimination that prevails over the more general provisions of R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.99.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>{\u00b6 36} At this point in the opinion, we remarked in a footnote: \u201cAlthough R.C. 4112.14 was the only statutory claim available to Leininger at the time she filed her complaint due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for claims under R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.05, this fact does not justify limiting our examination of the available remedies under the chapter as a whole. In determining whether a common-law tort claim for wrongful discharge based on Ohio\u2019s public policy against age discrimination should be recognized, we need to look at all the remedies available to a plaintiff at the time the claim accrued.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 31, fn. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">{\u00b6 37} Our discussion in the text of the opinion continued: \u201cWe reject this argument. R.C. 4112.08 requires a liberal construction of R.C. Chapter 4112. Although R.C. 4112.02(N), 4112.08, and 4112.14(B) all require a plaintiff to elect under which statute (R.C. 4112.02, 4112.05, or 4112.14) a claim for age discrimination will be pursued, when an age discrimination claim accrues, a plaintiff may choose from the full spectrum of remedies available. Leininger\u2019s argument also does not take into account the scope of R.C. 4112.99\u2019s remedies. In <em>Elek v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 135, 573 N.E.2d 1056, we stated that R.C. 4112.99 provides an independent civil action to seek redress for any form of discrimination identified in the chapter. Id. at 136, 573 N.E.2d 1056. A violation of R.C. 4112.14 (formerly R.C. 4101.17), therefore, can also support a claim for damages, injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief under R.C. 4112.99. This fourth avenue of relief is not subject to the election of remedies.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Leininger, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 311, 2007-Ohio-4921, 875 N.E.2d 36, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 38} The foregoing discussion in <em>Leininger </em>must be understood within its context. Of particular importance to that understanding is the statement within footnote 4 of <em>Leininger </em>explaining that this court was looking \u201cat all the remedies available to a plaintiff <em>at the time the claim accrued.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., \u00b6 31, fn. 4. Notably, \u201cwhen an age discrimination claim accrues,\u201d no statute of limitations has yet expired, and therefore an age-discrimination plaintiff at that time potentially can seek \u201cthe full spectrum of remedies available\u201d under R.C. Chapter 4112, as the quoted passage of \u00b6 31 of <em>Leininger </em>noted. Pursuant to our precedent, when a plaintiff files an age-discrimination claim solely under R.C. 4112.99 (as happened in <em>Bellian), </em>the plaintiff need not indicate which specific statutory remedies he or she is pursuing, a point also noted in the <em>Leininger </em>discussion. Therefore, a plaintiff who within 180 days files an age-discrimination claim in common pleas court under R.C. 4112.99 preserves the opportunity to pursue all remedies specifically delineated within the chapter. However, as we have explained above, the source of those remedies for age discrimination is the substantive provisions of R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.14; it is not R.C. 4112.99, even though a plaintiff can file under that statute. See <em>Leininger </em>at \u00b6 14, stating that with the incorporation of former R.C. 4101.17 into R.C. Chapter 4112 as R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>4112.14, additional \u201cremedies are available to plaintiffs * * * pursuant to R.C. 4112.99.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 39} The court of appeals was mistaken when it read our mention of <em>Elek </em>in the quoted passage from <em>Leininger </em>as reiterating the \u201cprior holding that had rejected the argument that the specific-remedies provisions of subsections within the chapter prevail over the more general provisions of R.C. 4112.99.\u201d 174 Ohio App.3d 339, 2007-0hio-7063, 882 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 24. In <em>Leininger, </em>this court was not citing <em>Elek </em>for such a broad principle as to age-discrimination claims but was merely noting that at the time an age-discrimination claim <em>accrues, </em>full remedies are available. To the extent that dicta in <em>Leininger </em>might give rise to the impression that <em>Elek </em>is the primary controlling authority for age-discrimination claims, we reject that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 40} We emphasize that all age-discrimination employment-related claims must be governed by the specific statutory directives in R.C. Chapter 4112, and <em>Leininger </em>should not be read as indicating otherwise. To read <em>Leininger </em>out of context the way the court of appeals did elevates R.C. 4112.99 beyond its possible reach for age-discrimination claims, makes irrelevant the specific age-discrimination statutes in R.C. Chapter 4112, and ignores our prior case law, which retains its relevance regarding current R.C. Chapter 4112, as established above.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\n<em>C. R.C. U12-U(C)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">{\u00b6 41} The dispositive issue in this case is whether Meyer\u2019s age-discrimination claim is barred by R.C. 4112.14(C). It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe cause of action described in division (B) of this section and any remedies available pursuant to sections 4112.01 to 4112.11 of the Revised Code shall not be available in the case of discharges where the employee has available to the employee the opportunity to arbitrate the discharge or where a discharge has been arbitrated and has been found to be for just cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">{\u00b6 43} In resolving this issue, the court of appeals first held that Meyer\u2019s termination had been upheld in a proceeding that was the equivalent of arbitration for R.C. 4112.14(C) purposes but then held that R.C. 4112.14(C) did not apply, because an age-discrimination claim under R.C. 4112.99 is not subject to R.C. 4112.14(C). 174 Ohio App.3d 339, 2007-0hio-7063, 882 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 26-30. For the reasons explained below, we accept the first holding but must reject the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">\n<em>1. Arbitration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">{\u00b6 44} The court of appeals summarily determined that Meyer\u2019s termination had been upheld in a proceeding that qualified as \u201carbitration\u201d under the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>by stating: \u201cIt is undisputed that Meyer contested his discharge in the grievance procedure established for employees at UPS. This grievance procedure was the functional equivalent of arbitration.\u201d Id., 174 Ohio App.3d 339, 2007-Ohio-7063, 882 N.E.2d 31, at \u00b6 28. The court of appeals supported this statement by citing its previous decision in <em>Hopkins v. United Parcel Serv., Inc. </em>(Feb. 11, 2000), 1st Dist. No. C-990392, 2000 WL 279228.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>Hopkins, </em>the employee challenged his termination by UPS through established grievance procedures, and after the termination had been upheld at a local hearing, he appealed that result to \u201cthe Ohio Joint State Committee\u201d in Columbus. The Ohio Joint State Committee grievance panel, which was made up of two UPS representatives and two union representatives, conducted a hearing and \u201cheld that Hopkins\u2019s termination was for just cause.\u201d Hopkins then filed an R.C. Chapter 4112 action in common pleas court. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding that the action was barred by R.C. 4112.14(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 46} In rejecting Hopkins\u2019s argument that \u201cthe grievance process lacked the indicia of impartiality that the term \u2018arbitration\u2019 implies,\u201d the First District in <em>Hopkins </em>found persuasive the holdings of other courts that \u201cthe UPS grievance mechanism does possess the requisite procedural safeguards to be deemed arbitration.\u201d 2000 WL 279228 at * 2. The court cited <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Mitchell </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 56, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 67 L.Ed.2d 732, and <em>VanDerVeer v. United Parcel Serv., Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1994), 25 F.3d 403.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 47} Those cited decisions both equated the UPS grievance-review process to an arbitration. See, e.g., <em>VanDerVeer, 25 </em>F.3d at 405 (terming the proceeding before the Ohio Joint State Grievance Committee in which the plaintiffs termi-. nation was upheld an \u201carbitration\u201d). Furthermore, Meyer has not taken issue in any way with this aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning. We therefore accept the court of appeals\u2019 holding that this case involves the functional equivalent of arbitration for R.C. 4112.14(C) purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\n<em>2. Applicability ofRC. 1112.11(C)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">{\u00b6 48} In holding that Meyer\u2019s age-discrimination claim under R.C. 4112.99 is not subject to R.C. 4112.14(C)\u2019s terms, the court of appeals in the case sub judice distinguished its decision in <em>Hopkins </em>because that case interpreted a different version of R.C. 4112.14(C) than is at issue in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>stated, \u201cThe plain language of R.C. 4112.14(C) does not now bar previously-arbitrated cases from proceeding to trial under R.C. 4112.99,\u201d thus placing Meyer\u2019s R.C. 4112.99 claim of age discrimination \u201coutside the ambit of R.C. 4112.14(C).\u201d 174 Ohio App.3d 339, 2007-0hio-7063, 882 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 49} The court of appeals misinterpreted the reach of R.C. 4112.14(C). Our holding earlier in this opinion that an age-discrimination claim brought pursuant to R.C. 4112.99 is subject to the substantive provisions of R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.14 establishes that R.C. 4112.14(C) must apply to Meyer\u2019s age-discrimination claim. Although <em>Bellian </em>and the <em>Cosgrove </em>concurrence analyzed R.C. Chapter 4112 principally with regard to statute-of-limitations issues, the reasoning expressed in those opinions also encompasses other age-discrimination provisions of the chapter beyond statute-of-limitations considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 50} Even though <em>Hopkins </em>interpreted a different version of the statute, it does not follow that R.C. 4112.14(C) does not apply here. Pursuant to our cases discussed above, the statute applies even though Meyer\u2019s age-discrimination claim is brought pursuant to R.C. 4112.99. The age-discrimination claim undoubtedly falls within the ambit of R.C. 4112.14(C) as a \u201ccause of action described in division (B) of\u2019 R.C. 4112.14. As noted in <em>Dworning v. Euclid, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 83, 2008-Ohio-3318, 892 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 41, the General Assembly has, through R.C. 4112.14(C), expressed the intent regarding age-discrimination claims \u201cto prefer arbitration over other remedies when arbitration is available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 51} We hold that pursuant to R.C. 4112.14(C), when the discharge of an employee has been arbitrated and the discharge has been found to be for just cause, the discharged employee is barred from pursuing an action for age discrimination. We conclude that R.C. 4112.14(C) applies to bar Meyer\u2019s age-discrimination claim, because his discharge was arbitrated and was found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>for just cause. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on the dispositive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>D. Other Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 52} UPS asserts that R.C. 4112.02(N) applies to more situations than R.C. 4112.14 does (i.e., R.C. 4112.02(N) applies to \u201crights relative to discrimination on the basis of age,\u201d while R.C. 4112.14 applies only to age discrimination in any job opening or discharge), that the two statutes contain different remedies (i.e., R.C. 4112.02(N) provides for \u201cany legal or equitable relief that will effectuate the individual\u2019s rights,\u201d while R.C. 4112.14(B) provides more limited remedies), and that those statutes have been held to have different statutes of limitations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> UPS accordingly argues that the logical way to give effect to the entirety of the statutory framework governing age-discrimination claims is to allow a plaintiff who fails to file his or her age-discrimination claim within the 180-day statute of limitations of R.C. 4112.02(N) but who does file the claim within six years of its accrual to pursue an age-discrimination claim only in job-opening or discharge situations and to seek only remedies set forth in R.C. 4112.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 53} Although our discussion of <em>Leininger </em>touched upon these issues, we decline to more specifically address UPS\u2019s argument for two reasons. First, because we have determined that Meyer\u2019s age-discrimination claim is barred by R.C. 4112.14(C), there is no need to consider whether the claim, or some aspects of the claim, might also be barred by statute-of-limitation or limitation-of-remedies concerns. See <em>PDK Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement Administration </em>(C.A.D.C.2004), 362 F.3d 786, 799 (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment), in which now Chief Justice John G. Roberts expressed \u201cthe cardinal principle of judicial restraint \u2014 -if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 54} Second, an important component of UPS\u2019s argument in this regard is that the trial court erred in allowing Meyer to amend his complaint to add his age-discrimination claim, because that claim should not relate back under Civ.R. 15(C). However, UPS failed to adequately pursue this precise issue in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>preserve it for appeal. We may therefore assume that Meyer\u2019s age-discrimination claim related back to the filing of his original complaint for purposes of Civ.R. 15(C) and was thus filed within the 180-day limitation period of R.C. 4112.02(N). Consequently, this case is an unsuitable vehicle to specifically address potential issues regarding the interplay of the applicable statutes of limitations and issues regarding election of remedies or limitation of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">{\u00b6 55} Finally, for the same reasons, we decline to address the argument advanced by amicus curiae Ohio Management Lawyers Association that <em>all </em>age-discrimination claims filed under R.C. 4112.99 should be governed by the 180-day statute of limitations of R.C. 4112.02(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 56} We hold that an age-discrimination claim brought pursuant to R.C. 4112.99 is subject to the substantive provisions of R.C. 4112.02 and 4112.14, including R.C. 4112.14(C). We also hold that pursuant to R.C. 4112.14(C), when the discharge of an employee has been arbitrated and the discharge has been found to be for just cause, the discharged employee is barred from pursuing an action for age discrimination. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals regarding Meyer\u2019s claim of age discrimination upon our determination that recovery on that claim is barred by R.C. 4112.14(C). This cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on Meyer\u2019s claim that he was wrongfully discharged in violation of R.C. 4123.90 in retaliation for filing workers\u2019 compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b230-9\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-10\">.

See Sections 1 and 3(A)(3) of Senate Bill 108,149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 385 and 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">{\u00b6 c} The court in <em>Hopkins </em>applied the House Bill 350 version of R.C. 4112.14(C), which stated \u201cunder this chapter.\u201d The court of appeals in the case sub judiee held that the reasoning in <em>Hopkins </em>did not apply because the relevant statutory language is \u201c <em>\u2018any remedies available pursuant to sections U112.01 io 4112.11 of the Revised Code </em>shall not be available.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) 174 Ohio App.3d 339, 2007-0hio-7063, 882 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 29, quoting R.C. 4112.14(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\">. {\u00b6 a} UPS has conceded in this case, both in this court and in the court of appeals, that an age-discrimination claim covered by R.C. 4112.14 is governed by a six-year statute of limitations, as this court determined in <em>Morris </em>when that statute was previously codified at R.C. 4101.17. 14 Ohio St.3d 45,14 OBR 440, 471 N.E.2d 471, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">{Kb} The source of the holding that a six-year statute of limitations applies to an age-discrimination claim that is covered by R.C. 4112.14 is Morris\u2019s holding regarding former R.C. 4101.17 and is <em>not </em>Cosgrove\u2019s holding expressed in that case\u2019s syllabus regarding R.C. 4112.99 for claims other than those for age discrimination. 70 Ohio St.3d 281, 638 N.E.2d 991. We therefore observe that Meyer\u2019s argument that all age-discrimination claims under R.C. 4112.99 are subject to a six-year statute of limitations, based on the <em>Cosgrove </em>syllabus\u2019s holding, is flawed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b230-10\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_L\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">{\u00b6 57} Although otherwise extraordinarily precise, the majority opinion is remarkably loose in describing R.C. 4112.99 as a \u201cgap filler.\u201d Majority opinion, \u00b6 29. Surely if the General Assembly has intended R.C. 4112.99 \u201cto function as a gap filler,\u201d it would have said so. It did not, and I see no reason for this court to depart from common rules of statutory interpretation and add those words to the statute. See <em>Bernardini v. Conneaut Area City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 1, 4, 12 O.O.3d 1, 387 N.E.2d 1222, quoting <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 125, 127, 49 O.O.2d 445, 254 N.E.2d 8 (\u201c \u2018It is the duty of this court to give effect to the <em>words used </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>[in a statute], not to delete words used <em>or to insert words not used.\u2019 </em>[Emphasis added.]\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJh\">Law Office of Marc Mezibov, Marc D. Mezibov, Stacy A. Hinners, and Susan M. Lawrence, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b231-10\">Frost Brown Todd, L.L.C., Kasey Bond, and Eugene Droder III, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b231-11\">Mark P. Herron; and Christina M. Royer, Ltd., and Christina M. Royer, urging affirmance for amicus curiae Ohio Employment Lawyers Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 58} In concluding that R.C. 4112.99 is subject to R.C. 4112.14(C), the majority opinion violates another common rule of statutory interpretation by ignoring the plain meaning of R.C. 4112.14(C). R.C. 4112.14(C) states that it applies to causes of action \u201cdescribed in division (B) of this section and any remedies available pursuant to sections 4112.01 to 4112.11 of the Revised Code.\u201d According to its own plain language, R.C. 4112.14(C) does not apply to R.C. 4112.99. See <em>Coventry Towers, Inc. v. Strongsville </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 18 OBR 151, 480 N.E.2d 412 (\u201cWhen interpreting legislation, courts must give the words used in statutes their plain and ordinary meaning, unless legislative intent indicates otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 59} Furthermore, R.C. 4112.08 states, \u201cThis chapter [R.C. Chapter 4112] shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes * * It is impossible to reconcile the result the majority opinion reaches and the means it uses to reach that result with the General Assembly\u2019s mandate that R.C. 4112.99 be liberally construed \u201cto protect victims of discrimination.\u201d <em>Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 522, 2003-Ohio-4358, 794 N.E.2d 56, \u00b6 22 (Carr, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 60} The majority opinion states: \u201cWe did not accept for review Meyer\u2019s cross-appeal * * *. As a result, the court of appeals\u2019 determination that the trial court\u2019s judgments on the jury verdicts and on additional issues must be reversed and remanded stands as conclusively established and is not within the scope of this appeal.\u201d \u00b6 8, fn. 3. I disagree with this court\u2019s practice of picking and choosing, within a case, the issues that we are willing to review. If a case is worthy of review, in the interests of providing justice to the parties and because, until we see the entire record, it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain the interplay of various issues, all appealed issues should be before us. Whether we address each issue at that point is, of course, within our considered discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">I dissent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AiK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Littler Mendelson, P.C., and Suellen Oswald, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Management Lawyers Association.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
