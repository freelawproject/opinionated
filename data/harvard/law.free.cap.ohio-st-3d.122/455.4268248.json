Because courts generally did not recognize a common-law cause of action for the unauthorized practice of law prior to 2004, and because this court has exclusive jurisdiction over the unauthorized practice of law, we hold that no such cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>action existed. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting appellant Third Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, Gary A. Greenspan, secured a $38,000 mortgage loan from appellant, Third Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association (\u201cThird Federal\u201d), in 2002. Third Federal charged Greenspan a $300 document-preparation fee in connection with the loan. Greenspan later filed a putative class action in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas seeking disgorgement of the document-preparation fee and alleging common-law claims for (1) unjust enrichment and (2) money had and received. Greenspan alleged that Third Federal routinely charged customers a document-preparation fee for services performed by nonattorney personnel in preparing or completing documents relating to the issuance of mortgage loans, in violation of Ohio law. Greenspan did not file a grievance against Third Federal with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel or contact the local bar association about the matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 3} Without issuing a written opinion, the trial court granted Third Federal\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. In its journal entry granting Third Federal\u2019s motion, the trial court stated that prior to September 15, 2004, there was no private right of action, either directly or collaterally, for the unauthorized practice of law. Greenspan appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Eighth District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 4} While Greenspan\u2019s appeal was pending, the Eighth District decided <em>Crawford v. FirstMerit Mtge. Corp., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89193, 2007-Ohio-6074, 2007 WL 3379927, which presented issues nearly identical to those raised in Greenspan\u2019s appeal. In <em>Crawford, </em>the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, holding that the plaintiffs claims were an impermissible attempt to recover damages for the unauthorized practice of law. Id., \u00b6 14-15. The Eighth District affirmed, holding that the unauthorized practice of law is within this court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction and that a person who claims to have been harmed by conduct alleged to have constituted the unauthorized practice of law must take his or her claim through the avenues prescribed by this court. Id., \u00b6 30. The court of appeals concluded that the plaintiffs claims, however styled, were an attempt to bring an action for the unauthorized practice of law, and therefore, the trial court had properly granted judgment on the pleadings. Id., \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Despite the holding in <em>Crawford, </em>a different panel of the Eighth District reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings in the case at bar. <em>Greenspan v. Third Fed. S. &amp; L., </em>177 Ohio App.3d 372, 2008-Ohio-3528, 894 N.E.2d 1250. The court held that because the unauthorized practice of law was available as a defense to breach-of-contract and fee-collection actions, it \u201cinexorably\u201d followed that it was also available as an affirmative cause of action. Id. at \u00b6 20. The appellate court acknowledged that its decision conflicted with <em>Crawford, </em>but declared that <em>Craivford </em>was \u201csimply in error.\u201d <em>Greenspan </em>at \u00b6 26. Despite this court\u2019s mandate in <em>In re J.J., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 205, 2006-Ohio-5484, 855 N.E.2d 851, at \u00b6 18, and its progeny, the Eighth District did not convene en banc to settle the conflict between the two decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 6} The case is now before us on our acceptance of a discretionary appeal. <em>Greenspan v. Third Fed. S. &amp; L., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 1416, 2008-Ohio-6166, 897 N.E.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 7} Third Federal argues that the court of appeals erred in holding that because the unauthorized practice of law may be an affirmative defense to breach-of-contract and fee-collection actions, it \u201cinexorably\u201d gives rise to a private cause of action. Third Federal asserts that prior to September 2004, no common-law cause of action in Ohio permitted a claim for the unauthorized practice of law. It also claims that no such cause of action could have existed because this court has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of attorneys, including the unauthorized practice of law. Thus, according to Third Federal, a private cause of action such as that asserted by Greenspan would necessarily require trial courts to make findings regarding the unauthorized practice of law, thereby invading the exclusive province of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">{\u00b6 8} Greenspan argues that courts have long recognized common-law claims for unjust enrichment and money had and received to recover fees charged by nonlicensed persons for services that must be performed by a licensed professional. Greenspan also contends that because the unauthorized practice of law has been recognized by courts as an affirmative defense in fee-collection actions for services performed by nonlawyers, it follows that the unauthorized practice of law provides a cause of action for recovery of fees already paid for legal services rendered by nonattorneys. Finally, Greenspan argues that trial courts can decide civil cases involving the unauthorized practice of law without improperly invading the exclusive jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">No Common-Law Private Cause of Action Existed Prior to 2004</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">{\u00b6 9} As an initial matter, the court of appeals held that Greenspan\u2019s action did not make a direct claim for the unauthorized practice of law, but rather, asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>common-law claims for unjust enrichment and money had and received. <em>Greenspan, </em>177 Ohio App.3d 372, 2008-Ohio-3528, 894 N.E.2d 1250, \u00b6 24. We disagree. Although Greenspan styled his claims as unjust enrichment and money had and received, ultimately, he sought to recover for Third Federal\u2019s purported unauthorized practice of law. The fact that Greenspan creatively framed the action as one for unjust enrichment and money had and received does not alter the essential nature of the action. \u201cAs this court has long recognized, the substance of the subject matter of a case is determinative, not the form under which a party chooses to bring it.\u201d <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Huron Rd. Hosp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 391, 394, 653 N.E.2d 235. Accord <em>Love v. Port Clinton </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 98, 99, 524 N.E.2d 166, quoting <em>Hambleton v. R.G. Barry Corp. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 179, 183, 12 OBR 246, 465 N.E.2d 1298 (\u201c \u2018In determining which limitation period will apply, courts must look to the actual nature or subject matter of the case, rather than to the form in which the action is pleaded. The grounds for bringing the action are the determinative factors, the form is immaterial\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">{\u00b6 10} The unauthorized practice of law, as defined by this court, \u201c \u2018is the rendering of legal services for another by any person not admitted to practice in Ohio under Rule I and not granted active status under Rule YI, or certified under Rule II, Rule IX, or Rule XI of the Supreme Court Rules for the Government of the Bar of Ohio.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Kocak, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 396, 2009-Ohio-1430, 904 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 17, quoting Gov.Bar R. VII(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 11} Greenspan\u2019s complaint alleges that Third Federal charged him for legal work performed by nonattorney employees. However styled, Greenspan seeks to recover for Third Federal\u2019s purported unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 12} Prior to 2004, there was no statutory cause of action for the unauthorized practice of law. R.C. Chapter 4705 prohibited nonattorneys from rendering legal services, but did not provide a civil remedy for violation of the statute. On September 15, 2004, the legislature amended R.C. 4705.07. R.C. 4705.07(C)(2) now expressly allows civil recovery for actual damages caused by the unauthorized practice of law. Because the events giving rise to this action occurred before the 2004 amendment, this case turns on whether a common-law right of action for the unauthorized practice of law existed prior to 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 13} Greenspan cites a myriad of cases from various state and federal courts for the proposition that courts have long recognized common-law claims for unjust enrichment and money had and received when a person without a license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>performs a service for which a license is required.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the caselaw upon which Greenspan relies almost exclusively relates to architectural and engineering services. Caselaw acknowledging a common-law claim for recovery of fees charged by unlicensed architects and engineers does not establish the existence of a common-law claim for the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 14} Greenspan also points to three cases involving legal services rendered by nonattorneys in support of his argument: <em>Middleton &amp; </em>Assoc. <em>v. Weiss </em>(June 19, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 71416, 1997 WL 337616; <em>Med Controls, Inc. v. Hopkins </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 497, 573 N.E.2d 154; and <em>Cocon, Inc. v. Botnick Bldg. Co. </em>(1989), 59 Ohio App.3d 42, 570 N.E.2d 303. However, none of these cases recognize an affirmative common-law claim for either unjust enrichment or money had and received arising from the unauthorized practice of law. Instead, the cases involve breach-of-contract and fee-collection actions in which the court allowed defendants to raise the unauthorized practice of law as a defense to the plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to recover fees for services rendered by nonattorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 15} Contrary to the Eighth District\u2019s holding, it does not \u201cinexorably\u201d follow that because the unauthorized practice of law may be an affirmative defense in breach-of-contract and fee-collection actions, an affirmative cause of action for the unauthorized practice of law must exist. Greenspan cites no caselaw, and this court is not aware of any, that recognizes an affirmative common-law cause of action for the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 16} In addition to the lack of caselaw recognizing a common-law claim for the unauthorized practice of law, Greenspan simply cannot escape the fact that the Supreme Court of Ohio has exclusive jurisdiction over the practice of law in Ohio, including the unauthorized practice of law. Section 2(B)(1)(g), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution confers on this court \u201cexclusive power to regulate, control, and define the practice of law in Ohio.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. CompManage</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>ment, Inc., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 168, 2004-Ohio-6506, 818 N.E.2d 1181, \u00b6 39. \u201cOur jurisdiction thus extends to regulating the unauthorized practice of law * * *.\u201d <em>Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Kocak, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 396, 2009-Ohio-1430, 904 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 17} In light of our exclusive jurisdiction over the unauthorized practice of law, this court established the Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law to hear complaints regarding the unauthorized practice of law. Gov.Bar R. VII sets forth the procedures that must be followed in the investigation and adjudication of such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 18} Greenspan argues that because trial courts have \u201coriginal jurisdiction in all civil cases\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2305.01, they must have jurisdiction over civil actions arising from claims related to the unauthorized practice of law. We are not persuaded by that argument. A common-law claim for the unauthorized practice of law would require trial courts to make determinations explicitly reserved for this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 19} Our holding is consistent with the legislature\u2019s 2004 amendment to R.C. 4705.07. In enacting a statutory cause of action for the unauthorized practice of law, the General Assembly avoided invading this court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over the practice of law by creating a statutory scheme under which a claimant may commence a civil action for the unauthorized practice of law only \u201cupon a finding by the supreme court that the other person has committed an act that is prohibited by the supreme court as being the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d R.C. 4705.07(C)(2). Moreover, the statute provides that \u201c[t]he court in which the action for damages is commenced is bound by the determination of the supreme court regarding the unauthorized practice of law and shall not make any additional determinations regarding the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d Id. Thus, although trial courts will preside over actions brought pursuant to R.C. 4705.07(C)(2), all determinations regarding the unauthorized practice of law remain within this court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\n<em>D</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 20} Because courts did not recognize a common-law cause of action for the unauthorized practice of law, and because such a cause would invade this court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over the practice of law, a private right of action for the unauthorized practice of law did not exist before September 15, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Appellate Courts Must Convene En Banc to Resolve Intradistrict Conflicts</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">{\u00b6 21} As we reiterated recently, \u201c \u2018[ajppellate courts are duty-bound to resolve conflicts within their respective appellate districts through en banc proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>McFadden v. Cleveland State Univ., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-4914, 896 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>N.E.2d 672, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>In re J.J., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 205, 2006-Ohio-5484, 855 N.E.2d 851, paragraph two of the syllabus; see <em>In re C.F., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 73, 2007-Ohio-1104, 862 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 40 (\u201cappellate courts should resolve internal conflicts through en banc proceedings before initiating a procedure to certify a conflict between districts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 22} Courts of appeals have discretion to determine whether an intradistrict conflict exists. However, if the judges of a court of appeals determine that two or more of the court\u2019s decisions are in conflict, they must convene en banc to resolve the conflict. <em>McFadden, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-4914, 896 N.E.2d 672, \u00b6 19. An en banc proceeding is necessary in such situations to promote uniformity, finality, and predictability within appellate districts. See <em>Textile Mills Secs. Corp. v. Commr. of Internal Revenue </em>(1941), 314 U.S. 326, 333-335, 62 S.Ct. 272, 86 L.Ed. 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 23} The Eighth District acknowledged that this case involves facts and arguments that are virtually identical to those in <em>Crawford </em>and that its decision in this case conflicts with <em>Crawford. Greenspan v. Third Fed. S. &amp; L., </em>177 Ohio App.3d 372, 2008-Ohio-3528, 894 N.E.2d 1250, \u00b6 26. However, the court of appeals declined to convene en banc to resolve the conflict, instead stating that the holding in <em>Crawford </em>was \u201csimply in error.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 24} Although the Eighth District erred by not convening en banc to resolve the intradistrict conflict, given our disposition, we need not remand the cause for additional proceedings. We note, however, that courts of appeals must heed the rule of <em>In re J.J. </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 25} Because courts did not recognize a common-law cause of action for the unauthorized practice of law prior to 2004, and because this court has exclusive jurisdiction over the unauthorized practice of law, no private cause of action existed for the unauthorized practice of law before the amendment of R.C. 4705.07 on September 15, 2004. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting Third Federal\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b573-11\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b573-12\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A1u\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Mark Schlachet; Cohen &amp; Malad, L.L.P., Richard E.
