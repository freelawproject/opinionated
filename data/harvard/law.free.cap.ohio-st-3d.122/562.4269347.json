Gentry, </em>Ashland App. No. 06 COA 038, 2007-Ohio-4781, 2007 WL 2702457, on the following issue: \u201cWhen an insurance policy defines an \u2018occurrence\u2019 as an \u2018accident\u2019 that results in bodily injury, does an \u2018occurrence\u2019 include injuries that result from an intentional act when the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>sured[s] seeking coverage are claimed to have been negligent in relation to that intentional act?\u201d Second, the court certified a conflict with the Third District Court of Appeals decision in <em>United Ohio Ins. Co. v. Metzger </em>(Feb. 8, 1999), Putnam App. No. 12-98-1, 1999 WL 84201, on the following issue: \u201cWhen an insurance policy excludes an injury \u2018which is expected or intended by [an or any] insured * * * injuries \u2018arising out of an illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured\u2019; or \u2018any injury caused by a violation of penal law or ordinance committed by or with the knowledge or consent of any insured,\u2019 do the exclusions become ambiguous when read in conjunction with a \u2018Severability of Insurance\u2019 condition, in light of the announced expectation by policyholders that their negligence will be covered?\u201d We accepted Safeco\u2019s discretionary appeal on the same issues and consolidated the cases. 117 Ohio St.3d 1457, 2008-Ohio-1635, 884 N.E.2d 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 4} For the following reasons, we answer the first certified question in the affirmative, holding that the negligent acts of the Wfiiites are \u201coccurrences\u201d under the language of the Safeco policies at issue. However, we decline to address the second question, which pertains to potential ambiguities in the policy exclusions, because we find the exclusions to be inapplicable in these circumstances. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and hold that the Wfliites are entitled to coverage under the Safeco policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b6 5} In July 2003, 17-year-old Benjamin White attacked and repeatedly stabbed Casey Hilmer, the 13-year-old daughter of Steve and Megen Hilmer, as she was jogging in their neighborhood. Her injuries were not fatal. Benjamin, who lived with his parents, the Whites, at the time of the attack, pleaded guilty to attempted murder and felonious assault. The trial court convicted him and sentenced him to an aggregate term of ten years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 6} After Benjamin was convicted, the Hilmers sued Benjamin and the Whites on multiple claims, including battery against Benjamin and negligent supervision, negligent entrustment, and negligent infliction of emotional distress against the Wfliites. The matter proceeded to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">{\u00b6 7} The jury made several findings relevant to our review. First, the jury found that Benjamin had committed a battery, an intentional tort, against Casey Hilmer and that his intentional acts had also caused Steve Hilmer to suffer emotional distress. Second, the jury found that the Wfliites had been negligent in their supervision of Benjamin, and that this negligence had also injured Casey Hilmer and caused Steve Hilmer to suffer emotional distress. Third, the jury found that the Hilmers were owed $6,500,000 in compensatory damages for these combined torts. Fourth, the jury found that Benjamin was 30 percent responsible for the Hilmers\u2019 injuries and that the WTiites were 70 percent responsible. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The jury also awarded the Hilmers $3,500,000 in punitive damages against Benjamin.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 8} At the time of the attack, the Whites had four insurance policies: a homeowner\u2019s policy and a separate umbrella policy, both issued by Safeco, a second homeowner\u2019s policy issued by appellee Pacific Indemnity Company (\u201cPacific\u201d), and an umbrella policy issued by appellee Federal Insurance Company (\u201cFederal\u201d). When the Hilmers filed suit, the Whites sought a defense and indemnification from each carrier. Pacific and Federal agreed to defend them, but Safeco refused. All, however, expressly denied any obligation to indemnify the Whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b6 9} During the pendency of the suit, Safeco filed the instant action, seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no obligation to defend or indemnify the Whites in relation to claims arising out of their son\u2019s intentional act. The trial court consolidated Safeco\u2019s declaratory-judgment action with the Hilmers\u2019 action, and the insurance companies and the Whites filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of coverage under the policies. Following the jury\u2019s verdict, however, Pacific and Federal withdrew their motions for summary judgment, agreed to indemnify the Whites under the terms of their policies, and claimed that Safeco should share in the cost. Safeco continued to aver that the Whites were not entitled to coverage under its policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Whites, entering a declaratory judgment that Safeco was required to defend and indemnify the Whites in connection with the underlying action. Federal and Pacific subsequently settled with the Hilmers on behalf of the Whites and asked the court to order Safeco to reimburse Federal and Pacific for Safeco\u2019s share of the Whites\u2019 attorney fees and the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">{\u00b6 11} On appeal, the First District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, holding that the Whites\u2019 negligence constituted an \u201coccurrence\u201d pursuant to language in the Safeco policies, even though it related \u201cto the failure to prevent intentional conduct.\u201d <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>Hamilton App. No. C-070074, 2007-Ohio-7068, 2007 WL 4553690, \u00b6 19. The appellate court further held that a severability clause in the Safeco policies created an ambiguity with respect to the application of an exclusion for injuries caused by the intentional act of another insured and that this ambiguity must be read in favor of coverage for the Whites. Id. at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">{\u00b6 12} Safeco contends that its policies do not provide coverage for the Whites\u2019 negligence for two reasons: (1) the injury in this case resulted from an intentional act by Benjamin, an insured under the policies, and therefore the act was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>an \u201coccurrence,\u201d which both policies def\u00edne as an \u201caccident,\u201d and (2) the policies explicitly exclude coverage for the intentional acts of an insured, and the severability clause in both policies does not render the language in the exclusionary clauses ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">{\u00b6 13} Federal and Pacific argue that Safeco\u2019s policies provide coverage because the Whites\u2019 acts were accidental and thus constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policies. Moreover, they contend that the exclusionary language in the Safeco policies is ambiguous because of a severability clause that provides that the insurance applies separately to each insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 14} Before we address these arguments, we review the relevant provisions in the Safeco policies and our caselaw on the general principles applicable when interpreting insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>A. The Safeco insurance policies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 15} The homeowner\u2019s policy issued by Safeco expressly names Lance and Diane Wdiite as insureds, and the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d contained in the policy includes their son, Benjamin. This policy provides coverage when \u201ca claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies.\u201d According to the policy, \u201c \u2018[occurrence\u2019 means <em>an accident\u201d </em>(emphasis added) that results in bodily injury or property damage. The policy expressly excludes coverage for bodily injury or property damage that \u201cis expected or intended by an insured or which is the foreseeable result of an act or omission intended by an insured.\u201d Moreover, the contract excludes coverage for injuries \u201carising out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 16} The umbrella policy issued by Safeco expressly names Lance White as the insured, and the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d includes both Diane and Benjamin. The contract provides coverage for \u201cpersonal injury or property damage caused by an occurrence,\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident\u201d that results in personal injury or property damage. The umbrella policy excludes coverage for \u201c[a]ny injury caused by a violation of a penal law or ordinance committed by or with the knowledge or consent of any insured,\u201d as well as for \u201c[a]ny act or damage which is expected or intended by any insured.\u201d In addition, both policies contain a severability clause that states, \u201cThis insurance applies separately to each insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">{\u00b6 17} As we stated in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, our task when interpreting an insurance policy is to \u201cexamine the insurance contract as a whole and presume that the intent of the parties is reflected in the language used in the policy.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11, citing <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>paragraph one of the syllabus. Moreover, \u201c[w]e look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in the policy unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the contents of the policy.\u201d Id., citing <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 18} We further stated in <em>Galatis </em>that \u201cwhere the written contract is standardized and between parties of unequal bargaining power, an ambiguity in the writing will be interpreted strictly against the drafter and in favor of the nondrafting party.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13, citing <em>Cent. Realty Co. v. Clutter </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 411, 16 O.O.3d 441, 406 N.E.2d 515. Because the insurer, not the insured, typically drafts the language in an insurance policy, \u201can ambiguity in an insurance contract is ordinarily interpreted against the insurer and in favor of the insured.\u201d Id., citing <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 19} With this policy language and caselaw in mind, we consider the issues presented for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">\n<em>B. Negligence related to an intentional act as an \u201coccurrence\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 20} The first issue presented is whether Casey Hilmer\u2019s injury resulted from an \u201coccurrence\u201d for purposes of Lance and Diane White\u2019s claim for coverage under the Safeco policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">{\u00b6 21} Both policies define an \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201caccident\u201d that results in injury or property damage. In <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 666, 597 N.E.2d 1096, we stated that \u201c[i]n its common, ordinary use, the word \u2018accidental\u2019 means unexpected, <em>as well as unintended.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We similarly recognized in <em>Gearing v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 34, 38, 665 N.E.2d 1115, that \u201cinherent in a policy\u2019s definition of \u2018occurrence\u2019 is the concept of an incident of an accidental, <em>as opposed to an intentional, nature.\u201d </em>(Emphasis altered.) Furthermore, in <em>Rothman v. Metro. Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 241, 247, 12 O.O. 50, 16 N.E.2d 417, this court acknowledged that \u201c \u2018accident,\u2019 as the term is ordinarily used, is a more comprehensive term than \u2018negligence,\u2019 and in its common signification means an unexpected happening without intention or design.\u201d Id. at 247, 12 O.O. 50, 16 N.E.2d 417, citing <em>Commonwealth Cas. Co. v. Headers </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 429, 161 N.E. 278. Thus, we held in <em>Rothman </em>that absent contrary language in a policy, \u201cif the injury was not intentionally caused, then it was accidentally suffered.\u201d Id. at 246, 12 O.O. 50, 16 N.E.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">{\u00b6 22} Here, Benjamin intentionally injured 13-year-old Casey Hilmer, but the jury found the Whites negligent with respect to Benjamin\u2019s act. In other words, from Benjamin\u2019s perspective, the act was intentional, but from the perspective of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>his parents, it was accidental. Thus, for purposes of coverage, the question is whether the accidental or intentional nature of the act that caused Casey\u2019s injury should be determined from the perspective of Benjamin or from the perspective of his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">{\u00b6 23} We addressed a similar issue in <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 738 N.E.2d 1243. Doe, who had been sexually molested while living in a residence for the mentally retarded, sued the facility\u2019s operator for negligent retention and supervision of the employees who committed the molestation. Id. at 389, 738 N.E.2d 1243. The operator of the facility sought coverage pursuant to its insurance policy, but the carrier denied the claim and filed a declaratory-judgment action claiming that it had no duty to provide coverage. Id. at 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the carrier, and the court of appeals affirmed, holding that public policy bars coverage not only for the intentional act of sexual molestation but also for negligence with regard to the molestation. We reversed, however, and held that \u201cOhio public policy permits a party to obtain liability insurance coverage for negligence related to sexual molestation when that party has not committed the act of sexual molestation.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b624} Thus, we held that liability coverage hinges on whether the act is intentional from the perspective of the person seeking coverage. As we stated, \u201cthe intentions of the molester are immaterial to determining whether the allegedly negligent party has coverage.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 393, 738 N.E.2d 1243, citing <em>Silverball Amusement, Inc. v. Utah Home Fire Ins. Co. </em>(W.D.Ark. 1994), 842 F.Supp. 1151, 1160, affirmed (C.A.8,1994), 33 F.3d 1476, citing <em>Sena v. Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(D.N.M.1992), 801 F.Supp. 471, 475. Furthermore, we explained, \u201cthe critical issue is the nature of the intent \u2014 inferred or <em>otherwise </em>\u2014 of <em>the party seeking coverage.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at 394, 738 N.E.2d 1243, citing <em>Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. v. Thompson </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 78, 81, 23 OBR 208, 491 N.E.2d 688, and <em>Transamerica Ins. Group v. Meere </em>(1984), 143 Ariz. 351, 356, 694 P.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 25} We concluded that \u201cthe intentions or expectations of the negligent insured must control the coverage determination, and not the intentions or expectations of the molester.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 393, 738 N.E.2d 1243, citing <em>Silverball, </em>842 F.Supp. at 1160. We reasoned that a contrary decision would \u201ceffectively dissolve} ] the distinction between intentional and negligent conduct, allowing the intentional act to devour the negligent act for the purpose of determining coverage.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Silverball, </em>842 F.Supp. at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 26} Although the issue in <em>Doe </em>was whether Ohio public policy permits insurance coverage for negligence arising out of a third party\u2019s illegal act, our rationale applies to this case in that whether the act is intentional must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>determined from the perspective of the person seeking coverage. In addition, many other jurisdictions have held that an \u201coccurrence\u201d exists if the person seeking coverage was negligent with regard to the intentional act. See, e.g., <em>United Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Shelly Funeral Home, Inc. </em>(Iowa 2002), 642 N.W.2d 648, 654; <em>Capital Alliance Ins. v. Thorough-Clean, Inc. </em>(Ala.1994), 639 So.2d 1349, 1352; <em>Durham City Bd. of Edn. v. Nat. Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 109 N.C.App. 152, 162, 426 S.E.2d 451; <em>Atlantic Employers Ins. Co. v. Tots &amp; Toddlers Pre-School Day Care Ctr., Inc. </em>(App.Div.1990), 239 N.J.Super. 276, 284-285, 571 A.2d 300; <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Borbor </em>(C.A.9, 1987), 826 F.2d 888, 895; see also 43 American Jurisprudence 2d (1982) 766, Insurance, Section 708; 2 Allan D. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes (5th Ed.2007) 65-68, Section 11:3.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">{\u00b6 27} Accordingly, we hold that when a liability insurance policy defines an \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201caccident,\u201d a negligent act committed by an insured that is predicated on the commission of an intentional tort by another person, e.g., negligent hiring or negligent supervision, qualifies as an \u201coccurrence.\u201d In this case, neither Lance nor Diane intentionally injured Casey Hilmer. From their perspective, the injury was accidental, and thus the act that caused her injury constitutes an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the policies they purchased from Safeco. Accordingly, we answer the first certified conflict question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">\n<em>C. Policy exclusions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 28} The second issue presented is whether any of the policy exclusions preclude coverage. The parties and the court of appeals appear to agree that, unless found to be ambiguous, the intentional-act and illegal-act exclusions in the homeowner\u2019s and umbrella policies preclude coverage for all the injuries in this case, whether caused by Benjamin\u2019s intentional acts or the Whites\u2019 negligent acts. Pacific and Federal argue that the use of the words \u201can insured\u201d and \u201cany insured\u201d in the exclusions creates an ambiguity that must be read against Safeco when the provisions are read in conjunction with the severability clauses in the policies. See <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, \u00b6 13, citing <em>Cent. Realty Co., </em>62 Ohio St.2d 411, 16 O.O.3d 441, 406 N.E.2d 515 (when a written contract is standardized between parti\u00e9s of unequal bargaining power, an ambiguity will be construed in favor of the nondrafting party).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 29} However, before considering whether the exclusions are ambiguous, we must determine whether they are applicable at all to these circumstances, and we do not find the answer to this question to be a foregone conclusion in view of the different types of torts at issue in this case. In fact, the inquiry raises a separate question that ultimately controls: Do policy exclusions that preclude coverage for the intentional and/or illegal acts of an insured also preclude coverage for related negligent acts of other insureds? After reviewing our caselaw and the caselaw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>from other states, which are split on this topic, we conclude that the exclusions do not preclude coverage for such negligent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">{\u00b6 30} As with the previous issue, <em>Doe </em>is instructive. There, we explored the distinction between injuries arising from intentional and/or illegal acts and those arising from acts like negligent supervision. As in this case, that case also featured allegations of both intentional torts (sexual molestation) and related negligent torts (negligent supervision, retention, and failure to warn) and a dispute over whether the negligent acts were covered by an insurance policy. <em>Doe, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 389-390, 738 N.E.2d 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 31} We held that public policy permits a party to obtain liability insurance coverage for negligence related to intentional acts when the negligent party did not commit the intentional act. Id. at syllabus. In coming to that conclusion, we partially overruled a prior decision, <em>Cuervo v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 41, 665 N.E.2d 1121, that held that insurance coverage for a negligent-supervision claim is barred by the public policy against permitting liability insurance for intentional torts because the negligence damages \u201cflow from\u201d the intentional tort committed, id. at 44, 665 N.E.2d 1121. <em>Doe </em>at 393, 738 N.E.2d 1243. We rejected the <em>Cuervo </em>approach as logically untenable \u201cbecause the intentions of the [party who committed the intentional tort] are immaterial to determining whether the allegedly negligent party has coverage.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 393, 738 N.E.2d 1243, citing <em>Silverball, </em>842 F.Supp. at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 32} As with the previous question, the portions of <em>Silverball </em>cited in <em>Doe </em>remain instructive: \u201c \u2018The ultimate effect of [those opinions denying coverage] leads to a metamorphosis in which certain negligent actions are transformed by the court into intentional actions for the purposes of deciding negligent hiring cases involving sexual abuse. <em>Such a decision effectively dissolves the distinction between intentional and negligent conduct, allowing the intentional act to devour the negligent act for the purpose of determining coverage. </em>The correct method of analyzing this issue in cases with the factual setting and insurance policy provisions involved * * * <em>would deal with each act on its own merits </em>* * *.\u2019 \u201d (Emphases added.) Id. at 393, 738 N.E.2d 1243, quoting <em>Silverball, </em>842 F.Supp. at 1163. We elaborated on this reasoning in <em>Doe, </em>noting that an \u201cinterpretation that refuses to distinguish between the abuser\u2019s intentional conduct and the insured\u2019s alleged negligence would impermissibly ignore the plain language of an insurance policy that excludes from coverage bodily injury that was expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Id. at 394, 738 N.E.2d 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 33} These passages show that torts like negligent supervision, hiring, retention, and entrustment are separate and distinct from the related intentional torts (committed by other actors) that make the negligent torts actionable. Thus, in determining whether a policy exclusion precludes coverage for that negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>act, we must examine the injuries arising from the negligent act on their own accord, not as part of the intentional act. We must also remember that a policy exclusion \u201cwill be interpreted as applying only to that which is <em>dearly </em>intended to be excluded.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Hybud Equip Corp., </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">{\u00b6 34} The two insurance policies at issue in this case each have two exclusions that could apply to these circumstances. The homeowner\u2019s policy precludes coverage for injuries that are \u201cexpected or intended by an insured\u201d or that \u201caris[e] out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured\u201d; the umbrella policy precludes coverage for injuries \u201ccaused by a violation of a penal law or ordinance committed by or with the knowledge or consent of any insured\u201d and for \u201c[a]ny act or damage which is expected or intended by any insured.\u201d Although each exclusion is worded slightly differently, the clear import is that the policies preclude coverage for injuries arising from or caused by the intentional or illegal acts of an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 35} These exclusions plainly apply to Benjamin\u2019s acts: he intentionally stabbed Casey, and the injuries he inflicted upon her and her family arose from the illegal acts he committed. Safeco would end the analysis there, so that Benjamin\u2019s involvement precludes coverage for all related claims because Benjamin was insured under the same policy as the Whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 36} This view fails to acknowledge the separate nature of the negligent-supervision and negligent-entrustment torts. To succeed on any claim of negligence, the plaintiff must show that the defendant breached an applicable duty of care and that the breach proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries. See <em>Lang v. Holly Hill Motel, Inc., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 120, 2009-Ohio-2495, 909 N.E.2d 120, \u00b6 10. Thus, to succeed on both claims, the Hilmers were required to show that the Whites breached their duties to supervise Benjamin and not to entrust him with a dangerous instrument and that <em>these breaches </em>proximately caused the Hilmers to suffer injuries. See also <em>Nearor v. Davis </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 806, 813, 694 N.E.2d 120 (further defining the elements of negligent supervision and negligent entrustment).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 37} This last element is crucial. For the Whites to be liable to the Hilmers, the Hilmers were required to show that they were injured <em>by the Whites\u2019 breaches of duty. </em>While Benjamin\u2019s intentional torts relate to the proximate-causation element (i.e., the Whites\u2019 failure to act with ordinary care enabled Benjamin to injure Casey), the injuries arising from the two types of torts are distinct. To prevail, the Hilmers had to demonstrate a separate injury from the Whites\u2019 negligent failure to monitor Benjamin, one that did not arise from intentional or illegal actions as contemplated by the policy exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>{\u00b6 38} As the jury interrogatories reveal, separate injuries were alleged and proved in this case. The jury determined that the Hilmers were injured by both Benjamin\u2019s intentional battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress <em>and </em>the Whites\u2019 negligent supervision and negligent infliction of emotional distress. These separate causes of action produced distinct injuries, for which Benjamin and the Whites were separately liable; the jury found that Benjamin was responsible for 30 percent of the Hilmers\u2019 compensatory damages for his intentional actions, whereas the Whites were responsible for 70 percent of the Hilmers\u2019 damages for their negligence. Thus, the Whites were held separately liable for their own actions, which were neither intentional nor illegal; the injuries they caused were distinct from the injuries caused by Benjamin\u2019s intentional and illegal acts. Therefore, the intentional-act and illegal-act policy exclusions do not apply to the negligence claims against the Whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">{\u00b6 39} We acknowledge that a split has arisen in the federal and state courts that have examined this precise issue. Several courts have followed the above approach, examining each tort on its own merits and declining to apply intentional-act and illegal-act exclusions (or similar exclusions) to preclude coverage for negligent acts related to intentional torts. See, e.g., <em>C.P. v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(Alaska 2000), 996 P.2d 1216, 1225-1226 (\u201cFrom the perspective of insureds whose acts are alleged to have negligently, but not criminally or intentionally, been a cause of a claimant\u2019s injury, these exclusions do not apply to the negligence claims against them\u201d [at 1226]); <em>Silverball, </em>842 F.Supp. at 1159-1165 (\u201can insurer must provide coverage and a legal defense to an insured where a complaint alleges that an employer was negligent in hiring and supervision of an employee who subsequently committed an intentional tort. An insurance policy would require an exceedingly precise exclusionary clause to avoid that fundamental principle, and there is no such clause in the instant case\u201d [at 1159]); <em>Talley v. MFA Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1981), 273 Ark. 269, 274-275, 620 S.W.2d 260; <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v.

Natl. Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(Pa.Super.1998), 709 A.2d 910, 916-917 (\u201cWhere it is alleged that negligence allowed a crime to occur, does the claim against the negligent arise from the negligence or from the criminality?

See, e.g., <em>Farmer v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(C.D.Cal.2004), 311 F.Supp.2d 884, 893-897; <em>W. Am. Ins. Co. v. Embry </em>(Apr. 25, 2005), W.D.Ky. No. Civ.

Mut. Ins. Co. v. Norgard </em>(N.D.1994), 518 N.W.2d 179, 184; <em>J.G. v. Wangard </em>(Wis.2008), 313 Wis.2d 329, 753 N.W.2d 475, \u00b6 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">{\u00b6 41} The decisions of the courts that are in conflict with our decision here appear to follow the <em>Cuervo </em>approach \u2014 that damages from negligent acts \u201cflow from\u201d related intentional acts \u2014 but we soundly rejected that reasoning in <em>Doe. Doe, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 393, 738 N.E.2d 1243. Our decision to join the courts that have found the intentional-act and illegal-act exclusions inapplicable to acts of negligence related to intentional torts is a continuation of and consistent with the \u201cexamine each act on its own merits\u201d approach established in <em>Doe </em>and our response to the first certified question. As we noted in <em>Doe, </em>this approach comports with common sense: \u201cWhile it is indeed true that the average person would likely find liability coverage for [intentional torts] loathsome, the same rationale cannot extend to negligence. The average person would no doubt find such coverage to be the purpose for which he obtained insurance.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 395, 738 N.E.2d 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">{\u00b6 42} Accordingly, we hold that insurance-policy exclusions that preclude coverage for injuries expected or intended by an insured, or injuries arising out of or caused by an insured\u2019s intentional or illegal acts, do not preclude coverage for the negligent actions of other insureds under the same policy that are predicated on the commission of those intentional or illegal acts, e.g., negligent hiring or negligent supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">{\u00b6 43} Because we find these exclusions to be inapplicable, the second certified question, which pertains to whether the exclusions are ambiguous, is moot. We therefore decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">{\u00b6 44} Because the Whites\u2019 actions qualify as \u201coccurrences\u201d under the applicable policies and because no exclusions apply, the Whites are entitled to coverage under Safeco\u2019s policies. We therefore affirm the decision of the court of appeals, albeit for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b686-6\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b686-7\">Cupp, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b686-8\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b686-9\">Cupp, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANv\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">{\u00b6 45} I concur in the majority opinion in its resolution of the first certified question. However, for clarity, I would rephrase the first syllabus paragraph to read: \u201cA liability insurance policy that defines an \u2018occurrence\u2019 as an \u2018accident\u2019 that results in injury includes within that definition an injury resulting from an intentional act of one insured when another insured seeking coverage is alleged to have been only negligent in relation to that intentional act.\u201d I believe that this language more closely reflects the issue before this court as presented in the first certified-conflict question and in appellant\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">{\u00b6 46} I also concur in the majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that coverage exists under the homeowner\u2019s policy at issue herein and agree with its rationale for that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">{\u00b6 47} I take a different approach, however, in analyzing the umbrella policy, but reach the same conclusion. In contrast to the analysis undertaken with respect to the homeowner\u2019s policy, I do not believe that the issue of coverage under the umbrella policy can be determined simply by pointing out that the conduct of one insured was negligent while the conduct of another insured was intentional. I would answer the second certified-conflict question and address appellant\u2019s first proposition of law, and I would conclude that the term \u201cany insured\u201d when used to define the exclusions in the umbrella policy in conjunction with the policy\u2019s requirement that the insurance be applied separately to each insured is ambiguous. As I view it, the term \u201cany insured\u201d as used in the umbrella-policy exclusion raises an ambiguity that the term \u201can insured\u201d does not raise in the homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">{\u00b6 48} A clearly worded exclusion in an insurance policy may, without violating public policy, exclude all coverage under the policy for an injury to a third party that is intentionally caused by one insured even if the conduct by another insured with regard to the injury is merely negligent. However, I find that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>exclusionary language used in the umbrella policy is ambiguous in this regard. Thus, I arrive at the same ultimate destination as the majority opinion but by a different route.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">{\u00b6 49} It is well established that an ambiguous provision in an insurance policy will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus. It is equally well established that an ambiguity cannot be created in an insurance policy where there is none. <em>Hacker v. Dickman </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 118, 119, 661 N.E.2d 1005. An ambiguous provision is one that has more than one reasonable interpretation. Id. at 119-120, 661 N.E.2d 1005; <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. Price </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St.2d 95, 98-99, 68 O.O.2d 56, 313 N.E.2d 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">{\u00b6 50} The ambiguity in this matter derives from the use of the term \u201cany insured,\u201d which is employed in the umbrella policy in defining the coverage exclusions relevant to this appeal. The umbrella policy excludes coverage for \u201c[a]ny injury caused by a violation of penal law or ordinance committed by or with the knowledge or consent of <em>any insured\u201d </em>and \u201c[a]ny act or damage which is expected or intended by <em>any insured, </em>or which is the foreseeable result of an act or omission intended by <em>any insured.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The severability clause included in the umbrella policy provides: \u201cThis insurance applies separately to each insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">{\u00b6 51} The ambiguity in the foregoing exclusions derives from the fact that there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the term \u201cany insured.\u201d For example, some courts have found that the term \u201cany\u201d can, and often does, have the same meaning as the word \u201can.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Brumley v. Lee </em>(1998), 265 Kan. 810, 813-815, 963 P.2d 1224. Other courts have acknowledged that although \u201can\u201d may mean \u201cany,\u201d a difference between the terms nevertheless exists because \u201can\u201d is seldom used to denote plurality, but \u201cany\u201d can denote plurality. See, e.g., <em>McFarland v. Utica Fire Ins. Co. </em>(S.D.Miss.1992), 814 F.Supp. 518, 525, 526. Definitions in prior editions of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary support both positions: \u201can\u201d is defined as \u201cequivalent to \u2018one\u2019 or \u2018any\u2019; seldom used to denote plurality\u201d; whereas \u201cany\u201d is defined as indicating \u201c \u2018all\u2019 or \u2018every\u2019 as well as \u2018some\u2019 or \u2018one.\u2019 \u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.1979) 77, 86. Against this backdrop, it is not unreasonable to conclude that \u201cany insured\u201d could be interpreted to apply either singularly to \u201c \u2018any one of the insureds\u2019 [only] or * * * collectively to the whole group of insureds.\u201d See <em>Transport Indemn. Co. v. Wyatt </em>(Ala.1982), 417 So.2d 568, 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">{\u00b6 52} Because of these different possible constructions of the term \u201cany insured,\u201d the umbrella-policy exclusions are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation. On one hand, if \u201cany\u201d is interchangeable with \u201can\u201d and means \u201call,\u201d application of the severability clause results in the policy provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>applying equally to all insureds. Accordingly, if one insured engages in an act for which coverage is excluded by the policy, coverage is precluded for all insureds. For purposes of this case, the implication is that all the insureds would be excluded from coverage under the umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">{\u00b6 53} On the other hand, if \u201cany\u201d is interchangeable with \u201can\u201d but instead means \u201cone,\u201d application of the severability clause results in the policy exclusions applying only to the insured who committed the act for which coverage is excluded. This same meaning also occurs if the meaning of the word \u201cany\u201d is distinct from, and more inclusive than, the word \u201can.\u201d Again, for purposes of this case, the ramification is that the umbrella-policy exclusions apply only to the insured who engaged in the intentional act and not to any negligent insureds. The negligent insureds remain covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">{\u00b6 54} This uncertainty in the interpretation of \u201cany insured\u201d in the policy exclusions could have been avoided through careful drafting. The following sentence is an example of a clearly written insurance-policy exclusion: \u201c \u2018If you <em>or any person insured under this policy </em>causes or procures a loss to property covered under this policy for the purpose of obtaining insurance benefits, then this policy is void and we will not pay you <em>or any other insured </em>for this loss.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Hall v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(C.A.5, 1991), 937 F.2d 210, 213 (court held that pursuant to the exclusion, a wife could not recover damages for losses she sustained when her husband [another insured] intentionally burned down their house), cited in <em>Wagner v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 287, 699 N.E.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">{\u00b6 55} Thus, based on the foregoing, I would hold that the term \u201cany insured\u201d used in defining the exclusions in the umbrella policy is ambiguous when read in conjunction with the policy\u2019s severability clause. Accordingly, the case law regarding the interpretation of ambiguous policy provisions applies, and the policy must be construed in favor of the insured. <em>King, </em>35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">{\u00b6 56} On this rationale, I would hold that coverage should be afforded to the insureds under the umbrella policy.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b688-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALZD\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">{\u00b6 57} I concur with the majority in its resolution of the first certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">{\u00b6 58} However, unlike the majority, I would hold that the intentional-act exclusions in both the homeowner\u2019s and the umbrella policies are applicable to all the injuries suffered in this case, and thus, I would reach the second certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>question regarding whether the severability clauses contained in those policies render the exclusions ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Exclusion of Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">{\u00b6 59} The second issue presented is whether a policy\u2019s exclusion of coverage for intentional acts of an insured is ambiguous because of a severability clause that provides that the policy applies separately to each insured. Before considering the severability clauses in the Safeco policies, it is necessary to examine the policies\u2019 exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">{\u00b6 60} In this case, the homeowner\u2019s policy excludes coverage for an injury that \u201cis expected or intended by <em>an insured\u201d </em>or that \u201caris[es] out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of <em>an insured.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The umbrella policy expressly excludes coverage for \u201c[a]ny injury caused by a violation of a penal law or ordinance committed by or with the knowledge or consent of <em>any insured,\u201d </em>as well as for \u201c[a]ny act or damage which is expected or intended by <em>any insured.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">{\u00b6 61} Commentators and courts have recognized that whether such exclusions of coverage apply depends on whether the exclusion refers to \u201cthe insured,\u201d \u201can insured,\u201d or \u201cany insured.\u201d As explained in 2 Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes (5th Ed.2007), 159-160, Section 11:8, \u201c[m]ost exclusions are written to apply to actions taken by \u2018the\u2019 insured. In that event, the exclusion would be inapplicable as to any insured that did not engage in the proscribed actions.\u201d See also <em>Tri-S Corp. v. W. World Ins. Co. </em>(2006), 110 Hawaii 473, 492, 135 P.3d 82; <em>N. Sec. Ins. Co. v. Perron </em>(2001), 172 Vt. 204, 219-222, 777 A.2d 151; <em>Morgan v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1981), 411 Mich. 267, 307 N.W.2d 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">{\u00b6 62} The phrase \u201cany insured,\u201d however, makes the exclusion applicable to <em>all </em>insureds whenever any one of them has committed the prohibited act. As the Supreme Court of Colorado stated in <em>Chacon v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Colo.1990), 788 P.2d 748, \u201c \u2018the phrase \u201cany insured\u201d unambiguously expresses a contractual intent to create joint obligations and to prohibit recovery by an innocent co-insured.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 751, quoting <em>Sales v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(C.A.11, 1988), 849 F.2d 1383, 1385. See also 2 Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes 155-160, Section 11:8.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">{\u00b6 63} Courts are divided on the question whether the phrase \u201can insured,\u201d which appears in the homeowner\u2019s policy in this case, means \u201cthe\u201d insured or \u201cany\u201d insured. Some courts have concluded that the phrase \u201can insured\u201d is ambiguous and should be construed against the insurer because it could mean either \u201cthe insured\u201d or \u201cany insured.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Michigan Millers Mut. Ins. Corp. v. Benfield </em>(C.A.11, 1998), 140 F.3d 915, 926 (Florida law); <em>McFarland v. Utica Fire Ins. Co. </em>(S.D.Miss.1992), 814 F.Supp. 518, 525-526 (Mississippi law).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>{\u00b6 64} A majority of courts, however, hold that the phrase \u201can insured\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cany insured.\u201d As the Supreme Court of Michigan explained in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Freeman </em>(1989), 432 Mich. 656, 443 N.W.2d 734, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[a]\u201d or \u201can\u201d is an indefinite article often used in the sense of \u201cany\u201d and applied to more than one individual object; whereas \u201cthe\u201d is an article which particularizes the subject spoken of.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 698, 443 N.W.2d 734, quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Foster </em>(D.Nev.1988), 693 F.Supp. 886, 889. Thus, the court in <em>Freeman </em>stated that \u201cif we place the word \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018an\u2019 in front of the word \u2018insured,\u2019 then we must conclude that \u2018an insured\u2019 unambiguously means \u2018any insured.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 699, 443 N.W.2d 734; see also <em>Utah Farm Bur.

Blanchard </em>(La.App.1983), 431 So.2d 913, 914-915.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">{\u00b6 65} The majority view is consistent with our prior cases interpreting indefinite articles such as \u201can,\u201d and thus I would adopt it. The word \u201can\u201d is a variant of the word \u201ca,\u201d and as the court stated in <em>Judy v. Bur. of Motor Vehicles, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 122, 2003-Ohio-5277, 797 N.E.2d 45, \u201cthe word \u2018a\u2019 is an indefinite article used to denote a [noun] that is \u2018undetermined, unidentified, or unspecified.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 19, quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1; see also id. at 75 (cross-referencing \u201can\u201d with \u201ca\u201d). Therefore, a liability insurance policy that excludes coverage for the intentional acts of \u201can insured\u201d excludes coverage for the intentional acts of any insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">(\u00b6 66} In this case, the homeowner\u2019s policy issued by Safeco excludes coverage for injuries caused by the intentional or illegal acts of \u201can insured,\u201d while the umbrella policy excludes coverage for injuries caused by the intentional or illegal acts of \u201cany insured.\u201d Both exclusions apply in this case because Benjamin is an insured under the policies and because he intentionally caused the injuries for which his parents sought coverage. I disagree with the majority\u2019s view that the injuries caused by the negligence of Lance and Diane White are distinct from the injuries caused by Benjamin\u2019s intentional acts. Accordingly, although these policies would otherwise provide coverage to Lance and Diane for their negligence, coverage is barred by the intentional-act-by-any-insured exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Severability</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">{\u00b6 67} The foregoing discussion does not end the analysis of the second issue in this case, however, because it is further necessary to consider whether these exclusions are ambiguous when viewed in the context of the severability clause contained in both policies, which states, \u201cThis insurance applies separately to each insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>{\u00b6 68} This issue appears to present a matter of first impression for this court. \u201cA severability clause provides that each insured will be treated independently under the policy.\u201d 2 Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes 161-163, Section 11:8. And as the Supreme Court of Minnesota noted in <em>Am. Natl. Fire Ins. Co. v. Estate of Foumelle </em>(Minn.1991), 472 N.W.2d 292, \u201c[t]he intent of a severability clause is to provide each insured with separate coverage, as if each were separately insured with a distinct policy, subject to the liability limits of the policy.\u201d Id. at 294, citing <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Globe Indemn. Co. </em>(1975), 60 Ill.2d 295, 299, 327 N.E.2d 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 69} Courts have taken differing views when interpreting an insurance policy that contains both a severability clause and an exclusion of coverage for the prohibited act of \u201cany insured.\u201d In <em>Foumelle, </em>for example, the Supreme Court of Minnesota explained that \u201cseverability demands that policy exclusions be construed only with reference to the particular insured seeking coverage.\u201d 472 N.W.2d at 294, citing <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Emmco Ins. Co. </em>(1976), 309 Minn. 21, 243 N.W.2d 134, and 13 Appleman, Insurance Law <em>&amp; </em>Practice (Rev.Ed.1976) 633, Section 7486; see also <em>Premier Ins. Co. v. Adams </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1994), 632 So.2d 1054,1057. Similarly, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held in <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mamell </em>(1986), 398 Mass. 240, 244, 496 N.E.2d 158, that if a policy contains both a severability clause and an exclusion of coverage for a prohibited act of \u201cany insured,\u201d then \u201cthe term \u2018insured\u2019 as used in the * * * exclusion refers only to the person claiming coverage under the policy.\u201d The court in <em>Mamell </em>recognized, however, that while this interpretation gives effect to the severability clause, it \u201cmakes the word \u2018any\u2019 in the * * * exclusion superfluous.\u201d Id. at 245, 496 N.E.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 70} Other courts have held that a policy containing both an any-insured exclusion and a severability clause is ambiguous and must be construed in favor of the insured. See, e.g., <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Keegan </em>(C.A.5, 2000), 209 F.3d 767, 771 (Texas law); <em>Brumley v. Lee </em>(1998), 265 Kan. 810, 815, 963 P.2d 1224; <em>W. Am. Ins. Co. v. AV &amp; S </em>(C.A.10, 1998), 145 F.3d 1224, 1229 (Utah law); <em>Northwestern Natl. Ins. Co. v. Nemetz </em>(Wis.App.1986), 135 Wis.2d 245, 256, 400 N.W.2d 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 71} A majority of courts, however, have held that a severability clause does not create any ambiguity and does not alter the plain meaning and application of an any-insured exclusion. See, e.g., <em>J.G. v. Wangard, </em>2008 WI 99, 313 Wis.2d 329, 753 N.W.2d 475, \u00b6 46-49; <em>Argent v. Brady </em>(App.Div.2006), 386 N.J.Super. 343, 355, 901 A.2d 419; <em>Am. Family Mut. Ins.

New Hampshire Ins. Co. </em>(D.Conn.1989), 716 F.Supp. 718, 721; <em>Great Cent. Ins. Co. v. Roemmich </em>(S.D.1980), 291 N.W.2d 772, 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">{\u00b6 72} The Supreme Court of Colorado\u2019s decision in <em>Chacon </em>is representative of the majority view. There, the teenage son of Reyes and Sarah Chacon vandalized an elementary school. 788 P.2d at 749. Upon reimbursing the school district for the repairs, the district\u2019s insurer sued the Chacons pursuant to a state statute that permitted recovery of up to $3,500 from the parents of a child who willfully damages a school. Id. The Chacons sought coverage for this liability from their homeowner\u2019s insurance carrier, but the carrier denied their claim on the basis of a provision that excluded coverage for damage caused by the intentional act of \u201cany insured,\u201d which included their son. Id. The Chacons filed an action to compel coverage, but both the trial court and the appellate court ruled in favor of the carrier. Id. at 749-750. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Colorado held that the exclusion \u201cclearly and unambiguously expresses an intention to deny coverage to all insureds when damage is intended or expected as a result of the actions of any insured.\u201d Id. at 752. Furthermore, the court emphasized, \u201c[t]he inclusion of a severability clause within the contract is not inconsistent with the creation of a blanket exclusion for intentional acts.\u201d Id. at 752, fn. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 73} This reasoning is persuasive, and I would adopt it. In this case, the Safeco policies exclude coverage for injuries caused by the intentional act of any insured. The language of the severability clause does not suggest that \u201can insured\u201d or \u201cany insured\u201d means \u201cthe insured\u201d or that the exclusions in the policies would not apply in these circumstances. Even if each insured is treated as having a separate policy, the exclusionary language remains unambiguous. As the Supreme Court of North Dakota stated in <em>Norgard, </em>\u201c \u2018the purpose of severability clauses is to spread protection, to the limits of coverage, among all of the * * * insureds. The purpose is not to negate bargained-for exclusions which are plainly worded.\u2019 \u201d 518 N.W.2d at 183, quoting <em>Natl. Ins. Underwriters v. Lexington Flying Club, Inc. </em>(Ky.App.1979) 603 S.W.2d 490, 492.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-L\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Jenks, Pyper &amp; Oxley Co., L.P.A., P. Christian Nordstrom, and Scott G. Oxley, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ABv\">Gallagher Sharp, Jay Clinton Rice, and Richard C.O. Rezie, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AqA\">Murray &amp; Murray Co., L.P.A., Dennis E. Murray Sr., and James L. Murray, urging affirmance for amici curiae, Vincent Joseph Bilgen and Gloria Louis.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">{\u00b6 74} Furthermore, giving the any-insured exclusion its plain meaning does not render the severability clause meaningless, as it would continue to apply in other contexts. See 2 Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes 164, Section 11:8, citing <em>St. Katherine Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., Inc. </em>(C.A.7,1993), 11 F.3d 707, 710-711 (Illinois law); <em>5801 Assocs., Ltd. v. Continental Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.5, 1993), 983 F.2d 662, 664-666; <em>Silverball Amusement, Inc. v. Utah Home Fire Ins. Co. </em>(W.D.Ark.1994), 842 F.Supp. 1151, 1154-1155, affirmed (C.A.8, 1994), 33 F.3d 1476. Thus, only one interpretation of the Safeco policies gives effect to both the exclusions and the severability clauses, and as the court stated in <em>Hacker v. Dickman </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 118, 119-120, 661 N.E.2d 1005, \u201c[i]t is only when a provision in a policy is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation that an ambiguity exists * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 75} Accordingly, I would answer the second certified conflict question in the negative and hold that a provision in a liability insurance policy that excludes coverage for injuries caused by the intentional act of any insured is not made ambiguous by a severability clause providing that the insurance applies separately to each insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 76} Because I would conclude that the injuries caused by the negligent acts of Lance and Diane are not distinct from the injuries caused by the intentional acts of Benjamin, I would hold that the intentional-act exclusions in the policies apply to all the injuries in this case. Furthermore, I would hold that the severability clauses do not render the exclusionary clauses ambiguous. Thus, I would hold that the Safeco policies do not provide liability coverage to Lance and Diane White for the injuries in this case and would therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
