(\u201cTech\u201d). Appellee Valley Roofing Company, L.L.C. (\u201cValley\u201d) bought those assets from PNC and continued the business operation. When Valley applied for workers\u2019 compensation coverage, appellant Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, as part of the process, transferred Tech\u2019s experience rating to Valley, finding that Valley was Tech\u2019s successor in interest. Valley objected and eventually filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">{\u00b6 2} The court granted a writ of mandamus. Relying on <em>State ex rel. Crosset Co., Inc. v. Conrad </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 467, 721 N.E.2d 986, the appellate court found that because the bureau had abused its discretion in determining that Valley was Tech\u2019s successor in interest, the bureau could not transfer Tech\u2019s experience rating to Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">{\u00b6 3} This cause is now before this court on the bureau\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">{\u00b6 4} A successor in interest, under R.C. 4123.32(C), assumes \u201cin proportion to the extent of the transfer * * * the [prior] employer\u2019s account and shall continue the payment of all contributions due under this chapter.\u201d One element of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>account is the experience rating, which factors into an employer\u2019s merit rating for workers\u2019 compensation premium purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">{\u00b6 5} We have defined \u201csuccessor in interest,\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation purposes, as a \u201ctransferee of a business in whole or in part.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lake Erie Constr. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 81, 83-84, <em>578 </em>N.E.2d 458. This definition, however, does not apply if the business assets of the predecessor entity have been purchased from a bank and not directly from that employer. As we stated in <em>Crosset, </em>\u201cthe specific language of R.C. 4123.32(D) [now R.C. 4123.32(C) ] * * *, <em>i.e., </em>\u2018employer transfers his business in whole or in part or otherwise reorganizes the business,\u2019 is plain and unambiguous. The language of the statute clearly refers to a voluntary act of the employer and not the involuntary transfer of the employer\u2019s business through an intermediary bank.\u201d <em>Crosset, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 471, 721 N.E.2d 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 6} Valley did not purchase Tech\u2019s assets from Tech. It acquired them from an intermediary bank. Under <em>Crosset, Lake Erie\u2019s </em>definition of \u201csuccessor in interest\u201d does not apply. Accordingly, Valley cannot be considered to be Tech\u2019s successor in interest and cannot be assigned Tech\u2019s experience rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 7} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b388-9\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b388-10\">Cupp, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Akc\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 8} I respectfully dissent for two reasons. First, we have long recognized\u2014 and deferred to \u2014 the considerable expertise of both the Industrial Commission and the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation in premium matters. See <em>State ex rel. Reaugh Constr. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1928), 119 Ohio St. 205, 209, 162 N.E. 800; <em>State ex rel. McHugh v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 143, 23 O.O. 361, 42 N.E.2d 774; <em>State ex rel. Viox Builders, Inc. v. Lancaster </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 144, 545 N.E.2d 895; <em>State ex rel. Minutemen, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 158, 161, 580 N.E.2d 777. In this case, the bureau determined that Valley Roofing Company, L.L.C. (\u201cValley\u201d), was the successor in interest to Tech Valley Contracting, Inc. (\u201cTech\u201d), and I do not believe that that determination should be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">{\u00b6 9} Second, I also believe that the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>State ex rel. Crosset Co., Inc. v. Conrad </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 467, 721 N.E.2d 986, is misplaced. <em>Crosset </em>does state that <em>Lake Erie Constr. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 81, 578 N.E.2d 458, does not apply when a successor entity purchases the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>predecessor\u2019s assets from an intermediary bank rather than directly from the predecessor itself. 87 Ohio St.3d at 475, 721 N.E.2d 986. <em>Crosset </em>also, however, reaffirmed <em>Lake Erie\u2019s </em>applicability to the transfer of experience ratings, which is the issue now before us. Id. at 474, 721 N.E.2d 986. This, in turn, creates a dilemma. The presence of an intermediary bank supports application of <em>Crosset, </em>but the fact that it is an experience rating and not a retrospective-rating plan that is at issue favors <em>Lake Erie\u2019s </em>applicability. Because I believe that the reasoning underlying <em>Crosset </em>is flawed, <em>Lake Erie </em>should instead apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Crosset, </em>the original company (\u201cOld Crosset\u201d) ceased operations when two banks foreclosed on its assets. 87 Ohio St.3d at 471, 721 N.E.2d 986. TCC Acquisitions then purchased those assets and continued the business under the Crosset name (\u201cNew Crosset\u201d). When New Crosset applied for workers\u2019 compensation coverage, the bureau transferred Old Crosset\u2019s experience rating to it. New Crosset did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 11} The bureau also transferred unpaid obligations associated with Old Crosset\u2019s participation in a retrospective-rating plan. A retrospective-rating plan is an alternative premium plan under R.C. 4123.29(A)(3) that allows an employer to pay a lower annual premium in exchange for the employer\u2019s direct payment of actual medical costs and compensation for each claim arising that year. New Crosset challenged that transfer by filing a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 12} The court of appeals, relying on <em>Lake Erie, </em>defined New Crosset as a successor in interest and upheld the transfer. This court reversed, relevantly holding that (1) R.C. 4123.32(D) did not apply to the acquisition of assets from an intermediary bank and (2) <em>Lake Erie </em>applied to the transfer of experience ratings, not retrospective-rating plans. <em>Crosset, 87 </em>Ohio St.3d at 475, 721 N.E.2d 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 13} The majority holding was based on former R.C. 4123.32(D), now R.C. 4123.32(C), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[I]f <em>any employer </em>transfers a business in whole or in part or otherwise reorganizes the business, the successor in interest shall assume, in proportion to the extent of transfer, * * * the employer\u2019s account and shall continue the payment of all contributions due under this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">{\u00b6 15} The majority\u2019s reasoning was simple: New Crosset acquired Old Crosset\u2019s assets from a bank, not from \u201cany employer.\u201d The majority feared that to approve the transfer under these circumstances \u201cwould subject all purchasers of assets from secured parties, where the purchasers intended to continue in the same business, to liabilities of debtors, even though such purchasers might not have any way of determining what, if any, such liabilities might exist. Chances are that before, during, and after forfeiture of assets of a debtor to a secured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>creditor, even the secured creditor may not know or have any way to find out about any outstanding obligations junior to the secured creditor\u2019s interest.\u201d Id. at 472, 721 N.E.2d 986.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Am\">Hemmer Pangburn DeFrank, P.L.L.C., Scott R. Thomas, and Robert L. Dawson, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b390-11\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Gerald H. Waterman, Assistant Attorney General, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 16} Unlike <em>Lake Erie, Crosset </em>was not unanimous, and the dissent made some thoughtful observations. The dissent challenged the majority\u2019s emphasis on the presence of an intermediary bank for two reasons. It disagreed with the majority\u2019s claim that R.C. 4123.32(D) \u201cclearly refers to a voluntary act of the employer and not the involuntary transfer of the employer\u2019s business through an intermediary bank.\u201d Id. at 471, 721 N.E.2d 986. The dissent stated that Ohio\u2019s commercial code, as contained in R.C. 1336.01(L), defined \u201ctransfer\u201d as \u201cevery direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, and voluntary or involuntary method of disposing of or parting with an asset.\u201d Id. at 476-477, 721 N.E.2d 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 17} The dissent also stressed that \u201cthe majority focuses its analysis on only half of the statutory phrase that supports the authority of the [bureau] administrator.\u201d Id. at 477, 721 N.E.2d 986. R.C. 4123.32(D) applies, she wrote, when \u201cany employer transfers his business * * * <em>or otherwise reorganizes the business.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cReorganization,\u201d she stated, was a \u201ccommonly used term for the restructuring of a business that occurs in bankruptcy. Employers forced into such proceedings would likely hesitate to describe such actions as voluntary.\u201d Id. This observation also undermines the majority\u2019s statement that the presence of an intermediary bank is a critical distinction, since a reorganization through bankruptcy would involve some type of intermediary.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 18} These observations are insightful, and I agree with the conclusion that the <em>Crosset </em>majority read R.C. 4123.32(D) too narrowly. For these reasons, I believe that Valley\u2019s acquisition of Tech\u2019s assets from PNC Bank rather than directly from Tech is irrelevant to the issue of Valley\u2019s status as a successor in interest. I also note that <em>Crosset </em>devoted considerable discussion to affirming <em>Lake Erie\u2019s </em>applicability to the transfer of experience ratings \u2014 a point that the present majority does not address.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, I would reverse the court of appeals and find that, under <em>Lake Erie, </em>Valley is Tech\u2019s successor in interest.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-9\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
