On February 7, 2008, we suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice on an interim basis pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(4), upon receiving notice of his felony conviction. See <em>In re Ridenbaugh, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1511, 2008-Ohio-441, 880 N.E.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline now recommends that we indefinitely suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice. The recommendation is based on the board\u2019s findings that respondent\u2019s acts of voyeurism and use of child pornography, which led to his felony convictions, breached ethical standards incumbent on lawyers in this state. We accept the board\u2019s findings that respondent engaged in professional misconduct and the recommendation for an indefinite suspension; however, we also grant respondent credit for the time his license has been under interim suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with violations of the former Code of Professional Responsibility and the current Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A panel of three board members heard the case, including the parties\u2019 stipulations to charged misconduct, and recommended that this court suspend respondent from practice for two years, order him to comply with various restrictions during that time, and deny his request for credit for the interim suspension of his license. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>but recommended an indefinite suspension under the suggested restrictions and without credit for the interim suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent objects to the board\u2019s recommendation, arguing that the board had no justification for augmenting the sanction recommended by the panel and that an indefinite suspension is too severe. Respondent asks that we (1) impose a two-year suspension with a stay of the last year on conditions resembling those recommended and (2) grant credit for the time served on the interim suspension to offset any suspension period we impose. For the reasons expressed below, we overrule the objections to the indefinite suspension, but sustain the objection to the denial of interim suspension credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent began engaging in the activities that would lead to his arrest sometime in late 2004, when while walking around his apartment complex he discovered that he could sometimes hear people inside an apartment having sexual relations. He started <em>placing a </em>recording device inconspicuously outside apartment windows so that he could record residents\u2019 sexual activity and later listen to the recording for sexual gratification. Respondent continued to make these secret recordings until May 21, 2007, when a resident spied him placing a recording device outside a bedroom window. Law enforcement apprehended respondent later the same day, and he confessed to surreptitious recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 6} A search of respondent\u2019s apartment revealed other evidence of illicit conduct \u2014 possession of child pornography. Police discovered three videos and hundreds of photos and digital images showing minors in various stages of nudity. Respondent later revealed that he began obtaining child pornography near the end of 2006. Officers also found that respondent had made a peephole allowing him to view the female resident in an adjoining apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent was indicted on three counts of intercepting wire, oral, or electronic communications in violation of R.C. 2933.32(A)(1), a felony of the fourth degree, and four counts of voyeurism in violation of R.C. 2907.08(A), a misdemeanor of the third degree, for acts occurring on April 21, 2005, September 27, 2006, and May 21, 2007. He eventually pleaded guilty to a bill of information charging him with three counts of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.322(A)(5), a felony of the fourth degree, and one count of the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(3), a felony of the fifth degree, for acts occurring on November 9, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">{\u00b6 8} After a presentence investigation, respondent was sentenced on November 21, 2007, to a 48-month prison term. He was granted early judicial release in mid-January 2008, after serving only 56 days. He was then placed on community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>control for a period of five years, ordered into therapy, and ordered to comply with a series of probationary restrictions, among them completion of 300 hours of community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent has admitted violations of DR 1-102(A)(3), prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude, and Prof. Cond.R. 8.4(b), prohibiting a lawyer from committing an illegal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty or trustworthiness. He also admits violations of DR 1-102(A)(6) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h), both prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law. We accept these stipulations and find the requisite clear and convincing evidence that respondent committed this professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 10} In determining the appropriate sanction to impose for attorney misconduct, \u201cwe consider the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases.\u201d <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Ake, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 266, 2006-Ohio-5704, 855 N.E.2d 1206, \u00b6 44. We then weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors to decide whether circumstances warrant a more lenient or a harsher disposition. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B). Because each disciplinary case involves unique facts and circumstances, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule and may take into account all relevant factors in determining which sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 11} Respondent has conceded that he violated the duties to the public and legal profession set forth in DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(3), Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(b), DR 1-102(A)(6), and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h). As to the harm posed by this misconduct, the board concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe offenses committed by Respondent were despicable acts. In the case of the voyeurism Respondent\u2019s fetishes led him to intrude into the most intimate aspects of the lives of unsuspecting individuals, many of whom felt compelled to relocate after Respondent\u2019s activity was unveiled. And in the case of the child pornography, Respondent\u2019s viewing of minors for sexual gratification provides direct financial and other support for an insidious subculture that victimizes the most defenseless of our society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">{\u00b6 13} In cases where lawyers commit sex crimes targeting children or other especially vulnerable victims, we have imposed a sanction to at once \u201cprotect the public, deter other lawyers from similar wrongdoing, and preserve the public\u2019s trust in the legal profession.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Goldblatt, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 310, 2008-Ohio-2458, 888 N.E.2d 1091, \u00b6 30. Thus, in <em>Goldblatt, </em>we indefinitely suspended a lawyer\u2019s license to practice following his two felony convictions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>attempting to engage in sexual conduct with an underage victim. Accord <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Pansiera </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 436, 674 N.E.2d 1373 (sexual conduct with minor). And in <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Linnen, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 507, 2006-Ohio-5480, 857 N.E.2d 539, we indefinitely suspended a lawyer from practice following his misdemeanor convictions for indecently exposing himself to at least 30 different women and photographing their reactions. In so doing, we ensured that the lawyers could not return to the practice of law for at least two years as required by Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B) or without requalifying to practice through the rigorous process for reinstatement set forth in the rest of Gov.Bar R. V(10).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>{\u00b6 14} An indefinite suspension from practice is thus an appropriate disposition in this case. Respondent argues, however, that (1) he should receive credit for time served on his interim suspension and (2) mitigating factors outweigh aggravating factors and support a suspension of two years with one year conditionally stayed, allowing him to forgo the petition-for-reinstatement process. In mitigation, the board found:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAlthough only a young lawyer having practiced less than five years before his interim suspension, Respondent does in fact have no disciplinary record.\u201d See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cRespondent has fully cooperated not only in the disciplinary process, but also the judicial process as well.\u201d See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cRespondent has made every attempt to rectify his misconduct by seeking and continuing treatment for the psychological and psychiatric disorders discussed below.\u201d See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThere have unquestionably been other, significant sanctions that have been imposed on Respondent, many of which will continue for years, if not a lifetime.\u201d See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">{\u00b6 19} As aggravating features, the board found:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThere was clearly a selfish motive behind Respondent\u2019s conduct. He succumbed to his sexual fetishes without regard to the privacy and well being of his victims.\u201d See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct involved multiple offenses that took place over a period of years.\u201d See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct was directed at vulnerable victims, particularly with respect to his viewing child pornographic material.\u201d See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">{\u00b6 23} Respondent claims that the board failed to adequately acknowledge his remorse and mental disability in its deliberations. As to the first factor, it is true that the board did not specify respondent\u2019s contrition as mitigating. We, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>however, have no difficulty accepting that respondent deeply regrets his misconduct and the devastating effects it has had on his family, friends, colleagues, and especially his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">{\u00b6 24} In contrast, we find that respondent is unable, for now, to completely satisfy the test in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g)(i) through (iv) for attributing significant mitigating effect to his mental disability. For a mental disability to qualify as a mitigating factor under the rule, the record must contain evidence of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(i) A diagnosis of a * * * mental disability by a qualified health care professional * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(ii) A determination that the * * * mental disability contributed to cause the misconduct;</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(iii) In the event of * * * mental disability, a sustained period of successful treatment; and</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(iv) A prognosis from a qualified health care professional * * * that the attorney will be able to return to competent, ethical professional practice under specified conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">{\u00b6 29} Respondent established the first three elements of this test. Respondent\u2019s psychiatrist, Stephen B. Levine, M.D., is an expert in clinical sexuality, including paraphilia, a condition generated by \u201cthe clash between individual sexual interest and social rules governing sexual behavior.\u201d <em>Goldblatt, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 310, 2008-Ohio-2458, 888 N.E.2d 1091, \u00b6 22. When he came under Dr. Levine\u2019s care in mid-June 2007, respondent had just been hospitalized as suicidal following his arrest. Dr. Levine testified to his four-pronged diagnosis of respondents mental disabilities: (1) dysthymia \u2014 -a chronic low-grade depression from which respondent has suffered since childhood, (2) chronic substance abuse, mainly of marijuana, (3) paraphilia, manifested by voyeuristic and pedophiliac activity, with mixed character disorder marked by a passive, socially avoidant personality, and (4) attention deficit disorder (\u201cADD\u201d), the most treatable of respondent\u2019s disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">{\u00b6 30} Dr. Levine\u2019s testimony also unquestionably established that respondent\u2019s mental disabilities contributed to his ethical breaches. He explained how respondent\u2019s depression and sense of hopelessness traced back to his upbringing, which included abandonment in childhood by his biological father, his mother\u2019s contemporaneous cancer diagnosis, and a few years later, his abrupt and painful separation from his stepfather, to whom respondent had grown close, due to the stepfather\u2019s conviction of possession of child pornography. Overwhelmed with low self-esteem and increasingly unable to achieve sexual satisfaction, respondent fixated on \u201ccoming of age\u201d sexuality and sex acts between pubescent minors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>According to Dr. Levine, respondent suffers from a lack of normal sexual development and as a result engaged in self-destructive behavior, including substance abuse, voyeurism, and extensive viewing of pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">{\u00b6 31} But with psychotherapy and medication, respondent has made strides toward managing his deviant and other unhealthy propensities. Before his incarceration in November 2007, respondent had attended weekly sessions with Dr. Levine; after prison, they met every two weeks until approximately June 2008. At that time, because he had made \u201creasonably\u201d good progress but also due to his financial constraints, respondent had cut back on his appointments with Dr. Levine to just one every three and one-half weeks. He is compliant with prescribed medication, which has included Zoloft, an antidepressant, and Strattera for his ADD. Dr. Levine testified and respondent confirmed that since entering therapy, respondent has not engaged in illegal sexual activity, and random drug testing has shown that he has ceased all substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 32} Megan Robertson, a social worker for the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d), also recounted how respondent had completed a sustained period of successful treatment. She testified that respondent had completely complied with his OLAP contract and had demonstrated commitment to fulfilling the requirements of community service, sex-offender therapy, drug and alcohol therapy, and the terms of his community control. Respondent, who formerly practiced as a bankruptcy attorney, returned to his law firm as a paralegal after his incarceration, and his work remains highly regarded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 33} Respondent has achieved much in terms of recovery and rehabilitation and has expressed gratitude for his arrest as the catalyst for both. But given the risks associated with his misconduct, we do not at this time consider the medical testimony to be clear and convincing proof of the fourth element of the BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g) test \u2014 that respondent is currently capable of returning to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law. We acknowledge that Dr. Levine testified, to a reasonable degree of psychiatric certainty, that respondent was ready to resume his practice. We, however, find too much equivocation in Dr. Levine\u2019s optimism for respondent\u2019s immediate future.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 34} Though making a \u201cvery good prognosis\u201d for respondent, Dr. Levine could say only that he thought respondent \u201cmay eventually get married and have a reasonably normal sexual life.\u201d Thus, respondent has not reached normality in the area of his life that caused his ethical violations, and he therefore continues to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>present a risk of relapse to aberrant behavior. Indeed, Dr. Levine\u2019s tentativeness in vouching for respondent\u2019s ability to avoid deviant sexual activity is evident from his testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">(\u00b6 35} \u201cSo I would say that he\u2019s not going to turn into somebody he wasn\u2019t before, but he\u2019s going to improve that \u2014 he\u2019s going to continue struggling with these characterological features, and I think he can have a far better adaptation. So in general, I have felt optimistic about him. It wasn\u2019t simply a thing that I give to people who are my patients; that is, I sell hope, yes. But I also am realistic to know that some people really can\u2019t and won\u2019t get better under my care.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cAaron, I believe, has engaged in multi-modal therapy. He\u2019s done that in a responsible way. He has a sense of hope for himself. And, therefore, I think I can consciously say that the prognosis is pretty good. But I can\u2019t predict the future. You know, I can\u2019t predict his economic situation. * * * But he has made significant progress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 37} As we explained in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Parker, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 64, 2007-Ohio-5635, 876 N.E.2d 556, \u00b6 84:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cWe have never allowed a lawyer who has committed misconduct because of a mental disability to continue to practice without the assurance of a qualified health-care professional, in conformity with BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g)(iv), that the lawyer is able to practice safely. Evidence suggesting that the lawyer <em>may </em>be able to practice competently and in accordance with ethical and professional standards is not nearly enough. Our cases show that a lawyer whose diagnosed mental disability has contributed to his misconduct must provide competent proof that the disabling symptoms are fully managed <em>currently. </em>E.g., <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Bowman, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 480, 2006-Ohio-4333, 854 N.E.2d 480, \u00b6 38; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Shaw, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 122, 2006-Ohio-3821, 851 N.E.2d 487, \u00b6 33; and <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. McCorkle, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 430, 2005-Ohio-2588, 828 N.E.2d 99, \u00b6 11.\u201d (Emphasis added in part.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">{\u00b6 39} Moreover, Dr. Levine conditioned his prognosis on respondent\u2019s long-term psychiatric treatment, stating that respondent needed continued therapy in order to feel \u201chopeful and responsible\u201d and \u201cto behave in reality, and not return to this la-la land that he existed in for so many years.\u201d He observed that \u201c[a] person with [respondent\u2019s] background could easily see a mental health professional weekly or twice a week, to gain control over the struggles I have described.\u201d Dr. Levine acknowledged that the nearly four-week intervals between respondent\u2019s recent sessions is \u201cdictated more by [respondent\u2019s] ability to pay, and less by his need,\u201d an unfortunate fact confirmed by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">{\u00b6 40} We infer from these concessions that respondent actually needs greater psychiatric oversight than he can currently afford. This leaves us in some doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>as to whether respondent can and will fully sustain the treatment regimen that his psychiatrist insists is crucial for him to control his abnormal sexual impulses. We order respondent\u2019s indefinite suspension from practice and rely on the reinstatement process to determine when respondent is capable of practicing within ethical constraints. On the other hand, we also see no reason to prevent respondent from attempting to qualify for reinstatement beyond the two-year bar imposed by Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B) and therefore also afford credit for the interim suspension of his license.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQMD\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Heather L. Hissom, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AqJ\">Richard C. Alkire Co., L.P.A., Richard C. Alkire, and Dean Nieding, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">{\u00b6 41} Respondent is therefore indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. In addition to the requirements of Gov.Bar R. V(10), respondent must upon petitioning for reinstatement show proof of (1) his compliance with the terms of his ordered community control, (2) his compliance with his OLAP contract, and (3) his continued psychiatric treatment and his ability to return to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law. Respondent is further granted credit for time served under the February 7, 2008 suspension of his license to practice ordered in <em>In re Ridenbaugh, </em>116 Ohio St.3d.1511, 2008-Ohio-441, 880 N.E.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 42} Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b703-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b703-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs with the sanction but would not give credit for time served under the interim suspension.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b703-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents and would permanently disbar respondent from the practice of law in Ohio.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-14\">.
