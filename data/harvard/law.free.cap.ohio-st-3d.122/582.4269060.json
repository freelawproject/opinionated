Periods of post-release control shall be served concurrently and shall not be imposed consecutively to each other.\u201d R.C. 2967.28(F)(4)(c). In addition, insofar as Durain claims that his sentencing entry violated Crim.R. 32, which would render it nonappealable, his remedy is not immediate release from prison pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus.
