Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 1} We are asked to determine whether the mere expenditure of public funds by an institution defined as a public authority in R.C. 4115.03(A) triggers the prevailing-wage requirement set forth in R.C. 4115.03 et seq. We hold that the wage requirement is triggered only when an R.C. 4115.03(A) institution spends public funds to construct a public improvement, which by definition must be constructed by a public authority or must benefit a public authority. Because the public funds herein were not spent on construction of a public improvement, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in holding that the prevailing-wage law does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">II. Facts and Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee Fellhauer Mechanical Systems, Inc. (\u201cFellhauer\u201d) is a private, for-profit electrical, heating, cooling, and plumbing contractor located in Ottawa County. Fellhauer also has a retail business, which sells security systems, audio and video equipment, televisions, and home-theater systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">{\u00b6 3} Fellhauer decided to purchase a building, the real property on which it stood, and office equipment and to renovate the portion of the budding that was used for retail sales. Fellhauer financed the project through several sources, acquiring both public and private funding. Fellhauer applied for a loan from Ottawa County. The source of these funds was a Small Cities Community Developmental Block Grant, which consists of federal funds that are disbursed by the Ohio Department of Development (\u201cODOD\u201d). Thus, Ottawa County filed an application for the grant on Fellhauer\u2019s behalf with the ODOD. The ODOD approved the grant, which expressly provided that Fellhauer was to use $300,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>of these funds to finance the purchase of the building, real property, and office machinery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">{\u00b6 4} Fellhauer also acquired a loan for $36,750 from appellee Ottawa County Improvement Corporation (\u201cOCIC\u201d), which is a publicly funded corporation formed under R.C. 1724.10 to promote economic development in Ottawa County. This loan was funded by conveyance fees on real estate transfers within Ottawa County. Fellhauer also used these public funds to finance its purchase of the building, the property, and the office equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 5} Finally, in addition to $40,000 of John Fellhauer\u2019s own money, he secured $308,250 in private funding. He used $135,000 to finance renovation of the building, and the remainder of the private funds was applied to the balance of the acquisition costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 6} Thus, Fellhauer used public and private funds to finance the purchase of the real property, a building, and office equipment, but used only private funds to finance the renovation of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant Kevin J. Flagg (now deceased), a state taxpayer, and appellant Northwestern Ohio Building &amp; Construction Trades Council (\u201cappellants\u201d), wrote to the Ottawa County prosecutor, stating that Fellhauer\u2019s project was subject to Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage law, R.C. 4115.03 et seq., and demanding legal action to enforce the prevailing-wage law at the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 8} When the prosecutor failed to take any action, appellants filed a verified complaint seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. Appellants alleged that failure to comply with the prevailing-wage law would cause irreparable harm once construction contracts were awarded in the Fellhauer project. The complaint asked the court to compel OCIC and Ottawa County to comply with the prevailing-wage law in connection with public funds they disbursed for the Fellhauer project. Appellants also sought to enjoin the awarding of any contracts in connection with the project until the project came into full compliance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court accepted appellants\u2019 assertion that Ottawa County and OCIC were institutions and public authorities as defined in R.C. 4115.03(A). However, the trial court held that the prevailing wage was not triggered, because expenditure of the funds did not benefit a public authority, but instead benefited Fellhauer, a private, for-profit corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court also held that Fellhauer\u2019s project did not qualify as a public improvement to which the prevailing wage automatically applies under R.C. 4115.032, which designates certain types of projects that are subject to R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Chapter 4115. The trial court concluded that Fellhauer\u2019s project was not an \u201celigible project\u201d under this statute because (1) the project was not funded by the Director of Development and (2) the renovation of a retail sale facility is excluded from the purview of R.C. 4115.032 by R.C. 166.01(D). The trial court entered judgment for the county and OCIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">{\u00b6 11} The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court on different grounds. The court of appeals reasoned that no entity that satisfied the definition of an institution as defined in R.C. 4115.03(A) had expended any funds on the Fellhauer project. Ottawa App. No. OT-07-017, 2008-0hio-1852, 2008 WL 1758888, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 12} Alternatively, the court of appeals held that even if an institution as so defined was associated with the project, no public funds were spent on any construction, i.e., the public funds were used to finance purchase of real property, a building, and office equipment. Id. at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 13} We have accepted Northwestern\u2019s discretionary appeal, which raises the following propositions of law: (1) \u201cAn R.C. Chapter 1724 \u2018Community Improvement Corporation\u2019 is an \u2018institution\u2019 as defined by O.A.C. 4101:9-4-02(P), and a \u2018public authority\u2019 under R.C. 4115.03(A),\u201d (2) \u201cExpenditures of an institution supported in part by public funds trigger prevailing wage applicability under R.C. 4115.03(A) as a matter of law,\u201d (3) \u201cAn Administrative Rule, 4101:9-4-02(BB)(l)(d), cannot be construed in a way that restricts the application of Revised Code, 4115.03(A),\u201d and (4) \u201cSubdividing a single public improvement project into construction and acquisition component parts to avoid prevailing wage applicability violates R.C. 4115.033 and O.A.C. 4101:9^1-17(C).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\n<em>A. Ohio\u2019s Prevailing-Wage Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe prevailing wage statutes, R.C. 4115.03 through R.C. 4115.16, require contractors and subcontractors for public improvement projects to pay laborers and mechanics the so-called prevailing wage in the locality where the project is to be performed.\u201d <em>J.A Croson Co. v. J.A. Guy, Inc. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 346, 349, 691 N.E.2d 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">, {\u00b6 15} Prevailing wage applies to \u201cconstruction projects that are \u2018public improvements\u2019 as defined in R.C. 4115.03(C): \u2018Public improvement\u2019 includes all buildings, roads, streets, alleys, sewers, ditches, sewage disposal plants, water works, and all other structures or works constructed by a public authority of the state or any political subdivision thereof or by any person who, pursuant to a contract with a public authority, constructs any structure for a public authority of the state or political subdivision thereof.\u201d <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Indus. Relations </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 366, 369, 575 N.E.2d 134. To qualify as a public improvement, the project must be constructed by a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>authority or must benefit a public authority. Id.; see also <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. v. Ohio Dept. of Indus. Relations </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 210, 219, 652 N.E.2d 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 16} A \u201cpublic authority\u201d is defined as \u201cany officer, board, or commission of the state or any political subdivision of the state, authorized to enter into a contract for the construction of a public improvement or to construct the same by the direct employment of labor, or any institution supported in whole or in part by public funds and said sections apply to expenditures of such institutions made in whole or in part from public funds.\u201d R.C. 4115.03(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 17} Northwestern argues that an institution defined as a public authority in R.C. 4115.03(A) is distinguishable from other public authorities defined in the same provision in that once such an institution expends public funds, the prevailing-wage requirement applies automatically, regardless of whether the project meets the usual criteria set forth in the rest of the prevailing-wage statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of this argument, Northwestern directs our attention to the final phrase of R.C. 4115.03(A): \u201csaid sections [i.e., R.C. 4115.03 to 4115.16] apply to expenditures of such institutions made in whole or in part from public funds.\u201d This clause, Northwestern contends, \u201crefers to the Prevailing Wage Law as a whole and independently triggers its application\u201d where an institution expends public funds. In other words, when an institution expends public funds, the prevailing wage must be paid as a matter of law, regardless of the statutory criteria set forth elsewhere in the prevailing-wage law. Thus, Northwestern argues that prevailing wage is triggered merely upon an institution\u2019s expenditure of public funds to finance a project, regardless of whether the project involves actual construction of a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d as defined in R.C. 4115.03(C), which is normally required to trigger payment of prevailing wage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 18} The phrase \u201csaid sections apply\u201d within R.C. 4115.03 must be read in its entirety: \u201csaid sections apply to expenditures of such institutions <em>made in whole or in part from public funds.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The intent is clear: the legislature wanted to stress that institutions, which, unlike the state or a political subdivision, may have private sources of funding, are still required to comply with the prevailing-wage law even if some of the expenditures come from private sources. The intent of this phrase was clearly not to saddle institutions with a prevailing-wage obligation every time they expend funds on any project.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 19} Moreover, Northwestern\u2019s argument that <em>any </em>spending of public funds by an R.C. 4115.03(A) institution would require payment of the prevailing-wage law would unjustifiably expand the scope of prevailing-wage law to include projects that are not public improvements, that are not constructed by a public authority, or that do not benefit a public authority. Therefore, just as with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>other public authority, an institution\u2019s expenditure of public funds triggers the prevailing-wage requirement only when the project meets the statutory criteria for determining the applicability of prevailing wage, i.e., where a public authority using public funds contracts to construct a public improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, we hold that the prevailing-wage law applies only when a public authority, including an institution, spends public funds to construct a \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d which by definition must be constructed by a public authority or must benefit a public authority. See <em>Episcopal Retirement, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 369, 575 N.E.2d 134 (a project must be constructed \u201cfor a public authority\u201d in order for the prevailing-wage statutes to apply); Ohio Adm.Code 4101:9-4-02(BB)(l) and (2) (defining \u201cpublic improvement\u201d as a structure \u201cConstructed\u201d by or for a public authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\n<em>B. The Fellhauer Project</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 21} Having concluded that the project at issue today must be subjected to the same prevailing-wage analysis as any other project, we turn now to the task of determining whether the prevailing-wage requirement applies under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 22} The Fellhauer project is not a \u201cpublic improvement.\u201d That term is limited to <em>\u201call buildings, roads, streets, alleys, sewers, ditches, sewage disposal plants, water works, and all other structures or works </em>constructed by a public authority of the state or any political subdivision thereof or by any person who, pursuant to a contract with a public authority, constructs any structure for a public authority of the state or a political subdivision thereof.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4115.03(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 23} Moreover, the Fellhauer project will not be (1) constructed (2) <em>by or for </em>a public authority as also required by R.C. 4115.03(C). <em>Episcopal Retirement, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 369, 575 N.E.2d 134. The only portion of the project that can possibly be \u201cconstructed\u201d is the renovation portion, and that is being done by Fellhauer, using private funds. And none of the project, in fact, is destined to be used by or for any public authority. The entire project is for Fellhauer alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 24} The simple fact is that the Fellhauer project is not a \u201cconstruction\u201d of a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d by or for a public authority. Consequently, because no public funds were used to finance any actual construction of a public improvement that benefits a public authority, the prevailing-wage requirement does not apply to the Fellhauer project.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 25} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b400-12\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Ahm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Cosme, D\u2019Angelo &amp; Szollosi Co., L.P.A., and Joseph M.
