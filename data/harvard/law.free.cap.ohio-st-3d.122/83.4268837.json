Chapter 2744 or any other provision of the law a final and appealable order when the order lacks a Civ.R. 54(B) certification?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">{\u00b6 2} George Sullivan, appellee, sued two parties: Anderson Township, appellant, and Ford Development Corporation, d.b.a. Trend Construction, an alleged subcontractor of Anderson Township. Sullivan averred that a road-widening project undertaken by the township and Trend Construction damaged his property. Sullivan\u2019s claims against the township included breach of contract, negligence, and trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The township answered by denying the substantive allegations of the complaint and asserting political-subdivision immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 and other defenses. The township moved for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that even if the allegations in Sullivan\u2019s complaint were true, they would not give rise to liability of the township, in part because of the immunity provided in R.C. Chapter 2744 for political subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court granted the township\u2019s motion in part and denied it in part. The trial court concluded that judgment on the pleadings was not wholly appropriate, because Sullivan had averred facts sufficient to sustain potential claims for breach of contract and negligence. But the trial court dismissed Sullivan\u2019s claim for trespass and his request for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 5} The township appealed the order to the First District Court of Appeals, asserting that the trial court should have granted judgment on the pleadings on the basis of political-subdivision immunity. The court of appeals held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal, because a trial court order in a multiparty, multiclaim case that disposes of fewer than all the claims against all the parties and that does not make the express determination required by Civ.R. 54(B) that there is no just reason for delay is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 6} The court of appeals acknowledged our holding in <em>Hubbell v. Xenia </em>that \u201cwhen a political subdivision or its employee seeks immunity, an order that denies the benefit of an alleged immunity is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).\u201d <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, \u00b6 2. It distinguished this case from <em>Hubbell </em>by noting that this case has multiple defendants, which is when Civ.R. 54(B) applies, and <em>Hubbell </em>did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 7} The court of appeals certified that its holding in this case conflicted with the decision of the Fourth District Court of Appeals in <em>Drew v. Laferty </em>(June 1, 1999), Vinton App. No. 98CA522, 1999 WL 366532. We recognized the conflict, accepted the township\u2019s appeal, and consolidated the cases. <em>Sullivan v. Anderson Twp., </em>118 Ohio St.3d 1460, 2008-Ohio-2823, 888 N.E.2d 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">{\u00b6 8} The certified issue requires us to answer an often asked question \u2014 Is this order a final, appealable order? Ordinarily, Civ.R. 54(B) requires that a trial court order that disposes of fewer than all claims against all parties in a multiparty and/or multiclaim lawsuit include a determination that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay\u201d for the order to be deemed a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2744.02(C) provides: \u201cAn order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.\u201d The tension between Civ.R. 54(B) and the statute is demonstrated in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>case. Here, the trial court\u2019s order denied the township the benefit of an alleged immunity in a multiparty, multiclaim lawsuit, but that order did not include the language required by Civ.R. 54(B), that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d Thus, the issue in this case is whether an order that denies the benefit of an alleged immunity to a political subdivision is a final, appealable order under R.C. 2744.02(C) in a multiclaim, multiparty lawsuit, when it lacks the Civ.R. 54(B) certification that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d We hold that such an order is a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 10} In this case, we need not apply the general rules for determining whether an order is final and appealable. The general rules regarding final, appealable orders in multiparty and/or multiclaim cases involve the tandem of R.C. 2505.02(B) for substance and Civ.R. 54(B) for procedure. <em>Noble v. Colwell </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 92, 97, 540 N.E.2d 1381. Under the general rules, a court first applies R.C. 2505.02(B) to determine whether the order \u201caffects a substantial right and whether it in effect determines an action and prevents a judgment.\u201d <em>Wisintainer v. Elcen Power Strut Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 352, 354, 617 N.E.2d 1136. If the court of appeals determines that the trial court order is final under R.C. 2505.02, the next step is to determine whether the trial court certified the order with the language of Civ.R. 54(B) \u2014 \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d <em>Wisintainer, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 354-355, 617 N.E.2d 1136; <em>Noble, </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 97, 540 N.E.2d 1381. The use of Civ.R. 54(B) certification by a trial court is discretionary. Id. at 96-97, 540 N.E.2d 1381, and fn. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 11} In the ordinary case, Civ.R. 54(B) certification demonstrates that the trial court has determined that an order, albeit interlocutory, should be immediately appealable, in order to further the efficient administration of justice and to avoid piecemeal litigation or injustice attributable to delayed appeals. <em>Wisintainer, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 356-357, 617 N.E.2d 1136; <em>Noble, </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 96, 540 N.E.2d 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 12} Here, however, no such determination by the trial court is necessary; the General Assembly has expressly made that determination with the enactment of R.C. 2744.02(C), which makes final an order denying a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability. <em>Hubbell, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, at \u00b6 27. Therefore, there is no reason for a trial court to certify under Civ.R. 54(B) that \u201cthere is no just cause for delay.\u201d When the denial of political-subdivision immunity is concerned, the trial court has no discretion to determine whether to separate claims or parties and permit an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">{\u00b6 13} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that R.C. 2744.02(C) permits a political subdivision to appeal a trial court order that denies it the benefit of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>alleged immunity from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744, even when the order makes no determination pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 14} We answer the certified question in .the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. The court of appeals decided this case on jurisdictional grounds and declined to address the merits of the township\u2019s assignment of error. Therefore, this cause is remanded to the court of appeals for consideration of the merits of the assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-7\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b198-8\">Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b198-9\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">{\u00b6 15} I join Justice Lanzinger\u2019s dissent: Civ.R. 54(B) controls this case. The majority today deals another blow to judicial economy by reading into R.C. 2744.02(C) a nonexistent provision regarding multiple-party litigation. Further, the majority\u2019s reliance on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 2744.02(C) makes summary judgment orders denying political-subdivision immunity final orders, not <em>appealable </em>orders. In <em>Hubbell, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, \u00b62, this court held that \u201cwhen a political subdivision or its employee seeks immunity, an order that denies the benefit of an alleged immunity is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).\u201d But in <em>Hubbell </em>this court was not dealing with Civ.R. 54(B)\u2019s limits on the appealability of final orders. <em>Hubbell </em>was not a multiple-defendant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">{\u00b6 17} Neither <em>Hubbell </em>nor R.C. 2744.02(C) addresses the special circumstance of multiple-party litigation. Civ.R. 54(B) should continue to control multiple-party litigation, allowing trial judges to determine how to best achieve judicial economy.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b198-13\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8Q\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">{\u00b6 18} In holding that Civ.R. 54(B) has no application to an order denying immunity to a political subdivision or its employee when multiple claims or multiple parties are involved, the majority does not even quote the language of the procedural rule. Civ.R. 54(B) states: \u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>presented in an action whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, and whether arising out of the same or separate transactions, or when multiple parties are involved, <em>the court may enter final judgment </em>as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties <em>only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. </em>In the absence of a determination that there is no just reason for delay, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties, shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Use of the words \u201cno just cause for delay\u201d signals the transformation of a final order into a final <em>appealable </em>order. <em>Wisintainer v. Elcen Power Strut Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 352, 354, 617 N.E.2d 1136. Wisintainer\u2019s explanation of the rule is helpful:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cAs this court has held in the past, the phrase \u2018no just reason for delay\u2019 is not a mystical incantation which transforms a nonfinal order into a final appealable order. <em>Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 86, 541 N.E.2d 64. Such language can, however, through Civ.R. 54(B), transform a final order into a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cIn deciding that there is no just reason for delay, the trial judge makes what is essentially a <em>factual </em>determination \u2014 whether an interlocutory appeal is consistent with the interests of sound judicial administration, <em>ie., </em>whether it leads to judicial economy. Trial judges are granted the discretion to make such a determination because they stand in an unmatched position to determine whether an appeal of a final order dealing with fewer than all of the parties in a multiparty case is most efficiently heard prior to trial on the merits. The trial court can best determine how the court\u2019s and the parties\u2019 resources may most effectively be utilized. The trial court is most capable of ascertaining whether not granting a final order might result in the case being tried twice. The trial court has seen the development of the case, is familiar with much of the evidence, is most familiar with the trial court calendar, and can best determine any likely detrimental effect of piecemeal litigation. More important than the avoidance of piecemeal appeals is the avoidance of piecemeal trials. It conserves expense for the parties and clarifies liability issues for jurors when cases are tried without \u2018empty chairs.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 354-355, 617 N.E.2d 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Walburn v. Dunlap, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 373, 2009-Ohio-1221, 904 N.E.2d 863, at \u00b6 13, we recently explained, \u201c \u2018It is well-established that an order must be final before it can be reviewed by an appellate court. If an order is not final, then an appellate court has no jurisdiction.\u2019 <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>[1989], 44 Ohio St.3d [17,] 20, 540 N.E.2d 266. \u2018An appellate court, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>determining whether a judgment is final, must engage in a two-step analysis. First, it must determine if the order is final within the requirements of R.C. 2505.02. If the court finds that the order complies with R.C. 2505.02 and is in fact final, <em>then the court must take a second step to decide if Civ.R. 51(B) language is required.\u2019 </em>Id. at 21[, 540 N.E.2d 266].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The General Assembly has clarified that the denial of the benefit of immunity is a final order. R.C. 2744.02(C) provides: \u201cAn order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.\u201d But it is still in the hands of the trial judge to determine whether the Civ.R. 54(B) language should be added to allow the losing party an immediate appeal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYY\">McIntosh &amp; McIntosh, P.L.L.C., and A. Brian McIntosh, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">{\u00b6 22} I disagree with the majority\u2019s statement that in this case, there is tension between a procedural rule and a statute. R.C. 2744.02(C) tells us that we have a final order. But it does not say \u201cfinal <em>appealable </em>order.\u201d The appealability of the order is a procedural determination to be made by the trial judge and is governed by the rules promulgated by this court. See <em>State ex rel. Scruggs v. Sadler, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 78, 2002-Ohio-5315, 776 N.E.2d 101; <em>Intenatl. Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local Union No. 8 v. Vaughn Industries, L.L.C., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 335, 2007-Ohio-6439, 879 N.E.2d 187, \u00b6 8 (\u201cA court may not bypass the requirement to include the express language of Civ.R. 54(B) simply by designating the order as final\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 23} There is no reason to exempt orders under R.C. 2744.02(C) from application of the civil procedural rule. Civ.R. 54(A) explains that the word \u201cjudgment\u201d as used in the rule \u201cincludes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies as provided in section 2505.02 of the Revised Code.\u201d (For example, a final order like that described in R.C. 2744.02(C) is a judgment.) Civ.R. 54(B) states that \u201cthe court may enter <em>final judgment </em>* * * only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, a trial court must certify a final, interlocutory order when there are multiple claims or multiple parties to make it appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 24} I would hold that just as in any other case involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the trial court must certify under Civ.R. 54(B) that \u201cthere is no just cause for delay\u201d before the order denying a political subdivision immunity may be considered a final appealable order. I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b200-7\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Surdyk, Dowd <em>&amp; </em>Turner Co., L.P.A., Edward J.
