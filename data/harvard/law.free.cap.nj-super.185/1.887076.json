Plaintiff challenges Judge Dreier\u2019s determination that a \u201cdue on transfer\u201d clause in a real estate mortgage is not triggered \u201cby its devolution by devise or descent.\u201d Thus the obligation to satisfy the balance of the mortgage debt due as of the death of the testator rests upon the devisee rather than upon the estate as plaintiff would have it. We affirm, 183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Dreier in his written opinion of January 27, 1982.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
