Nowak, </em>Deputy Attorney General, on the brief).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b139-7\">ANTELL, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Respondent appeals from an order by the Director of the Division on Civil Rights finding respondent guilty of unlawful discrimination in employment, ordering payment of $7,714.30 back pay to complainant together with $1,371.17 interest and an additional award of $750 for pain, suffering and humiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">On August 4, 1977 complainant applied to respondent for employment as a laborer. X-rays that were taken as part of a pre-employment physical examination disclosed a \u201cprominent hilar shadow on his left side,\u201d and he was denied employment by reason thereof. This determination was made by respondent pursuant to its standing policy of rejecting all job applicants with lung scarring or other markings. The policy rested upon the company\u2019s asserted belief that because of the silica dust present in the foundry, such persons would have a significant predisposition to contract silicosis or pneumoconiosis on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The Director found on uncontradicted evidence that the hilar shadow was produced by a calcification process within the lung which is perfectly normal and nondisabling and would not predispose complainant to any of the aforementioned lung diseases if he were permitted to work in the foundry environment. The Director also found that respondent\u2019s decision not to employ complainant \u201cwas not reasonably arrived at, was unjustifiable and not based upon supportable and reputable scientific evidence.\u201d These findings are supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole and will not be disturbed. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 598-99 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The sole remaining issue presented on this appeal is whether the Director\u2019s finding that complainant was not disabled places complainant outside the class of persons protected by the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 <em>et seq., </em>even though he was concededly \u201cperceived\" as a handicapped person by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In the recently decided case of <em>Andersen v. Exxon Company, U.S.A., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>483 (1982), the Supreme Court adhered to the rule that in a discrimination case such as this the complainant \u201chas the burden of proving that he was physically handicapped at the time that he applied for the part-time employment with Exxon.\u201d 89 <em>N.J. </em>at 493. However, at 495, n.2, it distinguished the case before it from a \u201c \u2018perceived disability\u2019 \u201d case. Citing <em>Barnes v. Washington Natural Gas Co., </em>22 <em>Wash.App. </em>576, 591 P.2d 461 (Ct.App.1979), and <em>Dairy Equip. Co. v. Dept. of Industry, etc., </em>95 Wis.2d 319, 290 N.W.2d 330 (Sup.Ct.1980), the court went on to state its agreement with the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">... [prejudice in the sense of a judgment or opinion formed before the facts are known is the fountainhead of discrimination engulfing medical disabilities which prove on examination to be unrelated to job performance or to be non-existent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The cases cited clearly stand for the rule that those perceived as suffering from a particular handicap are as much within the protected class as those who are actually handicapped. In <em>Barnes v. Washington Natural Gas Co., supra, </em>the court put it thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">It would defeat legislative purpose to limit the handicap provisions of the law against discrimination to those who are actually afflicted with a handicap, such as epilepsy, and exclude from its provision those perceived as having such a condition ... The law\u2019s application, therefore, should not be limited to those who actually have handicaps, excluding those who are discriminated against in the same way because they are only thought to have handicaps. [591 P.2d at 465]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In <em>Dairy Equip. Co. v. Dept. of Industry, etc., supra, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">It would be both ironic and insidious if the legislative intent in providing the protection of the Fair Employment Act were afforded to persons who actually have a handicap that makes \"achievement unusually difficult\u201d or limits their capacity to work, but the same protection is denied to those whom employers <em>perceive </em>as being handicapped. [290 N.W.2d at 335]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>We understand the import of footnote 2 in <em>Andersen </em>to be that where, as here, the physical condition perceived by the prospective employer as constituting a handicap is actually normal and nondisabling, the provisions of the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 <em>et seq., </em>are nevertheless applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Finally, we find the award of $750 in damages for \u201cpain, mental suffering and humiliation\u201d is supported by complainant\u2019s testimony and the findings of the Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
