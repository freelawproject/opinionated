We agree. The court should not exercise its discretion to increase the rate of interest on a judgment above the rate fixed in <em>R. </em>4:42-ll(a) solely because the mean prime lending rate subsequent to the entry of judgment would have provided a higher return than the rate fixed in the rule. We point out specifically that plaintiffs partially prevailed on their appeal and that, at the time of entry of judgment, the rate of interest fixed in <em>R. </em>4:42-ll(a) approximated the prime lending rate; thus, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiffs were motivated to appeal in order to benefit from a favorable interest rate on judgments during the pendency of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
