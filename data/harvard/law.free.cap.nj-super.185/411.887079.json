A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">This is a medical malpractice matter. We granted plaintiffs leave to appeal from an order, dated June 25, 1981, denying them the right to amend answers to interrogatories to add the name and the report of an additional medical expert, well in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>advance of the date of trial but after plaintiff\u2019s case had been presented to a <em>R. </em>4:21 medical malpractice panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">This case, like <em>Goddard v. Orthopedic Consultant Associates, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>319 (App.Div.1981), a case now on appeal to the Supreme Court of New Jersey and as yet undecided, presents the troublesome problem of the inherent conflict between the underlying purposes of <em>R. </em>4:21-1 <em>et seq. </em>and <em>R. </em>4:17 7 which, subject to <em>R. </em>4:17 \u2014 4(e), permits amendment to answers to interrogatories up to 20 days before the first trial date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As was true in <em>Goddard, </em>the new expert in this case was not utilized before the <em>R. </em>4:21 malpractice panel. Here this was so because this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>expert was obtained by plaintiff after the panel hearing was started and during the recess of the panel. The trial court, in an order dated October 14, 1980, which preceded the one here under review, refused to permit plaintiffs to use the new expert at the continued panel hearing. Leave to appeal that order was denied by this court on November 26,1980 and plaintiffs do not now argue the correctness of that earlier order. Thus, the question presented is whether a party, prior to trial, may seek to add an expert not used before the <em>R. </em>4:21 panel. Although the issue is facially similar to that presented in <em>Goddard, </em>it is not of that character because here the eventual decision of the panel, unlike the panel decision in <em>Goddard, </em>was a 2-1 decision, thus inadmissible at trial <em>(R. </em>4:21-5(e)). The new expert\u2019s report, moreover, added in material degree to the opinions and reports of the experts used by plaintiffs before the <em>R. </em>4:21 panel. The following are the additional facts necessary to our decision. They require reversal of the order entered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The case involves claims of malpractice arising out of the onset of cardiac arrest and resulting permanent brain damage to a 29-year-old female. Suit was brought against a group of physicians, hereafter designated as the Rosenblatt group, consisting of Morton and Alfred Rosenblatt, Samuel Stetzer and William B. Aarons, Jr. Also joined were Dr. A. E. Fontanilla, a surgical resident at Atlantic City Medical Center, and Dr. Maurice Elovitz, house surgeon at the same hospital. The Atlantic City Medical Center was sued as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Plaintiffs initially submitted expert reports to all defendants from Dr. Chodoff and Dr. Coombs in March 1979. In September 1979 plaintiffs amended answers to interrogatories to supply reports dated July 30, 1979 and August 1979 from Dr. Rachmel Cherner. On February 12, 1980 plaintiffs\u2019 counsel advised defendants that he no longer intended to use Dr. Chodoff or Dr. Coombs as expert witnesses. Defendants deposed Dr. Cherner in March 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The pretrial order, apparently dated December 19, 1978 (1979?), provided, \u201cAll discovery to be completed by March 1, 1980. Panel hearing will be held on or after April 1, 1980.\u201d Item 10 of this order (R. 4:25-l(b)[10]), intended by the rule to limit experts, stated \u201cNo limit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">On March 28, 1980, 27 days after the pretrial order cut-off date for discovery, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel submitted to defendants a report dated March 24, 1980 from Dr. Eugene N. Binder of Brookline, Massachusetts. By this time the medical malpractice panel hearing had been scheduled for April 15, 1980. On April 3, 1980 counsel for the Rosenblatt group wrote to the <em>R. </em>4:21 panel judge and requested an adjournment of the panel hearing. On April 15, 1980 the judge adjourned the hearing to June 20, 1980 and advised all attorneys that the panel hearing would not be adjourned again. Defendants then deposed Dr. Binder. It is apparent that neither counsel for the parties nor the court regarded the pretrial order\u2019s discovery cut-off date of March 1, 1980 as absolute and controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">On June 20, 1980 the malpractice panel convened. It heard presentation of plaintiffs\u2019 case and that of the Rosenblatt group. The attorney member of the panel noticed a discrepancy between a page of one copy of the hospital record and the same page as it appeared in a second copy submitted to the panel. By agreement the hearing was adjourned (apparently without date) to obtain the original hospital records. When the panel recessed on June 20,1980 the cases of Dr. Fontanilla and Dr. Elovitz had not been heard. We do not know if the hospital participated as a party to the hearing. See <em>R. </em>4:21-5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The present controversy began during the panel recess when, on July 15, 1980, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel wrote to all counsel for defendants advising that he intended to use Dr. Edward Frank as an expert witness and on August 18, 1980 forwarded Dr. Frank\u2019s expert report. During July and August defendants filed motions to strike Dr. Frank\u2019s name as an expert witness. These motions were returnable September 19, 1980 but were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>postponed until October 10, 1980. On that date the <em>R. </em>4:21 judge refused to permit plaintiffs to amend their answers to interrogatories and to use Dr. Frank as an additional expert. The transcript of that motion indicates that the panel was scheduled to reconvene the following Friday, October 17, 1980. (A trial date of September 9, 1980 had apparently been adjourned because the panel hearing had not been completed.) Although the trial judge requested counsel for defendants to submit the order barring Dr. Frank, the judge instead drafted an order dated October 14, 1980. That order, after reciting the adjournment of the panel hearing and plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to supply the \u201cname and testimony of an additional expert,\u201d ruled that \u201cthe said application is untimely and violates the provisions of <em>R. </em>4:21 and is hereby denied.\u201d The order also denied a stay of the scheduled panel hearing date. Plaintiffs obtained a temporary stay of the panel hearing from this court and filed a timely motion for leave to appeal from the trial court\u2019s order of October 14, 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">On November 26,1980 this court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to appeal and in doing so noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">The notice of motion describes the order in question as providing that the amendment to answers to interrogatories to include an additional medical expert be stricken and neither said expert nor his opinions be considered by either the medical malpractice panel <em>nor subsequently at the trial </em>[sic]. However, the order provides only that the application to supply the name and testimony of an additional expert \u201cis untimely and violates the provisions of <em>R. </em>4:21 and is hereby denied.\u201d No mention is made of barring the use of the expert at the time of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Accordingly, we construe the order as relating only to the malpractice panel and we express no opinion on whether the use of the expert at the time of trial may be barred by reason of failure to comply with the rules pertaining generally to discovery. See, <em>e.g., R. </em>4:17-7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">The motion for a stay of the panel proceedings is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">On December 5,1980 plaintiffs\u2019 counsel advised all counsel for defendants of his intention to call Dr. Frank at trial and offered to make the doctor available to any defendant seeking to take his deposition. Apparently, no response was made to this letter at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The panel reconvened on January 30, 1981 and concluded its hearing on that date. On May 11, 1981 the panel rendered the 2-1 decision by a written order pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21-5(e). The order recited that \u201cpursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:21-5, the findings made [herein] shall not be admissible into evidence at the trial of this cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">On May 20, 1981 counsel for the Rosenblatt group moved to bar Dr. Frank as an expert witness at trial. That motion, joined in by all defendants, was heard on June 12, 1981 before the <em>R. </em>4:21 judge. The court ruled that Dr. Frank could not be used as plaintiffs\u2019 expert at trial; hence, this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Medical malpractice cases are, as the trial court here viewed them, <em>sui generis. </em>They are of a peculiar class frequently requiring the application of persistent and uncommon legal talent in their presentation and an equally skillful and vigorous defense. Experience has taught us that if they are not efficiently handled by counsel for the parties and ably piloted through the system by the judiciary they occupy unwarranted time for discovery and can occupy inordinate amounts of trial time. The common interests of the public, of litigants and of the medical and legal professions were recognized as requiring that baseless medical malpractice suits be discouraged and that well founded actions be encouraged to settle as early as possible. Thus, in 1978, <em>R. </em>4:21 came into being as a means of processing such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The rule, in hopeful expectation of relatively speedy disposition, prescribed that in every vicinage a designated judge should be appointed to \u201cmonitor efficiently\u201d all such cases through discovery, pretrial motions, pretrial conference and the panel hearing to be conducted before the designated judge, a knowledgeable physician and an experienced trial attorney. <em>R. </em>4:21-1, <em>R. </em>4:21-2(b), <em>R. </em>4:21-3 and <em>R. </em>4:21-4(a). In order to expedite the process <em>R. </em>4:21-2(c) directed that the designated judge \u201cshall conduct a pretrial conference . . . not later than twelve months following service of process upon the defendants,\u201d and required that the pretrial order provide for the submission of the claim to the panel. Implicit in the rule was the expectation that all discovery would be completed prior to the pretrial conference or soon thereafter, so that the case would be ready for panel consideration in little more than one year of service upon the defendant physician. That is the expectation. The reality, unfortunately, is frequently different.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The trial judge in this case is experienced in shepherding <em>R. </em>4:21 cases and conscious of the burden the rule imposes to \u201cmonitor efficiently the case through the court.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:21-1. It is equally clear that he realized that the expeditious process contemplated by the rule necessarily must be tempered by a sense of fairness to all parties. Thus, he granted an adjournment of the first panel date when plaintiffs added Dr. Binder to their list of experts, although that move was made 27 days after the pretrial conference and only 18 days before the date the panel was to meet. This was done to allow plaintiffs to amend interrogatories in order to make their case more complete and to permit defendants to depose the new expert. The ruling was in accord with the trial court\u2019s view, already expressed in <em>Conde v. Brown, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 355 (Law Div.1980), that the \u201cpanel hearing date may be regulated according to the completeness of the discovery\u201d and that because the panel \u201cmust make findings with respect to the question of malpractice, it follows that all discovery must be completed earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>In <em>Conde, </em>where the plaintiff attempted to add an expert after the panel rendered its decision, the judge, who also sat in the present case, refused to permit amendment, holding that to do so \u201cwould have the potential of altering the case presented at trial.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <em>Conde </em>opinion presents his reasons for doing so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">The panel procedure is designed to serve as an additional catalyst in the litigation process. It is intended to weed out the worthless case, not to prevent the trial of the cases where a fair factual issue is presented. It was the hope of the committee which drew up the revised rule that settlements would be substantially encouraged as a result of it. Experience to date indicates this hope is being fulfilled. If no settlement is reached, the case goes on the trial calendar and is tried in turn. To permit the plaintiff a change in experts for trial would emasculate the purpose of first presenting the case to the panel. Plaintiffs\u2019 assurances that the added expert will testify within the existing parameters of the case are not persuasive. The distinct possibility of new testimony poses substantive prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The reasoning quoted above seems to be the root of the trial judge\u2019s later decision to deny plaintiffs the right to use Dr. Prank at trial. The judge properly held <em>Goddard </em>to be inapposite, primarily because the present case was an attempt to vary the evidence presented to the panel. In addition it is clear that the trial judge, as he did in <em>Conde, </em>viewed any attempt to add an expert after a panel has decided the case as destructive of <em>R. </em>4:21 and its underlying purposes. Thus, the trial judge here held that \u201cnobody [no expert] gets to the jury that didn\u2019t get to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the panel.\u201d This view of the rule quite naturally raises the question as to why a new expert should be disallowed when, as here, (1) the panel decision cannot be used at trial and the new expert report, although it varies from and adds to the evidence presented to the panel, cannot, thus, affect any use of the panel\u2019s decision; (2) no trial date has been set<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; (3) the exercise of proper judicial discretion, under the terms of <em>R. </em>4:17-7, allows such amendment; (4) the expert is necessary to a complete exposition of plaintiffs\u2019 case, and (5) the trial court can, without prejudicing defendants, set a schedule for the deposition of this doctor and the eventual date of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Amendments to answers to interrogatories are viewed in liberal fashion, even as to experts, and the sanction of exclusion of testimony is to be utilized cautiously. The aim of our system of rules of procedure is to better serve the cause of justice. <em>See </em>the dissent in <em>Gittleman v. Central Jersey Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 179 (App.Div.1967), 52 <em>N.J. </em>503 (1968) (reversing on that dissent). <em>R. </em>1:1 \u2014 2, for this reason, provides that unless otherwise stated, \u201cany rule may be relaxed or dispensed with by the court in which the action is pending if adherence to it would result in an injustice.\u201d The principles applicable to amendment of interrogatory answers appear in <em>Brown v. Mortimer, </em>100 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395 (App.Div.1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">The application of sanctions is consigned to the sound discretion of the court, subject only to the rule that the sanction visited upon the party must be just and reasonable. Our cases recognize three factors which, if disclosed by the circumstances of the particular case, strongly urge the trial court, in the exercise of his discretion, to' suspend the imposition of sanctions, namely, (1) the absence of design to mislead, (2) absence of the element of surprise if the evidence is admitted, and (3) absence of prejudice which would result from the admission of the evidence. <em>Branch v. Emery Transportation Co., </em>53 <em>N.J.Super. </em>367, 375-76 (App.Div.1958). [at 401-402]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>There is no contention here of a design to mislead. Defendants are hardly surprised. They knew of Dr. Frank and his opinions as early as August 18, 1980. After this court on November 26, 1980 construed the trial court\u2019s order of October 14,1980 as only prohibiting Dr. Frank\u2019s use at the panel hearing, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, on December 5,1980, advised defense counsel of his continued intention to use Dr. Frank at trial. Defendants made no reply to this letter. They made no further move to test plaintiffs\u2019 right to use this witness until five months later, although they knew the issue of plaintiffs\u2019 right to so use the witness was an open question, perhaps complicated by the existence of the second, and superfluous, order of October 28, 1980. At the time the issue was presented to the court on June 12, 1981, whatever prejudice might have been occasioned to defendants could readily have been dissipated by the exercise of judicial discretion to permit a reasonable time for discovery prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The imposition of the sanction of excluding the use of Dr. Frank at trial was not, we are obliged to observe, reached by a weighing of the respective rights of the parties or by any consideration of the prejudice perhaps resulting to the parties. Rather, it was based upon the trial judge\u2019s view that the proper application of <em>R. </em>4:21 and the survival of the purposes underlying the rule would be subverted by' permitting the addition of new expert opinion after panel decision. In this we feel the judge erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Defendants here advance much the same view as was used by the trial court and point to statements made in the dissenting opinion filed in <em>Goddard </em>where this writer observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">The action taken today by my colleagues subverts this rule and its purposes. Although it is true that <em>R. </em>4:21--5(e) provides that the panel\u2019s unanimous order, when admitted in evidence at trial, shall not be binding upon the trier of the facts, this provision for admissibility is the only arrow in this rule\u2019s quiver. Realistically, it is only this provision which will assist \u201cin the early disposition of medical malpractice actions\u201d by discouraging baseless actions and encouraging settlement of cases having merit. If the panel proceeding is to be merely a dry run where, when one party loses, he may correct his deficiencies by getting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>new expert (even one \u201cguaranteed\u201d to present the same theories advanced without success to the panel), then the admissibility provision is stripped of its purpose. Clearly, if the unanimous order of the panel is to have the desired result of \u201cdiscouraging baseless actions and encouraging settlement of those actions based on reasonable medical probability,\u201d the case later presented to the jury ought to be the same as that advanced to the panel. <em>Conde v. Brown, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 355 (Law Div.1980). If the rule is to be retained in its present form and if its salutary purposes are to be fulfilled, the order entered below must be affirmed. [177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 326-327; footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Defendants urge that the above reasoning \u201capplies no less to a case in which the panel finding is inadmissible by reason of not being unanimous\u201d and that \u201cin either case the \u2018dry run\u2019 effect occurs, deficiencies are corrected by the introduction of new experts, the case is delayed by the necessity for discovery of the new experts and settlements are thus thwarted, rather than promoted.\u201d Defendants argue that <em>R. </em>4:21 must be accorded general preeminence over the liberal effect of <em>R. </em>4:17-7 because physician defendants will, by reason of natural reluctance to settle, seize upon the \u201csecond chance\u201d to bring in new experts in the many cases where a non-unanimous panel decision exists because defendant physicians have a greater \u201cavailability of expert witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The argument has but facial appeal. The specter raised can be dealt with by the exercise of proper judicial discretion by trial judges. <em>R. </em>4:17-7 permits amendment only where the answers to interrogatories previously served are, by reason of newly acquired material, rendered \u201cincomplete or inaccurate.\u201d Here the information supplied was, as to some defendants, incomplete in the sense that Dr. Frank\u2019s opinion added materially to the issues of their alleged negligence, a fact recognized below and in this court by the protesting defendants. A reading of Dr. Frank\u2019s opinion demonstrates plaintiffs\u2019 need to present it. Our rules are designed to aid in the quest for justice. They should not be used to cut off the search for the truth where, as here, the proffered opinion is necessary to a plaintiff\u2019s (or a defendant\u2019s) case, merely because the expert comes late into the matter. It is for this reason that <em>R. </em>4:17-7 permits amendments even after the period of 20 days prior to the first date fixed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>trial in circumstances that are \u201ccompelling\u201d and \u201cto prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>See Gittleman, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 179. The salutary purposes of <em>R. </em>4:21, which seek to encourage settlement, are better served by a full presentation of facts and honestly held expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We reject defendants\u2019 view that in cases where the panel decision is not unanimous, the \u201cdry run\u201d effect discussed in the <em>Goddard </em>dissenting opinion should be a matter for judicial concern. <em>Goddard </em>was a case of an unanimous panel decision admissible at trial as an evidential factor. The dissenting judge was concerned that in such case the addition of a new expert, even one \u201cguaranteed\u201d not to vary from the theories presented at the panel hearing, was, nonetheless, a new element in the case and because not presented to the panel, a factor a jury might weigh against the value of the panel\u2019s decision. Thus, it was observed that \u201cif the unanimous order of the panel is to have the desired result of \u2018discouraging baseless actions and encouraging settlement of those actions based on reasonable medical probability,\u2019 the case later presented to the jury ought to be the same as that advanced to the panel.\u201d <em>Goddard, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 327. When a panel decision is not unanimous it has no effect on the trial evidence later presented and <em>R. </em>4:21 purposes are not materially involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In the circumstances here presented we do not regard <em>R. </em>4:21 as compelling the exclusion of this obviously necessary witness. We do not, moreover, regard our decision herein as doing material damage to the efficacy of that rule or its intended purposes. When a panel results in a decision which is not unanimous, and thus no one \u201cwins,\u201d its order may, nevertheless, have some effect on the prospect of settlement, but clearly not as much as does an unanimous determination, admissible before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">We wish to make clear that we do not consider the question of whether, in all cases, an unanimous panel decision prevents later amendment asxto experts. The issue is not before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>us. That question will have to await another day and, indeed, may be resolved by the expected decision in <em>Goddard. </em>Nor are we to be construed as granting a <em>carte blanche </em>right to amend in all matters where the panel decision lacks unanimity. Our decision is limited to the view that in circumstances where the panel is not unanimous, and upon a showing of a just right to amend and the need for the new expert, a court should weigh the necessity for the additional witness, consider as well the factors recommended in <em>Brown v. Mortimer, supra, </em>and balance them against what is, perhaps, an amorphous hope that a split panel decision will effect a settlement. The later consideration cannot be a controlling factor where a just need for the witness is shown and the ultimate aim is fairness for all the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Here, on balance, plaintiffs\u2019 demonstrated need requires vacation of the exclusionary order entered below. Therefore, the order appealed is reversed and vacated. This matter is remanded to the trial court to schedule a reasonable time for discovery by defendants and the setting of a trial date shortly thereafter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">R. 4:17-7 provides in pertinent part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by R. 4:17-4(e), if a party who has furnished answers to interrogatories thereafter obtains information which renders such answers incomplete or inaccurate, amended answers shall be served not later than 20 days prior to the first date fixed for trial.\u201d R. 4:17-4(e) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">If an interrogatory requires a copy of the report of an expert witness or a treating physician, the answering party shall annex to the interrogatory an exact copy of the entire report or reports rendered by the expert or treating physician or a complete summary of any oral report. The answering party shall further certify that the existence of other reports of that expert or treating physician, either written or oral, are unknown to him and if such become later known or available, he shall serve them promptly on the propounding party, but in no case later than the time provided by R. 4:17-7. If the answer to an interrogatory requesting the name of the party\u2019s expert or treating physician or a copy of his report indicates that the same will be supplied thereafter, the propounder may, on notice, move for an order of the court fixing a day certain for the furnishing of that information by the answering party. Such order may further provide that an expert or treating physician whose name or report is not so furnished shall not be permitted to testify at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">We observe that although a literal reading of R. 4:17 \u2014 4(e) suggests its application is limited to situations where a party has answered interrogatories indicating that expert names and reports \u201cwould be later supplied,\u201d in practice trial judges and lawyers, particularly in medical malpractice cases, have used the rule to obtain and enter orders limiting a party to a date certain to supply names of experts and their reports even where the original answers to interrogatories have given expert names and reports. The purpose, of course, is to freeze a case insofar as experts are concerned. Utilization of the rule for such purpose was recognized, and suggested as proper, in <em>Goddard, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 325.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Inexplicably, the trial judge, after drafting and signing his own order, signed a second order dated October 28, 1980 at a time when the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to appeal the order of October 14, 1980 was before this court by reason of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to appeal filed on October 17, 1980. The later order, drawn by counsel for the Rosenblatt group, directed that \u201cplaintiffs are barred from amending answers to interrogatories to include as an\u2018additional medical expert, Dr. Edward Frank.\u201d No party brought this order to the attention of this court, nor did anyone seek reconsideration of this court\u2019s order of November 26, 1980. In the circumstances presented, we regard the October 28, 1980 order as superfluous and inoperative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The <em>Conde </em>opinion does not directly state that the panel\u2019s decision was unanimous, thus admissible at trial. It would appear, however, that such was the case because the court noted that defendant therein questioned \u201cthe possible effects of new testimony on the issues decided by the malpractice panel and the validity of the panel\u2019s order at trial wherein different testimony may be heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The views expressed above are paralleled by the dissent in <em>Goddard, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 326-328. We do not, however, have a <em>Goddard </em>issue before us because, as noted earlier in this opinion, unlike <em>Goddard, </em>this case does not involve a unanimous panel determination admissible at trial, and Dr. Franks\u2019 opinion, unlike that of the new expert in <em>Goddard, </em>adds materially to plaintiffs\u2019 case as it asserts malpractice not presented to the panel as to some of these defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The first trial date of September 9, 1980 was apparently set without knowledge that the panel had recessed without date on June 20, 1980. This date can hardly be realistically regarded as the \u201cfirst date fixed for trial\u201d referred to in <em>R. </em>4:17-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
