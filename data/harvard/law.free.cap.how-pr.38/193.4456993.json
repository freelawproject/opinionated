He is compelled to make a motion to vacate it, or submit to it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-9\">If a <em>complaint </em>does not state facts sufficient to show that the plaintiff has such an interest in the controversy, as entitles him to the relief demanded therein, he is not entitled to an <em>injunction.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-10\"><em>Meld, </em>in this case, that the plaintiff has not shown, by his complaint, that he has any standing in conrt, as a creditor or bondholder or stockholder of the Erie Railway Company\u2014the defendants, so that he could have a <em>receiver </em>or <em>referee </em>appointed <em>ex parte </em>in the action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-11\">It is now pretty well settled, that a <em>receiver </em>of a railroad corporation, cannot be properly appointed in an action brought by a stockholder or a creditor <em>who has no judgment.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-12\">Also, that the <em>directors </em>of the corporation, acting in good faith, have power to issue convertible bonds in the name of the corporation for the amounts they may borrow to complete and finish, or to operate the road, with the right to authorize their conversion into stock; although it increases the amount of capital stock beyond that fixed by the charter. Consequently the right of the directors to <em>issue stock in conversion of such bonds, </em>is clear.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-13\">Ho authority is conferred by the statutes (3 22. <em>8., </em>5 <em>ed., </em>762, \u00a7\u00a7 40-43; 2 <em>id. </em>ls\u00bf <em>ed., </em>462, $ 33, \u00a7 36) upon a stockholder of a corporation, to maintain an action for the removal or suspension of a <em>director.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-14\">Ho officer of a corporation should be suspended from exercising his office, except upon <em>clear and positive proof .</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-15\">The power of a court of equity to issue <em>preliminary injunctions </em>ought to be exercised with extreme caution, and applied only in very clear cases.
