A reference- was thereupon ordered to compute the defendant\u2019s damages. The plaintiff had notice of, and opposed, the application; and also appeared on the reference, but filed no exceptions to the report. A motion for a \u201cfinal adjudication,\u201d and for a confirmation of the report, was made, which was granted, and an order made, June 23, 1868, \u201c that the plaintiff was not and had not been entitled to said injunction; that the defendant\u2019s damages caused thereby amounted to $2,060, and that he was entitled to recover the same from the plaintiff and his sureties.\u201d This order was served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, July 1, 1868, and personal notice given him, October 3, 1868, but no appeal was ever taken therefrom. A suit was subsequently commenced against the sureties. The defendant now moves on affidavits showing the above facts, and that service of a certified copy of this order had been made on the plaintiff, and a demand made by a person having written authority from the defendant, for an order that the plaintiff pay or be punished as for a contempt-.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Geobge W.

Having had full notice of that order and of all prior proceedings, his failure to appeal made it conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-7\">H. The method of correcting error is by appeal, not by disobedience, <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Sturtevant, </em>5 <em>Seld., </em>266.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-8\">Second.-^-The order was regular.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-9\">I. The discontinuance by the plaintiff, involved the concession that the injunction could not be maintained, and that the plaintiff* was not entitled to it. <em>(Pacific M. S. S. Co. </em>agt. <em>Leuling, </em>7 <em>Abb., N. S., </em>37, 40 ; <em>Taaks </em>agt. <em>Schmidt, </em>19 <em>How., </em>414; <em>Crockett </em>agt. <em>Smith, </em>14 <em>Abb., </em>62; <em>Mutual Safety Ins. Co. agt. Roberts, </em>4 <em>Sandf.

The fact of the plaintiff\u2019s not having signed the undertaking was immaterial, <em>(a) </em>It is not the practice for a plaintiff to sign undertakings on injunction, <em>(Askin </em>agt. <em>Hearns, </em>3 <em>Abb., </em>188; <em>Leffingwell agt. Chave, </em>10 <em>Id., </em>475, 476; <em>Rep., of Mexico </em>agt. <em>Arrangois, </em>5 <em>Duer., </em>640.) (6) The reference is provided by the Code, irrespective of the terms of the undertaking, <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 222.) <em>(c) </em>The plaintiff is liable as a wrong doer in any event, and a bond having been given <em>\u201con his </em>part\u201d <em>(Code </em>\u00a7 222,) prescribing a particular method of computing the damages, he cannot object thereto. <em>(Askin agt. Hearns, </em>3 <em>Abb., </em>188.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-12\">HI. The direction to pay was proper, although as <em>against the sureties </em>a new action should perhaps be brought, yet the liability of the <em>plaintiff </em>having been fully adjudicated, no further proceedings were necessary or should be required. The Code contemplates that these damages should be fixed and paid in a summary proceeding in the original action; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>making a distinction between these and other cases of damages on undertakings. <em>(Compare </em>$ <em>222 </em>with \u00a7 182, 207, <em>2'30, </em>234, <em>Code.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\"><em>Third, </em>The court has jurisdiction to enforce the order by proceeding for contempt.
