The lease contained covenants on the part of the tenants to pay the rent. The premises were occupied by the partners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-9\">During the term, Myers, Canfield &amp; Son dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">The Canfields sold out their interest in the partnership property and effects to Myers, and Myers entered into an agreement with the Canfields to pay and discharge the partnership debts and obligations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">At the time of making this agreement, the defendant, Fatman, jointly with Myers, executed a bond to the Can-fields, (the retiring partners,) in the penal sum of fifty-thousand dollars, with a condition that if the said Myers should well and truly assume and pay all the debts and liabilities of the said firm of Myers, Canfield &amp; Son, and save harmless the Canfields from and against the same, the obligation was to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-12\">The complaint alleges that after the making of the bond, rent for the premises fell due to the plaintiffs, to the amount of $3,375.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>That subsequent to the making of the bond, Myers died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">The action is brought on this bond by the plaintiffs, the landlord, against the defendant, Fatman, as the surviving obligor thereof, for the rent due and unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">The defendant demurred to the complaint, and alleged as ground of demurrer that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-7\">Charles H.
