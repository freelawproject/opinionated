We hold that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(b) (2008), the statute governing copyright infringement suits against the federal government, does not authorize his suit. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims that dismissed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b893-17\">The basic facts are undisputed. While an inmate at the United States Prison Leavenworth, the Appellant Robert James Walton was assigned to work for Federal Prison Industries Inc., a government-owned corporation that produces various products for the federal government. Prisoners assigned to that work were given compensation ranging from $0.23 to $1.15 per hour and various other benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-18\">While thus working and using government-furnished computers, Walton developed and produced desk-blotter calendars for the years 2000 and 2001-2002. Federal Prison Industries made a substantial number of those calendars, which it distributed to General Services Administr\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>tion warehouses throughout the country. It also sold the calendars to private purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">In 2001 Walton, acting pro se, filed a district court suit against the United States for damages for copyright infringement. The suit ultimately was transferred to the Court of Federal Claims. The government moved to dismiss because under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a), Walton could not maintain a suit for copyright infringement until he had registered his copyright. Walton obtained counsel and, after he registered his copyright with the copyright office, in 2005 filed an amended complaint setting forth the registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In a thirty-four-page opinion, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed Walton\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The court held that the suit could not be maintained because the statutory provisions governing copyright infringement suits against the United States (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(b), discussed in Part II <em>infra), </em>do not permit such suits by prisoners in Walton\u2019s situation. The court further held that because Congress had not waived the government\u2019s sovereign immunity from such suits, it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Walton\u2019s complaint, which it therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">A. Section 1498(b) of Title 28 of the U.S.Code provides that the \u201cexclusive action\u201d for infringement by the United States or its specified affiliates (including a government corporation) of \u201cthe copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States\u201d shall be a suit in the Court of Federal Claims \u201cfor the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation as damages for such infringement.\u201d This jurisdictional grant is immediately followed by this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\"><em>Provided, hoivever, </em>That this subsection shall not confer a right of action on any copyright owner ... with respect to any copyrighted work prepared by a person while in the employment or service of the United States, where the copyrighted work was prepared as a part of the official functions of the employee, or in the preparation of which Government time, material, or facilities were used[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">In other words, a copyright infringement suit cannot be maintained against the United States, if the copyrighted work was prepared (1) while in the \u201cemployment or service\u201d of the United States and (2)(a) as part of the official functions of the employee or (b) in whose preparation government \u201ctime, material[s], or facilities\u201d were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">It is not disputed that in the preparation of Walton\u2019s calendar, \u201cGovernment time, material, or facilities\u201d were used. He worked on the calendar on government-furnished computers as part of his assigned duties at a government facility. The critical issue therefore is whether Walton\u2019s preparation of the calendar was done while he was in the \u201cemployment or service\u201d of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">His argument that this statutory bar on copyright infringement suits against the United States does not cover his case is as follows: it is well settled that prisoners are not \u201cemployees\u201d of the United States. In \u00a7 1498(b), Congress used the terms \u201cemployment\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d interchangeably, and they mean the same thing. Accordingly, if Walton\u2019s work was not performed in the \u201cemployment\u201d of the United States, it also was not performed in the United States\u2019 \u201cservice\u201d and the statutory prohibition in the proviso of \u00a7 1498(b) does not apply to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>Under other statutes involving other issues, federal prisoners have been held not to be \u201cemployees.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Coupar v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>105 F.3d 1263, 1265 (9th Cir.1997) (finding a prisoner not an \u201cemployee\u201d under Clean Air Act and Toxic Substance Control Act); <em>Nicastro v. Reno, </em>84 F.3d 1446, 1446-47 (D.C.Cir.1996) (determining a prisoner working for Federal Prison Industries Inc. was not an \u201cemployee\u201d entitled to minimum wages under Fan1 Labor Standards Act). It does not automatically or necessarily follow, however, that prisoners are not \u201cemployees\u201d under \u00a7 1498(b) for purposes of suing the United States for copyright infringement. We need not decide that question, however, since we agree with the Court of Federal Claims that while preparing his copyrighted calendar, Walton was in the \u201cservice\u201d of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">When Congress uses different parallel words in the alternative in the same statutory provision, it is reasonable to assume that the words have different meanings. Cf. <em>Bowers v. N.Y. &amp; Albany Lighterage Co., </em>273 U.S. 346, 349-50, 47 S.Ct. 389, 71 L.Ed. 676 (1927). In that case, the Court considered a statute barring any \u201csuit or proceeding\u201d to collect taxes more than five years after the tax return date. <em>Id. </em>at 349, 47 S.Ct. 389. The Court rejected petitioner\u2019s contention that \u201cthe word \u2018proceeding\u2019 refers only to a proceeding in court and means the same as \u2018suit,\u2019 and that the act prescribes no limitation against the collection of such taxes by distraint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the \u201cthe meaning of \u2018proceeding\u2019 as used in the clause of limitation in section 250(d), Revenue Act of 1921, cannot be restricted to steps taken in a suit; it includes as well steps taken for the collection of taxes by distraint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 47 S.Ct. 389; <em>See also FCC v. Pacifica Found., </em>438 U.S. 726, 739-40, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (holding \u201cindecent\u201d not the same as \u201cobscene\u201d in statutory disjunctive phrase \u201cobscene, indecent, or profane.\u201d). As the Supreme Court has stated, it is \u201ca cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must \u2018give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 404, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (internal citation omitted) (quoting <em>Montclair v. Ramsdell, </em>107 U.S. 147, 152, 2 S.Ct. 391, 27 L.Ed. 431 (1883)). Walton\u2019s interpretation of the provision would in effect eliminate the statutory term \u201cservice\u201d from the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Section 1498(b) is a detailed, carefully drafted, complex provision in which Congress carefully and explicitly set forth the precise standards governing private suits against the United States for copyright infringement. This provision\u2014and the parallel provision governing patent infringement suits against the United States, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a), which also contains the \u201cemployment or service\u201d language\u2014 has been frequently reenacted with changes in language other than \u201cemployment or service.\u201d It is most unlikely that if Congress had intended \u201cservice\u201d to mean the same thing as \u201cemployment,\u201d it would have continued for many years to use the two different and separate terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">To the contrary, we conclude that Congress intended the two terms to have different, although related, meanings. One may have a \u201cservice\u201d relationship with the federal government that does not constitute an \u201cemployment\u201d relationship. Without attempting to define the precise limits of \u201cservice,\u201d we conclude it covered Walton\u2019s relationship with Federal Prison Industries Inc. while working for it on the federal calendar as a federal prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>Working for someone and under his direction may constitute being in that person\u2019s \u201cservice\u201d even though the relationship does not amount to the typical common-law master-servant relationship that the term \u201cemployment\u201d ordinarily describes. Walton\u2019s preparation of the calendar was done \u201cwhile in the service of the United States.\u201d He developed and made the calendar at the direction of and with computers provided by the United States, and was supervised by United States employees in that work. He performed the work at a government facility, and the government paid him modest compensation for his efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Walton points to the clause of the proviso requiring that the work was performed \u201cas a part of the official functions of the employee,\u201d whereas the immediately following \u201cGovernment time, material, or facilities\u201d clause contains no such limitation. He argues that there is no convincing reason why Congress would have limited the reach of only the first clause, but not the latter, to work performed as an employee. Whatever may be the merits of this argument, they are insufficient to outweigh the considerations leading to our contrary conclusion that we have set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">That is also the situation with respect to Walton\u2019s argument that the legislative history of \u00a7 1498(b) supports his interpretation of the statute. There is nothing in that history that explicitly addresses whether \u201cemployment\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d have the same meaning. What Walton relies on are statements in the committee reports that use the words \u201cin the employment of the United States\u201d as a shorthand reference to the statutory term \u201cin the employment or service\u201d of the United States. Once again, this is too thin a reed to support Walton\u2019s attempt to read the word \u201cservice\u201d out of the statute. Indeed, the phrase \u201cemployment or service\u201d first appeared in 1910 in the predecessor to \u00a7 1498(a), the provision governing patent infringement suits against the United States. An Act to Provide Additional Protection for Owners of Patents of the United States, Pub.L. No. 61-305, 36 Stat. 851-52 (1910). This was long before the 1939 and 1940 committee reports upon which Walton relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">B. Upon concluding that Walton\u2019s work was done while \u201cin the service of the United States,\u201d the Court of Federal Claims held that this clause of the proviso was a limitation on the government\u2019s waiver of its sovereign immunity for suits against it, and that the court therefore lacked jurisdiction over Walton\u2019s claim. It accordingly dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Subsequent to that decision, this court in <em>Blueport Co., LLC v. United States, </em>533 F.3d 1374 (Fed.Cir.2008), held that \u201c[t]he text and structure of \u00a7 1498(b) demonstrate that the three provisos to the waiver of sovereign immunity are jurisdictional limitations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1380. \u201cIt follows that because \u2018the terms of [the Government\u2019s] consent to be sued in any court define that court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the suit,\u2019 the CFC lacks jurisdiction over any copyright infringement claim within the scope of the \u00a7 1498(b) provisos.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1381 (internal citation omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 399, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976)). Accordingly, the Court of Federal Claims correctly dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">The judgment of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing the complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
