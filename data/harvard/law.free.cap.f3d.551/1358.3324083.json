Keener, William P. Smith, and Anne D. Smith (collectively, \u201cTaxpayers\u201d) brought suit against Defendant-Appellee the United States (\u201cthe Government\u201d) in the United States Court of Federal Claims seeking refunds of federal income taxes and interest paid in connection with their investments in various partnerships. The Government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, asserting that I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(h) foreclosed the court from exercising jurisdiction over Taxpayers\u2019 partnership-level challenges in this partner-level suit. The Court of Federal Claims agreed and dismissed Taxpayers\u2019 claims for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Keener v. United States, </em>76 Fed.Cl. 455 (2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">Taxpayers invested in partnerships that were part of a larger organization called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>AMCOR.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the early-to mid-1980s, \u201cAMCOR was in the business of promoting tax shelter partnerships.\u201d <em>Crop Assocs.-1986 v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>80 T.C.M. (CCH) 56, 59 (2000). In 1984 and 1985, the Taxpayers\u2019 partnerships reported ordinary loss deductions, which were apportioned among their partners. As a result, on their income tax returns for 1984 and 1985, Keener and Smith reported their shares of the losses and used those losses to offset their taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">After examining the returns of these partnerships, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) issued a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment (\u201cFPAA\u201d) to each partnership in 1991. These FPAAs disallowed the ordinary loss deductions reported by each partnership in 1984 and 1985 and, as a result, reduced those deductions to zero. The FPAAs each stated that the deductions were \u201cnot allowable for the following reasons,\u201d which included, \u201cThe partnership\u2019s activities constitute a series of sham transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In response, certain partners filed petitions in the Tax Court for readjustment of partnership items pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6226. Among other challenges, these petitions claimed that the period for assessing tax attributable to the adjusted partnership items had expired prior to issuance of the FPAAs and that the IRS had erred in determining that the partnerships\u2019 activities constituted a series of sham transactions. In order to end their involvement in these suits,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Taxpayers offered to settle with the IRS by executing Forms 870-P(AD) (\u201cSettlement Agreements\u201d), and the IRS accepted these settlements. In the Settlement Agreements, Taxpayers were permitted to report a fraction of the previously disallowed losses, and, in return, Taxpayers agreed that \u201cno claim for refund or credit based on any change in the treatment of partnership items may be filed or prosecuted.\u201d The Settlement Agreements made no mention of the \u201csham transaction\u201d determination in the FPAA, but did specify that the settlements \u201cmay result in an additional tax liability to [Taxpayers] plus interest as provided by law.\u201d Thereafter, the IRS assessed additional tax and interest, including penalty interest pursuant to \u00a7 6621(c), which Taxpayers paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Mr. Keener then filed administrative refund claims with the IRS in December 1999, and the Smiths filed administrative refund claims in March 2002. The IRS denied their claims, and Mr. Keener and the Smiths filed separate refund suits in the Court of Federal Claims, which were later consolidated. <em>Keener, </em>76 Fed.Cl. at 457. After consolidation, the Government filed partial motions to dismiss, arguing that the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(h). <em>Id. </em>The court granted the Government\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>tion, <em>id. </em>at 470, and, after the parties stipulated to a dismissal of the remaining issues with prejudice, entered final judgment. Taxpayers appealed to this court, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">\u201cThe Court of Federal Claims\u2019 decision to grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is a matter of law, which this court reviews <em>de novo.\u201d Mudge v. United States, </em>308 F.3d 1220, 1224 (Fed.Cir.2002). As the party seeking the exercise of jurisdiction, Taxpayers have the burden of establishing that jurisdiction exists. <em>Rocovich v. United States, </em>933 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed.Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">At the Court of Federal Claims, Taxpayers argued that they were entitled to refunds on two separate grounds. First, Taxpayers claimed that they were due refunds of tax and interest on the theory that the IRS assessed the tax and interest after the statute of limitations in I.R.C. \u00a7 6229(a) expired. Second, and alternatively, Taxpayers claimed that they were due refunds of penalty interest\u2014paid pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6621(c)\u2014because their underpayments of tax were not attributable to \u201ctax motivated transactions.\u201d The Government filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(h) deprives the Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction over both of these claims, and the Court of Federal claims agreed, concluding that \u00a7 7422(h) precluded jurisdiction because the Taxpayers\u2019 claims for refunds are \u201cattributable to partnership items.\u201d <em>Keener, </em>76 Fed.Cl. at 460, 469-70. After providing a brief overview of the relevant law, we evaluate the dismissal of each of Taxpayers\u2019 claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">A. Overview of TEFRA</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">As partnerships are pass-through entities that do not themselves pay tax, all income, deductions, and credits are allocated to the individual partners. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-702; <em>Conway v. United States, </em>326 F.3d 1268, 1271 (Fed.Cir.2003). Partnerships are required to file annual information returns reporting the partners\u2019 distributive shares of income, gain, deductions or credits, I.R.C. \u00a7 6031, and the individual partners then report their distributive shares on their federal income tax returns, I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-704.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">In 1982, Congress enacted the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (\u201cTEFRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 97-248, 96 Stat. 324. \u201cTEFRA created a single unified procedure for determining the tax treatment of all partnership items at the partnership level, rather than separately at the partner level.\u201d <em>In re Crowell, </em>305 F.3d 474, 478 (6th Cir.2002); <em>see AD Global Fund, LLC ex rel. North Hills Holding, Inc. v. United States, </em>481 F.3d 1351, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2007) (TEFRA is \u201ca statutory scheme that intends that adjustment to a partnership tax return be completed in one consistent proceeding before individual partners are assessed for partnership items.\u201d). Accordingly, whether a tax item is a \u201cpartnership item\u201d governs how the TEFRA procedures apply. Significantly for this appeal, the code defines the terms \u201cpartnership item,\u201d \u201cnonpartnership item,\u201d and \u201caffected item\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-12\">(3) Partnership item.\u2014The term \u201cpartnership item\u201d means, with respect to a partnership, any item required to be taken into account for the partnership\u2019s taxable year under any provision of subtitle A to the extent regulations prescribed by the Secretary provide that, for purposes of this subtitle, such item is more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>(4) Nonpartnership item.\u2014The term \u201cnonpartnership item\u201d means an item which is (or is treated as) not a partnership item.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-4\">(5) Affected item.\u2014The term \u201caffected item\u201d means any item to the extent such item is affected by a partnership item.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">I.R.C. \u00a7 6231(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">B. Statute of Limitations Claim\u2014 I.R.C. \u00a7 6229(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Taxpayers first argue that the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over them refund claims that allege that the IRS assessed tax and interest after the statute of limitations in I.R.C. \u00a7 6229(a) had expired. The Government argues that the Court of Federal Claims correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Taxpayers\u2019 limitations claim because that claim is a challenge to a partnership item and TEFRA specifies that \u201c[n]o action may be brought for a refund attributable to partnership items\u201d (with exceptions not applicable here). I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(h). In response, Taxpayers assert that this jurisdictional bar does not apply to their limitations claim because it is not a \u201cpartnership item.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">As this dispute turns on the meaning of the term \u201cpartnership item,\u201d we look first to its statutory definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-9\">The term \u201cpartnership item\u201d means, with respect to a partnership, <em>any item required to be taken into account for the 'partnership\u2019s taxable year under any provision of subtitle A </em>to the extent regulations prescribed by the Secretary provide that, for purposes of this subtitle, such item is more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-10\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 6231(a)(3) (emphasis added). The relevant Treasury regulation further defines a \u201cpartnership item\u201d to include \u201cthe <em>legal and factual determinations </em>that underlie the determination of the amount, timing, and characterization of items of income, credit, gain, loss, deduction, etc.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6231(a)(3)-l(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">The Government argues that the limitations claim is a \u201cpartnership item\u201d within the terms of the regulation because the statute of limitations \u201cunderlie[s] the determination of the amount, timing, and characterization of items of income, credit gain, loss, deduction, etc.\u201d <em>See Weiner v. United States, </em>389 F.3d 152, 157 (5th Cir. 2004) (\u201c[T]he treasury regulations have implicitly included the statute of limitations determination within the definition of \u2018partnership item.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Slovacek v. United States, </em>36 Fed.Cl. 250, 255 (1996) (suggesting that the limitations claim \u201cmight be said to affect the amount, timing, and characterization of income, etc., (partnership items) at the partnership level, if only in a thumbs-up or thumbs-down manner\u201d). Taxpayers do not dispute that this regulation includes their limitations claim in its definition of \u201cpartnership item.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Rather, Taxpayers argue that the regulation should not be given deference because the regulation\u2019s inclusion of the limitations claim in its definition of \u201cpartnership item\u201d contradicts the plain language of the statute. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (stating that a regulation adopting a \u201cpermissible construction\u201d of a statute is due deference \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue\u201d). Taxpayers assert that the statute defines the term \u201cpartnership item\u201d to include <em>only </em>(1) items found in subtitle A that (2) must be tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>en into account for the partnership\u2019s taxable year and (8) are designated as \u201cmore appropriately determined at the partnership level.\u201d While stipulating that their limitations claim satisfies the latter two requirements, Taxpayers argue that the claim cannot be a \u201cpartnership item\u201d because it fails to satisfy the first requirement. In other words, Taxpayers contend that because the provisions relevant to this claim\u2014namely, \u00a7\u00a7 6229(a) and 6501\u2014are found in subtitle F of the code, rather than subtitle A, the claim cannot be considered a partnership item by definition. Because the statute is allegedly clear in this regard, Taxpayers argue that the Treasury regulation is invalid to the extent it defines \u201cpartnership item\u201d to include any item outside subtitle A.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The ambiguity in the statutory definition, however, is illustrated by <em>Prati v. United States, </em>81 Fed.Cl. 422 (2008), where the court adopted a different understanding of the statute\u2019s definition of \u201cpartnership item.\u201d Under that court\u2019s reading, the statute\u2019s phrase \u201cunder any provision of subtitle A\u201d modifies not \u201cany [partnership] item\u201d (as Taxpayers argue), but what immediately precedes it (i.e., \u201cthe partnership\u2019s taxable year\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 430-31 <em>(iciting </em>William Strunk Jr. &amp; E.B. White, <em>The Elements of Style </em>4-5, 59 (4th ed.1999) (identifying rule of grammar that a restrictive clause limits or defines what immediately precedes it and is not set-off by a comma)). The court noted that this understanding \u201cmakes eminent sense because while subtitle A encompasses substantive rules for a partner\u2019s income tax, subtitle A\u2019s provisions make clear that this income is derived from the partnership during the partnership\u2019s taxable year, as defined by this subtitle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431. Under this reading, a \u201cpartnership item\u201d would be anything that affects\u2014or, in other words, is \u201crequired to be taken into account for\u201d\u2014the partnership\u2019s taxable year. <em>Id. (quoting </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6231(a)(3) (emphasis omitted)). That court\u2019s understanding \u201cpermits treating, as partnership items, any and all legal issues that influence the treatment of partnership items arising under subtitle A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432. Also, under this reading a \u201cpartnership item\u201d could include items outside subtitle A.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Because we are presented with these different interpretations, we hold that the statute does not unambiguously answer the question of whether a provision outside of subtitle A can be a \u201cpartnership item.\u201d <em>See GHS Health Maint. Org., Inc. v. United, States, </em>536 F.3d 1293, 1297 (Fed. Cir.2008) (\u201cIdentifying \u2018the precise question at issue\u2019 is a necessary prerequisite to determining whether or not Congress has directly spoken on it.\u201d). In light of this ambiguity, we conclude that the Government\u2019s interpretation of the statute is, at a minimum, a reasonable one. Since the statute is ambiguous with respect to this issue, we give deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. As noted above, Taxpayers do not dispute that the regulation\u2019s definition of \u201cpartnership item\u201d includes them limitations claim. Thus, the Court of Federal Claims correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the limitations claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">We note, moreover, that the interpretation of the statutory language outlined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number><em>Prati </em>is more reasonable and appropriate given the structure established by TEFRA. As noted above, TEFRA is \u201ca statutory scheme that intends that adjustment to a partnership tax return be completed in one consistent proceeding before individual partners are assessed for partnership items.\u201d <em>AD Global Fund, </em>481 F.3d at 1355. To remain consistent with this structure, the limitations claim raised by Taxpayers should not be litigated in a partner-level proceeding because it affects the partnership as a whole. <em>Weiner, </em>389 F.3d at 156-57. Moreover, to allow a taxpayer to raise this argument in a partner-level proceeding \u201cwould undermine TEFRA\u2019s dual goals of centralizing the treatment of partnership items and ensuring the equal treatment of partners.\u201d <em>Chimblo, </em>177 F.3d at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">In addition, Taxpayers\u2019 proffered interpretation of the statutory definition\u2014 which categorically excludes anything in subtitles B-J from the definition of \u201cpartnership item\u201d\u2014makes little sense given the framework established by TEFRA. Subtitle F of the Code, titled \u201cProcedure and Administration,\u201d includes subchapter C, which is titled \u201cTax Treatment of <em>Partnership </em>Items.\u201d (Emphasis added). This subchapter includes rules relating to the treatment of partnership items (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 6221, 6229, and 6231), and, if we were to adopt Taxpayers\u2019 definition of \u201cpartnership item,\u201d these procedures for dealing with partnership items would not, themselves, be partnership items. The result would be that a partnership-level proceeding would not adjudicate these issues, instead leaving them to a plurality of potentially inconsistent partner-level proceedings. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6221 (\u201c[T]he tax treatment of any partnership item shall be determined at the partnership level.\u201d). Like other courts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we reject this impractical result. <em>See River City Ranches </em># <em>1 Ltd. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>401 F.3d 1136, 1144 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cA partnership\u2019s tax items ... are litigated in partnership proceedings\u2014not in the individual partners\u2019 cases.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">C. Penalty Interest Claim\u2014 I.R.C. \u00a7 6621(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Second, Taxpayers requested refunds of penalty interest paid pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6621(c). Section 6621(c), which was in effect for the years at issue,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> imposed an interest rate of 120% of the statutory rate on \u201cany substantial underpayment attributable to tax motivated transactions.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6621(c)(1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>[T]he term \u201csubstantial underpayment attributable to tax motivated transactions\u201d means any underpayment of taxes imposed by subtitle A ... which is attributable to 1 or more tax motivated transactions if the amount of the underpayment ... exceeds $1,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 6621(c)(2). The statute defines a \u201ctax motivated transaction\u201d to include \u201cany sham or fraudulent transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 6621(c)(3)(A)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">In this case, the FPAAs issued by the IRS disallowed the ordinary loss deductions reported by the partnerships and explained that these deductions were \u201cnot allowable\u201d for several reasons, including a determination that \u201c[t]he partnership\u2019s activities constituted a series of sham transactions.\u201d After partner-level suits followed these FPAAs, Taxpayers chose to settle with the IRS. The Settlement Agreements made no mention of the \u201csham transaction\u201d determinations in the FPAAs and stated \u25a0 that the settlements \u201cmay result in an additional tax liability to [Taxpayers] plus interest as provided by law.\u201d The IRS later assessed additional tax and interest, including penalty interest pursuant to \u00a7 6621(c), which Taxpayers paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Now arguing that they are entitled to a refund, Taxpayers assert that their underpayments of taxes were not attributable to \u201ctax motivated transactions\u201d and, thus, that the IRS improperly imposed penalty interest under this section. The Government responds that the Court of Federal Claims correctly concluded that it lacks jurisdiction over this claim for a refund because it is \u201cattributable to partnership items.\u201d <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(h). Noting that Taxpayers\u2019 arguments are focused on determining whether or not the partnerships\u2019 transactions were \u201ctax motivated,\u201d the Government argues that\u2014because the nature of the partnerships\u2019 transactions is a partnership item\u2014Taxpayers\u2019 claims are based on the determination of a partnership item. Thus, the Government concludes, Taxpayers\u2019 claims are \u201cquintessential claims for a refund \u2018attributable to partnership items\u2019\u201d and are barred by \u00a7 7422(h). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">As noted above, \u00a7 7422(h) provides that \u201c[n]o action may be brought for a refund <em>attributable to </em>partnership items ... except as provided in section 6228(b) or section 6230(c).\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(h) (emphasis added). \u201cThe phrase \u2018attributable to,\u2019 ... is not defined anywhere in the Code and has no special technical meaning under the tax laws. Courts in various tax cases have construed the phrase according to its plain meaning, which is understood to be \u2018due to, caused by, or generated by.\u2019 \u201d <em>Electrolux Holdings, Inc. v. United States, </em>491 F.3d 1327, 1330-31 (Fed.Cir.2007) (internal citations omitted) (addressing meaning of the phrase in \u00a7 6511(d)(2)(A)). Thus, the applicability of \u00a7 7422(h) turns on whether Taxpayers\u2019 refund claims are \u201cdue to, caused by, or generated by\u201d a partnership item.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">As the Government correctly notes, Taxpayers\u2019 refund claims are based on the assertion that the partnerships\u2019 transactions were not shams. This characterization of a partnership\u2019s transaction is a partnership item:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it bears directly on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>validity of the deductions claimed by the partnership; it affects the tax treatment of other partnership item entries; and it can even dictate whether certain income tax concepts are applicable. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6221 (\u201c[T]he tax treatment of any partnership item shall be determined at the partnership level.\u201d); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6231(a)(3)-1(b) (defining \u201cpartnership item\u201d to include \u201cthe legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination of the amount, timing, and characterization of items of income, credit gain, loss, deduction, etc.\u201d); <em>River City Ranches, </em>401 F.3d at 1143-44 (\u201cThe nature of the partnerships\u2019 transactions is ... \u2018required to be taken into account ... under ... [the income tax provisions of] subtitle A.\u2019 \u201d (alterations in original) <em>(quoting </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6231(a)(3))). Moreover, the nature of a partnership\u2019s transaction affects all partners and is not dependent on facts unique to a particular partner. <em>Cf. Prochorenko v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2001) (finding jurisdiction when issue was \u201centirely dependent on [the taxpayers\u2019] own unique factual circumstances\u201d). Thus, the nature of a partnership\u2019s transaction\u2014and, specifically, whether a partnership transaction is a \u201csham\u201d\u2014is a partnership item.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">Accordingly, because Taxpayers are requesting a refund based on the nature of the partnerships\u2019 transactions and because the nature of a partnership\u2019s transaction is a partnership item, Taxpayers\u2019 claims are \u201cattributable to\u201d partnership items. <em>Cf. id. </em>(finding that refund was not \u201cattributable to partnership items\u201d where it was \u201cbased on\u201d a nonpartnership item). Accordingly, the Court of Federal Claims correctly determined that it lacks jurisdiction over Taxpayers\u2019 claim \u201cfor a refund attributable to partnership items.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">In an attempt to avoid this result, Taxpayers recharacterize their claims as <em>general </em>claims for a refund of \u00a7 6621(c) penalty interest\u2014which, they assert, is an affected item and not a partnership item\u2014and argue that \u00a7 7422(h) does not bar refund claims for affected items. Taxpayers explain that an affected item\u2014defined by statute as \u201cany item to the extent such item is affected by a partnership item,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6231(a)(5)\u2014 includes both a partnership-level component (requiring partnership-level determinations) and a partner-level component (requiring partner-level determinations). Thus, by challenging the penalty interest \u201cas a whole,\u201d Taxpayers contend that they can avoid the statute\u2019s jurisdictional bar. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">First, even assuming that penalty interest under \u00a7 6221(c) is an affected item, Taxpayers only challenge a partnership-level component of this affected item (namely, the nature of the partnerships\u2019 transactions), without advancing any argument regarding partner-level components (e.g., a partner\u2019s underpayment must exceed $1,000 in order to be \u201csubstantial\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, Taxpayers\u2019 argument relies on the mistaken premise that \u00a7 7422(h) only bars claims for a refund of partnership items. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>The statute, however, bars refund claims <em>attributable to </em>partnership items. Because the two terms are not coextensive, our inquiry must focus on the language in the statute. <em>See Prochorenko, </em>243 F.3d at 1363 (\u201cWhile it is true that the Prochorenkos were seeking a refund of partnership taxes, their refund was not \u2018attributable to partnership items.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Taxpayers also obliquely suggest that this case is tantamount to the potential situation where the IRS imposes penalty interest when <em>no </em>partnership-level determination has been made that the transactions were tax motivated. Quite simply, this is not that case. Each relevant FPAA disallowed the partnership\u2019s deductions because \u201c[t]he partnership\u2019s activities constitute[d] a series of sham transactions.\u201d Taxpayers concede that the FPAAs are conclusive, as this finding was not altered by the Settlement Agreements. And the statute is clear that a \u201csham or fraudulent transaction\u201d is a \u201ctax motivated transaction.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6621(c)(3)(A)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">More specifically, Taxpayers\u2019 argument appears to be that the relevant FPAAs fail to establish that Taxpayers\u2019 underpayments were attributable to \u201ctax motivated transactions\u201d because the FPAAs list multiple, independent grounds for the disallowance\u2014some of which qualify as \u201ctax motivated transactions\u201d and others which do not\u2014making it impossible to determine whether Taxpayers\u2019 underpayments were \u201cattributable to\u201d the tax motivated grounds. Even assuming that the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over this argument, we would not be persuaded. <em>See Irom v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>866 F.2d 545, 547-48 (2d Cir.1989) (finding that taxpayer should pay penalty interest for portion of deficiency attributable to a tax motivated transaction even though that deficiency may also be attributable to other factors). The inequitable result of Taxpayers\u2019 contention would be to impose penalty interest when a deduction is disallowed because the partnerships\u2019 transactions were tax motivated, but <em>not </em>to impose penalty interest when that deduction is also disallowable on other inseparable grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">In sum, we conclude that Taxpayers\u2019 claims for a refund are barred by I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(h) because they are based on the nature of the partnerships\u2019 transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">The Court of Federal Claims correctly determined that, under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(h), it lacked jurisdiction over: (1) Taxpayers\u2019 claims for refunds of tax and interest on the theory that the IRS assessed tax and interest after the statute of limitations in I.R.C. \u00a7 6229(a) expired; and (2) Taxpayers\u2019 claims for refunds of penalty interest, I.R.C. \u00a7 6621(c), on the grounds that their underpayments of tax were not attributable to \u201ctax motivated transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-6\">.

Ultimately, on July 19, 2001, the Tax Court issued stipulated decisions in the partnership-level proceedings.
