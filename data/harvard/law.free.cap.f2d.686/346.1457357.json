RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b417-25\">Milton Prater seeks a writ of habeas corpus, contending that he was denied equal protection of the law and due process because the state supreme court, in affirming his conviction of a state offense, held that one of his assignments of error had merit, but limited the operation of the new rule to future cases. He contends also that the trial prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct, the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, and the judge\u2019s alleged failure to exercise discretion in sentencing violated his constitutional rights. Finding no denial of due process or equal protection, and no merit in the other claims, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-27\">Prater was convicted in a Louisiana court of distributing heroin. The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, recognizing the validity of one of his claims of error but announcing a new rule to be applied \u201cpurely prospectively.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State v. Prater, </em>337 So.2d 1107 (La.1976). The trial court denied his subsequent state habeas petition, and the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed without opinion. <em>State ex rel. Prater v. Blackburn, </em>380 So.2d 1373 (La.1980). He then resorted to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The trial judge refused to instruct the jury about, or permit Prater\u2019s lawyer to mention in closing argument that, on conviction, Louisiana law mandated a life sentence. In affirming his conviction on direct appeal, <em>State v. Prater, </em>337 So.2d 1107 (La.1976), the Louisiana Supreme Court held that juries should in the future be informed if a sentence is mandatory. Prater contends that its refusal to apply the rule to him denied him equal protection of the law as well as due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The majority opinion in <em>Prater </em>held that the trial judge was correct in refusing to permit the jury to be informed of the sentence. One of the members of the majority, however, filed a special concurrence stating that he voted to affirm the conviction because the trial judge properly relied on prior Louisiana authority; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> however, he agreed that jurors should henceforth be informed of any penalty that would be mandatory if the jury convicted the defendant. He concluded that <em>\u201cBlackwell </em>may be regarded as overruled prospectively by the present opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1110 (Tate, J., concurring).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In <em>Great Northern Railway Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>287 U.S. 358, 53 S.Ct. 145, 77 L.Ed. 360 (1932), the Court rejected an argument similar to Prater\u2019s. The Montana Supreme Court had overruled its decision in <em>Doney v. Northern Pacific Railway Co., </em>60 Mont. 209, 199 P. 432 (1921). In overruling <em>Doney, </em>the Montana court held that the decision would nevertheless be applied to those litigants who, \u201cduring the period of its reign, had acted on the faith of it.\u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>287 U.S. at 361, 53 S.Ct. at 147, 77 L.Ed. at 364. The Court held that the Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">[H]as no voice upon the subject. A state in defining the limits of adherence to precedent may make a choice for itself between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backward. It may say that decisions of its highest court, though later overruled, are the law none the less for intermediate transactions .... The choice for any state may be determined by the juristic philosophy of the judges of her courts, their conceptions of law, its origin and nature. We review, not the wisdom of their philosophies, but the legality of their acts. . . . If this is the common-law doctrine of adherence to precedent as understood and enforced by the courts of [the state], we are not at liberty, for anything contained in the Constitution of the United States, to thrust upon those courts a different conception either of the binding force of precedent or of the meaning of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 364-66, 53 S.Ct. at 148-49, 77 L.Ed. at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\"><em>Sunburst\u2019s </em>reasoning applies to Prater\u2019s due process claim. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has given a ruling \u201cpurely prospective\u201d application in at least one case involving criminal law. <em>James v. United States, </em>366 U.S. 213, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961). <em>See Wainwright v. Stone, </em>414 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 190, 38 L.Ed.2d 179 (1973) (per curiam); <em>cf. England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, </em>375 U.S. 411, 422, 84 S.Ct. 461, 468, 11 L.Ed.2d 440, 449 (1964) (decision not applied to parties before court although their mistaken view of the law \u201cwill not avail other litigants who rely on it after today\u2019s decision\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">Moving to the equal protection aspect of Prater\u2019s claim, Prater neither claims to be, nor is, a member of a suspect class. Therefore, the state need demonstrate only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>its decision is rationally related to a legitimate state interest in order to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"> Justice Tate\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>State v. Prater </em>rests on courts\u2019 and litigants\u2019 reliance on <em>Blackwell </em>and refuses to upset justified expectations. Courts may rationally decline to give a decision retrospective effect when to do so would be unjust because, for example, of reliance on prior law. <em>See, e.g., Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 628, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1737, 14 L.Ed.2d 601, 607 (1965). We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s decision to apply the <em>Prater </em>holding \u201cpurely prospectively\u201d was rationally related to the state interest in stability and fairness in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Prater claims that the prosecutor\u2019s reference in closing argument to the \u201cunrebutted\u201d testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses directed the jury\u2019s attention to Prater\u2019s failure to testify, violating the fifth amendment\u2019s prohibition against self-incrimination as interpreted in <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, he contends that the judge\u2019s instruction on negating the provisions of the law improperly assigned him the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that there was no objection to the prosecutor\u2019s comments or to the court\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Prater has, therefore, waived these contentions. <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977); <em>Huffman v. Wainwright, </em>651 P.2d 347, 349 (5th Cir. 1981) (per curiam).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">Prater next argues that the state trial judge\u2019s denial of his motion for resentencing violates the due process clause because he is entitled to an appropriate exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion under the doctrine of <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>447 U.S. 343, 100 S.Ct. 2227, 65 L.Ed.2d 175 (1980). In <em>Hicks, </em>the jury convicted the defendant and, as Oklahoma procedure dictated, sentenced him, assessing a mandatory penalty of forty years in jail. The Oklahoma appellate courts then declared the mandatory forty-year sentence unconstitutional while Hicks\u2019 case was pending on direct appeal. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals declined to order Hicks resentenced, however, reasoning that the forty-year sentence was within the range of lawful punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">The Supreme Court reversed the decision and remanded for resentencing, holding that the Oklahoma courts had deprived Hicks of liberty without due process of law. The Court rejected the argument that the defendant\u2019s interest in the exercise of sentencing discretion is a matter of state procedural law, stating that the defendant in such a case \u201chas a substantial and legitimate expectation that he will be deprived of his liberty only to the extent determined by the jury in the exercise of its statutory discretion, and that liberty interest is one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>that the fourteenth amendment preserves against arbitrary deprivation by the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 100 S.Ct. at 2229, 65 L.Ed.2d at 180 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Prater was sentenced to life imprisonment under the command of La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 40:966 (1973) (amended 1977, 1981) (West 1974 &amp; Supp.1982). At the time he was sentenced, the trial judge could condemn a convicted defendant to prison, in which case life imprisonment was mandatory, or could suspend the sentence or place the defendant on probation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Prater claims that the judge failed to exercise appropriate discretion in sentencing him to prison. While the sentencing hearing is not transcribed, the judge\u2019s order entered when he denied resentencing indicates that he was aware of the option to suspend Prater\u2019s sentence or place him on probation, and declined to exercise it. <em>State v. Prater, </em>No. 246-089 (La.Crim. Dist.Ct. Orleans Parish, Oct. 3, 1979) (judgment denying resentencing). There was no error in denying habeas corpus relief on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court dismissing the habeas petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-18\">. \u201cA ruling which is purely prospective does not even apply to the parties before the court.\u201d <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 621-22, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1733, 14 L.Ed.2d 601, 603-04 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\">. <em>State v. Blackwell, </em>298 So.2d 798 (La.1974), holding that the trial judge has discretion whether to instruct the jury about the penalty on conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\">. Three justices and Justice Tate combined to form the majority voting for affirmance. Three justices dissented: Justice Calogero filed a dissenting opinion arguing that the judge should have informed the jury of the penalty, and Justices Dixon and Dennis dissented without opinion. <em>State v. Prater, </em>337 So.2d 1110 (La.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b418-16\">. <em>See also National Ass\u2019n of Broadcasters v. FCC, </em>554 F.2d 1118, 1130-31 &amp; n.32 (D.C.Cir.1976) (collecting cases involving the <em>Sunburst </em>doctrine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">. In <em>Jennings v. United States, </em>527 F.2d 862, 871 (5th Cir. 1976), we held that a prosecutor may point out that a witness\u2019s testimony is uncontradicted. This is because someone other than the defendant or the defendant\u2019s witnesses could <em>contradict </em>a state witness\u2019s testimony. Prater argues that no one but the defendant or a defense witness could <em>rebut </em>prosecution testimony. Thus, he claims, the remark infringed on his constitutional right not to present evidence and not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Because we resolve this contention on another ground, we need not decide the question. However, we note that the argument differs from the style we approved in <em>Jennings.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b419-15\">. Louisiana\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule is codified at La.Code Crim.Pro.Ann. art. 841 (West Supp.1982). Prater made no showing of \u201ccause\u201d for the failure to object or of \u201cactual prejudice\u201d therefrom. Such a showing is required to set aside the waiver under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes. See Washington v. Estelle, </em>648 F.2d 276, 278 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 899, 102 S.Ct. 402, 70 L.Ed.2d 216 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b419-16\">. We note that the instruction placed the burden of proving an affirmative defense on the defendant. <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979), does not hold this to be a constitutional violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\">. In <em>Hicks, </em>the jury both decided innocence or guilt and imposed sentence on the defendant. The rule of the case is not, however, limited to imposition of sentences by <em>juries. </em>In this case, the judge \u2014 not the jury \u2014 was vested with statutory discretion in sentencing. The defendant had a legitimate expectation that he would be deprived of liberty only after an appropriate exercise of that discretion. <em>See Hicks, </em>447 U.S. at 346, 100 S.Ct. at 2229, 65 L.Ed.2d at 180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b420-22\"> . The statute was amended in 1977 to remove the court\u2019s discretion to suspend the sentence or place the defendant on probation. <em>See </em>La. Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 40:966 (West 1977). The 1981 amendment added sections not relevant here. <em>See id. </em>(West Supp.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
