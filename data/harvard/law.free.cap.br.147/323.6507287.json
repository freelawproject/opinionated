On November 4, 1992, I denied appellant\u2019s application for a stay of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Bankruptcy Court order pending this appeal. I now affirm the Bankruptcy Court order.</p><p id=\"b386-4\">II</p><p id=\"b386-5\">Preliminarily, appellees argue that this appeal is moot because the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order has already been implemented by closing the transfer. They urge that under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(m), absent a stay, which was never granted in this case, reversal or modification of the assignment order on appeal would not affect the validity of the assignment. While \u00a7 363(m) does not bar remedies other than invalidation of the assignment in the event an order permitting an assignment were to be reversed, rapidly moving commercial transactions can readily be derailed by lawsuits threatening subsequent remedies. This has led courts to require application for preliminary relief, in lieu of suit for post-event damages or reversal of the transaction, where the objecting party has notice, and where a preliminary application is feasible. See generally <em>Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, </em>430 U.S. 1, 42, 97 S.Ct. 926, 949, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977), quoting <em>Electronic Specialty Co. v. International Controls, </em>409 F.2d 937, 947 (2d Cir.1969).</p><p id=\"b386-6\">If, of course, a transaction were found to have been rushed through so quickly that prior relief would have been impracticable, the <em>Piper </em>principle as applied in bankruptcy cases might be inapplicable because pri- or relief would not have been feasible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus restriction of remedies may or may not, depending on the circumstances, lead to the conclusion that no appropriate remedy is available.</p><p id=\"b386-7\">These issues, however, need not be pursued in the present case, since I affirm the decision of Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg on the merits for the reasons outlined below.</p><p id=\"b386-10\">III</p><p id=\"b386-11\">Appellant New Plan seeks reversal of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order on the grohnd that Schottenstein\u2019s presence would disrupt the customer or tenant mix at the center, thus contravening the use clause in the lease in a manner making it reasonable under that clause and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(f)(1) for the landlord to reject the assignment.</p><p id=\"b386-12\">New Plan\u2019s attorney, however, signed a proposed consent order submitted to the Bankruptcy Court on September 10, 1992, set forth as Ex.C to Schottenstein\u2019s objections to the stay application (Dkt. No. 115, filed Oct. 28, 1992), consenting to the assignment challenged on this appeal. While this proposed consent order was not signed by the Bankruptcy Judge and is thus not independently binding as a court order, New Plan\u2019s agreement to its provisions is probably contractually binding, and may also be relevant as an admission by an adverse party pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2). The only explanation given by New Plan for its change of position is discovery of an Ohio state court ruling under state law which went against Schot-tenstein involving an assertedly similar assignment involving another landlord. <em>Schottenstein Stores v. South Towne Centre, Ltd., </em>85-1437 (Ct. of Common Pleas, Montgomery County Feb. 23, 1988), Ex. A to New Plan\u2019s application for a stay. Lack of prior knowledge of this marginal enhancement of New Plan\u2019s legal position involving a non-bankruptcy assignment would hardly have led New Plan to agree voluntarily to a disposition significantly harmful to its interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p><p id=\"b386-13\">New Plan\u2019s consent to the assignment it now challenges would, absent significant rebutting evidence credited by the Bankruptcy Judge or so overwhelming that failure to credit it would have been clearly erroneous, justify holding New Plan to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>agreement. While New Plan claims that its experts predict disaster if Schottenstein occupies the space involved, no affidavits from other tenants or other reliable evidence have been cited to indicate that New Plan\u2019s September consent was ill advised or based on mistake.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p><p id=\"b387-4\">In view of the convincing reasons to believe that the claimed injury to New Plan which might justify overturning the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order does not exist, and the deference due the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s ruling, that ruling cannot properly be disturbed.</p><p id=\"b387-5\">SO ORDERED.</p><p label=\"1\">\n</p><p id=\"b386-8\">. See generally, e.g., <em>In re Slocum, 922 </em>F.2d <em>1081 </em>(3d Cir.1990).</p><p label=\"2\">\n</p><p id=\"b386-9\">. I raised the question at the hearing on the motion for a stay whether Schottenstein's failure to bring this case to the attention of the Bankruptcy Court might have violated Fed. R.Civ.P. 11. Since this event occurred before the Bankruptcy Court, which did not impose or recommend sanctions, I conclude that it is not necessary to pursue this question further. As indicated at the hearing, the failure appears traceable solely to Schottenstein and not to its counsel.</p><p label=\"3\">\n</p><p id=\"b387-17\">. It is unclear to what extent, if any, the discount nature of the projected Schottenstein store is a reason for New Plan's objection to its presence in the shopping center. Because other circumstances in this case call for affirmance of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order, any potential public policy implications, were the court asked to enforce a ban on discounting, need not be considered. See generally Note, 104 Harv.L.Rev. 548 (1990).</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
