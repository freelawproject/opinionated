Regrettably, that is why the California Reports contain an ever growing number of cases devoted to sanctions. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">Here is .yet another contribution to the sanctions proliferation. Where sanctions are awarded pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court must state in writing its reasons for the order. <em>(Fegles </em>v. <em>Kraft </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 812, 816-817 [214 Cal.Rptr. 380].) Here we hold that where sanctions are awarded against a party as a condition of relieving him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>a judgment or order under section 473, the court must also provide that party with a written statement of reasons for the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Cross-defendant George R. Hearst, Jr., appeals the $600 attorneys\u2019 fees awarded to cross-complainants George and Kathy Ferrante. We remand to permit the trial court to state reasons justifying the sanctions, or alternatively, to vacate the award. (\u00a7 128.5; <em>Fegles </em>v. <em>Kraft, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d 812, 816-817; \u00a7473; <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 654 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179].)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The Ferrantes, sued by Hearst for breach of contract, filed a cross-complaint against Hearst for false imprisonment and infliction of emotional distress. The Ferrantes\u2019 attorney contended that he personally served this cross-complaint upon Marilyn O\u2019Toole, an attorney representing Hearst. He also served the cross-complaint upon her by mail that same day. O\u2019Toole declared that she did not receive the cross-complaint either by personal service or through the mail. She was aware that the Ferrantes had filed a cross-complaint, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Several weeks later, O\u2019Toole wrote the Ferrantes\u2019 attorney and requested a copy of the cross-complaint. In response, the attorney mailed another copy of the cross-complaint. O\u2019Toole declared she did not receive this copy either.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Having received no answer to the cross-complaint, the Ferrantes obtained a default judgment after proper notice to Hearst. Hearst then petitioned the court to set aside the default judgment because his attorneys believed the cross-complaint had not been served. O\u2019Toole declared that she knew a cross-complaint had been filed with the court because the Ferrantes\u2019 attorney had so informed her. When she did not receive a copy of the cross-complaint in response to her letter, she purchased a copy from the clerk of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">The trial judge set aside the default but stated that Hearst could have resolved the service controversy by voluntarily answering the cross-complaint. The trial judge decided that both parties were blameworthy but that Hearst should pay $600 in attorneys\u2019 fees to the Ferrantes.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">On appeal Hearst argues that 1) the trial judge failed to specify reasons justifying the award of sanctions and 2) the award of sanctions was an abuse of discretion. Our conclusion concerning Hearst\u2019s first argument makes it unnecessary to discuss his second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The order awarding the attorneys\u2019 fees to the Ferrantes stated that \u201c[t]he court awards sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $600.00.\u201d  The trial judge specified neither the reasons for the sanctions nor the statute permitting the award. We decide here that whether the trial judge acted under section 128.5 or section 473, due process requires a statement of reasons justifying sanctions. <em>(In re Marriage of Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal. 3d 637, 654; <em>Fegles </em>v. <em>Kraft, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d 812, 816-817.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Section 128.5 permits the trial court to impose reasonable expenses incurred by a party as a result of his adversary\u2019s frivolous or delaying tactics.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The award of expenses must be written and specify the reasons for the award: \u201cAn order imposing expenses shall be in writing and shall recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.\u201d (\u00a7 128.5, fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em> An order bereft of this statement of reasons cannot stand. <em>(Fegles </em>v. <em>Kraft, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d 812, 816-817.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Section 473 permits the trial court to relieve a party from a judgment or order against him under specified conditions and \u201cupon such terms as may be just.\u201d Courts have long construed this phrase to allow payment of costs or attorneys\u2019 fees to the adverse party to compensate him for any losses or expenses suffered by the section 473 motion. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Myer </em>(1907) 150 Cal. 714, 719 [89 P. 972]; <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Snap-Tite, Inc. </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 208, 213 [100 Cal.Rptr. 51].)  Although section 473 empowers the trial court to award attorneys\u2019 fees occasioned by the resisting party, due process requires that the court provide the party with a written statement of reasons for the award when the fees are imposed as \u201csanctions.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 637, 654.) This requirement of written reasons affords a safeguard against an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion and permits appellate review of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Accordingly, we remand to enable the trial court to make findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>or to vacate its award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the Ferrantes. Each party to bear his own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Stone, P.

Frivolous actions or delaying tactics include, but are not limited to, making or opposing motions without good faith. This section also applies to judicial arbitration proceedings under Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 1141.10) of Title 3 of Part 3. [11] (b) Expenses pursuant to this section shall not be imposed except on notice contained in a party\u2019s moving or responding papers; or the court\u2019s own motion, after notice and opportunity to be heard. An order imposing expenses shall be in writing and shall recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">In 1985 the section was amended to define bad faith and frivolous actions or tactics.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
