After hearing evidence, the trial court ruled that the antenuptial agreement was unenforceable and made certain findings in support of that ruling. Thereafter, petitioner, the proponent of the antenuptial agreement, filed his notice of appeal of that ruling. No orders were made relative to division of community property nor was any judgment entered on any issue in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-12\">We do not reach the merits of petitioner\u2019s appeal because this court is without jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. Nonetheless, we discuss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1638\">*1638</page-number>appealability issue for several reasons: first, although respondent vigorously opposes petitioner\u2019s contentions on appeal, respondent does not raise the issue of this court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction; second, interim rulings on bifurcated issues are a frequent occurrence in the family law trial arena; and finally, the only published family law case which arrived on the appellate scene in a like procedural posture was decided on its substantive merits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">Petitioner contends that the trial court erred in what he characterizes at times as a \u201cruling,\u201d at other times as an \u201corder\u201d and at other times as a \u201cjudgment. \u201d  Although the law relating to appealability speaks in terms of orders or judgments, we recognize that it is not the label but rather the substance and effect of a court\u2019s judgment or order which determines whether or not it is appealable. <em>(Ezer </em>v. <em>Fuchsloch </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 849, 856 [160 Cal.Rptr. 486, 13 A.L.R.4th 1333].)  We view the trial court\u2019s conduct in this case as being in the nature of an interim ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">The right to appeal in California is wholly governed by statute and appellate courts have no jurisdiction to entertain appeals except as provided by the Legislature. <em>(Jasper Constr., Inc. </em>v. <em>University Casework Systems, Inc. </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 582, 585 [114 Cal.Rptr. 143].) As stated in 9 Witkin, California Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, section 38, page 61, \u201cSince an appealable judgment or order is essential to appellate <em>jurisdiction, </em>the parties cannot by any form of consent make a nonappealable order appealable. The court must of its own motion dismiss an appeal from such an order. [Citations.]\u201d (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">The primary statutory basis for appeal is found in Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1. A thorough review of the provisions of this section, other statutes dealing with appealability, and case law discloses no legislation which creates appellate jurisdiction over a mere ruling on a bifurcated issue. Yet, it has been stated that <em>In re Marriage ofNoghrey, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.3d 326 stands for the proposition that \u201c[w]hen there is bifurcation in a family law case of a threshold issue, an appeal lies immediately.\u201d (Cal. Family Law Service (1986) Termination of Marital Relationship: Review, \u00a7 35:51, p. 74.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">Although the <em>Noghrey </em>court decided on its merits an appeal of the trial court\u2019s interim ruling on a bifurcated issue, it appears that that court was aware of the problem regarding appealability but disposed of it in the following manner: \u201cThis matter was transferred from the First Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1639\">*1639</page-number>District to this court upon order of our Supreme Court____Considering the length of time this matter has been pending and the manifest importance of the decision to the remaining issues in the case, we do not now question its appealability.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 329, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">We view the <em>Noghrey </em>decision as an act in excess of jurisdiction. We hold that this court is without jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the trial court\u2019s interim ruling on a bifurcated issue as sought in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">Even though this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, this court does have the power to treat the purported appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.  However, an appellate court will exercise this jurisdiction only in unusual circumstances. <em>(Olson </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 390, 401 [197 Cal.Rptr. 843, 673 P.2d 720].) We find no unusual circumstances associated with this purported appeal. Therefore, we decline to treat this matter as a petition for writ of mandate, and we note that the issues raised herein can be raised on appeal from judgment in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">Kaufman, Acting P. J., and McDaniel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1273-13\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1274-8\"><em>In re Marriage ofNoghrey </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 326 [215 Cal.Rptr. 153],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1274-9\">The appeal in <em>Noghrey </em>was from an interim ruling by the trial court on a bifurcated issue. That issue was the same as the substantive issue in this appeal, the enforceability of a premarital agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
