J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZb\">\u2014In this dependency proceeding, the issue on appeal is whether the time limit prescribed by section 366.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code for the filing of a report by the probation or other officer for status review hearings is jurisdictional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">At the six-month status review hearing herein, the trial court dismissed the dependency proceedings of Charles and Shannon B. on the sole ground the Children\u2019s Protective Services (petitioner herein) failed to submit and serve the report in question within the specified time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Petitioner\u2019s subsequent motion to set aside this order was denied and petitioner appeals from these rulings. We conclude the time limitations are directory, not mandatory, and therefore not jurisdictional. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Procedural Backgound<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">On June 21, 1985, the court convened for a six-month status review hearing. The social worker\u2019s report had recommended the minors be placed in their mother\u2019s custody. Petitioner advised the court that one day earlier, on June 20, the minors\u2019 mother informed the social worker that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>leaving the area and was unable to take the children. Petitioner requested a two-week continuance to devise an alternative plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The minors\u2019 father (respondent) objected to a continuance. He contended the provisions of section 366.2, subdivision (c), requiring petitioner to file its report with the court at least 16 days before the hearing and to provide a copy of the report to the minors\u2019 parents at least 14 days before the hearing, were mandatory. Asserting that neither of these requirements had been met,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> respondent\u2019s counsel, without any prior notice to the court or parties, moved to dismiss the dependency proceedings on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Petitioner requested an order shortening the time for serving respondent with the report, which would permit the review hearing to be held within six months of the dispositional hearing as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">The court dismissed the proceedings stating, \u201cThe Court doesn\u2019t feel if Child Protective Services makes a mistake or doesn\u2019t comply with the code section, that inasmuch as the Court would like to do what is in the best interest of the child, the Court doesn\u2019t think that it can use its powers to alleviate a mistake made by one party to a lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">In denying petitioner\u2019s subsequent motion for relief from the order of dismissal, the court noted, \u201cI know that you are aware of the fact that the Court didn\u2019t want to dismiss these matters and did so on what it considered a procedural technicality.\u201d The court then stated it was denying petitioner\u2019s motion \u201cwith great reluctance because I don\u2019t think justice is served and <em>[sic] </em>the interest of these minors going on the Court\u2019s previous matter and by the court order today[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">We find merit in petitioner\u2019s contention the court erred in dismissing the dependency proceedings and in refusing to grant a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">According to the directives of section 366.2, subdivision (c), the probation officer (1) \u201cshall file\u201d a supplemental progress report with the court at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>16 days before the status review hearing, and (2) \u201cshall provide\u201d the parents with a copy of the report at least 14 days before the hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Respondent contends this mandatory language is jurisdictional in nature, compelling dismissal in the event of a failure to comply. He errs.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Respondent has erroneously assumed that all statutory duties prefaced by \u201cshall\u201d are mandatory and the consequences of failure to perform are therefore dismissal or similar drastic remedies. The language of section 366.2, subdivision (c) that the probation officer \u201cshall file\u201d and \u201cshall provide\u201d is obligatory and not permissive. (See \u00a7 15.) The filing of a progress report is required and not a matter left to petitioner\u2019s discretion.  But this appeal centers on an entirely separate issue, i.e., the consequences for failing to comply with this requirement, and this in turn depends on whether the requirement is directory or mandatory. The Supreme Court explained this distinction this way: \u201c \u2018... the \u201cdirectory\u201d or \u201cmandatory\u201d designation does not refer to whether a particular statutory requirement is \u201cpermissive\u201d or \u201cobligatory,\u201d but instead simply denotes whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will or will not have the effect of invalidating the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 901, 908 [136 Cal.Rptr. 251, 559 P.2d 606], fn. omitted.) If the failure to comply with a particular procedural step does not invalidate the action ultimately taken, as determined by applying certain tests ..., the procedural requirement is referred to as \u2018directory.\u2019 If, on the other hand, it is concluded that noncompliance does invalidate subsequent action, the requirement is deemed \u2018mandatory.\u2019 <em>{Id., </em>at p. 909.)\u201d <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Steele </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 406, 409-410 [158 Cal.Rptr. 662, 599 P.2d 1365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Courts have generally held time requirements to be directory rather than mandatory or jurisdictional, absent a clearly expressed contrary intent. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 410; <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Bd. of Education </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 807, 811 [177 Cal.Rptr. 29].)  \u201c\u2018In order to determine whether a particular statutory provision ... is mandatory or directory, the court, as in all cases of statutory construction and interpretation, must ascertain the legislative intent. In the absence of express language, the intent must be gathered from the terms of the statute construed as a whole, from the nature and character of the act to be done, and from the consequences which would follow the doing or failure to do the particular act at the required time. [Citation.] When the object is to subserve some public purpose, the provision may be held directory or mandatory as will best accomplish that purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>[citation]____\u201d <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 901 at p. 910 [136 Cal.Rptr. 251, 559 P.2d 606], quoting <em>Pulcifer </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 258, 262 [175 P.2d 1]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Callegri </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 856, 866-867 [202 Cal.Rptr. 109].)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Under these guidelines, we conclude the Legislature did not intend section 366.2, subdivision (c) to be mandatory in the jurisdictional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">The statute does not provide a penalty or consequence for noncompliance, nor is there any suggestion the Legislature intended to strip the court of jurisdiction in the event of a delay by the probation officer. (See <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Steele, supra, 25 </em>Cal. 3d at p. 410.) Other pertinent statutes indicate precisely the opposite. Section 352 authorizes the court to continue any hearing beyond specified time limits as long as the continuance is not contrary to the interests of the minor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See also Cal. Rules of Court, rules 1376(b) and 1378(e), allowing a 48-hour continuance at the request of the minor, parent or guardian if the progress report has not been timely furnished.) Section 202 sets forth the purposes of the Juvenile Court Law and emphasizes the need to act in the minors\u2019 best interests.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A dismissal based solely on the late filing of a progress report, without regard for the best interests of the minors, defeats the purposes behind dependency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">In the instant case, the trial court dismissed the dependency petitions for what it termed a \u201cprocedural technicality,\u201d even though it did not believe this decision served the interests of justice. While we do not condone peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>tioner\u2019s failure to comply with section 366.2, subdivision (c), the court\u2019s decision placed undue weight on a matter of procedure rather than substance. (Cf. <em>In re Cindy E. </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 393, 403-405 [147 Cal.Rptr. 812].) The dismissal was erroneous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Finally, we note petitioner was well within its rights in requesting a continuance to file a new probation report. Section 352 authorizes a continuance if the delay is not contrary to the interests of the minor. In stating the minors\u2019 interests were not served by dismissing the dependency petition, the court impliedly found a continuance would be proper if the court possessed the authority to grant the requested relief. A reasonable continuance was virtually compelled herein as the minors\u2019 mother notified the probation officer of the plan\u2019s unsuitability only the day before the hearing. Were a continuance not permitted under these circumstances, parents could manipulate the proceedings to obtain dismissals of dependency petitions merely by refusing at the last minute to cooperate with the recommended plan and then challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction to act by urging the statutory time limits were not met. Such a result is antithetical to the entire juvenile law system and cannot be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">The order of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Sparks, J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-11\">A11 further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.

The probation oficer shall provide the parent or parents with a copy of the report, including his or her recommendation for disposition, at least 14 days before the hearing. In the case of a minor removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, the probation oEcer shall provide a summary of his or her recommendation for disposition to the foster parents, community care facility, or home-finding agency having the physical custody of the minor at least 14 days before the hearing. This subdivision does not apply to the minor if he or she has been removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian because of severe physical abuse pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) of Section 361, and the court has found pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 366 that attempts at reunification with his or her parent or guardian would be detrimental.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b961-14\">The record on appeal consists oEy of the clerk\u2019s and reporter\u2019s transcripts from the two hearings at issue in this appeal.

(b)(5)) and the court has found attempts at reunification would be detrimental. (See \u00a7 366, subd. (c).)

In considering the minor\u2019s interests, the court shall give substantial weight to a minor\u2019s need for prompt resolution of his or her custody status, the need to provide children with stable environments, and the damage to a minor of prolonged temporary placements.

When the minor is removed from his or her own family, it is the purpose of this chapter to secure for the minor custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his or her parents.
