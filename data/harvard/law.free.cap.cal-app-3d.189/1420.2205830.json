Hart appeals, contending the trial court erred in concluding his first cause of action, for sexual harassment, was not cognizable under Government Code section 12940. We disagree, and therefore affirm that portion of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Hart also contends the court below erroneously concluded National is not potentially liable to him for negligence or punitive damages. We agree with Hart and reverse that portion of the judgment. Although not addressed by the trial court, we decide here an issue contested by both parties\u2014whether workers\u2019 compensation provides the exclusive remedy for Hart\u2019s causes of action for assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-10\">The facts recited here are deciphered from partial deposition transcripts attached to both parties\u2019 papers re National\u2019s motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication of issues. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>In August 1981, 59-year-old Hart, Jean Campbell and Debbie Adams were all supervisors of equal rank in National\u2019s customer service department. Hart and Campbell shared an office. Hart claimed during the ensuing year Campbell made unwelcomed and unsavory remarks and physical gestures towards him, which he complained about to Campbell and Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">In September 1982, Campbell and Adams were promoted to comanagers of the department (with equal authority), making them Hart\u2019s superiors. Campbell moved out of Hart\u2019s office. Thereafter, Hart said Campbell became bolder in his physical and verbal interaction with him. During the ensuing nine months, Campbell would grab Hart\u2019s genitals, grab Hart around the waist and try to mount him and make sexually suggestive gestures, accompanied by crude remarks. He claims Campbell would also scratch his own genitals. At times, some of these acts were done in the presence of other employees, some of whom were female. On each occasion, Hart would yell and/or \u201celbow\u201d Campbell and demand he desist, but he did not. Hart even threatened Campbell with a sexual harassment suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Hart felt Campbell was a pervert and was singling him out for this treatment. He did not believe, however, that Campbell was doing this because he was interested in having sex with Hart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">Hart said in the fall of 1982, he complained to Debbie Adams about Campbell\u2019s behavior.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Adams replied the problem would have to be solved within the department and she would take care of it. Hart spoke to Adams sometime thereafter and asked her if she had conveyed his complaint to Mary Drury, assistant to National\u2019s president and director of Hart\u2019s department. Adams said, \u201cNo,\u201d that Drury was \u201cbusy.\u201d Hart told Adams to \u201c[g]et her unbusy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">In February 1983, Adams and Campbell showed Hart a plastic ice cube tray replica of a man\u2019s penis. In late April, after another \u201cmounting\u201d incident with Campbell, Hart again complained to Adams and demanded a meeting with Mary Drury. However, Drury was busy and the meeting never took place. A week later, Hart told Adams \u201c[Campbell] has really done it to me ... with his ... horsing around____\u201d He resigned, at his doctor\u2019s urging, because of a nervous condition he claims was caused by Campbell\u2019s behavior. Later that day, during a phone conversation with Mary Drury, he told her about Campbell\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">Campbell denied doing any of the things Hart alleges except for occasion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>ally scratching himself in an unoffensive way. He denied Hart or anyone else had ever complained to him about his behavior. He and Debbie Adams admitted showing Hart the ice cube tray, but they claimed Hart had asked to see it and laughed when they showed it to him. Both Mary Drury and Debbie Adams denied seeing or being told about any of the acts Hart alleges Campbell did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">Hart\u2019s suit names National, its president Gary Berger, Mary Drury, Debbie Adams and Campbell as defendants. Hart alleges the latter four were \u201cagents, servants and employees of... National..., and in doing the things ... [alleged] were acting in the course and scope of their authority as such</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">55</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Eventually, by stipulation, Gary Berger, Mary Drury, and Debbie Adams were dismissed from the suit, leaving only National and Campbell as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">Hart alleges Campbell (and on one occasion, Adams) sexually harassed him during the relevant period by doing the above described things, all of which he reported to Adams and eventually to Drury on the day he resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">In his first cause of action, he alleges Campbell\u2019s acts caused him humiliation and stress and created an offensive and hostile working environment, all of which eventually forced him to resign. He claims this constitutes an unfair employment practice under Government Code section 12940, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">In his second cause of action, Hart alleges National was negligent in retaining Campbell after Hart reported the harassment to Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-10\">Hart\u2019s third cause of action, for assault and battery, states Campbell \u201ccame at [Hart] in a threatening manner grabbfed] him around the waist, ... jumped on [his] back ... [and] pinch[ed] plaintiff on the buttocks\u201d which caused Hart to suffer \u201cmedical and emotional distress.\u201d He incorporates by reference his allegation he reported these acts to Adams, and, eventually to Drury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-11\">In his fourth cause of action, Hart alleges Campbell\u2019s acts were outrageous, intentional and malicious and were \u201cdone for the purpose of causing [him] humiliation, mental anguish and emotional and physical distress.\u201d He further alleges, \u201cAdams and Drury condoning this conduct was done with knowledge that [he] had objected and... would suffer further emotional and physical distress and was done with a wanton and reckless disregard of the consequences to [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>As to both the third and fourth causes of action, Hart alleges, in addition to general damages and work disability that he is entitled to punitive damages, because \u201c[t]he ... acts of... Campbell were willful, wanton, malicious and oppressive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">In granting National\u2019s motion for summary judgment, etc., the trial court focused on two issues raised by the parties and ignored others. The court held Campbell\u2019s conduct was \u201cbelow and beyond the employment duties and work responsibilities,\u201d which consequently absolved National of any liability. Moreover, the court said Hart failed to allege that National either had \u201cadvanced [sz'c] knowledge and constant disregard\u201d of Campbell\u2019s acts or \u201cauthorized or ratified\u201d them, as \u201crequired by C[ivil] C[ode] \u00a7 3294(b) for an award of punitive damages against an employer.\u201d As to the first cause of action under Government Code section 12940, the court found that section did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">Government Code Section 12940</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">Government Code section 12940, as here pertinent, prohibits an employer from discriminating against his employee in the \u201cterms, conditions or privileges of employment... <em>because of sex [ ] </em>[II] [or] harassing him]... <em>because of sex.\u201d </em>Hart does not here allege, nor do the depositions show, that Campbell harassed Hart because of Hart\u2019s sex. Absent this, section 12940 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">National\u2019s Liability for Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">National argues the facts do not show it was negligent in rehiring Campbell in 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Be that as it may, Hart alleges in his second cause of action that National \u201cnegligently] <em>retained </em>Campbell... after it had been reported to Adams that... Campbell... was [harassing him].\u201d If knowledge of the harassment and failure to act by Adams, or anyone above her, can be imputed to National, Hart has stated a cause of action in negligence. The matter involves questions of fact which cannot be decided here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">The same holds true for National\u2019s vicarious liability on the third and fourth causes of action. Despite the trial court\u2019s ruling, whether Campbell, Adams or Drury acted within the scope of their employment, thus making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>National liable, is a question of fact <em>(Coats </em>v. <em>Construction &amp; Gen. Laborers Local No. 185 </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 908, 913 [93 Cal.Rptr. 639]; 29 Cal.Jur.3d, Employer and Employee, \u00a7 92, pp. 706-707, \u00a7 116, p. 771) which must be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Workers\u2019 Compensation as the Exclusive Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">National claims workers\u2019 compensation is the exclusive remedy available to Hart for the assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress causes of action.  Labor Code sections 3600 and 3601 make workers\u2019 compensation the exclusive remedy except in a few narrowly drawn circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite this seemingly clear prohibition, case law construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>the sections has greatly expanded the exceptions to the exclusivity rule, by employing a number of different factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Until recently, one such factor present in intentional infliction of emotional distress cases has unfortunately received more attention than it should have. The factor focuses on whether the employee suffered physical injuries, including work disability or mental harm, i.e., anguish, humiliation and embarrassment. If physical injuries occurred, the courts have held workers\u2019 compensation was available. Thus, resort to an action at law was unnecessary and the exclusivity doctine applied. <em>(Hollywood Refrigeration Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 754 [210 Cal.Rptr. 619];* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>McGee </em>v. <em>McNally </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 891 [174 Cal.Rptr. 253]; <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Trans Video Corp. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 196 [155 Cal.Rptr. 486]; <em>Ankeny </em>v. <em>Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 531 [155 Cal.Rptr. 828].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the injuries were emotional, it was recognized that workers\u2019 compensation provided no remedy. In order to provide some type of compensation to the injured employee, the courts created an exception to the exclusivity doctrine. <em>(Renteria </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 833 [147 Cal.Rptr. 447].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>The problems with this approach are twofold. First, \u201c[i]ntentional infliction of emotional distress which results in physical injury and disability is ordinarily more reprehensible than intentional infliction of emotional distress which does not result in disability, [yet] civil action [with its attendant higher awards] is allowed only in the latter situation.\u201d <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 148, 156 [233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743].) The second problem deals with the difficulty of handling a case, such as the one before us, where both physical and mental damages have been pleaded. How do we begin to separate them or to decide that one is more significant than the other, especially when, at this juncture, we are unaware of the extent of either?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We believe the time should and has come to cast aside the arbitrary and sometimes irrationally applied \u201cphysical versus emotional harm\u201d approach in favor of another factor more logically connected to the workers\u2019 compensation or suit-at-law choice. That factor is whether the acts complained of were a \u201cnormal part of the employment relationship\u201d <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 160), or, whether the acts were incidents of the employment relationship. <em>(Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 465, 477 [165 Cal.Rptr. 858, 612 P.2d 948, 9 A.L.R.4th 758]; <em>Young v. Libbey-Owens Ford Co., supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d 1037; <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Atlas Pacific Engineering, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d 219, 230; <em>Lagies </em>v. <em>Copley </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 958, 970 [168 Cal.Rptr. 368]; <em>Magliulo </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 760, 769-770, 777-779.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">In the recent California Supreme Court decision, <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 148, an employee sued his employer for \u201cmental and physical disability\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> resulting from harassment of him during union negotiations, and unfounded disciplinary actions taken against him which included demotions, humiliating work assignments, and salary reductions. He claimed the foregoing acts were done with the intent of causing him emotional distress. The court applied the exclusivity doctrine, holding: \u201c[W]hen the misconduct attributed to the employer is actions which are a normal part of the employment relationship, such as demotions, promotions, criticism of work practices, and frictions in negotiations as to grievances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>an employee suffering emotional distress causing disability may not avoid the exclusive remedy provisions of the Labor Code by characterizing the employer\u2019s decisions as manifestly unfair, outrageous, harassment, or intended to cause emotional disturbance resulting in disability____</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\"><em>\u201cThe cases that have permitted recovery in tort for intentional misconduct causing disability have involved conduct of an employer having a \u2018questionable\u2019 relationship to the employment, an injury which did not occur while the employee was performing service incidental to the employment and which would not be viewed as a risk of the employment, or conduct where the employer </em>... <em>stepped out of [his] proper [role]. </em>[Citations.] .. .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>9(Id., </em>at pp. 160-161, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">There can be little doubt Campbell\u2019s acts, as alleged, had a questionable relationship to employment, and were neither a risk, an incident, nor a normal part of Hart\u2019s employment with National. National can be charged with knowledge of the acts by virtue of the fact Hart allegedly reported them to Debbie Adams, and National failed to take action against Campbell. National can be said to have ratified Campbell\u2019s tortious conduct, and thus became a joint participant in it. <em>(Iverson </em>v. <em>Atlas Pacific Engineering, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at p. <em>228;</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> Meyer v. Graphic Arts International Union </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 176, 178 [151 Cal.Rptr. 597].) Of course, it must be shown National did this for the purpose of causing Hart emotional distress. <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 159; <em>Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p 476.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">We believe Hart has adequately alleged ratification by claiming he reported Campbell\u2019s activity to Debbie Adams, and she and Mary Drury \u201ccondon[ed] this conduct... with knowledge that plaintiff had objected and plaintiff would suffer further emotional and physical distress.\u201d If he is able to allege National acted with the intent to injure, he should be permitted to do so. (See, e.g., <em>McGee </em>v. <em>McNally, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.3d at p. 896.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>Hart alleges National\u2019s actions and his injuries occurred during the period August 1982 to May 1983. Certain amendments to the Labor Code became effective January 1, 1983. The acts and injuries occurring after that date are governed by the amendments. <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\">The amendment severely limited one judicially created exception1 *********<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the exclusivity doctrine,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> not relevant here, and codified those exceptions dealing with willful physical assaults by the employer, fraudulent concealment by the employer, and the use of defective products manufactured by the employer. Absent from the amendment is any mention of emotional distress. Does this then mean this exception died with the amendment? We think not. The infliction of emotional distress continues to be one wrong for which the workers\u2019 compensation system provides no remedy, even after the amendments. Thus, we find ourselves once again in the situation this court faced in Renteria\u2014the exception must continue to be viable if injured workers are to have redress for wrongful acts committed by employers. We are also persuaded by language repeated throughout the history of this developing area and most recently reiterated by the Supreme Court in <em>Cole,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that when employers step out of their roles as such and commit acts which do not fall within the reasonably anticipated conditions of work, they may not then hide behind the shield of workers\u2019 compensation. This is as true today as it was before 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>We also believe the exclusivity doctrine does not apply to prevent Hart from stating a cause of action against National for assault and battery, if Hart is able to correctly plead such a cause of action. Before 1983, case law held an employee could sue his employer when the latter personally assaulted the employee. <em>(Magliulo </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 760.) The 1983 amendments codified an exception to the exclusivity doctrine when the injury is \u201ccaused by a willful physical assault by the employer.\u201d (Note, there is no express requirement that the employer <em>personally </em>assault the employee.) We believe under the doctrine of ratification (see <em>Iverson </em>v. <em>Atlas Pacific Engineering, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d 219; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Graphic Arts International Union, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 176), Hart may state a cause of action by alleging National was aware of Campbell\u2019s acts in jumping on, grabbing and pinching him, and did nothing to discipline him. Although his complaint, as it currently stands, falls short of doing this, we believe he should be given the chance to amend it if he is able to do so. (See, e.g., <em>McGee </em>v. <em>McNally, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.3d at p. 896.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">National\u2019s Liability for Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">The trial court found National could not be held liable for punitive damages under the assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress causes of action because Hart\u2019s pleadings did not fulfill the requirements of Civil Code section 3294.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">That section provides: \u201c[Wjhere the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice,... [K] An employer shall not be liable for [punitive] damages ... based upon acts of [his] employee ... unless the employer ... ratified the wrongful conduct ... or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the ... ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">In <em>Coats </em>v. <em>Construction &amp; Gen. Laborers Local No. 185, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.3d 908, a union\u2019s officers were informed its employees assaulted a union member, but it refused to discipline the employee. The court found the union\u2019s failure to discharge or discipline the offending employees amounted to ratification which justified an award of punitive damages against the employer under Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b). (See also <em>Bertero </em>v. <em>National General Corp. </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 43,67 [118 Cal.Rptr. 184, 529 P.2d 608, 65 A.L.R.3d 878].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>Hart alleged and testified in his deposition that he told Debbie Adams throughout the August 1982 - May 1983 period that Campbell was harassing him. He alleged and testified that Mary Drury was informed of Campbell\u2019s actions and the effect they were having on Hart the day he resigned. Evidently, nothing was done to punish Campbell.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">If plaintiff can show that Debbie Adams\u2019s knowledge of the harassment early on and failure to take action or Mary Drury\u2019s later knowledge and failure to act constitutes ratification imputable to National, he is entitled to punitive damages. In the alternative, he may be able to demonstrate Campbell was an \u201cofficer, director or managing agent\u201d of National,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and he committed acts of \u201coppression ... or malice.\u201d In order to comply with Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b), Hart should amend his pleading to allege either set of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">The judgment is affirmed as to the first cause of action.

The court found the workers\u2019 compensation award was res judicata as to all of plaintiff\u2019s special damages, leaving only the matter of pain and suffering uncompensated.

App.3d 760 [121 Cal.Rptr. 621], a case that has been given by the various courts precedential weight usually reserved for California Supreme Court decisions. One of the three rationales for the holding in <em>Magliulo </em>was an employer should not be able to shield himself from liability for his intentional torts by using the exclusivity doctrine. <em>Ankeny </em>gives little heed to this aspect of <em>Magliulo. </em>Second, the court concluded the acts alleged in <em>Ankeny </em>were not sufficiently outrageous to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-11\">The other two opinions here cited, <em>McGee </em>and <em>Gates, </em>blindly followed <em>Ankeny.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Courts trying to adhere to the physical versus emotional harm approach have been forced to be creative in their treatment of cases involving both types of injuries.
