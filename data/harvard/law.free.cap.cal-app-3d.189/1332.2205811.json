J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnP\">\u2014Petitioner Octavio Lozoya (Lozoya) seeks a writ of prohibition to restrain any further proceedings against him on a criminal information charging him with murder on the grounds he was committed by the magistrate without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">Because the magistrate\u2019s finding of attenuation is not supported by the record, the petition is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">On the evening of January 11, 1986, Michael Mosby (Mosby) was stabbed near the comer of 131 st Street and Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles County, and died shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-13\">On the morning of February 6, 1986, Lozoya was being interviewed at the police operations crash bureau at Avalon and 118th Street as a victim in an unrelated matter. At around 10 or 10:30 a.m., Lozoya was approached there by Detective Pietrantoni (Pietrantoni), who asked Lozoya if he were willing to discuss the murder of a Black man at 131st and Vermont. Lozoya agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-14\">The detective\u2019s interest in Lozoya arose from the fact that Mosby had perpetrated a residential robbery on December 15, 1985, at the Mendez home. One of the victims, Sophia Mendez, was Lozoya\u2019s girlfriend. During an investigative interview of the robbery at the Mendez home by other officers on January 10, 1986, Lozoya entered the room and stated \u201c \u2018The police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>never show up when you call them.\u2019... [1\u00cd]... \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Pietrantoni told Lozoya he preferred they confer at the station, and Lozoya acquiesced. On the way to the Southeast station, Lozoya was advised of his rights. Pietrantoni testified they \u201creally didn\u2019t have anything to arrest him for at the time.\u201d No positive identification had been made at that time and Lozoya had not been linked to a green Pinto used by the assailants. While Lozoya was not formally placed under arrest when transported to the station at about 10:30 a.m., he was not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">During the first of several interviews, which interview lasted about an hour, Lozoya denied he knew anything about the Mosby killing. Lozoya then agreed to submit to a polygraph examination, which was set for 1 p.m. at Parker Center in downtown Los Angeles. Lozoya told Youngblood, the polygraph examiner, that he had not slept for several days. Early in the examination Lozoya denied being present at the scene at the time of the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">Youngblood employed a number of tactics including telling Lozoya, among other things, that he didn\u2019t think any man would have let Mosby get away with what he did, referring to the robbery of Lozoya\u2019s girlfriend and her mother; that if Lozoya would cooperate, Lozoya would have some say on how things could go; that Lozoya had the choice of working with or against the authorities; and that he was uncertain as to whether Lozoya had done the actual stabbing. Youngblood told Lozoya he would try to clear him, and needed to know in which direction to go in the event the district attorney asked whether Lozoya was cooperating. Youngblood further asked: \u201c \u2018You want me to tell the detectives to go ahead and file murder charges?\u2019 \u201d Lozoya responded to Youngblood that he had told his girlfriend he would help her if the burglar returned, and admitted being near the scene, but denied stabbing Mosby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Lozoya was taken back to the station at around 4:30 p.m. and formally arrested. He was again extensively interviewed, although Pietrantoni noted Lozoya was sleepy. Lozoya gave three different versions of what occurred, and implicated several other suspects. The detectives told him they were becoming upset with him and were running out of patience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">Following this interview, Lozoya accompanied the detectives to several locations in south Los Angeles to identify residences of gang members he had implicated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>On Friday morning, February 7, Sophia Mendez and her sister were interviewed. Contrary to Lozoya\u2019s statements, they denied being present at the scene or being with Lozoya at the time of the stabbing. Lozoya was reinterviewed twice in the afternoon, with one technique being to admonish him repeatedly to tell the \u201cfucking truth.\u201d Lozoya admitted participating in the initial fight, but claimed he had backed off and was not involved in the actual killing. In between the interviews, a suspect known as \u201cWild Man,\u201d implicated by Lozoya as the driver of the green Pinto involved in the attack on Mosby, was brought into the room to confront Lozoya. The suspect shouted and swore at Lozoya and frightened him and had to be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">The detectives did not work on Saturday and Sunday, February 8 and 9, and Lozoya remained in custody. He was again interviewed at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, February 10. Lozoya complained he had not been permitted to use the phone, and the officers told him he could do so as soon as they were through. This time Lozoya admitted being present at the scene, armed with a knife, and participating in the initial assault on Mosby. Consistent with his earlier statements, Lozoya continued to deny any involvement in the actual stabbing, and held to the position that he had backed off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">Pietrantoni did not take the matter to the district attorney to file on because he and his partners were still investigating the case and preparing reports. Subsequently, named codefendant Rafael Navarro (Navarro) and his girlfriend, Beatrice Sanchez (Sanchez), were also interviewed separately on Monday. Although Navarro had been implicated by Lozoya during his questioning, Navarro\u2019s connection to the case began weeks earlier when the officers located the green Pinto used by the assailants parked in front of the Navarro family home. After Navarro submitted to a polygraph examination, the officers spoke to Sanchez. The officers then interviewed Navarro again, who, when advised of Sanchez\u2019s statements, implicated Lozoya.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Following the Navarro interviews, Lozoya was again interviewed by Pietrantoni on Monday, February 10, at 4:45 p.m. This interview occurred beyond the statutory arraignment period of Penal Code section 825.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This time, Lozoya stated he believed Mosby was responsible for the robbery at the Mendez home. He related that on the evening of January 11, 1986, he and several of his gang members drove around in the green Pinto searching for Mosby. Lozoya admitted stabbing Mosby upon locating him near 131st and Vermont. Lozoya then led officers to his home and gave them the knife used. He signed a summary of his statements at 8:50 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">A complaint was filed and Lozoya was arraigned Tuesday, February 11. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>At the preliminary hearing, the magistrate suppressed statements obtained from Lozoya on the first and second day of his custody because police tactics were \u201creprehensible\u201d and involved improper use of threats and promises. The magistrate ruled Lozoya should have been arraigned by 3:15 p.m., Monday, February 10, prior to the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Nonetheless, the magistrate ruled the Monday evening confession admissible, finding \u201cLozoya, after hearing that he had been implicated by Navarro, ... confessed to being the one that stabbed the victim.\u201d The confession was determined to be voluntary, as it came \u201cfrom an independent source cut off completely from the improper interviews and the threats and promises that had been made on Thursday and Friday by [Youngblood] as well [as] ... Pietrantoni.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Lozoya and Navarro were thus held to answer for the Mosby killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">An information was filed alleging Lozoya and Navarro violated one count of section 187, subdivision (a), and Lozoya personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon, to wit, a knife, in the commission of said offense, within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b). In addition, there was a prior prison term allegation (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) against Lozoya.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">The superior court denied Lozoya\u2019s section 995 motion to set aside the information. Lozoya then sought a writ of prohibition to restrain further criminal proceedings against him on the ground he was unlawfully committed. This court issued an alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">Lozoya contends: (1) he was arrested without probable cause; (2) all his statements should have been suppressed as fruits of an illegal arrest and as the result of improper threats and promises by the police; (3) without these statements, there was no probable cause to hold him to answer; and (4) the delay in arraignment was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\"> Discussion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">1. <em>Standard of appellate review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">A defendant has been held to answer without probable cause if the commitment is based entirely on incompetent evidence. Accordingly, in such a case, the trial court should grant a motion to set aside the information. <em>(Priestly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 812, 815 [330 P.2d 39].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>In proceedings under section 995, the magistrate is the finder of fact. The superior court sits as a reviewing court and must draw every legitimate inference in favor of the information. It cannot substitute its judgment as to the credibility or weight of the evidence for that of the magistrate. On review by appeal or writ, the appellate court in effect disregards the ruling of the superior court and directly reviews the determination of the magistrate holding the defendant to answer. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laiwa </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 711,718 [195 Cal.Rptr. 503, 669 P.2d 1278].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">2. <em>The arrest was unsupported by probable cause, tainting evidence which flowed from it.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">a. <em>The Thursday morning arrest was illegal because it was not based on probable cause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\"> As indicated, Pietrantoni testified, and the People concede, that Lozoya was not free to leave at 10:30 a.m. or so on Thursday morning, at the time Lozoya agreed to go to the station for questioning. At that point in the investigation, the officers were not sure whether Lozoya was a witness or a suspect. However, the magistrate found the arrest occurred at 3:15 p.m. on Thursday, because it was then, after Pietrantoni heard what Lozoya told Youngblood at the polygraph examination, that the decision to arrest was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">The ruling was error. In <em>Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 200, 203 [60 L.Ed.2d 824, 829-830, 99 S.Ct. 2248], without enough information for an arrest warrant, the police picked up the petitioner and took him into custody for questioning. Although he was not told he was under arrest, the petitioner would have been physically restrained had he attempted to leave. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Petitioner waived counsel and eventually incriminated himself in an attempted robbery and murder. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The United States Supreme Court pronounced \u201cdetention for custodial interrogation\u2014regardless of its label\u2014 intrudes so severely on interests protected by the Fourth Amendment as necessarily to trigger the traditional safeguards against illegal arrest.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 216 [60 L.Ed.2d at p. 838].) Accordingly, <em>Dunaway </em>held the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments are violated where, in the absence of probable cause, a suspect is seized and transported to the police station for interrogation. (Ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>There is no suggestion in the instant case that probable cause existed at that critical point. As in <em>Dunaway, </em>the detention was investigatory only, executed in the hope that something might turn up. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">b. <em>The Thursday afternoon arrest was illegal because Lozoya\u2019s statements to Youngblood were unlawfully obtained, barring their use for probable cause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">The magistrate suppressed Lozoya\u2019s statements made to Youngblood because of the latter\u2019s egregious conduct. Those statements were unlawfully obtained because of Youngblood\u2019s tactics and further, because they were the fruit of the improper custody of Lozoya. But even assuming, as the magistrate found, that Lozoya was not arrested until 3:15 p.m., with the suppression of Lozoya\u2019s statements to Youngblood, a postpolygraph arrest would be lacking in probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">It is fundamental that convictions supported by fruits of illegal government conduct are outlawed, \u201c \u2018because they encourage the kind of society that is obnoxious to free [people].\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bilderbach </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 757, 764 [44 Cal. 313, 401 P.2d 921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">\u201cThe essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the court, but that <em>it shall not be used at all. </em>Of course this does not mean that the facts thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them is gained from an independent source they may be proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the government\u2019s own wrong cannot be used by it in the way proposed.\u201d <em>(Silverthorne Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1920)251 U.S. 385, 392 [64 L.Ed. 319, 321, 405 S.Ct. 182,24 A.L.R. 1425], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Accordingly, <em>People </em>v. <em>Maxwell </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 124, 131-132, held information obtained by unlawful police conduct is \u201c \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 \u201d which cannot be added to the equation of probable cause. Consequently, a 3:15 p.m. arrest of Lozoya based on inadmissible statements made to Youngblood would have been lacking in probable cause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">Because the arrest of Lozoya was illegal, all evidence which flowed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>exploitation of that illegality was tainted \u201c \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1963) 371 U.S. 471, 487-488 [9 L.Ed.2d 441, 445, 83 S.Ct. 407].) Due to the improper police conduct, the magistrate suppressed, in addition to Lozoya\u2019s statements to Youngblood, all postarrest statements on Thursday and Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">However, the magistrate allowed in the pivotal confession of Monday evening, finding it was a voluntary act sufficient to attenuate the preceding taint. It is to that confession that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">3. <em>The magistrate\u2019s finding of attenuation is unsupported by the record. </em>a. <em>General principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">In <em>Wong Sun, </em>the Supreme Court pronounced the principles to be applied where the issue is whether statements and other evidence obtained after an illegal arrest should be excluded. Not \u201call evidence is \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police. Rather, the more apt question in such a case is \u2018whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 487-488 [9 L.Ed.2d at p. 455].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\"><em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 590, 603-604 [45 L.Ed.2d 416, 427, 95 S.Ct. 2254], held \u201c[t]he question whether a confession is the product of a free will under <em>Wong Sun </em>must be answered on the facts of each case. <em>No single fact is dispositive. </em>The workings of the human mind are too complex, and the possibilities of misconduct too diverse, to permit protection of the Fourth Amendment to turn on such a talismanic test. The <em>Miranda </em>warnings are an important factor, to be sure, in determining whether the confession is obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest. But they are not the only factor to be considered. The temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession, [fn. omitted] the presence of intervening circumstances, [citation], <em>and, particularly, the purpose andflagrancy </em>of the official misconduct [fn. omitted] are all relevant. [Citation.] The voluntariness of the statement is a threshold requirement. [Citation.] And the burden of showing admissibility rests, of course, on the prosecution. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">The temporal factor is an ambiguous one. While a short lapse of time may not suffice to purge the initial taint <em>(Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 98, 107 [65 L.Ed.2d 633, 643, 100 S.Ct. 2556]), a prolonged detention may well be a more serious exploitation of an illegal arrest than a short one. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number><em>(Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>442 U.S. at p. 220 [60 L.Ed.2d at p. 841] (cone. opn. of Stevens, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">\u201c[T]he degree of \u2018attenuation\u2019 which suffices to remove the taint from evidence obtained as a result of unlawful police conduct requires at least an intervening independent act by the defendant or a third party which breaks the causal chain linking illegality and evidence in such a way that the evidence is not in fact obtained by exploitation of that illegality. [Citation.] The defendant\u2019s [confession], if sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful conduct, may produce the requisite degree of attenuation. <em>(Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>371 U.S. 471 , at p. 486 [9 L.Ed.2d 441, at p. 454]; .. ,)\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(In re Peter G. </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 576, 585 [168 Cal.Rptr. 3].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">b. <em>Application here.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">\u201cIt is, ..., well recognized that the issue whether the taint flowing from the illegal police conduct had been adequately purged or dissipated is a factual matter ... to be determined by the trier of fact. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sesslin </em>[(1968]) 68 Cal.2d 418 , at p. 429.)\u201d <em>(In re Peter G., supra, </em>110 Cal.App.3d at p. 586.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">Here, the magistrate concluded: \u201c[Sanchez] implicated Navarro and Lozoya. Navarro was played a copy of the tape. He imlicated Mr. Lozoya. And Lozoya, <em>after hearing that he had been implicated by Navarro, </em>then confessed to being the one that stabbed the victim. [If] Under the circumstances I believe the confession at that time was voluntary. <em>And it came from an independent source </em>cut off completely from the improper interviews and the threats and promises that had been made on Thursday and Friday by the polygraph operator as well [as] Officer Pietrantoni.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">The magistrate\u2019s rendition of the facts is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">The following colloquy occurred between Lozoya\u2019s counsel and Pietrantoni on cross-examination at the preliminary hearing: \u201cQ Prior to this second conversation with Mr Lozoya on the 10th, meaning the one that took place in the early evening, prior to that time you had had an interview and done a polygraph examination with Mr. Navarro. Is that correct?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-5\">\u201cQ. Before you entered [yzc] Mr. Lozoya in the evening of the 10th, did you tell him the contents, or did you tell him what Mr. Navarro had said in his interviews?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-6\">\u201cA. I believe we probably discussed several interviews with him. Whether we discussed specifically Mr. Navarro\u2019s matter, I\u2019m not actually sure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-7\">The issue was later further explored on re-cross: \u201cQ Isn\u2019t it a fact that after\u2014well, you indicated yesterday that having a conversation with Mr. Navarro on February 10 you thereupon, prior to talking with Mr. Lozoya the evening of the 10th, you had either confronted him or reviewed what Mr. Navarro had told you.

I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-12\">\u201cQ. Did you then merely discuss what he had told you in that taped conversation with Mr. Lozoya?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-13\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know how we approached Mr. Lozoya regarding\u2014That\u2019s why I made the reference to between reviewed and confronted.

However, on the tape recording of the conversation between the detectives and Mr. Lozoya in the evening hours of February 10 there is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>direct reference on the tape by anyone to the tape of Mr. Navarro\u2019s statements. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-4\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-5\">\u201cQ. I assume then that your asking or referring in some manner to Mr. Navarro\u2019s statements was done prior to the afternoon tape recording process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-6\">\u201cA. Possibly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-7\">\u201cQ. Do you recall asking Mr. Lozoya any questions prior to turning the tape on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-8\">\u201cA. I recall having a discussion with him. As far as specifics, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-9\">\u201cQ.

Nor is there any support for the finding that the confession came from an independent source. Because on this record, the finding of attenuation cannot stand, the confession and the knife must be suppressed as fruits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>of an illegal arrest. Absent those items, the evidence is insufficient to sustain the commitment. The information must therefore be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">We do not reach the issue of delayed arraignment, except to note that such delay does not immunize a defendant from prosecution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d Supp. 7, 8-10 [84 Cal.Rptr. 703].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">c. <em>No attenuation possible here as a matter of law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">Even assuming Lozoya\u2019s confession resulted from his being presented with Navarro\u2019s statements, as a matter of law no attenuation could have occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Examination of cases where a defendant\u2019s statements or other evidence are held admissible due to attenuation reveals that such evidence is typically the product of <em>happenstance, </em>but not the <em>desired </em>result of official misconduct. The facts of the seminal case of <em>Wong Sun </em>are summarized at footnote 6, <em>ante. </em>In <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>448 U.S. at page 108 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 644], the \u201cpetitioner\u2019s admissions were apparently spontaneous reactions to the discovery of his drugs\u201d in a purse belonging to a third party, and as such \u201cweigh[ed] heavily in favor of a finding that petitioner acted \u2018of free will unaffected by the initial illegality.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Caratti </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 847 [163 Cal.Rptr. 265], likewise no exploitation of the primary illegality took place. There, the police unlawfully searched appellant\u2019s car, found, and seized drugs, but did not arrest appellant because they knew the search had been illegal and they would be unable to prosecute. Subsequently, appellant sold drugs to an undercover officer, was arrested, and pled guilty to a possession charge. The <em>Caratti </em>court rejected appellant\u2019s contention that the contraband sold to the officer was a fruit of the prior illegal search, holding the decision to sell drugs to the officer was an intervening independent act sufficient to dissipate the taint. <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 850-852.) The court acknowledged the police focused upon appellant as a result of the search of his car, but held there was no legally cognizable exploitation of the illegality, and appellant\u2019s volitional act was the proximate cause of his arrest and conviction. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 852.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\"><em>In re Peter G., supra, </em>110 Cal.App. 3d at page 581, presented the fact situation of a minor appellant being questioned by police, when another officer entered the interview room holding a screwdriver with which a victim had been stabbed. The appellant asked this officer what he was doing with appellant\u2019s screwdriver. <em>{Ibid.) </em>His convictions of attempted robbery and assault were reversed because an independent examination of the evidence led to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>the conclusion the appellant lacked the ability to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">However, the <em>Peter G. </em>court ordered that upon retrial, the trial court should determine whether appellant\u2019s spontaneous statement acknowledging ownership of the screwdriver constituted a sufficiently free and voluntary act which attenuated or purged the taint of the improper interrogation, <em>\u201cor whether his statement was the result of a police ploy inducing him to make further incriminating statements by bringing in and exhibiting the screwdriver in his presence.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 586, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\"><em>In re Jorge S. </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 852, 860 [141 Cal.Rptr. 722], found there was no attenuation where it was \u201capparent that the <em>purpose </em>of the official misconduct was directed toward obtaining an admission of criminal conduct.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">Precisely the same is true here. Assuming arguendo the officers actually presented Lozoya with Navarro\u2019s statements, their conduct was wholly purposeful, with an eye toward finally extracting a confession from Lozoya. Rather than being attenuated, such a confession would have been the result of the ongoing exploitation of the primary illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">We are mindful of the gravity of the charge herein, and further that Lozoya confessed to the stabbing and led police to the knife used. However, probable cause was lacking at the time of the arrest. Even assuming the arrest did not occur until 3:15 p.m. Thursday afternoon, the magistrate suppressed Lozoya\u2019s statements to Youngblood, which statements cannot be used to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">The magistrate\u2019s finding that Lozoya confessed upon being presented with Navarro\u2019s statements implicating him is not supported by this record. At best, Pietrantoni\u2019s responses upon which the magistrate\u2019s ruling rested, were inconclusive. Accordingly, this record cannot support a finding that the taint was attenuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">Even assuming the events transpired as the magistrate found, rather than being attenuated, the confession would have been nothing more than the product of a continued exploitation of the initial illegality. Due to the lack of attenuation, the confession and the knife as \u201cfruits\u201d of the illegal arrest, must be suppressed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">The alternative writ having served its purpose is discharged.

The lack of supplemental briefing does not disturb the finality of the trial court\u2019s ruling.
