Kristal (Kristal), and various coventurers with Kristal (hereinafter collec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>lively referred to as appellants), appeal following jury trial on claims of fraud and breach of various warranties arising out of Olivet\u2019s purchase and use of chickenfeed produced by the Albers Milling Division of the Carnation Company (Albers).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We must, at the outset, address the question of mootness. Several weeks after oral argument before this court, when this appeal had been submitted for decision, counsel for all parties joined in a self-styled \u201cmotion for order vacating submission; or alternatively, to defer further consideration of submitted appeal.\u201d The motion was made upon the ground that the parties had entered into a tentative settlement agreement. Thereafter, the parties notified the court that all necessary approvals had been obtained and the settlement agreement had been executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In light of this disposition of the dispute between the parties, we have determined to treat the parties\u2019 motion as one for dismissal of the appeal and hereby grant the motion as to six of the eight issues raised by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The two remaining issues are: (1) whether the injured party or the breaching party bears the burden of proving the adequacy or inadequacy of efforts to mitigate consequential damages under California Uniform Commercial Code section 2715, subdivision (2)(a) and (2) whether cross-demands for money must be mutual and due from the same person to the same person in order to qualify as offsetting claims under Code of Civil Procedure section 431.70. The former issue presents a question of first impression in California, about which courts in other jurisdictions are almost evenly divided. The latter is one on which there is a surprising dearth of helpful authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">It is established that \u201c[i]f an action involves a matter of continuing public interest and the issue is likely to recur, a court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue, even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot. <em>(In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 23-24 ...; <em>Di Giorgio Fruit Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Employment </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 54, 58 ... ; <em>American Civil Liberties Union </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 167, 181-182 ____)\u201d <em>(Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fales </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 712, 715, 716 [106 Cal.Rptr. 21, 505 P.2d 213]; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 622, fn. 6 [111 Cal.Rptr. 704, 517 P.2d 1168.)  Due to the likelihood the legal questions earlier described will arise again, and the manner in which prompt resolution of these questions will facilitate commercial transactions in this .state, we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>that these issues involve matters of continuing public interest and on this basis proceed to decide them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The facts pertinent to the issues we decide are as follows. Appellant Kristal, through the Olivet Egg Ranch Limited Partnership and a network of other partnerships and joint ventures, controlled and managed an egg-producing operation in Northern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">For approximately five years, Olivet or its predecessors in interest purchased chickenfeed from Albers, which operated a mill in Santa Rosa. After unsuccessfully seeking payment of its bills, Carnation advised appellants they would no longer be allowed to purchase on credit. Appellants executed a note for the $606,382 balance owed to Carnation. When appellants defaulted on the note Carnation commenced this litigation. Appellants cross-complained on various theories,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> all premised on their assertion that the feed sold them was \u201cmisformulated, mis-produced and nutritionally substandard\u201d and, therefore, breached a variety of express and implied warranties made to appellants by Carnation and its employees. Appellants alleged that the feed\u2019s nutritional deficiencies had caused a decrease in Olivet\u2019s egg production revenues and sought to offset such losses against the amount due Carnation on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">After lengthy pretrial discovery, jury trial commenced in October 1979. Because the execution and terms of the note were uncontested, appellants proceeded as if plaintiffs and presented their case first. At the conclusion of Olivet\u2019s case Carnation successfully moved for nonsuit as to the loss-of-goodwill portion of Olivet\u2019s damage claim. The court granted a nonsuit on goodwill damages as to the breach of warranty causes of action only on the theory appellants had not met their burden of proving, under California Uniform Commercial Code section 2715, that they had made reasonable efforts to mitigate the damages flowing from the loss of their retail egg-marketing accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">At the close of evidence Carnation was granted a directed verdict as to a portion of the damages suffered by Olivet\u2019s predecessor in interest in 1970. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>The jury found that Carnation had breached its warranties and damaged Olivet in the amount of $225,000, but that the claim of fraudulent misrepresentation had not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Separate judgments for both parties were entered and Olivet moved for a new trial on various grounds. Carnation petitioned for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and a determination of the interest due on its note. The court denied the motion for new trial, granted a motion to vacate the two previously entered judgments and ordered nunc pro tunc entry of the net judgment after verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\n<em>Burden of Proof Under California Uniform Commercial Code Section 2715, Subdivision (2)(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The nonsuit as to the $309,000 loss in goodwill appellants claimed due to their inability to service their egg marketing accounts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was granted upon the theory that California Uniform Commercial Code section 2715, subdivision (2)(a) places on the aggrieved party the burden of showing it took reasonable steps to mitigate its consequential damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In granting nonsuit the court necessarily determined that, as a matter of law, Olivet failed to present evidence sufficient to meet its burden. It will be necessary to consider whether Olivet presented evidence sufficient to withstand nonsuit on this issue only if we first determine that the court\u2019s imposition of the burden on Olivet was legally correct. Olivet could not be penalized for failing to meet a burden which actually rested with Carnation. Thus, we are squarely faced with a question of first impression in California: which party bears the burden of proving the adequacy or inadequacy of efforts to mitigate conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>quential damages under California Uniform Commercial Code section 2715, subdivision (2)(a)?</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Section 2715, subdivision (2)(a), which was adopted without change from the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), simply declares that \u201c[consequential damages resulting from the seller\u2019s breach include ... [a]ny loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The official comment to the parallel provision of the UCC does not shed much light on allocation of the burden of proof. Paragraph 2 of the pertinent UCC comment provides in material part that: \u201cThe \u2018tacit agreement\u2019 test for the recovery of consequential damages is rejected. Although the older rule at common law which made the seller liable for all consequential damages of which he had \u2018reason to know\u2019 in advance is followed, <em>the liberality of that rule is modified by refusing to permit recovery unless the buyer could not reasonably have prevented the loss by cover or otherwise. </em>Subparagraph (2) [of the statute] carries forward the provision of the prior uniform statutory provision as to consequential damages resulting from breach of warranty, but modifies the rule by requiring first that the buyer attempt to minimize his damages in good faith, either by cover or otherwise.\u201d (Italics added.) This comment does not demonstrate, as respondent asserts, that section 2715, subdivision (2)(a) was intended to act as \u201ca restraint on the liberality of the common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Paragraph 4 of the UCC comment makes specific reference<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the UCC\u2019s section on the liberal administration of remedies,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> indicating that the right to consequential damages should be <em>broadly, </em>not narrowly, construed. Furthermore, while paragraph 4 states that \u201c[t]he burden of proving the extent of loss incurred by way of consequential damage is on the buyer ...\u201d this statement does not determine the allocation of the burden of proof on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the mitigation issue. It is entirely possible for the injured party to bear the burden of proving the <em>extent </em>of consequential damages while the breaching party has the duty of proving those items which <em>limit </em>the award of consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The UCC\u2019s failure to allocate unambiguously the burden of proving mitigation has resulted in conflicting interpretations among those jurisdictions that have considered the question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unfortunately, these cases are of little value to us since they do not analyze the problem nor explain why the burden should rest with one party or the other. By and large the cases merely state the unembellished conclusion that one or the other party has the burden of proof on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Paragraph 3 of the California code comment to section 2715 provides that \u201c[t]he consequential damages provided for in subdivision (2) were recoverable under prior California law.\u201d (Citing, as examples, <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Wander Seed &amp; Bulb Co. </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 462 [2 Cal.Rptr. 310], and <em>Roberts Distrib. Co., </em>v. <em>Kaye-Halbert Corp. </em>(1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 664 [272 P.2d 886].) Similarly, another California Court of Appeal has concluded that section 2715, subdivision (2)(a) \u201cis merely a codification of the rule that the buyer must attempt to minimize damages. (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 639-640, 670-674).)\u201d <em>(Sun Maid Raisin Growers </em>v. <em>Victor Packing Co. </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 787, 792 [194 CaLRptr. 612].) Thus, adoption of the UCC did nothing to alter preexisting California law on the right to recover consequential damages and the duty to mitigate such losses. We have discovered no pre-UCC California goods cases (which now would be governed by the UCC) which deal with the issue before us. However, there is abundant California authority on the question as it arises in other contract cases. In those cases, the established rule is that \u201c[t]he burden of proof is on the party whose breach caused damage, to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>matters relied on to mitigate damage. [Citations omitted.]\u201d <em>(Steelduct Co. </em>v. <em>Henger-Seltzer Co. </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 634, 654 [160 P.2d 804] [contract action]; accord, <em>Mass </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 612, 628 [39 Cal.Rptr. 739, 394 P.2d 579] [wrongful discharge]; <em>Healdsburg Police Officers Ass'n.</em>v. <em>City of Healdsburg </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 444, 456 [129 Cal.Rptr. 216] [stating that it is \u201caxiomatic\u201d that the burden of proof regarding mitigation is on the breaching party].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, to the extent adoption of the UCC was intended to leave undisturbed preexisting law on this question, we should continue to place the burden on the breaching party. Moreover, the interest in consistency supports adoption of a rule placing on the breaching party the burden of proof under California Uniform Commercial Code section 2715, subdivision (2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">While the commentators do not unanimously support allocating the burden to the breaching party, there is substantial support among them for this position. Corbin, for example, declares that \u201c[t]he burden of proving that losses have been avoided by reasonable effort and expense must always be borne by the party who has broken the contract.\u201d (5 Corbin on Contracts (1964) \u00a7 1039, citing <em>Vitagraph, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Theatres Co., supra, </em>197 Cal. 694, and <em>Rosenberger </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Ry. Co. </em>(1896) 111 Cal. 313 [43 P. 963].) White and Summers state that \u201cconsequential damages that the <em>defendant </em>proves the buyer could have avoided will not be allowed ... \u201c (J. White and R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (2d ed. 1980) \u00a7\u00a7 6-7, p. 250, italics added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Placing on the party who breaches the burden of showing that consequential losses could have been avoided is intuitively attractive, since proof that there has been a failure to mitigate adequately will reduce the damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>awarded and, therefore, seems more in the nature of a defense than an element of the plaintiff\u2019s affirmative case. In this sense, proof of failure to mitigate is analogous to evidence showing comparative negligence in tort law, which must be alleged and proved by the defendant. (See generally, <em>Li </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 804 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226, 78 A.L.RJd 393].) Moreover, it is sensible to require the defendant to prove those items which go to reduce the plaintiffs recovery, as plaintiffs would have little incentive to do so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Respondent maintains that \u201c[i]t makes more sense to place the burden of proving efforts to mitigate on the party best able to adduce evidence of such efforts.\u201d While this argument is on its surface appealing it does not stand up to closer scrutiny. As has been noted \u201c[v]ery often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof. Nearly all required allegations of the plaintiff in actions for tort or breach of contract relating to the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions describe matters peculiarly in the defendant\u2019s knowledge. Correspondingly, when the defendant is required to plead contributory negligence, he pleads facts specially known to the plaintiff.\u201d (McCormick on Evidence (3d ed. 1984) ch. 36, \u00a7 337 at p. 950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Moreover, in cases such as this defendants do not genuinely lack the ability to ascertain the pertinent facts. A carefully drafted set of interrogatories could have provided Carnation with all the information it required about Olivet\u2019s efforts to mitigate its consequential damages. Since it therefore had access to the relevant evidence we see no reason why this consideration should prevent allocation to Carnation of the burden of showing that appellants failed to adequately mitigate their consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that while the burden of proving the extent of loss incurred by way of consequential damages rests with the injured party, section 2715, subdivision (2)(a) imposes upon the allegedly breaching party the burden of proving the inadequacy of efforts to mitigate consequential damages. Thus, Carnation, not Olivet, properly had the burden of proof on the issue of Olivet\u2019s mitigation of the consequential damages arising from Carnation\u2019s breach.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Olivet therelore had no duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>present evidence of mitigation and the granting of the nonsuit on the basis of Olivet\u2019s asserted failure to produce such evidence was error. The nonsuit removed from the jury\u2019s consideration a $309,000 damage claim. Since Carnation never presented evidence on this issue there is no way of knowing whether appellants likely would have prevailed if the court had placed the burden of proof on Carnation. Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>Appellants\u2019 Ability to Assert Joint Venture I\u2019s Losses as Offsets</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">At the conclusion of the evidence Carnation sought and was granted a directed verdict as to the damages allegedly suffered by one of Kristal\u2019s previous partnerships, Joint Venture I, in 1970.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The directed verdict was based on Carnation\u2019s argument that appellants could not invoke California Code of Civil Procedure section 431.70 to protect the 1970 claims and that they were therefore time-barred.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">As relevant, section 431.70 provides that: \u201cWhere cross-demands for money have existed between persons at any point in time when neither demand was barred by the statute of limitations, and an action is thereafter commenced by one such person, the other person may assert in the answer the defense of payment in that the two demands are compensated so far as they equal each other, notwithstanding that an independent action asserting the person\u2019s claim would at the time of filing the answer be barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d The trial court concluded that since \u201ccross-demands\u201d must have co-existed \u201cbetween persons,\u201d the rights must be mutual and due from the same person to the same person to qualify as offsetting claims under the statute. Because Joint Venture I was not a party against whom Carnation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>had a claim the court reasoned that Joint Venture I\u2019s losses could not be asserted as an offset in this action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis and therefore find no error in awarding Carnation a directed verdict on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Appellants suggest that the question comes down to \u201cwhether a partner with some beneficial interest in a partnership claim should be entitled to offset under \u00a7 431.70 some or all of the partnership\u2019s claim against a third party, against that third party\u2019s claim against the partner.\u201d Appellants rely upon the bare language of the Uniform Partnership Act (codified in Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 15000 et seq.) as support for their position. They reason that since a partner has a proportionate beneficial interest in the partnership\u2019s assets and liabilities (\u00a7\u00a7 15018, 15024-15026), and an equal right to manage and conduct the partnership\u2019s business (\u00a7\u00a7 15018, subd. (c) and 15024, subd. (3)), it follows that, even after dissolution, a single partner may assert a partnership claim as an offset in an action not involving the partnership. We see the matter differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Section 431.70 requires that claims must be mutual if they are to qualify as \u201ccross-demands\u201d under the statute. In considering a claim under former Code of Civil Procedure section 440,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> predecessor to section 431.70, our Supreme Court stated: \u201c[t]here can be no question but that the general rule as to the necessity of mutuality is as asserted by respondent, and it may be conceded that in a strict sense there is no mutuality between the claims here under consideration; <em>they are not due to and from the same parties and in the same </em>capacity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>California etc. Trust Co. </em>(1914) 168 Cal. 241, at p. 248 [141 P. 1181], italics added; see also, <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Petty </em>(1884) 65 Cal. 322, 324 [4 P. 103] [concluding that under former \u00a7 440 the claims must be in the nature of a counterclaim and \u201cexisting in favor of a defendant and against a plaintiff, between whom a several judgment might be had in the action ... \u201d].) \u201cThus, a partnership obligation or claim may not be set off against the personal obligation or claim of the partners----\u201d (16 Cal.Jur.3d (rev. 1983) Counterclaim and Setoff, \u00a7 9, at p. 259.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>The trial judge and counsel for both parties engaged in a lengthy discussion of this issue, during which appellants\u2019 counsel indicated that Joint Venture I was distinct from Joint Venture II because they were composed of different partners and pursued significantly different objectives.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, Carnation argues that \u201cKristal as partner of Joint Venture I cannot set off Joint Venture I\u2019s claim against Carnation\u2019s claim upon Kristal, either individually or as a partner in Joint Venture II and Olivet, because Joint Venture I has no obligation to satisfy Kristal, Joint Venture II or Olivet\u2019s obligations.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The language of section 431.70 and the cases discussing its interpretation and application make clear that the statute was intended to protect mutual claims existing between the same persons in the same capacities. We believe it would require stretching section 431.70 far beyond its intended boundaries to allow appellants to assert Joint Venture I\u2019s claim against Carnation when Carnation is not maintaining any claim against Joint Venture I. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that the policy objectives underlying section 431.70 would be served by its application in this case.  As appellants acknowledge, the underlying purpose of the statute is to prevent a party from sitting on a claim against a particular person and thereby inducing that person to permit his or her counterclaim to become time barred, and then swooping in on the defenseless victim. However, we cannot see how this purpose would be served by applying the statute here. In light of the complicated relationships between and among the persons and entities involved and the uncertainty of section 431.70\u2019s application, it is difficult to believe Carnation deliberately would have waited until 1976 to sue <em>Olivet and Kristal </em>with the intention of \u201clulling\u201d <em>Joint Venture I </em>into permitting its claim to become barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court was correct in granting Carnation a directed verdict on this claim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Due to the trial court\u2019s improper allocation of the burden of proof under California Uniform Commercial Code section 2715, subdivision (2)(a), the judgment is reversed.

Due to Olivet\u2019s shortfall in egg production, it ultimately was unable to keep up with the requirements of its market accounts and Olivet transferred the accounts to Olson Egg Farms. Appellants claimed the loss of the goodwill value of the retail marketing arm of its operation as an additional element of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The nonsuit was granted only as to the loss of goodwill attributable to the claimed breach of warranty.

After the joint venture was dissolved, the ranch was vacant for a time until another venture, Joint Venture II, was formed in 1971. In 1974 Joint Venture II was merged into the partnership that was a party to this suit. Appellants had claimed that Joint Venture I suffered $30,000 in damages due to its use of Carnation\u2019s allegedly nutritionally deficient feed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Since Joint Venture I\u2019s claim against Carnation would have accrued in late 1970, and was not asserted until the filing of the cross-complaint on April 8, 1976, it would be barred by the statute of limitations if it did not fall within the purview of section 431.70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Appellants admit that \u201cthere was no evidence that the first joint venture continued in existence after 1970, or of how Olivet might have succeeded to its rights and interests,\u201d although there was evidence that Kristal was one of the partners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Former section 440 of the Code of Civil Procedure section provided, in relevant part, that: \u201cWhere cross-demands have existed between persons, under such circumstances that if one had brought an action against the other, a counter-claim could have been set up, the two demands, so far as they equal each other, shall be compensated____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Conversely, it has been held that \u201c[i]n an action on a partnership demand the defendant cannot set off an individual debt from one of the partners.

In addition, Joint Venture I merely rented a ranch, ran birds through one egg-laying cycle, and then sold them. Joint Venture II owned the ranch, purchased the birds and then continued to have them produce eggs as long as was profitable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Even if we had determined that the claims were offsetting cross-demands under section 431.70, Kristal, one of eight partners in Joint Venture I, could not maintain a claim on behalf of the partnership without joining all of his partners. In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1918) 177 Cal. 587 [171 P. 293], the California Supreme Court held that a partner could not sue in her individual capacity for damages suffered by a partnerhsip with which she was involved, and stated, \u201c \u2018the true rule is that the damages to the copartnership must be recovered by the partners jointly, and that damages to the partners individually must be recovered by the partners separately; otherwise it would be necessary to have a partnership accounting in [the instant suit]____\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 590, quoting <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Postum Cereal Co., Ltd. </em>(1912) 150 App.Div. 169 [134 N.Y.Supp. 847]; see also, <em>Leh </em>v. <em>General Petroleum Corporation </em>(S.D.Cal. 1958) 165 F.Supp. 933,936 [interpreting California law to require the joinder of all partners in an action asserting a partnership claim and denying the individual partners \u201clegal capacity to sue\u201d on behalf of the partnership].)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Moreover, there would be additional problems involved in determining what share of a partnership claim could be used as an offset by one individual. Permitting one partner to offset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the entire partnership\u2019s interest might later result in other partners seeking to use the claim as an offset, only to discover that their rights have already have been adjudicated. (That could not happen in this case, because any claims Carnation might have had against Joint Venture I now are time-barred and the venture\u2019s claims could only avoid the statute of limitations if asserted as an offset against Carnation. However, it is not difficult to imagine a situation where it might occur.) On the other hand, if an individual only were allowed to apply his percentage share of the partnership claim the litigation would be further complicated by the need to have a partnership accounting to determine the proportionate interest that rightfully could be asserted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
