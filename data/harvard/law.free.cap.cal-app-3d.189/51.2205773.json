Congleton and Dorothy H. Congleton, appeal from the summary judgment entered in favor of respondents, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa., Southeastern Aviation Underwriters, Inc., and Southeastern Aviation (California) Insurance Service, and from an order denying them leave to file an amended complaint. We affirm the judgment and the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Appellants filed a complaint for damages against respondents for tortious denial of their property loss claim under an aviation insurance policy, alleging causes of action for breach of statutory duties under Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">In February 1979, appellants purchased a new twin-engine Piper Navajo Chieftain aircraft and then leased it to Baja Cortez Airlines, a corporation of which Paul Congleton was a member of the board of directors, president and a stockholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">During the period of the lease, Baja Cortez decided to sublease the aircraft for financial reasons. In anticipation of the sublease, Paul Congleton contacted respondents\u2019 agent, William Tassio, to procure aviation insurance coverage. Congleton told Tassio that he intended to lease the aircraft to R. Bruce Allender, and Tassio subsequently interviewed Allender over the tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>phone as to the proposed lease terms. On July 28, 1980, Tassio issued, on respondents\u2019 behalf, a binder of insurance for the aircraft effective the following day. The insurance binder listed the named insureds as \u201cPaul C. &amp; Dorothy H. Congleton (Lessor) and R. Bruce Allender (Lessee)\u201d and provided that, \u201cIt is expressly stipulated that this binder is issued (1) subject to all the terms and conditions of the policy regularly issued by the Company in the state in which the operation or property is located, which policy is hereby made a part hereof to the same extent as if fully set forth herein, (2) ____[\u00b6] . . . This binder is made and accepted subject to the foregoing stipulations and conditions ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">On August 1, 1980, Baja Cortez entered into the sublease with Allender and delivered possession of the aircraft to him through his agent, Ralph Boone, in Knoxville, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">On August 5, 1980, respondents issued a policy of aviation insurance to appellants, naming appellants and Allender as insureds and \u201clessor\u201d and \u201clessee,\u201d respectively, as on the binder.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The \u201cDeclarations\u201d page of the policy provided, in part, that, \u201cThe aircraft will be used only for the purposes indicated by \u2018X\u2019 below (see Definitions). [\u00b6] ... X \u2018 <em>Pleasure and Business\u2019 \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The relevant \u201cinsuring agreements\u201d portion of the policy provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">\u201cCoverage F\u2014All Risk Basis To pay for any <em>physical damage </em>loss to the aircraft, including <em>disappearance </em>of the aircraft. [\u00b6] Coverage G\u2014All Risk Basis Not in Flight To pay for any <em>physical damage </em>to the aircraft sustained while the aircraft is not in flight and which is not the result of fire or explosion following crash or collision while the aircraft was in flight. [\u00b6] Coverage H \u2014All Risk Basis Not in Motion To pay for any <em>physical damage </em>loss to the aircraft sustained while the aircraft is not in motion and which is not the result of fire or explosion following crash or collision while the aircraft was in motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Among the express policy \u201cexclusions\u201d to these coverages were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">\u201cThis policy does not apply: [\u00b6] 1. To any insured while the aircraft is in flight with the knowledge and consent of such insured or of any executive officer, partner, or managing agent of such insured for any unlawful purpose, or any purpose not so designated in the Declarations. [\u00b6] .... 6. Under Coverages F, G and H [\u00b6] (a) to loss or damage due to conversion, embezzle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ment or secretion by any person in possession of the aircraft under a bailment, lease, conditional sale, purchase agreement, mortgage or other encumbrance, nor for any loss or damage during or resulting therefrom;...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The relevant words appearing in \u201cbold face print\u201d (italicized above) in these provisions were defined as follows: \u201c \u2018Disappearance\u2019 means missing and not reported for sixty days after commencing a flight.\u201d \u201c \u2018Physical Damage\u2019 means direct and accidental physical loss of or damage to the aircraft, hereinafter called loss, but does not include loss of use or any residual depreciation in value, if any, after repairs have been made.\u201d \u201c \u2018Pleasure and Business\u2019 means used in the business of the insured including personal and pleasure uses but excluding any operation for hire or reward----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The aircraft was last seen at the Knoxville airport on August 5, 1980. The aircraft has not since been located.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">While little is apparently known about the aircraft\u2019s mysterious disappearance, information accumulated by respondents about Allender and Boone suggests at least one very plausible, if not likely, scenario that may be relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">It seems that in April 1980, four months before respondents insured appellants\u2019 aircraft, respondents insured a similar aircraft owned by Reed Harman that also happened to be the subject of a lease to Allender, a named insured under the Harman policy. The aircraft lease between Harman and Allender happened to be executed by Boone, who was also known as Richard Wellens, on Allender\u2019s behalf. As appellants explain, \u201cOn or before June 23, 1980, the Harman aircraft had been seized in Columbia [\u00bf7 c], South America, for illegal entry.\u201d Harman submitted a theft claim under the policy, though the aircraft was never recovered, and respondents compromised and settled the claim in the amount of $20,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Upon investigation of the Harman loss, respondents learned that Boone, in conjunction with an aircraft broker named Richard Peacock and others, including persons known as the \u201cPounders Brothers,\u201d was implicated in a ring of international drug smugglers who stole twin-engine, long distance aircraft such as appellants\u2019 for use in drug smuggling between Colombia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>South America, and the United States. Apparently, law enforcement agents in the United States had actually photographed Boone removing seats from one of the aircraft, owned by Baja Cortez and insured by respondents, for the purpose of installing internal auxiliary fuel tanks. Later, Boone and one of his pilots were convicted of conspiracy to smuggle drugs into the United States and sentenced to prison. In the course of proceedings against them, the pilot revealed that he had flown another aircraft insured by respondents and crashed another in a lake or river in Colombia. Respondents commenced investigations on at least three other aircraft losses they had insured against that occurred under similar circumstances, including two others involving aircraft owned by Baja Cortez. Over time, one of the missing aircraft was recovered in Miami, Florida, without seats while another was reportedly crashed at sea, another located in Colombia and yet another purportedly crash-landed in a Colombian lake or river.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Appellants submitted a claim for the missing aircraft in the amount of $240,000 to respondents under their aviation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Although respondents settled a claim submitted by Crocker National Bank, which held a security interest in the aircraft as lender, respondents denied appellants\u2019 claim on the following three grounds: (1) the policy expressly excludes coverage \u201cwhile the aircraft is in flight with the knowledge and consent of such insured ... for ... any purpose not so designated in the Declarations,\u201d and the declarations provided that the aircraft would be used only for \u201cpleasure and business\u201d purposes; the aircraft was not being used either by appellants or by their co-insured, Allender, for \u201cpleasure\u201d or \u201cbusiness\u201d at the time of its loss; (2) under exclusion number \u201c6.(a),\u201d quoted above, the policy expressly excludes coverage for conversion or secreting of the aircraft by any person in possession under a lease, and all of the known facts indicated that either Allender or his agent, Boone, had converted or secreted the aircraft; and (3) appellants failed to establish \u201cphysical damage\u201d loss to or \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the aircraft within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The trial court granted respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied appellants\u2019 motion for leave to file an amended complaint; appellants now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against them for the following reasons: (1) at the time of its loss the aircraft was not being used for other than \u201cpleasure and business\u201d purposes; (2) regardless of whether the aircraft was stolen on the ground or in flight, the loss was covered by the insurance policy; (3) the coverage exclusion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>losses resulting from \u201cconversion or secretion by any person in possession under a lease\u201d is neither valid nor applicable under the evidence presented; (4) triable issues of fact existed with respect to respondents\u2019 waiver of various policy defenses because of their prior knowledge of facts affecting coverage or, alternatively, knowledge of such facts estopped them from relying on the policy defenses asserted; and (5) the temporary insurance binder rather than the policy is controlling because the claimed loss occurred before the policy was delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Appellants further contend that the trial court prejudicially erred in denying them leave to file a first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Discussion <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u201c[O]n an appeal from a summary judgment, the appellate court has the duty to determine whether a triable issue of material fact exists. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Estate ofPitzer </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 979, 986 [202 Cal.Rptr. 855].)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u201cA motion for summary judgment may only be granted where no triable issue of material fact exists and where the moving party\u2019s affidavits, declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions or judicially noticeable matters set forth sufficient facts to sustain a judgment in its favor. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b); <em>Estate ofPitzer [supra] </em>155 Cal.App.3d 979.)\u201d <em>(Rincon </em>v. <em>Burbank Unified School Dist. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 949, 954 [224 Cal.Rptr. 88].)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Both appellants and respondents urge us to adopt various interpretations of the insurance policy\u2019s provisions in determining whether triable issues of material fact exist. Before undertaking an analysis of specific policy provisions, however, we first consider the applicable legal principles upon which our determination of factual materiality will be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">At the outset we note that appellants\u2019 action is essentially one for first party insurance bad faith against respondents for alleged tortious refusal to pay benefits under a policy of aviation insurance following appellants\u2019 reported loss of their aircraft while it was subleased to Allender, also a named insured under the policy.  \u201c \u2018[W]hen the insurer unreasonably and in bad faith withholds payment of the claim of its insured, it is subject to liability in tort.\u2019 [Citations.] For the insurer to fulfill its obligation not to impair the right of the insured to receive the benefits of the agreement, it... must give at least as much consideration to the latter\u2019s interests as it does to its own. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Egan </em>v. <em>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 809, 818-819 [157 Cal.Rptr. 482, 598 P.2d 452].) One court has observed that \u201cthe ultimate test of liability in the first party cases is whether the refusal to pay policy benefits was <em>unreasonable.\u201d (Austero </em>v. <em>National Cas. Co. </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 1,32 [148 Cal.Rptr. 653]; <em>accord Paulfrey </em>v. <em>Blue Chip Stamps </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 187,192 [197 Cal.Rptr. 501].) Stated another way, \u201cthe conduct of an insurer in rejecting a claim is unreasonable if inconsistent with placing the insured\u2019s interests above those of the insurance company and its stock holders.\u201d <em>(Fleming </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 31, 40 [206 Cal.Rptr. 313].) Moreover, \u201cbreach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing involves something beyond breach of the contractual duty itself,\u201d and it has been held that \u201c\u2018[b]ad faith implies unfair dealing rather than mistaken judgment....\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(California Shoppers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 1, 54, 55 [221 Cal.Rptr. 171].) When the alleged bad faith conduct consists of the insurer\u2019s interpretation of its ambiguous policy to exclude coverage, that interpretation is not conclusive evidence of bad faith unless it is \u201cinherently unreasonable.\u201d <em>(Delgado </em>v. <em>Heritage Life Ins. Co. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 262, 277 [203 Cal.Rptr. 672].)  Finally, we recognize that interpretation of the policy is a <em>legal </em>rather than a <em>factual </em>determination. <em>(Nash </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 594, 602 [114 Cal.Rptr. 299].)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Before turning to the specific policy provisions which respondents have interpreted so as to deny coverage, we begin with the general scope of coverage provided under the \u201cPhysical Damage Coverages\u201d in the \u201cinsuring agreements\u201d portion of the policy. Appellants contend that all of the physical damages coverages, \u201cF,\u201d \u201cG\u201d and \u201cH,\u201d begin with reference to an \u201cAll Risk Basis,\u201d which is the broadest possible coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">It t has been held that where the words appear in a policy of aviation insurance, \u201cThe use of the term \u2018all risks\u2019 ordinarily covers every loss that may happen, except by fraudulent acts of the insured, and is not given a restrictive meaning. Miller v. Boston Insurance Co., 420 Pa. 566, 218 A.2d 275 (1966) and Fidelity Southern Fire Insurance Co. v. Crow, Tex.Civ.App., 390 S.W.2d 788 (1965).\u201d <em>(Bryant </em>v. <em>Continental Insurance Company </em>(1970) 2 Wn.App. 37 [466 P.2d 201,202].)  Application of such a broad interpretation here finds support in one of the general rules governing interpretation of insurance policies in this state: \u201c\u2018Whereas coverage clauses are interpreted broadly so as to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured ..., exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly against the insurer____\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 808 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764]; <em>White </em>v. <em>Western Title Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 870, 881 [221 Cal.Rptr. 509, 710 P.2d 309].)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>This rule applies with equal force to the policy definition of the words \u201cPleasure and Business,\u201d which appear on the \u201cDeclarations\u201d page of the policy to describe the permitted uses of the aircraft, and hence to describe coverage, under the policy. An examination of the policy definition of \u201cPleasure and Business,\u201d quoted previously, reveals not only a definition of the terms to include \u201cpersonal and pleasure uses\u201d but an <em>express exclusion, </em>\u201cexcluding any operation for hire or reward.\u201d Thus, contrary to respondents\u2019 assertions, we find that to the extent that the definition of \u201cPleasure and Business\u201d expressly excludes \u201cany operation for hire or reward,\u201d that exclusionary language must be narrowly construed so as <em>not </em>to mean \u201crental to others,\u201d which appears in the definitions of other uses under the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In light of this interpretation and the fact that respondents knew and expressly noted on the declarations page of the policy that appellants\u2019 coinsured, Allender, was a \u201clessee\u201d of the aircraft from appellant s as \u201clessor,\u201d respondents could not reasonably have denied coverage on the basis that a lease or sublease of the aircraft to another at the time of its loss was not a permitted \u201cPleasure and Business\u201d use under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Another ground of respondents\u2019 denial of coverage was that appellants failed to establish \u201cphysical damage\u201d or \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the aircraft within the meaning of the \u201cPhysical Damages Coverages.\u201d Despite the fact that \u201cdisappearance\u201d as used in coverage claims \u201cF\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201cmissing and not reported for sixty days after commencing a flight,\u201d appellants contend that they did not bear the burden of showing that the aircraft commenced a flight immediately before vanishing but instead only had to show \u201cthat the aircraft disappeared.\u201d Appellants\u2019 contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">As respondents correctly assert, \u201cIn the absence of physical damage or theft, no recovery under Coverage F is possible unless a \u2018disappearance\u2019 of the aircraft can be demonstrated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Unable to show that a theft actually occurred\u2014or even that someone wrongfully took possession\u2014appellants essentially urge an interpretation of \u201cdisappearance\u201d that is synonymous with a mere inability to locate the aircraft. Such an interpretation would be in clear derogation of an express policy definition of \u201cdisappearance,\u201d a term used in an insuring clause rather than in an exclusionary clause. Additionally, in a similar case, where an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>insuring clause in an aviation policy purported to cover \u201cAll Risks While In Motion\u201d and contained language similar to that in appellants\u2019 policy here, the court held that, \u201cIn the absence of proof of takeoff or that the plane was in motion, plaintiff simply failed to prove a risk within the coverage stated above. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Compass Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Palm Beach Lakes, etc. </em>(Fla. App. 1981) 399 So.2d 517, 518.) Application of this interpretation is particularly compelling here because the aircraft was reported missing within a few weeks after the policy was procured, and appellants apparently made no showing of what efforts, if any, they undertook on their own to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the mysterious disappearance of a plane they had recently purchased for almost a quarter of a million dollars and immediately leased and then subleased to people already under investigation for both drug smuggling and similar mysterious disappearances of other aircraft, including at least two owned by Baja Cortez and leased to Allender and Boone through the same broker, Peacock. Appellants\u2019 immediate submission of their claim to respondents under these circumstances could be said to reasonably raise respondents\u2019 eyebrows in considering the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Accordingly, we find that appellants\u2019 failure to sustain their burden of producing evidence of their aircraft\u2019s \u201cdisappearance\u201d so as to invoke coverage under the policy entitled respondents reasonably to deny coverage under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Alternatively, appellants contend that coverage clauses \u201cG\u201d and \u201cH\u201d applied even if \u201cF,\u201d with its \u201cdisappearance\u201d requirement, did not. However, the \u201cDeclarations\u201d page of the policy, under an item identified as \u201cDescription of Aircraft and Physical Damage Coverage hereinunder,\u201d lists coverage \u201cF\u201d as the only physical damage coverage for which appellants contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Finally, appellants contend that the broad reading that must be accorded their \u201call risk\u201d policy under established rules of interpretation requires it to be interpreted so as to provide coverage for theft even though an express exclusion, \u201c6(a),\u201d would omit coverage for conversion or secretion of the aircraft by one in possession under a lease, such as Allender and Boone. They argue in support of this contention that, first, Allender and Boone intended to steal their aircraft at the time the lease was executed, thereby rendering the lease null and void and, second, any ambiguity between a covered \u201ctheft\u201d and an excluded \u201cconversion\u201d or \u201csecretion\u201d must be resolved in favor of coverage under established rules of policy interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Aside from the absence of any evidence to show Allender\u2019s and Boone\u2019s intent to steal, appellants\u2019 contention begs the preliminary question of what evidence they had that a theft had occurred. As the court in <em>Compass Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Palm Beach Lakes, etc., supra, </em>399 So.2d at page 518, expressed it, \u201cHere, at best, plaintiff proved that the whereabouts of the plane were unknown,\u201d which amounted to a failure to prove a risk within the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Therefore, under the circumstances presented here, we must conclude that appellants failed to produce any evidence that respondents\u2019 denial of coverage was unreasonable. There having been presented no other evidence of \u201cbad faith\u201d by the insurer respondents in denying appellants\u2019 claim, we have determined that summary judgment in respondents\u2019 favor was proper here.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\n<em>Denial of Leave to File Amended Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In their last contention, appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied them leave to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u201cC.C.P. 473 authorizes the trial court, in its \u2018discretion,\u2019 to allow amendments \u2018in furtherance of justice.\u2019 The policy of great liberality in permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding was declared at an early date and has been repeatedly restated. [Citations.]... [\u00b6]... [\u00b6]  When an order granting or denying leave to amend is attacked <em>on appeal, </em>an additional policy enters into the reviewing court\u2019s determination: The discretion of the trial court should be upheld unless clearly abused____\u201d (5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Pleading, \u00a7 1121, pp. 537-538.) \u201cIf the lower court denies leave to amend, the conflict of policies ... is often resolved in favor of the privilege of amending, and reversals are common where the appellant makes a reasonable showing of prejudice from the ruling. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 540.)  However, \u201cIt is of course proper to deny leave when the proposed amendment or amended pleading is <em>insufficient to state a cause of action or defense. </em>[Citations.] [\u00b6] Likewise, an amendment which <em>contradicts an admission in the original pleading </em>will ordinarily not be allowed unless a showing is made of mistake or other excuse for changing the allegations of fact. [Citations.] [\u00b6] Similarly, denial of leave may be upheld where the amendment <em>contradicts a </em>stipulation____\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 541.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">In their proposed first amended complaint, appellants alleged, in addition to the four causes of action alleged in their original complaint, a fifth cause of action for negligence which incorporated almost all of the allegations of the first cause of action and added the following: \u201c 19. Defendants negligently failed to disclose to plaintiffs the facts alleged in paragraph 9 (A) herein and negligently sold, issued and delivered to plaintiffs the policy of insurance described herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">Paragraph 9 of the proposed amended complaint, which was incorporated by reference into the new cause of action, alleged in subparagraph A.: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u201cDefendants at all material times and specifically on and before July 29, 1980, when they sold the policy to plaintiffs, on August 22, 1980, when they issued the policy to plaintiffs, in early September, 1980, when they delivered the policy to plaintiffs, on January 7,1981, and thereafter, when they denied and continued to deny plaintiffs\u2019 claims for policy benefits, knew and had full knowledge of the following facts: [\u00b6] A. That plaintiffs\u2019 aircraft was to be delivered to and used by one Bruce Allender, the purported lessee of the aircraft, and also named by defendants as an insured on plaintiffs\u2019 policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The remaining subparagraphs of paragraph 9 describe the suspicious facts linking Allender and Boone to an international drug smuggling ring which stole private aircraft for use in its smuggling operations as were previously recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In their opening brief, appellants explain their proximate cause theory in the proposed negligence cause of action as follows: \u201cHad defendants not issued the binder or policy naming Allender as an insured, and told plaintiffs the reasons why, plaintiffs would never have delivered, and lost, their aircraft to a thief.\u201d However, earlier in their brief appellants recite facts from the record which contradict this theory: <em>\u201cOn August 1, 1980, Baja Cortez Airlines, </em>plaintiffs\u2019 lessee, <em>entered into the purported lease ... with Allender, and delivered possession of the aircraft to </em>him____[\u00b6] Thereafter, <em>on August 5, 1980, defendants issued a policy insuring plaintiffs\u2019 aircraft </em>effective July 29, 1980 ____The named insureds were the same as on the binder, \u2018Paul and Dorothy Congleton (Lessor) and Bruce Allender (Lessee).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Thus, the evidence appellants presented in opposition to the summary judgment motion showed that they could not have relied on respondents\u2019 issuance of the policy to Allender as a named insured in deciding whether they would lease their aircraft to Baja Cortez which, in turn, would sublease it to Allender; Baja Cortez had already subleased the aircraft to Allender and delivered possession to Boone when respondents issued the policy. Appellants also could not reasonably have relied on the binder of temporary insurance because it was provided only by the local insurance agent, Tassio, and expressly advised that it was \u201ca temporary Insurance Contract to serve as evidence of Insurance pending: Issuance and Delivery of a Policy,\u201d and was subject to cancellation by the insurer. Clearly, a binder signed by an agent of the insurer, though evidence of temporary insurance, cannot serve as evidence of the <em>insurability </em>of a named insured where the issuing company has not yet had any opportunity to conduct an investigation. By not waiting for issuance of the actual policy before leasing their aircraft to Baja Cortez and then subleasing and delivering possession to Allender and Boone, appellants demonstrated their intent to deal with Allender and Boone regardless of the results of any investigation or information provided by respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Appellants further contend that the trial court should have allowed the amended pleading because it alleged respondents waived and/or were estopped to assert various policy defenses as a result of their previous knowledge concerning the alleged unlawful conduct of Allender and Boone. As our previous discussion reflects, we need not and therefore do not reach any of respondents\u2019 policy defenses in light of appellants\u2019 preliminary failure to show that their claim was within the policy coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants leave to file their proposed first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Kingsley, Acting P.
