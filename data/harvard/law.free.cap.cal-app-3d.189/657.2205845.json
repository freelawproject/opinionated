They brought a series of actions against the superintendent of CMF, the director of the Department, and others, culminating with this one seeking declaratory relief and a permanent injunction against enforcement of the regulations. On appeal from the order denying a preliminary injunction (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (f); 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 98, p. 117), they contend that the regulations in question are inconsistent with the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Loggins </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 907 [187 Cal.Rptr. 575, 654 P.2d 758] (hereafter Bailey), interpreting Penal Code section 2600,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the First Amendment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>United States Constitution, <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 396 [40 L.Ed.2d 224, 94 S.Ct. 1800], and article I, section 2 of the California Constitution. Specifically, they claim that the majority of the regulations are over-broad, vague, and susceptible to official abuse and arbitrary and personal application. They also contend that the regulations must be enjoined in their entirety because they are a comprehensive, coordinated set with no sever-ability clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We disagree with appellants\u2019 narrow reading of <em>Bailey </em>and uphold the regulations as being within the Department\u2019s power to limit the exercise of prisoners\u2019 rights for purposes of prison security, protection of the public, and valid penological objectives. Accordingly, we affirm the order denying preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">This appeal is the latest chapter in a series of disputes over prison newspapers that began at least a decade ago. The <em>Bailey </em>decision had its origins in 1976, when two articles written by a Soledad inmate for that prison\u2019s newspaper were rejected. The author pursued grievance procedures and asked that guidelines governing newspaper content be established. <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 911.) The Department complied with the latter request, but then rejected the articles under the newly established regulations. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 911-912.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Those regulations, as read by the <em>Bailey </em>court, \u201cprovided generally that the newspaper should conform to good journalistic standards, be designed to appeal to all inmates, and avoid material offensive to racial, religious, or political groups.... [T]he guidelines prohibited the use of the newspaper to attack administration rules or policy, or to assert any grievance. They also banned the assumption of an editorial position on pending legislation, the attempt to elect or defeat any official, or an attack upon existing governmental policy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 912.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Bailey, as editor of the paper, and others, brought a mandamus action seeking to compel publication of the two articles, the establishment of narrower regulations, and the establishment of an expeditious review procedure. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 910, 912.) During trial the Department published new and more complete regulations which incorporated the former provisions without change. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 912.) The trial court issued the writ, finding the regulations overbroad and the appeal procedure inadequate. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 913-914.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Pending appeal and review in the appellate courts, the Department changed its regulations twice more, ultimately returning to ones similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>those in effect at the time of trial. Meanwhile the Department withdrew its objections to publication of the two articles, but controversy remained regarding validity of the regulations. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 914.) The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order mandating enactment of new regulations and requiring that a speedy method of review be established. It reversed that portion of the order directing enactment of regulations which would permit prison authorities to exercise only a very limited censorship. <em>{Bailey, supra, </em>32 Cal. 3d at p. 922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Not long after <em>Bailey </em>was decided, Charles (EZ) Williams, editor of the San Quentin News, initiated a habeas corpus proceeding in Marin County alleging that the departmental guidelines issued on January 13, 1983, in response to <em>Bailey </em>were constitutionally invalid on their face. <em>(In re Williams </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 600, 602-603 [205 Cal.Rptr. 903] [hereafter <em>Williams).) </em>The superior court ordered three provisions modified or deleted and rejected Williams\u2019s numerous other attacks. The Department revised the regulations on August 11, 1983, to comply with the Marin County Superior Court order. When the Court of Appeal denied a writ petition challenging the revised regulations, the Supreme Court issued an order to show cause returnable before the Court of Appeal, directing the Department to show how its revised guidelines conformed to the standards set forth in <em>Bailey. (Williams, supra, </em>at pp. 603-605.) Division Four of this court concluded that the Department met that burden and denied the writ, over a dissent by Acting Presiding Justice Poch\u00e9. The Supreme Court denied hearing. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 612, 616.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The controversy underlying the action in the case at bench, which was filed in March 1981, grew out of censorship disputes beginning in 1980. It has been taken to the Solano County Superior Court on several occasions. The regulations upheld in <em>Williams, </em>i.e., the January 1983 regulations as revised, are also the subject of this appeal, having been upheld by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The traditional approach, which considered prisoners to be \u201ccivilly dead,\u201d has been reversed in the last two decades by statutory enactment and judicial interpretation. (See generally, 2 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1985 supp.) Punishment for Crime, \u00a7 917, pp. 322-326; Comment, <em>Constitutional Rights in Prison: The Standard of Review in California </em>(1985) 16 Pacific L.J. 10770-Section 2600 now provides: \u201cA person sentenced to imprisonment in a state prison may, during any such period of confinement, be deprived of such rights, and only such rights, as is necessary in order to provide for the reasonable security of the institution in which he [or she] is confined and for the reasonable protection of the public.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>It was in light of this provision, and those of the United States and California Constitutions, that the Supreme Court was called upon to assess the Department\u2019s regulations in <em>Bailey. </em>And it was in light of the <em>Bailey </em>decision that Division Four of this court in <em>Williams </em>was required to determine the validity of the revised regulations before it and before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The <em>Williams </em>majority (Haugner, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> with Panelli, J., cone.) characterized the <em>Bailey </em>holdings as follows: \u201c... the state may censor newspapers in order to provide for the reasonable security of the institution and the reasonable protection of the public. It may also exercise control over the content of the newspaper to serve valid penological objectives, but censorship may not go beyond that which is necessary to achieve a legitimate penological objective. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 607.) The majority tested the regulations against this standard and concluded: \u201c... the regulations conform to the standards set forth in <em>Bailey </em>for a limited scope publication which functions as a public forum.... [T]he department of corrections may exercise control over the newspaper as set forth in the regulations and as discussed above on the grounds that the censorship provides for the reasonable security of the institution as well as reasonable protection of the public and serves valid penological objectives. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Justice Poch\u00e9 dissented, stating that the majority, which did not address his point, had analyzed the <em>Bailey </em>holding incorrectly. Although we do not adopt Justice Poch\u00e9\u2019s view in its entirety, and ultimately we agree with the result reached by the <em>Williams </em>majority, the diversity of opinions in <em>Bailey </em>has led to confusion (see Comment, <em>First Amendment Rights of Prisoners: Freedom of the Prison Press </em>(1984) 18 U.S.F. L.Rev. 599), on which Justice Poch\u00e9\u2019s opinion sheds some light. Accordingly, we set out a portion of Justice Poch\u00e9\u2019s dissent, with appropriate additions and deletions as indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\"><em>\u201cBailey </em>v. <em>Loggins </em>consists of five separate opinions: (1) a lead opinion authored by Justice Broussard concurred in by Justice Reynoso; (2) a separate concurring opinion by Justice Newman; (3) a separate concurring opinion by Chief Justice Bird; (4) a dissenting opinion by Justice Richardson concurred in by Justice Mosk; and (5) a dissenting opinion by Justice Kaus.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u201cIn the lead opinion, Justices Broussard and Reynoso posit that prisoners enjoy some measure of press freedom rights under both the United States and the California Constitutions. <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Loggins, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 917-920.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) The extent of this protection is not coextensive with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>accorded to private, noninstitutionalized publishers. Thus, the Department of Corrections may \u2018censor [prison]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> newspapers in order to provide for the reasonable security of the institution and the reasonable protection of the public____\u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2600)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, may \u2018exercise control over the content of the newspaper to serve valid penological objectives [citing federal decisions]____\u2019, \u2018can insist on standards of good journalism ...\u2019 and \u2018can also insist that the newspaper report announcements and events of interest to its readers.\u2019 <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Loggins, supra', </em>at p. 920 and fn. 9.) Justices Broussard and Reynoso concluded that regulations concerning prison newspapers \u2018must be framed and applied uniformly with due regard for constitutionally protected rights of free expression, and in accord with the standards of... Penal Code section 2600\u2019 and the traditional \u2018less restrictive\u2019 means test for evaluating regulation of such rights. <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Loggins, supra, </em>at pp. 920-921 and fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u201cThe sole announced purpose of the Chief Justice\u2019s concurring opinion was to emphasize that the Department of Corrections \u2018may not reissue regulations substantially similar to those which have been presented to this court,\u2019 and that \u2018the regulations issued hereafter must comport with the First Amendment principles applicable to state publications generally (except as provided by Pen. Code, \u00a7 2600).\u2019 <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Loggins, supra, </em>32 Cal. 3d at p. 923 (conc. opn. of Bird, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u201cThus at least three members of the court [appear to] agree that the regulations governing prison newspapers \u2018must comport with the First Amendment principles applicable to state publications generally (except as provided by Pen. Code, \u00a7 2600).\u2019 But the agreement of three justices of a seven-member tribunal is not sufficient to establish \u2018standards.\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\u201cAs [we] read the concurring opinion of Justice Newman, it supplies sufficient agreement with a portion of the language [of] the lead opinion (when read in conjunction with the concurring opinion of the Chief Justice) so that it can be said, with some assurance, that there are \u2018standards set forth in <em>Bailey </em>v. Loggins.\u2019 In other words, a majority of the court agrees on a rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201cJustice Newman does not rely on the federal Constitution, but solely on the California Constitution, and in so doing agrees with the lead opinion to the extent that section 2 of article I of the California Constitution is applicable. (See <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Loggins, supra, </em>at p. 923 (conc. opn. of Newman, J.).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus the \u2018standards\u2019 of <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Loggins </em>to the extent they are of constitutional origin, are limited to the California Constitution and only to section 2 of article I thereof.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u201c[Although he concurs in the judgment,] Justice Newman steps away from a portion of the lead opinion\u2019s rationale. He does \u2018not agree that Penal Code section 2600 permits any restraints or abridgements of speech, press, and petition rights that can be justified only by referring to \u201cgood\u201d journalistic standards or \u201cvalid\u201d penological objectives.\u2019 <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Loggins, supra, </em>at p. 923 (conc. opn. of Newman, J.).) Instead, in his view the Legislature in section 2600 has required that those standards and objectives which justify restraints or abridgements of speech, press and petition rights \u2018be based on either security or public protection.\u2019 He [states that he] reads the lead opinion as holding that \u2018except when necessary to provide for reasonable security or reasonable public protection, the Department of Corrections no longer may concretize clauses like those of regulation 723 that are identified in footnote 10 of the opinion.\u2019 [Arguably, o]nly on the basis of such an interpretation of the holding of the lead opinion does he concur. (Ibid.)\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at pp. 613-614 (dis. opn. of Poch\u00e9, Acting P. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">This ends the portion of Justice Poch\u00e9\u2019s dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">From this analysis, Justice Poch\u00e9 concludes that a \u201cmajority\u201d in <em>Bailey </em>permits restraints on freedom of press only where necessary for prison security and public safety, and not for valid penological objectives. He therefore disagrees with the <em>Williams </em>majority, which upholds regulations based on the latter criterion. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 615 (dis. opn. of Poch\u00e9, Acting P. J.).) In our view, however, Justice Newman\u2019s comments place him in a minority of one, and we must look elsewhere to find the true \u201cmajority\u201d in <em>Bailey, </em>namely, to the dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Justice Richardson, with whom Justice Mosk concurred, began his dissent with the proposition that \u201cinmates have neither a constitutional nor statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tory right to publish their articles in [a prison] newspaper...\u201d and that therefore prison authorities must be given broad discretion to select and edit articles. <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 923 (dis. opn. of Richardson, J.).) He questioned the lead opinion\u2019s reliance on cases holding that once a governmental entity establishes a \u201cpublic forum,\u201d it cannot selectively ban expressions of which it disapproves. To demonstrate the flaw in this argument, Justice Richardson quoted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statement that a \u201c \u2018prison is most emphatically not a \u201cpublic forum\u201d \u2019 <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Union </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 119,136 [53 L.Ed.2d 629,645,97 S.Ct. 2532])____\u201d <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d atp. 924 (dis. opn. of Richardson, J.).) He argued further that section 2600 was intended to preserve preexisting rights, not to create new ones. \u201cIt bears emphasis that prior to their confinement, inmates as law-abiding private citizens enjoyed no right of publication on demand, or freedom from editorial censorship.... I cannot fairly conclude that a person\u2019s constitutional rights are <em>enlarged </em>by the sole fact of his [or her] felony conviction or confinement in prison.\u201d <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>at p. 926 (dis. opn. of Richardson, J.), original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Justice Richardson concluded: \u201cA prison newspaper may serve many valid and diverse purposes such as educating inmates, promoting prison morale, encouraging rehabilitation, lessening tensions, improving inmate-guard relations, recognizing literary merit, and providing a balanced reading diet. But the determination of the goals to be served and the means for implementing them is a matter which should be entrusted to the sound discretion of the prison administrators.\u201d <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 927 (dis. opn. of Richardson, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Justice Kaus wrote a dissent with a different focus, but agreed with Justices Richardson and Mosk that the lead opinion\u2019s premise finding the paper in question a public forum was incorrect. The thrust of his opinion was that the lead writers were in effect attempting to tell prison officials what kind of newspaper they were to permit and then to tell them they were not doing it right. <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 928, 929 (dis. opn. of Kaus, J.).) Instead, he said, the regulations permitted the establishment of a \u201chouse organ,\u201d which everyone agreed was subject to control by prison authorities and which was \u201ca pedagogical effort to which the First Amendment is as relevant as the Clayton Act to a game of Monopoly.\u201d <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>at p. 930 (dis. opn. of Kaus, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Thus, three justices (Richardson, J., Mosk, J., and Kaus, J.) support the broadest possible discretion in prison authorities to control and censor the content of a prison newspaper, and at least two others (Broussard, J., and Reynoso, J.) support the next broadest view, permitting control and censorship based on the needs for prison security, public safety, and penological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>objectives. There can be no doubt which view the \u201cdissenters\u201d would follow, given the choice between that of the lead opinion and that of Justice Newman (which would permit only those limitations based on prison security and public safety). Therefore, in our view, at least five justices interpret the constitutional and statutory law as permitting broad discretionary control and censorship of prison newspapers by prison authorities based on their perceived need for prison security, public safety, and valid penological purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We note that the critics of the \u201cvalid penological objectives\u201d justification for censorship have failed to consider the meaning of the term.  \u201cPenology,\u201d the root of the word \u201cpenological,\u201d is a branch of criminology dealing with prison management and treatment of offenders, especially with regard to their rehabilitation. (Webster\u2019s New Intemat. Diet. (3d ed. 1970) p. 1671.) A major purpose of rehabilitation is protection of the public. <em>(Pell </em>v. <em>Procunier </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 817, 823 [\u201c[SJince most offenders will eventually return to society, another paramount objective of the corrections system is the rehabilitation of those committed to its custody.\u201d].) Therefore, <em>Bailey </em>and the many decisions which have permitted censorship for \u201cvalid penological objectives\u201d have in effect simply been stating in another way that censorship is permissible to protect the public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Similarly, a prisoner who is rehabilitated will be less likely than others to be a discipline problem while he or she remains incarcerated. It follows that censorship for \u201cpenological objectives\u201d is, in effect, censorship for prison security, and that permitting it is not inconsistent with the provisions of section 2600. (See generally, <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>416 U.S. 396; <em>Pell </em>v. <em>Procunier, supra, </em>417 U.S. at pp. 822-823 [41 L.Ed.2d at pp. 501-502]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Union </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 119, 125, 129, 134 [53 L.Ed.2d 629, 638, 640-641, 644, 97 S.Ct. 2532]; <em>Pittman </em>v. <em>Hutto </em>(4th Cir. 1979) 594 F.2d 407, 410-411; but see Comment, <em>First Amendment Rights of Prisoners: Freedom of the Prison Press, supra, </em>18 U.S.F. L.Rev. 599.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We turn to the appropriate disposition of the case at bench, the question before us being one of law\u2014whether the regulations in question are valid in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey. </em>(See <em>Eastern Columbia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waldman </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 268, 273 [181 P.2d 865]; <em>Williams, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 607.) We must stress that the question is one which we cannot and should not attempt to resolve from an ivory tower.  \u201cBecause the realities of running a penal institution are complex and difficult, [the courts] have ... recognized the wide-ranging deference to be accorded the decisions of prison administrators.\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Union, supra, </em>433 U.S. at p. 126 [53 L.Ed.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>pp. 638-639].) Judges are not expert in the manner in which the inmate population might react to various printed stimuli. \u201c[I]n all such matters, the courts give deference to determinations by prison officials that restrictions are essential to protect a legitimate state interest. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><em>The </em>Regulations<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Appellants attack every aspect of the regulations (\u00a7\u00a7 720-728 of the administrative manual of the Department), from section 721 stating the purposes of prison newspapers to section 728 dealing with subscriptions and circulation. They aptly describe section 723, subdivision (e), of the regulations as being the \u201cKey Censorship Provision.\u201d It provides: \u201c(e) No inflammatory material will be published which might threaten institution safety or security. Material offensive to any race, gender, nationality, religious faith or similar group is prohibited. Lewd, obscene, pornographic, sexually suggestive, libelous or defamatory material is prohibited. Use of profane or vulgar terminology is prohibited. Reports and articles will not attack any individual or serve as a vehicle for individual inmate complaints, as a substitute for the departmental inmate appeal procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Appellants cite <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>416 U.S. at page 415 [40 L.Ed.2d at p. 241], as explicitly rejecting censorship standards using the words \u201cinflammatory\u201d or \u201cdefamatory.\u201d Although the lead opinion in <em>Bailey </em>cited that case with approval <em>(Bailey, supra, </em>32 Cal. 3d at p. 920), limitation of material which, because of its inflammatory nature, might threaten prison security is well within the <em>Bailey </em>holding. Use of the word \u201coffensive\u201d standing alone might arguably be vague, but in this context it means offensive in a manner as to disrupt intergroup peace and thereby threaten prison security. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 609.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Appellants argue that the terms \u201cvulgar\u201d and \u201cattack\u201d provide the censor with an opportunity to vent personal prejudices, but we find these standards in keeping with valid penological objectives, including training and education in appropriate journalistic standards and techniques. The same is true of the mandate of section 723, subdivision (a), that publications be produced in accord with the \u201chighest journalistic standards.\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at p. 608.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Appellants characterize section 723, subdivision (b), as a frontal attack on <em>Bailey. </em>On the contrary, it \u201cdefines the newspaper as one of limited purpose, a definition recognized, and approved, by the <em>Bailey </em>court.

Prisons, by definition, are closed societies populated by individuals who have demonstrated their inability, or refusal, to conform their conduct to the norms demanded by a civilized society. Of necessity, rules far different from those imposed on society at large must prevail within prison walls. The ... courts ... are not equipped by experience or otherwise to \u2018second guess\u2019 the decisions of state legislatures and administrators in this sensitive area except in the most extraordinary circumstances. This ... does not imply that a prisoner is stripped of all constitutional protection as he [or she] passes through the prison\u2019s gates.... Rather, it \u2018reflects no more than a healthy sense of realism\u2019 on our part to understand that needed reforms in the area of prison administration must come, not from the ... courts, but from those with the most expertise in this field\u2014prison administrators themselves. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The regulations under consideration constitute a reasonable attempt on the part of the Department to implement a prison newspaper program to enhance the rehabilitation of inmates through training and education which may offer them hope, but at least will occupy their time in a constructive manner\u2014clearly a valid penological objective which will contribute to both the security of the institution and the protection of society.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Merrill, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">White, P.
