There is no dispute on the facts and the legal determination turned on interpretation and application of section 2326 of the California Uniform Commercial Code. In our view, the trial court incorrectly interpreted the section, and so the order appealed from will be reversed with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-10\">Operational Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-11\">In an effort to satisfy its judgment against defendants who do business as Unique Motor Cars, Ltd., plaintiff instructed the Riverside County Marshal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1643\">*1643</page-number>to seize and levy upon a certain new 1985 Mercedes Benz automobile, carrying dealer plates and in the possession of defendants. After the levy, Klaus Meininger and Autohaus Imports, Inc. (third party claimants) filed their third party claim with the marshal, and in due course the matter came before the trial court for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">According to the undisputed facts, as disclosed by the record, defendants were in physical possession of the seized automobile. Although third party claimants insisted that they owned a hidden security interest in the automobile, plaintiff was unaware of such interest; moreover, third party claimants had never filed a financing statement asserting a security interest in this automobile. Based solely on these facts, the trial court ruled in favor of third party claimants, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">The sole issue presented on appeal calls for interpretation of section 2326 of the California Uniform Commercial Code, more particularly subdivisions (2) and (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1644\">*1644</page-number>Before the introduction of the Uniform Commercial Code, even though the interest of a consignor was commonly viewed as a \u201csecret lien against creditors ... as harmful as an unfiled chattel mortgage or conditional sale,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a consignor could nevertheless retrieve the consigned goods in a contest with the consignee\u2019s creditors. The draftsmen of the Uniform Commercial Code effectively did away with the \u201csecret lien\u201d by providing, where a consignment be intended for security, that the consignor must file a financing statement under article IX of the Uniform Commercial Code. The drafters also provided that <em>all goods on </em>consignment\u2014whether or not so placed to \u201csecure\u201d the <em>consignor\u2014are subject to the claims of the consignee\u2019s creditors if the consignor fails to comply with the notice requirements of article II </em>of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">In the case here, the third party claimants neither filed a financing statement under article IX nor complied with the notice requirements of article II.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> California Uniform Commercial Code section 2326, subdivision (2) provides in pertinent part: \u201c... <em>goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer\u2019s possession.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">Thus, the sole question in determining the respective rights of plaintiff and third party claimants is whether the automobile was held by the judgment debtor as a \u201csale or return\u201d item.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">Section 2326, subdivision (3) defines when goods are deemed held for \u201csale or return,\u201d stating that: \u201c <em>Where goods are delivered to a person for sale and the person maintains a place of business at which he or she deals in goods of the kind involved, under a name other than the name of the person making delivery, then with respect to claims of creditors of the person conducting the business the goods are deemed to be on sale or return. </em>The provisions of this subdivision are applicable even though an agreement purports to reserve title to the person making delivery until payment or resale or it uses such words as \u2018on consignment\u2019 or \u2018on memorandum\u2019.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">It is undisputed that judgment debtors, Herbert Haas and Patricia Haas, were maintaining a business selling cars under the name Unique Motor Cars, Ltd. They do not do business under the names Autohaus Imports, Inc., Klaus Meininger, or any other name even related to that of the third party claimants. Thus, with reference to creditors\u2019 claims against property held by Herbert and Patricia Haas and Unique Motor Cars, Ltd., the code creates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1645\">*1645</page-number>a presumption<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that those automobiles are held on a \u201csale or return\u201d basis. The California comment to the the cited section, subdivision 3, states: \u201c <em>\u2018This rule applies without regard to the agreement made between the wholesaler and retailer relative to retention of title in the wholesaler. </em>The wholesaler can protect himself only by complying with the filing provisions of Chapter [Division] 9 of the Code or (in States which have \u201csign statutes\u201d, which California does not) by putting up signs indicating that the goods are on consignment. This subsection [subdivision] relieves the court of the onerous task of determining whether, despite words of \u201cconsignment\u201d in the agreement, the contract was in reality one of sale, thus making the goods available to the retailer\u2019s creditors.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">In other words, the agreement between the consignor and consignee cannot operate to grant the consignor a unpublicized, nonpossessory lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">In an attempt to avoid the obvious applicability of California Uniform Commercial Code section 2326, third party claimants have cited <em>Allgeier </em>v. <em>Campisi </em>(1968) 117 Ga.App. 105 [159 S.E.2d 458], in support of their argument that the seized automobile was not delivered to defendants \u201cfor sale\u201d but was only delivered to enable defendants to \u201clook for buyers.\u201d This argument misconstrues <em>Allgeier </em>and California Uniform Commercial Code section 2326. In <em>Allgeier </em>the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\"><em>\u201cWhere, </em>as in the present case, <em>an individual owner of an automobile delivers it to an automobile dealer </em>for the purpose of having said dealer secure offers for the purchase thereof, and to sell the same upon approval of an offer by the individual owner, the automobile dealer to receive a commission of a set sum regardless of the sale price, such transaction is not a \u2018sale or return\u2019 transaction between a buyer and a seller within the meaning of Georgia Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 109A-2-326, so as to make said automobile subject to levy and sale upon executions obtained against the automobile dealer by creditors of the dealer.\u201d (159 S.E.2d at p. 459, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">The sparse 200-word opinion in <em>Allgeier </em>did not elaborate upon the court\u2019s reasoning, but clearly involved distinguishable facts. The opinion emphasized that the automobile was delivered by an individual owner and that the dealer was to receive a set sum regardless of the sales price.  In the case here, third party claimants are commercial dealers in automobiles and the defendants were to receive a commission on the sales price, not a flat fee. In other words, <em>this case involves a commercial supplier </em>of automobiles who should be bound to comply with the California Uniform Commercial Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1646\">*1646</page-number>in the course of operating its business; whereas, the Georgia case merely involved a private individual who was essentially renting lot space to sell his used car. In fact, the California Legislature amended Uniform Commercial Code section 2326 in 1965 by adding subdivision (3)(d) providing for a special exemption relieving noncommercial transactions, which involve used goods, from the burden of compliance with section 2326.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">In any event, the Georgia decision certainly does not stand for the proposition that a consignor\u2019s reservation of authority to approve the sales price entitles the consignor to a secret lien. This would obviously open the door to fraud and would defeat the purposes of section 2326.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">Lack of express authority to conclude a sale does not bar a finding that the transaction between the dealer and his supplier was a sale or return under section 2326, subdivision (3). Another Georgia court, determining the applicability of the <em>Allgeier </em>decision stated: \u201cWe agree that the undisputed facts of this case fall squarely within the provisions of OCGA \u00a7 11-2-326(3). Logan, the owner of the tractor, delivered the tractor to Davis for the purpose of having Davis receive offers to purchase the tractor. The offers were to be approved by Logan, and Davis was to receive a commission for his efforts. Davis was an authorized Massey-Ferguson dealer which dealt in goods of this kind, and operated under a trade name different from that used by Logan____</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\"><em>\u201cAllgeier </em>v. <em>Campisi </em>(1968) 117 Ga.App. 105,159 S.E.2d 458, relied upon by appellant, is not controlling here. \u2018All that case says is that the facts did not qualify the situation as a \u201csale or return\u201d under [OCGA \u00a7 ll-2-326(l)(b)].\u2019In <em>re A &amp; T Kwik-N-Handi, Inc. </em>(M.D. Ga.1973) 13 UCC Rep. 779, 782. The case at bar is concerned with the application of OCGA \u00a7 11-2-326(3), which is much broader in scope than \u00a7 1 l-2-326(l)(b), which was at issue in <em>Allgeier. </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">\u201cThe purpose of OCGA \u00a7 11-2-326(3) is \u2018to protect the creditors of the person in possession of goods (the dealer) who would have a right to assume the goods were the property of the dealer [Davis]. The real owner [Logan] can protect [itself] by showing the creditor ... of the dealer had no right to assume such ownership. This can be done under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code by showing (a) compliance with a relevant sign law, (b) that the dealer is known by his creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others, or (c) by compliance with the filing provisions of Article 9 (Secured Transactions) of the Code.\u2019 [Citations.] In the case at bar, Logan failed to take any of the statutorily prescribed protective steps.\u201d <em>(Logan Paving </em>v. <em>Massey-Ferguson Credit Corp. </em>(1984) 172 Ga.App. 368 [323 S.E.2d 259, 260-261.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1647\">*1647</page-number>The third party claimants have argued that a judgment creditor here is not a creditor who \u201cextended credit\u201d to defendants and that therefore the statute is inapplicable. However, there is no support for such an interpretation, and the express language of the code is squarely to the contrary. California Uniform Commercial Code section 1201, subdivision (12) defines the term \u201ccreditor\u201d to include \u201c... a general creditor, a secured creditor, a lien creditor, and any representative of creditors ....\u201d California Code Annotation 12 states that this definition of the term \u201ccreditor\u201d is intended to include \u201call classes of creditors.\u201d Therefore, to invoke the statute,it makes no difference how the plaintiff became a creditor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">Moreover, in the case here, plaintiff actually became a creditor of the defendants by delivering a downpayment of $9,000 to purchase a car. In delivering this downpayment, plaintiff relied on the representation of defendants that defendants purchased the cars themselves from Europe on a cash basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">Third-party claimants seem to be suggesting that creditors must prove detrimental reliance on the lack of a financing statement in order for California Uniform Commercial Code section 2326 to apply. This is clearly not the law. Such a requirement would defeat the intent of the California Uniform Commercial Code to require a party claiming a nonpossessory lien to publicize its security interest. (Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 9302, subd. (1) and 9305; Baird &amp; Jackson, <em>Possession and Ownership: An Examination of the Scope of Article 9 </em>(1983) 35 Stan.L.Rev. 175, 183.)  The statute places the burden on the commercial consignor to do one of two things, either: (1) comply with the filing provisions of the division on secured transactions; or (2) prove that the person conducting the business is generally known by his or her creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others. (Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7 2326, subds. (3)(b) and (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">Thus, it was clearly the intent of the drafters of the code to compel consignors to comply with the filing statutes. <em>The code places the burden on the nonfiling consignor to prove the general public\u2019s state of knowledge regarding the consignee\u2019s business. There is no requirement that individual creditors must prove detrimental reliance in extending credit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">Placing the risk on the first secured party is sensible because it creates an incentive for that creditor to make reliable information accessible to others. (See Dunham, <em>Inventor and Accounts Receivable Financing </em>(1949) 62 Harv.L.Rev. 588, 612.) On the other hand, requiring creditors to prove that they detrimentally relied on the consignor\u2019s failure to file would create great uncertainty in commercial transactions, opening up every claim to litigation and defeating the inducement to file financing statements. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1648\">*1648</page-number>Based upon the foregoing, we hold that third party claimants failed to meet the statutory burden devolving upon them, and the trial court incorrectly ruled in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">The order appealed from is reversed, and the trial court in No. Indio 43812 is directed to vacate paragraph 1 of its minute order of March 26,1986, and to enter a new and different order under said paragraph 1 stating that the third party claim is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">Campbell, P.
