Glenn (Glenn) appeals from the judgment entered following a jury trial in which he was convicted of possessing cocaine. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a).) Glenn contends that the People were barred under section 1538.5, subdivision (d) from relitigating a suppression motion they had lost in superior court in a prior action dismissed on the People\u2019s motion pursuant to section 1385. [[/]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\"><em>The Prior Action (No. </em>CR35316)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">The People originally filed a felony complaint (No. CR35316) on October 27, 1994, against Glenn in Ventura County Municipal Court for possession of cocaine. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a).) Glenn was held to answer at a preliminary hearing before Magistrate O\u2019Neill.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Glenn, thereafter, brought a motion in superior court before Judge McGrath to have the cocaine suppressed, (\u00a7 1538.5.) This was the first suppression motion. Judge McGrath granted it. The People moved to dismiss the case pursuant to section 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">\n<em>The Present Action (No. CR38128)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Following dismissal of No. CR35316, the People brought an identical action against Glenn in Ventura County Superior Court (No. CR38128) for possession of cocaine. Glenn filed a second suppression motion to suppress the cocaine in superior court. The parties submitted the motion on the transcript of the first suppression motion heard by Judge McGrath. Judge Campbell denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\n<em>Judge McGrath\u2019s Ruling Granting Glenn\u2019s First Suppression Motion Was Not Binding in the Second Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In <em>Schlick </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 310 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 406, 841 P.2d 926], the California Supreme Court held that the People were bound by a superior court\u2019s ruling in a prior case granting a defendant\u2019s suppression motion where the charges subsequently were dismissed and refiled by the People. The court relied on the language in subdivision (d) of section 1538.5, which provides that if a suppression motion is granted, the property or evidence suppressed shall \u201cnot be admissible against the movant at any trial or other hearing unless further proceedings authorized by this section [or other specified review procedures] are utilized by the people.\u201d (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (d).) The court observed that review procedures available to the People included a timely petition for mandate or prohibition seeking appellate review of the suppression ruling. (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (o).)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">The court also relied on the language then found in subdivision (j) of section 1538.5 to bolster its conclusion that a <em>superior court </em>ruling granting a suppression motion is binding in any later action brought by the People on identical charges. The court stated: \u201cThe Legislature in subdivision (j) made it explicit that suppression rulings <em>by a magistrate </em>at the preliminary hearing could be relitigated following a dismissal and the filing of a new complaint. The Legislature\u2019s failure to include a similar provision qualifying the broad language of section 1538.5, subdivision (d) as applied to suppression rulings <em>by the superior court </em>leads us to conclude the omission was deliberate, and reflects an intention to bar relitigation of those rulings.\u201d <em>(Schlick </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 315, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">The Legislature changed its intention and in 1993 amended section 1538.5, subdivision (j) to include the following language: \u201cIf the case has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>been dismissed pursuant to Section 1385, or if the people dismiss the case on their own motion <em>after the special hearing, </em>the people may file a new complaint or seek an indictment <em>after the special hearing, </em>and the ruling <em>at the special hearing </em>shall not be binding in any subsequent proceeding, except as limited by subdivision (p).\u201d (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (j), italics added.) The term \u201cspecial hearing\u201d is mentioned in subdivision (i) of section 1538.5 and refers to a hearing in superior court to determine the validity of a suppression motion prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The People contend that under the 1993 amendment to subdivision (j), Judge McGrath\u2019s ruling on Glenn\u2019s first suppression motion in superior court was not binding in the second action brought by the People following dismissal of No. CR35316 pursuant to section 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Glenn disagrees. He relies on the text in section 1538.5, subdivision (j) which precedes its reference to \u201cspecial hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Glenn contends that the \u201cspecial hearing\u201d in subdivision (j) relates only to a hearing <em>requested by the People </em>in superior court to determine the validity of a defense suppression motion <em>after a suppression motion already has been granted in the defense\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number><em>favor at the preliminary hearing. </em>Because Glenn never made a suppression motion at the preliminary hearing in the first case, Glenn contends subdivision (j) does not apply, and Judge McGrath\u2019s ruling in the first case <em>was </em>binding in the second case brought by the People pursuant to subdivision (d) of section 1538.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Glenn places too narrow a construction on the phrase \u201cspecial hearing.\u201d First, Glenn ignores the reference to a \u201cspecial hearing\u201d in section 1538.5, subdivision (i). That subdivision provides: \u201cIf the property or evidence obtained relates to a felony offense initiated by complaint and the defendant was held to answer at the preliminary hearing ... the defendant shall have the right to renew or make the motion in the superior court <em>at a special hearing </em>relating to the validity of the search or seizure which shall be heard prior to trial. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (i).) The superior court hearing before Judge McGrath to determine the validity of Glenn\u2019s first suppression motion clearly was such a \u201cspecial hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Under Glenn\u2019s interpretation, moreover, the People could only relitigate a suppression motion where they had previously lost the same motion twice (once at the preliminary hearing and, again, at a later special hearing requested by the People in superior court). He argues that the People could not relitigate a suppression motion where, as here, they had lost the motion only once in superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">This interpretation would lead to absurd results and is inconsistent with the language found in subdivision (p) of section 1538.5 which refers to the People\u2019s right to relitigate a previously lost suppression motion. Subdivision (p), added in 1993, provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf a defendant\u2019s motion to . . . suppress evidence in a felony matter has been granted twice, the people may not file a new complaint ... in order to relitigate the motion or relitigate the matter de novo at a special hearing in the superior court as otherwise provided by subdivision (j), unless the people discover additional evidence relating to the motion that was not reasonably discoverable at the time of the second suppression hearing.\u201d (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (p); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallegos </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 252 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 666], review den. [construing the 1993 amendment to section 1538.5 to permit the prosecution, following the grant of a motion to suppress evidence first made in the superior court, to dismiss the case, refile the charges and oppose a subsequent superior court suppression motion without binding effect of the first ruling].)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Based upon the foregoing, Judge McGrath\u2019s ruling granting Glenn\u2019s first suppression motion was not .binding in the second action brought by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>People. Instead, subdivision (j) of section 1538.5 expressly permitted the People to relitigate the suppression motion following dismissal and refiling of the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">[[/]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Stone (S.

In the alternative, the people may move to reinstate the complaint, or those parts of-the complaint for which the defendant was not held to answer, pursuant to Section 871.5. If the property or evidence relates to a felony offense initiated by complaint and the defendant\u2019s motion for the return or suppression of the property or evidence at the preliminary hearing is granted, and if the defendant is held to answer at the preliminary hearing, the ruling at the preliminary hearing shall be binding upon the people unless, upon notice to the defendant and the court in which the preliminary hearing was held and upon the filing of an information, the people, within 15 days after the preliminary hearing, request in the superior court a special hearing, in which case the validity of the search or seizure shall be relitigated de novo on the basis of the evidence presented at the special hearing, and the defendant shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to a continuance of the special hearing for a period of time up to 30 days. The people may not request relitigation of the motion at a special hearing if the defendant\u2019s motion has been granted twice. If defendant\u2019s motion is granted at a special hearing in the superior court, the people, if they have additional evidence relating to the motion and not presented at the special hearing, shall have the right to show good cause at the trial why the evidence was not presented at the special hearing and why the prior ruling at the special hearing should not be binding, or the people may seek appellate review as provided in subdivision (o), unless the court, prior to the time the review is sought, has dismissed the case pursuant to Section 1385. If the case has been dismissed pursuant to Section 1385, or if the people dismiss the case on their own motion after the special hearing, the people may file a new complaint or seek an indictment after the special hearing, and the ruling at the special hearing shall not be binding in any subsequent proceeding, except as limited by subdivision (P)----\u201d (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (j).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">In <em>Soil </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 872 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 319], the court recently held that the relitigation of a suppression motion must be heard by the same judge who granted the suppression motion if that judge is available.
