For the reasons set forth below, we affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">Barrich Company, Inc. (Barrich) was a real estate developer building two homes in the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles. Brentwood Bank of California (the bank) was the project\u2019s construction lender and the bank\u2019s loans were secured by first trust deeds on both properties. Barrich eventually defaulted on the construction loans and the bank began foreclosure proceedings. In early 1992, Barrich filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the federal bankruptcy court, which stayed the foreclosure pursuant to 11 United States Code section 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">In June 1992, Barrich filed a bankruptcy court motion for permission to incur more debt\u2014a so-called \u201cpriming lien loan\u201d\u2014in order to finish its construction project and thus generate more revenue for itself and its creditors. Such priming loans gain court-ordered priority over any existing encumbrances and are authorized by 11 United States Code section 364(d). The motion was granted in July 1992 over the bank\u2019s strong opposition. The bankruptcy court\u2019s order authorized Barrich to obtain two loans of $165,000 each, both of which would be secured by trust deeds taking priority over the bank\u2019s existing trust deeds. The court ordered that the loan funds be used only to complete the construction project or to pay expenses essential to preserve the assets of Barrich\u2019s bankruptcy estate. No other restrictions on the use or disbursement of the loan proceeds were ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">American Mutual Mortgage, Inc. (AMM), is in the business of making and arranging loans secured by real property. AMM arranged for a group of investors to fund two loans of $165,000 each on the two properties which Barrich sought to develop. Those investors are the plaintiffs and appellants: Peter J. Rosen, M.D., trustee of the Peter J. Rosen, M.D., Inc., a Medical Corporation Profit Sharing Plan; Bear, Steams &amp; Company, Inc., custodian for the William Lamond IRA Rollover Account; Jerry and Susan Grosslight, trustees of the Jerry and Susan Grosslight Living Trust; Dennis and Ida Block; Milton P. Kaplan, M.D., trustee of the Milton P. Kaplan, M.D., Inc., a Medical Corporation Pension Plan; Wade Yoshii, M.D.; Sanford Poise, M.D., trustee of the Sanford Poise M.D. Profit Sharing Plan; Thomas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>Neuman, DPM, trustee of the Thomas Neuman, DPM, a Professional Corporation Pension Plan; and Helene K. Swartz, Trustee Retirement Trust for C-Kay Associates, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Appellants\u2019 loan funds were placed in escrow. The trust deeds securing the loan funds were recorded at 3:01 p.m. on September 4, 1992, and the loan funds were disbursed later. After appellants\u2019 trust deeds were recorded, TRW Title Insurance Co. (TRW) issued two title insurance policies in favor of appellants in connection with their trust deeds. The policies by their terms were effective at the same time and date that appellants\u2019 trust deeds recorded.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">Nations was aware that the bank\u2019s preexisting trust deeds were subordinated to appellants\u2019 trust deeds due to the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting Barrich\u2019s priming motion, and issued the policies knowing that the bank had challenged the priming loan motion and might do so again. The bank\u2019s subordinated trust deeds were noted in and not excluded from coverage by the title policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">On August 24, 1993, the bank, having previously obtained permission from the bankruptcy court to do so, foreclosed on its trust deeds and took title to the construction project properties subject to appellants\u2019 priming loan trust deeds. In October 1993, Barrich defaulted on appellants\u2019 priming loans and appellants began foreclosure proceedings. In December 1993, the bank sued Barrich and appellants in federal district court in order to obtain a declaration that appellants\u2019 priming loan trust deeds should be subordinated to the bank\u2019s trust deeds. The gravamen of this action was twofold: (1) in violation of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, Barrich had squandered appellants\u2019 loan funds on matters unrelated to the construction project; and (2) appellants negligently permitted this to happen by failing to monitor Barrich\u2019s use of those funds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">Appellants tendered the defense of the bank\u2019s action to Nations. Nations denied the tender on the grounds that the asserted defect in appellants\u2019 title was created by appellants and that the allegations in the bank\u2019s action did not relate to the validity of the priming lien order itself but instead arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>from conduct which occurred after the policy was issued and which was therefore outside the scope of coverage. Appellants paid for their own defense and eventually prevailed in the bank\u2019s action when the trial court for that action found no evidence the loan funds had been misused by Barrich.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">On October 20, 1995, appellants sued Nations for bad faith and breach of the title policy. Both parties later filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court issued a tentative ruling on June 13, 1996, granting Nations\u2019 motion and denying appellants\u2019 as moot. The court based its ruling on the fact that title insurance only applies to defects in title as of the date escrow closes, that the title defect alleged in the bank\u2019s action arose from events occurring after escrow closed and the title policies issued, and that as a result, the bank\u2019s action fell outside the express scope of coverage as stated in the policies. The motion was granted that day and judgment was entered July 10, 1996. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">Summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) In reviewing an order granting summary judgment, we must assume the role of the trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion. In doing so, we must strictly scrutinize the moving party\u2019s papers. <em>(Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 544, 549 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 674].) The declarations of the party opposing summary judgment, however, are liberally construed to determine the existence of triable issues of fact. <em>(Sosinsky </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1556 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 552].) All doubts as to whether any material, triable, issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">While the appellate court must review a summary judgment motion by the same standards as the trial court, it must independently determine as a matter of law the construction and effect of the facts presented. <em>(Saldana </em>v. <em>Globe-Weis Systems Co. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1510-1511, 1513-1515 [285 Cal.Rptr. 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">A defendant moving for summary judgment meets his burden of proof of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party shows that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) Once the defendant does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or defense. In doing so, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>cannot rely on the mere allegations or denial of his pleadings, \u201cbut, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 653].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">1. <em>Scope of Coverage</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Appellants contend that Nations breached its duty to defend them, thus giving rise to claims for breach of contract and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (bad faith). It is axiomatic that if Nations had no duty to defend, there was no breach of contract. The bad faith claim is also dependent on the existence of a duty to defend. Absent such a contractual duty, the cause of action cannot stand. <em>(Golden Security Thrift &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>First American Title Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 250, 258 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 442] (hereafter <em>Golden Security).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">An insurer must defend its insured if the insurer becomes aware of, or if a lawsuit against its insured pleads, facts which give rise to potential liability under the policy. The duty arises so long as the facts\u2014either as expressed or implied in the complaint or as learned from other sources\u2014give rise to a potentially covered claim. It is implicit in this rule that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 19 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619] (hereafter <em>Waller).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">The duty of defense is a continuing one, arising on the tender of defense and lasting until either the underlying lawsuit ends or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage. <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 295 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153] (hereafter <em>Montrose).) </em>The insured\u2019s desire to secure a defense paid by the insurer is as important as the desire to obtain indemnity for possible liability. An immediate duty to defend is therefore necessary to afford the insured what it is entitled to: the full protection of a defense on its behalf. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 295-296.) As a result, our courts have been solicitous of an insured\u2019s expectations in this regard and have resolved all doubts in the insured\u2019s favor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 296; <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barbara B. </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1076, 1081 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792].) The duty arises even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>claims asserted against the insured are baseless and even applies to noncovered claims so long as any one of the claims discloses the potential for liability covered by the policy. <em>(Devin </em>v. <em>United Services Auto. Assn. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1157 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 263].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Even so, the insurer\u2019s duty to defend is not absolute but is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy. <em>(Waller, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 19.) We may not impose coverage by adopting a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists. <em>(Waranch </em>v. <em>Gulf Insurance Co. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 356, 359 [266 Cal.Rptr. 827].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">Insurance policies are written in two parts: an insuring agreement which defines the type of risks being covered, and exclusions, which remove coverage for certain risks which are initially within the insuring clause. Therefore, before considering whether any exclusions apply, a court must examine the coverage provisions to determine whether coverage exists at all. <em>(Collin </em>v. <em>American Empire Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 787, 802-803 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 391].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">This rule is significant for two reasons. First, when an occurrence is clearly not within the coverage clause, it does not also have to be specifically excluded. \u201cSecond, although exclusions are construed narrowly and must be proven by the insurer, the burden is on the insured to bring the claim within the basic scope of coverage, and (unlike exclusions) courts will not indulge in a forced construction of the policy\u2019s insuring clause to bring a claim within the policy\u2019s coverage. [Citations.]\u201d (21 Cal.App.4th at p. 803.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">\u201cTo prevail, the insured must prove the existence of a <em>potential for coverage, </em>while the insurer must establish <em>the absence of any such potential. . . </em>.\u201d <em>(Montrose, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 300, original italics.) \u201c[T]he determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy. Facts extrinsic to the complaint give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy. [Citations.] [^D Conversely, where the extrinsic facts eliminate the potential for coverage, the insurer may decline to defend even when the bare allegations in the complaint suggest potential liability. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Waller, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">Finally, the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law and, as such, we will independently determine the proper construction. <em>(Bluehawk </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1131 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 147].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>The insuring clause of Nations\u2019 policies insured, \u201cas of Date of Policy,\u201d against loss or damage due to any defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title, the invalidity or unenforceability of the lien of the insured mortgage upon the title, and the priority of any lien or encumbrance over the lien of the insured mortgage. Relying on the decisions in <em>National Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>American Title Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 299 N.C. 369 [261 S.E.2d 844] (hereafter <em>National </em>Mortgage) and <em>Mark Twain Kansas City Bank </em>v. <em>Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. </em>(E.D.Mo. 1992) 807 F.Supp. 85 (hereafter <em>Mtirk Twain), </em>the trial court ruled that the scope of coverage afforded by the term \u201cdate of policy\u201d was limited to defects which existed when the policy became effective. Since the bank\u2019s action was based on conduct which occurred later\u2014appellants\u2019 alleged negligence in monitoring Barrich\u2019s use of the priming loan funds\u2014the court found that the bank\u2019s action fell outside the scope of coverage and that Nations therefore had no duty to defend that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">Appellants contest the trial court\u2019s reasoning by attempting to distinguish <em>National Mortgage </em>and <em>Mark Twain </em>on the basis that Nations assumed the risk of the bank\u2019s legal challenge. As set forth below, we conclude that <em>National Mortgage </em>is both compatible with our decisional law and applicable on these facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">In <em>National Mortgage, supra, </em>299 N.C. 369 [261 S.E.2d 844], the lessors of vacant commercial property agreed to subordinate their fee simple title to the lessee\u2019s construction loan. National Mortgage was the lessee\u2019s construction lender and obtained a first trust deed over the lessors\u2019 subordinated title to secure its loan. The loan funds were disbursed to the lessors six days after the subordination agreement and construction loan first trust deed were recorded, which was also six days after the title policy\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">When the lessee/borrower defaulted, the construction lender began foreclosure proceedings. The lessors/owners sued to enjoin the foreclosure and obtain a declaration that their subordination agreement was invalid because the lessee breached that agreement by misusing the construction loan funds for purposes other than developing the property. The lessors obtained such a judgment, along with a declaration that the construction lender did not have a valid trust deed on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">The construction lender sued its title insurer, which had denied coverage on the ground that the acts which invalidated the lender\u2019s lien occurred after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>the effective date of the policy and were therefore outside the scope of coverage. The trial court found for the title insurer, and the North Carolina Supreme Court overturned the reversal of the trial court\u2019s ruling by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">The <em>National Mortgage </em>court noted the general rule that title insurance is not prospectively applied, that policyholders are only protected against defects, liens or encumbrances in existence when they take title, and are not insured against defects which may arise later. <em>(National Mortgage, supra, </em>299 N.C. at p. 375 [261 S.E.2d at pp. 847-848].) In line with this rule, the court held: \u201cDue consideration of the record impels the conclusion that the [post-closing] disbursement and the subsequent misappropriation of the loan proceeds caused the nullification of the subordination agreement and the loss of plaintiff\u2019s lien on the [lessors\u2019] property. There were no breaches of the subordination agreement as of [the policy\u2019s effective date]. Nor were there any fatal defects in the drafting or execution of the agreement on or prior to that date. Thus, the failure of the subordination agreement and the consequent loss of the lien cannot be attributed to matters in existence on the date the policy was issued. [Therefore, ... the loss incurred by the insured is not covered by the policy of title insurance sued upon in this case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 376 [261 S.E.2d at p. 848].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">California law is the same. \u201cTitle insurance is a contract to indemnify against loss through defects in the title or against liens or encumbrances that may affect the title <em>at the time when the policy is issued. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(King </em>v. <em>Stanley </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 584, 590 [197 P.2d 321], italics added; <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Marler </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 1, 18 [147 Cal.Rptr. 655], disapproved on another point in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Don Miller &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 498, 507 [198 Cal.Rptr. 551, 674 P.2d 253, 44 A.L.R.4th 763].) \u201c \u2018Generally, in other kinds of insurance, the policy protects the assured against matters that may arise during, and only during, a stated period after the issuance of the policy, but the risks of title insurance, although they may be referable to the contingency of future loss, are only designed to save the assured harmless from loss through defects, liens, and encumbrances that may affect or burden the title <em>at the time when the certificate or policy is issued. There is no implied agreement to go beyond the conditions existing at the time the policy is issued and to assume a general liability to indemnify against future encumbrances. </em>. . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 629, 636 [32 P.2d 381], italics added, citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">The preliminary title report which the title insurer provides before a policy issues is merely an inducement for the prospective insured to buy such insurance and for the insurer to state in advance the precise risk which it will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>assume. <em>(Siegel </em>v. <em>Fidelity Nat. Title Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1192-1193 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 84] (hereafter <em>Siegel).) </em>The insured may not rely on the title report alone to state a claim for negligence against, the title insurer. (Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12340.10,12340.11.) The title insurer intends that the preliminary report represents only that a title insurance policy will be issued later which insures the title <em>\u201cin the condition described in the preliminary report.\u201d </em>(Siegel, <em>supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at p. 1192, italics added.) Since the preliminary report is issued before the policy, and since the title insurer only insures the title in the condition stated in the preliminary report, it seems clear that any changes in the condition of title after the policy is issued are outside the scope of coverage. This conclusion is made clear by the decision in <em>Safeco Title Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Moskopoulos </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 658 [172 Cal.Rptr. 248, 18 A.L.R.4th 1301] (hereafter <em>Safeco).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Moskopoulos had entered an oral agreement to buy certain real property from the Williamses, who were on the verge of losing the property in foreclosure. When the Williamses refused to put their agreement in writing and attempted to negotiate different terms, Moskopoulos sued for specific performance and filed a lis pendens on the property. They settled the action and the Williamses conveyed the property to Moskopoulos through an escrow which closed the same day as the foreclosure sale had been set to take place. Williams then dismissed his suit. Shortly after, the Williamses sued Moskopoulos for fraud, rescission and other related causes of action based on Moskopoulos\u2019s conduct leading up to the eventual transfer of the property. As part of that action, a lis pendens was filed on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">Moskopoulos had bought title insurance from Safeco which insured him <em>as of the date of the policy </em>against loss or damage due to any defect in or lien or encumbrance on his title or unmarketability of his title. The effective date of the policy coincided with the close of escrow. He tendered the defense of the action to Safeco, which assumed the defense with a reservation of rights. Safeco then sued Moskopoulos for declaratory relief, seeking a judicial determination that it did not owe Moskopoulos a duty of defense. The trial court found for Safeco.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">On appeal, the judgment against Moskopoulos was affirmed, in part because the claims alleged in the complaint against him fell outside the insuring clauses of Safeco\u2019s title policy. First, the complaint alleged intentionally tortious conduct by Moskopoulos, not a defect in his title. \u201cThere is not a suggestion in the record or the briefs of any matter constituting a defect in or lien or encumbrance on the record title to the . . . property, except as disclosed in the policy. Nor is there any suggestion of any off-record risk in the chain of title coming within the policy coverage, such as a forged, altered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>or improperly delivered deed, incompetency, incapacity, marital rights, or irregularities in any probate proceeding.\u201d <em>(Safeco, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d at p. 666.) Second, the lis pendens filed against the property as part of the Williamses\u2019 suit did not render Moskopoulos\u2019s title unmarketable within the meaning of the title policy\u2019s insuring clauses since that lien was filed after the effective date of the policy. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cNeither [Moskopoulos\u2019s] conduct leading up to the [Williamses\u2019] action nor the filing of [that] action [after the title policy took effect] can reasonably be construed as coming within the policy coverage.\u201d <em>(Ibid.\\ </em>accord, <em>Barczewski </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 406, 413 [258 Cal.Rptr.386] [insured under a title policy was sued in an action seeking to rescind the priority of the insured\u2019s trust deed on certain real property based on allegations of contractual obligations of legal and equitable subordination and allegations that the earlier trust deed lacked consideration; applying <em>Moskopoulos </em>to those facts, the appellate court held that the title insurer owed no duty of defense since \u201ctortious conduct involving behavior which does not constitute matters on the public record is not within coverage afforded in the standard policy of title insurance\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\"><em>National Mortgage </em>is therefore in accord with California law on the scope of coverage for title insurers and we adopt its reasoning. Such policies only insure against defects, liens or title challenges which exist when the policy took effect, not after. Combined with the decision in <em>Safeco, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 658, it is clear that the challenge to appellants\u2019 priming loan trust deeds which was raised in the bank\u2019s action was based on events occurring after Nations issued its title policy and that it therefore owed no duty to defend that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">The complaint at issue in <em>Safeco </em>alleged intentionally tortious conduct by the insured which invalidated its title. The complaint at issue here alleged negligent conduct by appellants which supposedly invalidated the priority of their trust deeds. Such allegations do not constitute any title defect or lien or encumbrance on the property <em>(Safeco, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d at p. 666) and to the extent appellants\u2019 predicate their claim on that portion of the insuring clause, <em>Safeco </em>demonstrates that the bank\u2019s action fell outside the scope of coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since the lis pendens in <em>Safeco </em>was filed after the title policy took effect, the insured\u2019s title was rendered unmarketable by events occurring outside the scope of coverage. The same is true of the bank\u2019s action, which was filed more than one year after the title policy took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\"><em>National </em>Mortgage\u2014which applied the same principles\u2014is very nearly on point. The lender\u2019s trust deed was challenged based on the borrower\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>misuse of loan funds which occurred after the title policy took effect. That was the basis of the bank\u2019s action: Appellants failed to monitor Barrich\u2019s use of their loan funds, which were disbursed and which Barrich allegedly misused after Nations\u2019 policy took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Appellants attempt to distinguish <em>National Mortgage </em>as follows: Contrary to the subordination agreement and the expectations of the title insurer, the lender in <em>National Mortgage </em>disbursed the funds at once, rather than as construction progressed; while the subordination agreement in <em>National Mortgage </em>was breached, the trial court in the bank\u2019s action found no evidence that the loan funds had been misused and the bankruptcy court\u2019s priming loan order was therefore not breached; Nations knew the loan funds would be disbursed at once and they were; and because Nations knew all the circumstances surrounding the priming loans and the bank\u2019s previous challenges to those loans, the loss which occurred was contemplated by Nations as part of its coverage obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">We believe the trial court adequately addressed these distinctions in its tentative decision: \u201c[Appellants\u2019] attempts to distinguish <em>National Mortgage </em>... are unconvincing. The cases clearly hold that loan proceeds are not covered by the policy because the policies insure title only as of the date of the policy. It is not significant whether the insured lost control of his funds, the knowledge of the insured and insurer when the policy was issued or whether the funds were misappropriated or correctly disbursed. The critical fact is the time of the wrongful event in relation to the date of the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">Put another way, at the time Nations\u2019 policy took effect, there was nothing to indicate any defect in or competing liens or encumbrances on appellants\u2019 priming loan trust deeds and Nations cannot be deemed to have contemplated coverage for any later misuse of the loan funds. <em>(Safeco, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d at pp. 665-666 [no reasonable construction of the title policy could impose on the insurer the obligation to defend any third party action seeking to rescind the property sale; no insured could reasonably have such an expectation].) Under <em>Waller, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at page 19, the determination of coverage is based upon an examination of the allegations of the complaint in the bank\u2019s action. That complaint did not allege any defects or liens at the time Nations\u2019 title policy took effect. Instead, as in <em>Safeco </em>and <em>National Mortgage, </em>it alleged misconduct or legal actions which occurred after and which therefore were outside the scope of coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>2. <em>Waiver of Coverage </em>Issue<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment is affirmed.
