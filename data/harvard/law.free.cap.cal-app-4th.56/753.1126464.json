He was sentenced to a term of 25 years to life in state prison. (See Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 459, 667, subd. (e)(2).) Early appeals, contending, inter alia, that the jury was misinstructed and that this matter must be remanded for resentencing pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628]. We affirm the conviction, but remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On March 29, 1994, appellant Robert Louis Early allegedly burglarized the Dublin home of Karen Stewart. Early and Michael Duran Apodaca were apprehended by police after the two men ran away from them near the Stewart home. Early had jewelry and coins in his pocket that had come from the house. When he was questioned, he told police investigating the burglary that he committed the burglary and that he was a dope fiend looking to \u201cmake a score\u201d in order to buy heroin. He stated that he and Apodaca had gained entry by a side door.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Early was charged by information with first degree burglary enhanced by allegations of five prior convictions, all of them for completed or attempted first degree burglaries. (See \u00a7\u00a7 459, 667, subds. (a), (e)(2).) His motion to set aside the enhancement allegations in the information was denied. (See \u00a7 995.) He moved to strike four of the five prior conviction allegations, also without success.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">At trial, Apodaca admitted burglarizing the house. He had previously pled guilty to the burglary and was serving a prison sentence by the time he testified at Early\u2019s trial. He testified that he had not met Early before the date of the burglary. He needed someone to drive him to commit a burglary. He did not tell Early of his purpose. Instead, Apodaca told Early that he needed a ride to his girlfriend\u2019s house to pick up some things that belonged to him. He traded heroin for the ride. They both used some heroin before they left together. When they arrived at the house, Apodaca went in, but Early did not. When he came out of the house with the items he had taken, he gave some jewelry and money to Early. Then, he saw the police and the two of them ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Early also testified in his own defense. His testimony was consistent with that offered by Apodaca\u2014that he gave Apodaca a ride to his girlfriend\u2019s house in exchange for heroin, that Apodaca alone entered the house and that when he came out of the house, he gave Early some items to pocket. He ran from the police because he was under the influence of heroin, with tracks on his arm while he was on parole. When he gave his statement to police, he told the officer \u201cwhatever he want[ed] to hear\u201d in order to pacify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Another defense witness, an expert psychologist, recounted Early\u2019s similar description of the burglary and the reason why he ran from police. He testified that Early told him that he did not know that Apodaca intended to burglarize the house at any time before he actually went into the house. The psychologist testified that Early had told him that he was addicted to heroin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>and that he burglarized homes in order to support his habit. Early had admitted having committed multiple burglaries in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The prosecution put on evidence suggesting that Early and Apodaca committed the burglary together, because they were seen earlier on the day of the crime checking out houses. Ultimately, the jury found Early guilty of burglary and found all the allegations charged to be true. His motions to strike tire prior conviction findings and his challenge to the sentencing scheme as cruel or unusual punishment and as discriminatory enforcement were denied. (See \u00a7 1385.) He was sentenced to a term of 25 years to life in state prison. (See \u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">II. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"AdZ\">A. <em>Residential Burglary\u2014Constitutional Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Early contends that his first degree burglary conviction must be reversed because the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on an element of residential burglary. Specifically, Early correctly observes that to constitute first degree burglary the structure entered must be \u201can inhabited dwelling house.\u201d (\u00a7 460.) He argues that the trial court, through its instructions, erroneously removed this element from the jury\u2019s consideration. We agree that error occurred but conclude that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">At trial, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cNow, what\u2019s a burglary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201cBurglary is defined as any person who enters a structure of the type shown by the evidence in this case[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the kind of structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">\u201cIn other words, the crime of burglary is defined as every person who enters the home of Karen Stewart with the specific intent to steal, take, and carry away the personal property of another with the specific intent to deprive the owner permanently of her property is guilty of burglary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-12\">\u201cIn other words, if you take the property and plan to give it back, that\u2019s not a burglary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-13\">\u201cBut burglary is the entrance of this type of home with the specific intent to steal, take, and carry away the property with the intent to permanently deprive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\u201cThe essence of a burglary is entering such [a] place with the specific intent. The burglary is committed as soon as entry is made, regardless of whether the intent thereafter is carried out. Therefore, in order to prove the commission of the crime of burglary, you need certain elements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cElement number one, you have to enter a dwelling house, and the house of Karen Stewart is a dwelling house which qualifies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">\u201cTwo, at the time of the entrance, the person has to have the specific intent to steal, take, and carry away someone else\u2019s property and intend to deprive the owner permanently of such property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cAnd, again, the specific intent to commit burglary must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The specific intent to permanently deprive must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">\u201cNow, if you find the defendant guilty of burglary, Ladies and Gentlemen, don\u2019t worry about the degree of burglary. I\u2019m going to instruct you that if you should find beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s [sz'c] guilty of burglary, it\u2019s first-degree burglary as a matter of law, so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">It is a well-established constitutional requirement that the prosecution prove every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which a criminal defendant is charged. <em>(In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 364 [90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072-1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368].) Consequently, a trial court may not direct a jury to convict, regardless of how overwhelming the evidence may appear to be. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co. </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 564, 572-573 [97 S.Ct. 1349, 1355, 51 L.Ed.2d 642].) To do so violates the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. (See <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 145, 155-156 [88 S.Ct. 1444, 1450-1451, 20 L.Ed.2d 491].) As stated by our Supreme Court, \u201c[t]he rule prohibiting verdicts directed against an accused emanates from the guarantee of due process and the right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Figueroa </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 714,725 [224 Cal.Rptr. 719, 715 P.2d 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Reasonably construed, the trial court\u2019s instructions told the jury not to \u201cworry about\u201d the type of structure allegedly entered because the structure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>was the \u201cdwelling house\u201d of the victim, Karen Stewart. In so instructing, the trial court removed from consideration and, in essence, directed a verdict on an element of first degree burglary, i.e., that the structure entered be an \u201cinhabited dwelling house.\u201d This was error of a constitutional magnitude. (See <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>391 U.S. 145.) The question remains, however, whether the error is reversible per se or subject to a harmless error analysis under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 570 [106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460], the United States Supreme Court applied a \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard in determining the prejudicial effect of an erroneous jury instruction dealing with rebuttable presumptions, observing that there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that a constitutional violation will be subject to harmless error analysis. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 579 [106 S.Ct. at p. 3106].) As stated in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279, 306 [111 S.Ct. 1246, 1263, 113 L.Ed.2d 302], \u201c. . . the Court has applied harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless.\u201d Specifically, the court has repeatedly applied a harmless error analysis to instructional errors of a constitutional magnitude. (See, e.g., <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 391, 402 [111 S.Ct. 1884, 1892, 114 L.Ed.2d 432] [erroneous burden-shifting instruction]; <em>Carella </em>v. <em>California </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 263, 266 [109 S.Ct. 2419, 2421, 105 L.Ed.2d 218] [erroneous mandatory presumption instruction]; <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 497, 502-504 [107 S.Ct. 1918, 1921-1923, 95 L.Ed.2d 439] [erroneous instruction on element of offense].) The courts of this state have done so as well: \u201cIt is appropriate and constitutionally permissible to analyze instructional error with regard to an element of an offense by the harmless error standard of <em>Chapman </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brenner </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 335, 339 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 260] [specific intent crime defined as requiring only general intent], and cases cited therein; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Avila </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 642 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 484] [failure to instruct on element of kidnapping].)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 506 [115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444], the court held that the materiality of a false statement must be submitted to the jury rather than decided by the trial judge. In upholding the reversal of the conviction by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the court stated: \u201cThe Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt of every element of the crime with which he is charged. The trial judge\u2019s refusal to allow the jury to pass on the \u2018materiality\u2019 of Gaudin\u2019s false statements infringed that right.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number><em>(Id. </em>at pp. 522-523 [115 S.Ct. at p. 2320].) Nowhere in the <em>Gaudin </em>majority opinion, however, is there any discussion of whether the error is reversible per se or subject to a harmless error analysis. This absence of discussion is apparently attributable to the fact, as observed in the concurring opinion, that \u201cthe Government has not argued here that the error in this case was either harmless or not plain,\" <em>(id. </em>at p. 526 [115 S.Ct. at p. 2321]) and the further disclaimer that \u201c[t]he Court today has no occasion to review the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the constitutional error here \u2018cannot be harmless.\u2019 28 F.3d, at 951.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 526 [115 S.Ct. at p. 2322].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Kobrin </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 416 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 895, 903 P.2d 1027], decided a few months after <em>Gaudin, </em>our Supreme Court reversed a perjury conviction where the trial court refused to allow the jury to determine the requisite element of materiality and instead instructed the jury that if the statements were made they were \u201cmaterial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 421.) As in <em>Gaudin, </em>the court did not hold that such an error was reversible per se. Unlike the majority opinion in <em>Gaudin, </em>the court expressly acknowledged what it was not deciding: \u201cIn light of our findings on this record, we need not decide whether, and under what other circumstances, a reviewing court may determine the omission of instruction on an element was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 428, fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">While this appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(1997) _ U.S. _ [117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Johnson, </em>defendant was charged with making a false material declaration under oath before a grand jury. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623.) At trial, the district court informed the jury that the element of \u201cmateriality\u201d was a question for the court to decide and that the court had determined defendant\u2019s statement to be material. Defendant did not object to this instruction in the trial court. On appeal to the Eleventh Circuit, defendant argued that the trial court\u2019s failure to submit materiality to the jury rendered her conviction invalid under <em>Gaudin. </em>The circuit court affirmed the judgment of conviction. Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the failure to object in the trial court waives the error for purposes of appeal (Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. rule 30, 18 U.S.C.), unless the error or defect affects \u201csubstantial rights\u201d <em>(id. </em>rule 52(b), 18 U.S.C.; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Olano </em>(1993) 507 U.S. 725 [113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508]). The circuit court held that the error \u201cdid not affect the \u2018substantial rights\u2019 of the defendant,\u201d basing its conclusion on the court\u2019s \u201cindependent review of the record and determination that there was \u2018overwhelming\u2019 evidence of materiality and that \u2018[n]o reasonable juror could conclude that Johnson\u2019s false statements about the source of the money . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>were not material to the grand jury\u2019s investigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>U.S., </em>supra,_U.S. at p._[117 S.Ct. at pp. 1547-1548].)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The Supreme Court, after observing that materiality \u201cwas essentially uncontroverted at trial and has remained so on appeal [fn. omitted],\u201d affirmed the circuit court: \u201cOn this record there is no basis for concluding that the error \u2018seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 Indeed, it would be the reversal of a conviction such as this which would have that effect. \u2018Reversal for error, regardless of its effect on the judgment, encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it.\u2019 R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970). No \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 will result here if we do not notice the error, [citation], and we decline to do so.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>U.S., supra, </em>_ U.S. at p. _ [117 S.Ct. at p. 1550].)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In the present case, as in <em>Johnson, </em>the evidence was uncontroverted at trial, and is not challenged on this appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the structure entered was an \u201cinhabited dwelling house.\u201d As in <em>Johnson, </em>the same error occurred: In <em>Johnson, </em>the trial court removed the element of \u201cmateriality\u201d from the jury\u2019s consideration; here, the trial court removed the element of \u201cinhabited dwelling house\u201d from the jury\u2019s consideration. In <em>Johnson, </em>upon a review of the record, the court concluded that the error was not one that \u201c \u2018 \u201cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>U.S., </em>supra,_U.S. at p._[117 S.Ct. at p. 1550].) Application of this standard is wholly inconsistent with a reversible per se rule. In sum, the <em>Johnson </em>court rejected the argument that the error was \u201cstructural\u201d requiring automatic reversal <em>(Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>391 U.S. 145) by affirming the judgment on the basis that the error did not affect \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Accordingly, we apply a harmless error analysis to the error at issue and conclude, upon a review of the record, that no reasonable juror could find that the structure entered was anything other than an \u201cinhabited dwelling house.\u201d <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">B.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>III.
