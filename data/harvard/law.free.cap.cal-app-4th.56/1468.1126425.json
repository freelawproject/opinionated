Its sole owner is Donald D. Bade (Bade). Between April 1988 and May 1990 Vintech, Inc., and Bade (collectively, Vintech) sought investors for four limited partnerships of which they were the general partners. The objectives of the limited partnerships were to (1) purchase four existing wineries: Lyeth, Domaine Laurier, Mazzocco, and Jekel; (2) generate cash from operating the wineries; and (3) realize capital appreciation upon sale of the wineries. Minimum investment in a limited partnership unit was $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">Vintech made information and disclosures regarding the limited partnerships available to prospective investors by way of a confidential offering memorandum (COM). The COM\u2019s stated they were prepared by Vintech\u2019s attorneys, and that Vintech retained respondent, an accounting firm, to prepare financial statements and tax returns for the partnerships. Each COM contained financial projections or forecasts for a six-year period after formation of the partnership. A summary of significant forecast assumptions and accounting policies accompanied the forecasts, which projected a return of 16 to 19 percent over the six-year period. Each COM also contained several caveats that the investment involved a high degree of risk and should be made only by investors who could afford a total loss of their contributions. The Mazzocco and Jekel COM\u2019s included an \u201cIndependent Accountants\u2019 Report\u201d (IAR) prepared by respondent which states, inter alia, that respondent reviewed the forecasted income tax basis statements of income, expenses, partners\u2019 capital and cash flows for each of the years included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number>the economic forecasts of Mazzocco and Jekel. The IAR\u2019s further state that the review was \u201cmade in accordance with the standards for an examination of [a forecast] established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA),\u201d and that \u201c[i]n our opinion, the accompanying forecast is presented in conformity with guidelines for presentation of a forecast established by the [AICPA], and the underlying assumptions provide a reasonable basis for [management\u2019s] forecast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\">Between December 1990 and May 1991 all four limited partnerships, as well as Vintech, Inc., and Bade, filed chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Appellants are purchasers of limited partnership interests who lost their investments when the partnerships failed. They allege generally that respondent knew, but failed to disclose in the COM\u2019s that the partnerships would be required to incur significant debt to continue in business and that the necessary loans were unavailable, and therefore the Mazzocco and Jekel forecasts had no reasonable basis in fact. They also allege that respondent continued to participate in partnership offerings even though it was aware of the lack of funding, marketing difficulties, and management problems of the first partnership, and that they relied on the COM\u2019s in deciding to invest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Appellants also allege that respondent aided, abetted and conspired with Vintech in the latter\u2019s fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of state securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A2_\">I, II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">Appellants next contend triable issues of material fact exist in each of their causes of action, and thereby preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">Summary judgment is properly granted if the record reveals no triable issues of material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) (1) Defendants moving for summary judgment meet their burden of negating the plaintiff\u2019s action by establishing a complete defense thereto, or showing that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established. <em>(McCarthy </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number><em>Fletcher </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 130, 138 [254 Cal.Rptr. 714].) The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to set forth specific facts showing the existence of a triable issue. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (g)(2).) Summary judgments are reviewed de novo. <em>(Jambazian </em>v. <em>Borden </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 836, 844 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">Appellants\u2019 theories of recovery are dependent upon their ability to establish either fraud or negligent misrepresentation. However, the causes of action for negligent misrepresentation are based on respondent\u2019s IAR\u2019s and confined to the investors in Mazzocco and Jekel, which are the only two limited partnerships that disseminated respondent\u2019s report in their COM\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">\n<em>The Mazzocco and Jekel Offerings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">Appellants contend there is a triable issue of material fact concerning respondent\u2019s knowledge of false and misleading statements in the Mazzocco and Jekel COM\u2019s. Appellants refer to respondent\u2019s statements in its IAR\u2019s that it examined the Mazzocco and Jekel forecasted balance sheets and income tax basis statements of income, partners\u2019 capital and cash flows for the forecasted years in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) standards for examination of prospective financial statements, and that the underlying assumptions provide a reasonable basis for management\u2019s forecast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">1. <em>Fraud</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">The elements of intentional misrepresentation, or actual fraud, are: \u201c(1) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of falsity (scienter); (3) intent to defraud (i.e., to induce reliance); (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1108 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46] <em>(Molko).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">In support of respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Michael Rudy, respondent\u2019s engagement partner responsible for examination of the forecast material contained in the COM\u2019s, declared that the Mazzocco and Jekel forecasts were prepared by Vintech personnel, not respondent; that respondent examined the forecasts according to the AICPA guidelines governing such examinations; that respondent concluded the forecast was presented in conformity with those guidelines and that the assumptions underlying the forecast provided a reasonable basis for the forecast at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>examination; that respondent had no knowledge that any assumptions on which the forecast was based were false; and that respondent\u2019s report contains no misstatements or omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\">Respondent also supported its motion with AICPA guidelines for prospective financial statements. The guidelines state that a prospective financial statement, including the underlying assumptions, is the responsibility of the entity\u2019s responsible party. \u201cEntity\u201d is defined as any unit for which financial statements could be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such as a partnership. \u201cResponsible party\u201d is the person, usually management, responsible for the assumptions underlying the prospective financial statement. The guidelines further state that an accountant engaged to examine a prospective financial statement \u201cshould evaluate support for assumptions,\u201d and can conclude the assumptions are suitably supported if the preponderance of information, i.e., the weight of available information, supports each significant assumption. In evaluating the support for assumptions, the accountant should consider \u201cwhether sufficient pertinent sources of information about the assumptions have been considered.\u201d Sources might include government and industry publications, economic forecasts, existing and proposed legislation, changing technology, and the entity\u2019s budgets, sales records, and debt agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">Appellants opposed respondent\u2019s motion principally with the declaration of Mike Fisher, a certified public accountant with substantial accounting experience in the California premium wine industry and degrees in both enology and accounting. He declared that he reviewed the forecasted financial statements and respondent\u2019s IAR\u2019s, respondent\u2019s supporting work papers for its reports, and depositions and declarations of respondent\u2019s and Vintech\u2019s personnel. He opined that respondent not only failed to conduct its examination of the forecasts according to relevant AICPA guidelines, but that its accounting procedures \u201cwere so deficient as to constitute an extreme departure from the applicable accounting standards.\u201d He further declared that under AICPA guidelines an accountant should consider, inter alia, sales backlog records, debt agreements, market surveys, industry statistics, and trends and patterns developed from an entity\u2019s operation history in evaluating the support for assumptions. He stated that respondent violated these guidelines in its Mazzocco and Jekel reports. In Fisher\u2019s opinion, respondent should have verified the forecasts\u2019 assumptions that the partnerships would secure certain specified financing by independently investigating lenders and the current financing market. Instead, according to its work papers respondent relied only on general partner Bade\u2019s representations that necessary future financing was available. Fisher also declared that respondent\u2019s work papers do not mention independent research in the marketing and demand of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>Mazzocco and Jekel wines to support their sales assumptions, but again rely solely on Bade\u2019s representations of aggressive marketing and increased sales staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">The requisite state of mind, or scienter, for actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation is disbelief in the truth of the statement, i.e., <em>knowledge of falsity. (Molko, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 1108.) Assuming that respondent\u2019s statement in the COM\u2019s that \u201cthe underlying assumptions [for the forecasted balance sheets] provide a reasonable basis for [management\u2019s] forecast\u201d was incorrect, Fisher\u2019s declaration does not state that respondent made this misrepresentation <em>knowing </em>it was not true, or that respondent did not believe the representation to be true. As we understand their argument, appellants claim that Fisher\u2019s opinion regarding respondent\u2019s \u201cextreme deviation\u201d from AICPA standards raises a question that respondent made representations about forecasts without first checking the facts upon which its representations were based, i.e., that it didn\u2019t do its homework. This constitutes a claim of negligent misrepresentation rather than an intent to deceive, which is the basis of actual fraud. (See, e.g., <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Bertran </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 481, 487-488 [275 P.2d 15] <em>(Gagne); </em>5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7\u00a7 682-683, pp. 140-142; 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 704, pp. 805-806.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">2. <em>Negligent Misrepresentation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">Negligent misrepresentation is the assertion of a false statement, honestly made in the belief it is true, but without reasonable ground for such belief. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1572, subd. 2, 1710, subd. 2; <em>Bily </em>v. <em>Arthur Young &amp; Co. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 407-408 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 51, 834 P.2d 745] <em>(Bily).) </em> \u201c[T]he broad statements that \u2018scienter\u2019 is an element of every cause of action for deceit, and that an \u2018intent to deceive\u2019 is essential, are untrue, since neither is a requisite of negligent misrepresentation. [Citations.]\u201d (5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 722, p. 821.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">\u201cUnder certain circumstances, expressions of professional opinion are treated as representations of fact. When a statement, although in the form of an opinion, is \u2018not a casual expression of belief\u2019 but \u2018a deliberate affirmation of the matters stated,\u2019 it may be regarded as a positive assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>of fact. [Citation.] Moreover, when a party possesses or holds itself out as possessing superior knowledge or special information or expertise regarding the subject matter and a plaintiff is so situated that it may reasonably rely on such supposed knowledge, information, or expertise, the defendant\u2019s representation may be treated as one of material fact. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 408; see also <em>Gagne, supra, </em>43 Cal.2d at p. 489; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>S &amp; S Construction Co. </em>(1983) 151 Cal.App.3d 941, 946 [201 Cal.Rptr. 173].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\">The liability of accountants to third parties, i.e., parties other than their actual clients, for negligent misrepresentation in connection with the preparation of audit reports is set forth in <em>Bily. Bily </em>adopted the position of Restatement Second of Torts section 552, subdivision (2), as summarized in the jury instruction <em>Bily </em>fashioned for trial courts in such cases: \u201c \u2018The representation must have been made with the intent to induce plaintiff, or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs, to act in reliance upon the representation in a specific transaction, or a specific type of transaction, that defendant intended to influence. Defendant is deemed to have intended to influence [its client\u2019s] transaction with plaintiff whenever defendant knows with substantial certainty that plaintiff, or the particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs, will rely on the representation in the course of the transaction. If others become aware of the representation and act upon it, there is no liability even though defendant should reasonably have foreseen such a possibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 414.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">We conclude that appellants have raised a triable issue concerning the reliability of respondent\u2019s IAR\u2019s through Fisher\u2019s declaration in opposition to respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment. If the acts or conduct of a professional accountant performed in preparation for an audit or representation fall below the applicable standard of care for the profession, in that the accountant failed to examine or acquire the necessary information required to support the accountant\u2019s professional opinion disseminated to potential investors, the opinion is made without a reasonable ground for believing it to be true. (See <em>Gagne, supra, </em>43 Cal.2d at pp. 488-489.) When a statement, although in the form of an opinion, constitutes \u201c \u2018a deliberate affirmation of the matters stated\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bily, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 408, citing <em>Gagne, supra, </em>43 Cal.2d at p. 489), as occurred here, \u201cit may be regarded as a positive assertion of fact.\u201d <em>(Bily </em>at p. 408.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">\u2018  The next question is whether appellants presented a triable issue of whether respondent knew with substantial certainty that appellants, or the particular class of persons to which they belong, would rely on the IAR\u2019s in the course of the transaction. The answer to that inquiry requires analysis of the circumstances surrounding the preparation of the IAR\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>In <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Ball, Hunt, Hart, Brown &amp; Baerwitz </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 104 [128 Cal.Rptr. 901] <em>(Roberts) </em>a law firm prepared an opinion letter for its client for delivery to a prospective lender. When the client defaulted on the loan, the lender sued the attorneys alleging that the loan was extended on the basis of erroneous information in the opinion letter. In holding that the allegation in the lender\u2019s complaint that the attorneys knew and understood that the opinion letter was to be shown to the lender to induce it to make the loan stated a cause of action, the court stated: \u201c[A] legal opinion intended to secure benefit for the client, either monetary or otherwise, must be issued with due care, or the attorneys who do not act carefully will have breached a duty owed to those they attempted or expected to influence on behalf of their clients.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">In <em>Soderberg </em>v. <em>McKinney </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1760 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 635] <em>(Soderberg), </em>plaintiff trustee was contacted by a mortgage broker to invest in a second deed of trust on residential property. Plaintiff did so in reliance on an appraisal prepared under an agreement between the appraiser and the mortgage broker. After the borrowers defaulted on the deeds of trust, plaintiff brought an action against the appraiser for negligent misrepresentation of the property\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\"><em>Soderberg </em>reversed a summary adjudication in favor of the appraiser, concluding that the appraiser\u2019s knowledge of the potential investors by name or specific identity was not a prerequisite to bringing the action. It was sufficient that, the appraiser supplied the information for repetition to a certain group or class of persons. It further concluded the appraiser could not establish as a matter of law that he knew the appraisal would be used solely by the mortgage broker, because he knew that the particular class of persons to which plaintiff belonged\u2014potential investors contacted by the mortgage broker\u2014would rely on his report for their investment decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">This case is comparable to <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Soderberg. </em>There is ample evidence to support a finding that respondent knew its reports were not limited to Vintech\u2019s internal or personal use, but were to be included in the COM\u2019s and thus communicated to potential investors in the Mazzocco and Jekel limited partnerships. The forecast and underlying assumptions to which the IAR\u2019s refer are designed for the specific purpose of attracting investors in the limited partnerships, i.e., to induce reliance, and cannot reasonably be understood to have any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">As we noted earlier, in order to prevail on summary judgment respondent had to negate appellants\u2019 action either by establishing a complete defense or by showing that one or more of its elements did not exist. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>asserted no affirmative defense, and the record demonstrates triable issues of fact concerning the falsity of the IAR\u2019s and respondent\u2019s intent to induce reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-4\">\u201cReliance exists when the misrepresentation or nondisclosure was an immediate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct which altered his or her legal relations, and when without such misrepresentation or nondisclosure he or she would not, in all reasonable probability, have entered into the contract or other transaction. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Alliance Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Rothwell </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1226,1239 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 900 P.2d 601].) Except for \u201c \u2018rare\u2019 \u201d cases where \u201c \u2018the undisputed facts leave no room for a reasonable difference of opinion,\u2019 \u201d whether the plaintiff\u2019s reliance is reasonable is a question of fact. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">Respondent\u2019s IAR\u2019s accompanied only the Mazzocco and Jekel COM\u2019s, and investors therein were instructed not to execute any investment documents until they had reviewed the COM\u2019s. The subscription agreements contain a paragraph acknowledging that \u201cI received and reviewed the [COM] . . . [and] have not relied upon any information concerning the offering, written or oral, other than that contained in such documents.\u201d Several appellants testified at their depositions that they relied on the IAR\u2019s in making their investment decisions. Respondent has not negated the element of reliance by these investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">However, the IAR\u2019s are specific only to Mazzocco and Jekel, and not to any other entity. Appellants have presented no reliable evidence that investors in the Lyeth and Domaine Laurier partnerships could reasonably have relied on the Mazzocco and Jekel IAR\u2019s in making their investment decisions. Consequently, any liability of respondent for negligent misrepresentation reaches only investors in the Mazzocco and Jekel entities. Respondent has negated the element of reliance by investors in Lyeth and Domaine Laurier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\"><em>Conspiracy in All </em>Offerings<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-9\">IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>Conclusion<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">The judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
