Kennedy Medical Center (Medical Center) as an independent contractor. When the Medical Center had openings for full-time employees on the nursing staff, Sada submitted an application and was interviewed. The Medical Center did not hire Sada but continued to use her on a temporary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Sada, who is of Mexican descent, complained to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) that, in rejecting her for full-time employment, the Medical Center had violated the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.) (FEHA or the Act). She claimed that she was denied the job because of her national origin and ancestry. Within a few days after the DFEH contacted the Medical Center to investigate Sada\u2019s claim, she was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Sada filed this action under the FEHA, alleging claims of discriminatory hiring and retaliatory termination. The trial court granted summary judgment for the Medical Center, concluding that Sada was not qualified for a full-time position.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">On appeal, the parties address the principal legal question of whether the FEHA covers independent contractors. The Medical Center argues that, even if Sada was terminated because she complained about discriminatory hiring, the Act does not apply to her because she was an independent contractor. We find it unnecessary to decide whether the Act covers independent contractors. We conclude that, as an <em>applicant for an employee position, </em>Sada was protected against retaliation for protesting discriminatory hiring. Included within the matters protected was Sada\u2019s work for the Medical Center on a temporary basis. We further conclude that triable issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on the discriminatory hiring claim. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Sada was bom in Reynosa, Mexico, in 1950 and is of Mexican ancestry. She is a citizen of the United States. She has blond hair, is light complected, and speaks English without an accent. She is fluent in Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Sada began her nursing career in Texas. In 1982, she became a licensed vocational nurse and, in 1988, she became licensed as a registered nurse. From 1988 through 1992, Sada held nursing positions with various hospitals in Texas. For health reasons, she took a leave of absence from March 1992 through August 1993. In August 1993, Sada moved to California. Here, she received a temporary license as a registered nurse in September 1993 and a permanent license in April 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Beginning in December 1993, Sada obtained work through a nurses\u2019 registry known as Nurse Providers. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1812.524, subd. (b) [defining \u201cnurses\u2019 registry\u201d].) As a registry nurse, Sada worked several days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>a month at different hospitals as an independent contractor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From December 1993 through July 28, 1994, she worked in the \u201cdefinitive observation unit\u201d at the Medical Center. That unit provides telemetry care, which is the electronic monitoring of heart rhythms of cardiac patients. Until the last day of her employment at the Medical Center, Sada did not receive any oral or written criticism of her performance. In fact, she received numerous compliments on her work, including at least 12 written evaluations by charge nurses that praised her performance. Sada typically worked five to eight days a month at the Medical Center.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">On one occasion, a Hispanic patient complained to Sada about the lack of Spanish-speaking nurses on a particular shift and his resulting inability to communicate with the staff about the pain he was experiencing. Sada relayed the complaint to Patricia Brendia, the director of the definitive observation unit. In response, Brendia said, \u201cHispanics spend 20 to 30 years in this country and do not bother to learn English, but they sure can find those public offices where they can get food stamps and all kinds of public assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In May 1994, Sada learned that the Medical Center had openings for full-time employees on the nursing staff in the definitive observation unit. She completed and submitted a job application. On June 6, 1994, Brendia interviewed Sada for one of the positions. During the interview, Brendia spoke favorably of Sada\u2019s performance and complimented her ability to complete assignments. At one point, Brendia asked Sada, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d and Sada said that she was from Mexico. Brendia responded by saying twice, \u201cI would never have known,\u201d and then asked, \u201cHow come you don\u2019t have an accent?\u201d Sada explained that she had attended a Catholic school where English was required and some of the teachers were American. Brendia also inquired about Sada\u2019s work experience during the 1990-1991 time frame. Sada stated that she had been working at hospitals in the United States and commuting to her home in Mexico. Upon hearing this information, Brendia\u2019s eyes \u201cpopped open.\u201d She stared for a little while and then said, \u201cWell why don\u2019t you just go back to Mexico and work there?\u201d Sada replied that she did not want to work in Mexico. She attempted to explain that the only work she had done in Mexico was missionary work, but Brendia interrupted her, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to end this.\u201d Brendia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>told Sada that she was not eligible for the job.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Five other individuals were hired to fill the positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The day after the interview, Sada telephoned Brendia to explain why she had been living in Mexico and working in the United States. Brendia said that she was too busy to discuss the matter. When Sada asked if she needed to fill out another job application to apply for other nurse positions at the Medical Center, Brendia answered, \u201cThere are no openings.\u201d Sada then placed a telephone call to the Medical Center\u2019s \u201cjob line\u201d and learned that there were numerous openings on the nursing staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Although Sada was not hired as an employee, the Medical Center continued to use her on an independent contractor basis to work in the definitive observation unit. On July 20, 1994, Sada went to the DFEH and complained that the Medical Center had refused to hire her as an employee because of her national origin and ancestry. Sada did not file a formal charge at that time, but asked the DFEH to attempt to resolve the problem informally.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On July 22, 1994, Robert Hammock, an investigator with the DFEH, spoke by telephone with Louis Gregorio, who worked in the Medical Center\u2019s human resources department. Hammock wanted to know why Sada did not get a job offer. Gregorio said he would look into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Within a day or two, Gregorio talked to Brendia by telephone and asked to see any documentation explaining why Sada was not hired. Gregorio met with Brendia a few days later, at which time he reviewed Sada\u2019s job application. Brendia told him that Sada did not get the job because she was not qualified. No other reason was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Brendia directed that Sada\u2019s job performance be \u201creevaluated,\u201d which occurred on July 28, 1994. The evaluation was performed by Pat Heasley, a registered nurse whom Sada had previously reported for making mistakes in treating a patient.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Heasley found alleged deficiencies in Sada\u2019s performance and documented them in a written evaluation. On July 29, 1994, Brendia telecopied the evaluation to Sada\u2019s registry, together with a \u201cdo not send\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>letter, which had the effect of terminating Sada\u2019s work at the Medical Center. Brendia did not give Sada an opportunity to explain or refute the alleged deficiencies before terminating her services. On August 3, 1994, Sada wrote a detailed letter to the Medical Center, denying the accusations in the performance evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">On August 11, 1994, Sada filed formal charges with the DFEH, contending that the Medical Center had denied her a full-time position because of her national origin/ancestry and had terminated her in retaliation for protesting the discriminatory hiring decision. This lawsuit followed, in which Sada alleged (1) causes of action against the Medical Center and Brendia for violations of the FEHA, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and (2) causes of action against only the Medical Center for intentional and negligent spoliation of evidence. In response to the lawsuit, Brendia told a coworker in late 1994: \u201cThose Mexicans. Sada better drop her lawsuit. We are going to send all their asses back to Mexico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In September 1995, the Medical Center and Brendia moved for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of issues, arguing that (1) Sada was not hired for a full-time position because she was not qualified, (2) Sada could not maintain a retaliation claim under the FEHA because she was an independent contractor, (3) the retaliation claim failed in any event because Sada was terminated for a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason (i.e., patient errors), and (4) Sada\u2019s remaining claims failed for lack of evidence. The trial court concluded that, as a matter of law, Sada was not qualified for the full-time position. Based on that conclusion, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the Medical Center and Brendia. Sada filed a timely appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Sada contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to the FEHA and emotional distress claims against the Medical Center. She does not challenge the entry of summary judgment in favor of Brendia or the adjudication of the spoliation of evidence claims in favor of the Medical Center. We conclude that summary judgment as to the Medical Center was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Summary judgment is appropriate if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201cA defendant seeking summary judgment has met the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established [or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action]. . . . Once the defendant\u2019s burden is met, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to that cause of action. ... In reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment, the appellate court independently reviews the record that was before the trial court. . . . We must determine whether the facts as shown by the parties give rise to a triable issue of material fact. ... In making this determination, the moving party\u2019s affidavits are strictly construed while those of the opposing party are liberally construed.\u201d <em>(Hanooka </em>v. <em>Pivko </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1553, 1558 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 70], citations omitted; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).) We accept as undisputed facts only those portions of the moving party\u2019s evidence that are not contradicted by the opposing party\u2019s evidence. <em>(Kelleher </em>v. <em>Empresa Hondurena de Vapores, S.A. </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 52, 56 [129 Cal.Rptr. 32].) In other words, the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment and the reasonable inferences therefrom must be accepted as true. (See <em>Zeilman </em>v. <em>County of Kern </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1174, 1179, fn. 3 [214 Cal.Rptr. 746].)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">A. <em>Discrimination in Hiring</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The FEHA makes it unlawful \u201c[f]or an employer, because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, or sex of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (a).) As stated, Sada alleged that the Medical Center refused to hire her because of her national origin and ancestry.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In determining the propriety of summary judgment on a discrimination claim under the FEHA, we look to the test formulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 792 [93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668] and <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 248 [101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207] for evaluating claims under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.) (Title VII). (See <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Paramount Unified School Dist. </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 189, 201-203 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 448].)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">As we have previously recognized: \u201cIn most disparate treatment employment discrimination cases, the plaintiff will lack direct evidence of the employer\u2019s discriminatory intent, which is a necessary element to prevail. . . . \u2018Consequently certain rules regarding the allocation of burdens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>and order or presentation of proof have developed in order to achieve a fair determination of \u201cthe elusive factual question of intentional discrimination.\u201d ... A three-part analysis was mandated by the Supreme Court in the case of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green[, supra, </em>] 411 U.S. 792 . . . : (1) [t]he complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) the employer must offer a legitimate reason for his actions; (3) the complainant must prove that this reason was a pretext to mask an illegal motive.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u201cUnder the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test, a prima facie case of employment discrimination through disparate treatment is established if the plaintiff shows: \u2018 \u201c(i) that he belongs to a [protected class]; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d . . .\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u201cIf the employee establishes a prima facie case, \u2018the employer must offer a legitimate reason for his actions However, the burden of persuasion never shifts to the employer; it remains at all times with the employee. ... \u2018If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the defendant bears only a burden of going forward with additional evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons. The defendant does not take on a burden of persuasion.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\u201cThe employer, in order to meet its burden of going forward with additional evidence, \u2018need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. ... It is sufficient if the [employer\u2019s] evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the [employee]. To accomplish this, the [employer] must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the [employee\u2019s] rejection. The explanation provided must be legally sufficient to justify a judgment for the [employer]. If the [employer] carries this burden of production, the presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted, and the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u201cIf the employer successfully rebuts the presumption raised by the prima facie case, \u2018the <em>McDonnell!Burdine </em>presumption \u201cdrops from the case\u201d and the factfinder must decide upon all of the evidence before it whether defendant intentionally discriminated against plaintiff. ... In short the trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>of fact decides whether it believes the employer\u2019s explanation of its actions or the employee\u2019s.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u201cIn the third stage of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test, the employee, who \u2018retains the burden of persuasion[,] . . . now must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision. This burden now merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that [the employee] has been the victim of intentional discrimination. [The employee] may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Claremont University Center </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 639, 662-664 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 151], citations and fn. omitted; accord, <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 502, 506-511 [113 S.Ct. 2742, 2746-2749, 125 L.Ed.2d 407].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Of course, we must keep in mind that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test was originally developed for use at trial, not in summary judgment proceedings. \u201cIn such pretrial proceedings, the trial court will be called upon to decide if the plaintiff has met his or her burden of establishing a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. If the employer presents admissible evidence either that one or more of plaintiff\u2019s prima facie elements is lacking, or that the adverse employment action was based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors, the employer will be entitled to summary judgment <em>unless the plaintiff produces admissible evidence which raises a triable issue of fact material to the defendant\u2019s showing. </em>In short, by applying <em>McDonnell Douglas's </em>shifting burdens of production in the context of a motion for summary judgment, \u2018the judge [will] determine whether the litigants have created an issue of fact to be decided by the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Caldwell </em>v. <em>Paramount Unified School Dist., supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 203, italics added.) Thus, \u201c \u2018[a]l-though the burden of proof in a title VII action claiming an unjustifiable refusal to [hire] ultimately rests with the plaintiff .... in the case of a motion for summary judgment or summary issue adjudication, the burden rests with the moving party to negate the plaintiff\u2019s right to prevail on a particular issue. ... In other words, the burden is reversed in the case of a summary issue adjudication or summary judgment motion. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Addy </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Bliss &amp; Glennon </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 205, 216 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 642], citations omitted.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Here, the Medical Center contends that Sada\u2019s discriminatory hiring claim fails as a matter of law because (1) she was not qualified for the job and (2) she was <em>less </em>qualified than the individuals who were actually hired. The question of whether Sada was qualified for the position involves step one of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test\u2014the prima facie case\u2014while the question of her comparative qualifications concerns step two\u2014the Medical Center\u2019s articulation of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision. (See <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>University of Minnesota </em>(8th Cir. 1994) 34 F.3d 698, 702-703; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>City Nat. Bank </em>(S.D.W.Va. 1986) 642 F.Supp. 989, 993-994, affd. (4th Cir. 1987) 836 F.2d 547.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">1. <em>Prima Facie Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The Medical Center concedes that Sada belongs to a protected class and that she applied for employment and was rejected. Its argument is that Sada cannot make out a prima facie case because she was not qualified for the job. We conclude that triable issues of material fact exist with respect to \u201cthe <em>minimal </em>requirements of [the] prima facie case.\u201d <em>(St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 506 [113 S.Ct. at p. 2727], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">We first observe that, when an employer seeks to establish on summary judgment that an applicant was not qualified for a job, it should describe the job qualifications in terms that are as specific and objective as possible. (See <em>Sempier </em>v. <em>Johnson &amp; Higgins </em>(3d Cir. 1995) 45 F.3d 724, 729; <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Prive Corp. </em>(5th Cir. 1993) 987 F.2d 324, 326-328; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Seaboard Coast Line R. Co. </em>(11th Cir. 1985) 767 F.2d 771, 774-775.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In its moving papers, the Medical Center argued that there were specific deficiencies in Sada\u2019s abilities and performance. Brendia submitted a declaration stating that, when she interviewed each job applicant, she asked a series of questions about dysrhythmia analysis. (The list of questions was attached to the summary judgment motion as an exhibit.) According to Brendia, Sada could not answer the questions. Further, Brendia claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Sada was \u201cextremely reluctant\u201d to take a basic dysrhythmia exam.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, Brendia indicated that she told Sada during the interview that, on occasion, she (Sada) did not know \u201cimportant\u201d information about her patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In opposition to the motion, Sada submitted a declaration in which she stated that (1) Brendia had never asked her any questions about dysrhythmia analysis, (2) when Brendia asked whether she would take a basic dysrhythmia exam, she responded, \u201cyes,\u201d (3) Brendia had never stated that she (Sada) lacked knowledge about her patients, and (4) the statements in Brendia\u2019s declaration on these issues were not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Plainly, by disputing each of the points made in Brendia\u2019s declaration, Sada raised triable issues of material fact with respect to the showing made by the Medical Center. In addition, Brendia testified at her deposition that Sada\u2019s past experience \u201cwasn\u2019t unsatisfactory\u201d and that Sada \u201chad [the] minimum qualifications\u201d for the position. This testimony alone indicates that Sada was sufficiently qualified to make out a prima facie case. (See <em>Hase </em>v. <em>Missouri Div. of Employment Sec. </em>(8th Cir. 1992) 972 F.2d 893, 896; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Arcata Associates, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 772 F.2d 1453, 1460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Moreover, we cannot ignore Sada\u2019s evidence that she applied for the \u201csame job\u201d that she was already performing at the Medical Center, albeit on a temporary, as-needed basis. Indeed, as of the date of the interview, Sada\u2019s performance in that position had been consistently praised by the charge nurses. Although Brendia testified that registry nurses do not perform all of the duties of a full-time nurse, the Medical Center\u2019s written policy provides that registry nurses \u201cwill meet the same expectations for Standards of Care, Practice, and Performance as those of Hospital employees.\u201d This policy statement suggests that, at a minimum, registry nurses had to be <em>capable </em>of satisfactorily performing the duties of a full-time employee, regardless of what duties they were actually assigned.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Thus, the Medical Center did not establish as a matter of law that Sada was unqualified for the position she sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>2. <em>Nondiscriminatory Reason for Failure to Hire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to refuse to hire a person \u201cbecause of\u2019 her national origin, ancestry, or other statutorily specified reasons. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (a).) The Act does not prohibit an employer from rejecting a job applicant because she is less qualified than the person selected. (See <em>Holt </em>v. <em>KMI-Continental, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1996) 95 F.3d 123,129-130; <em>Scales </em>v. <em>J.C. Bradford and Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1991) 925 F.2d 901, 907; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Seaboard Coast Line R. Co., supra, </em>767 F.2d at pp. 809-810.) (Id) Accordingly, the Medical Center argues that it did not discriminate against Sada because, as a matter of law, she was less qualified than the individuals who were hired. On this record, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">At her deposition, Sada testified that she had had more than five years of telemetry experience.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On her job application, Sada wrote, among other things: \u201cHave taken courses in critical care, basic EKG, mechanical ventilators, chemotherapy administration, management etc. I have worked as a staff and charge RN and as . . . supervisor for almost 3 years in nursing home setting. Have been in nursing for 13 years working mostly with adults and the elderly in a hospital setting. I have experience in mental health nursing also (adults and adolescents).\u201d The application also indicated that Sada had worked from August 1983 to September 1989 at McAllen Medical Center (McAllen), a hospital in Texas, where she obtained experience in \u201cRN staff, med. surg., [and] critical care.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In her declaration, Brendia expressed the opinion that Sada\u2019s past work experience did not \u201ccome close\u201d to that of the individuals who were hired. According to Brendia, of the persons hired, one had two years of telemetry experience and agreed to work at night;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> one \u201chad extremely in-depth knowledge of EKGs and had critical care experience\u201d; and another \u201chad critical care and telemetry experience\u201d which \u201cwas more suited to [the Medical Center].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Given the general and sometimes conclusory nature of Brendia\u2019s description of the applicants who were hired, we cannot say that, as a matter of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>they were more qualified than Sada. By way of example, Brendia sought to distinguish one of the hirees on the ground that she \u201chad critical care and telemetry experience.\u201d But Sada had experience in those same areas. Absent evidence indicating how much experience the hiree had or how that experience might have differed from Sada\u2019s, we cannot adequately compare the two applicants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, at her deposition, Brendia stated that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t hire anyone just on their past experience.\u201d Yet, the Medical Center has failed to indicate what factors other than past experience it considered in making the hiring decisions. Nor has it established through undisputed facts that the successful applicants were superior to Sada in some area other than past experience. Thus, viewing the evidence most favorably to Sada, we conclude that she was at least as qualified as one or more of the hirees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Finally, assuming that Sada was at least equally qualified for the job, we find that she presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue as to pretext. (See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1735 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 181] [where employer makes adequate showing of legitimate reason for its personnel decision in moving for summary judgment, employee must produce \u201csubstantial responsive evidence\u201d of pretext].) Suffice it to say that the remarks attributed to Brendia\u2014before, during, and after the job interview\u2014permit an inference that the Medical Center did not consider Sada\u2019s application on its merits but, instead, made a hiring decision based on Sada\u2019s national origin and ancestry.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In sum, the Medical Center did not establish as a matter of law that it declined to hire Sada based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. It follows that the trial court erred in adjudicating the discriminatory hiring claim in favor of the Medical Center. In reaching this conclusion, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>acknowledge that \u201c[a]n important public interest exists in preserving a hospital\u2019s ability to make managerial and policy determinations and to retain control over the general management of the hospital\u2019s business.\u201d <em>(Mateo-Woodburn </em>v. <em>Fresno Community Hospital &amp; Medical Center </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1169, 1184-1185 [270 Cal.Rptr. 894].)  \u201cThis Court does not sit as a super-personnel department that reexamines an entity\u2019s business decisions. . . . The question is not whether the [employer] exercised prudent business judgment [but whether it made an unlawful hiring decision].\u201d <em>(Dale </em>v. <em>Chicago Tribune Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1986) 797 F.2d 458, 464, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The evidence before us strongly suggests that, because of her national origin and ancestry, Sada may have been rejected for a full-time nursing position for which she was at least as qualified as some of the successful applicants. By directing that the case proceed to trial, we do not substitute our legal judgment for the employer\u2019s medical knowledge. Rather, we only give effect to the FEHA\u2019s founding principle that \u201cdenying employment opportunity ... for [unlawful] reasons foments domestic strife and unrest, deprives the state of the fullest utilization of its capacities for development and advance, and substantially and adversely affects the interest of employees, employers, and the public in general.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12920.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">B. <em>Retaliatory Termination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The FEHA makes it unlawful \u201c[f]or any employer ... to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person [(1)] because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this [Act] or [(2)] because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this [Act].\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (f).)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">As with Sada\u2019s discriminatory hiring claim, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test applies in evaluating the propriety of summary judgment on her retaliation claim. (See <em>Flait </em>v. <em>North American Watch Corp. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 467 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 522]; <em>Addy </em>v. <em>Bliss &amp; Glennon, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at pp. 215-217.) In a retaliation case, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test \u201crequire[s] that (1) the plaintiff establish a prima facie case of retaliation, (2) the defendant articulate a legitimate nonretaliatory explanation for its acts, and (3) the plaintiff show that the defendant\u2019s proffered explanation is merely a pretext for the illegal termination. ... [f] To establish a prima facie case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the plaintiff must show that he engaged in a protected activity, [the] employer subjected him to adverse employment action, and there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer\u2019s action. ...[*][]... [f] Pretext may ... be inferred from the timing of the company\u2019s termination decision, by the identity of the person making the decision, and by the terminated employee\u2019s job performance before termination.\u201d <em>(Flait </em>v. <em>North American Watch Corp., supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at pp. 476-479, citations omitted.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The Medical Center argues that Sada\u2019s retaliation claim fails as a matter of law because (1) she was terminated for a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason (i.e., her unsatisfactory performance) and (2) the FEHA does not protect an independent contractor from retaliation. We discuss these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">1. <em>Nonretaliatory Reason for Termination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The Medical Center contends that Sada was terminated because of serious patient care errors that were discovered when Pat Heasley evaluated her performance on July 28, 1994.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On August 3, 1994, Sada wrote to the Medical Center, denying that she had committed any mistakes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In her declaration opposing summary judgment, Sada also stated that the accusations in the evaluation were false. As a result, there are triable issues of material fact with respect to the Medical Center\u2019s stated reason for terminating Sada.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Further, Sada presented sufficient evidence of pretext: the evidence supports an inference that the Medical Center\u2019s stated reason for its decision was merely a subterfuge for retaliatory conduct. Until Brendia learned that Sada had complained to the DFEH about the Medical Center\u2019s hiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>decision, Sada had received oral compliments on her work and 13 written evaluations that praised her performance. She had not received any criticism of her work, either orally or in writing. After the Medical Center failed to hire Sada as a full-time nurse (on June 6, 1994), it continued to use her services on a temporary basis, presumably because it was satisfied with her abilities. Brendia learned about Sada\u2019s DFEH complaint on or about July 26, 1994. Two days later, at Brendia\u2019s direction, Sada\u2019s performance was \u201creevaluated.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> That evaluation was conducted by Heasley, who had previously been \u201cwritten up\u201d after Sada reported Heasley\u2019s inadequate performance to a physician. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>Based on Sada\u2019s evaluation\u2014the first to criticize her\u2014Brendia decided to terminate Sada\u2019s services. A few months later, Brendia commented: \u201cThose Mexicans. Sada better drop her lawsuit. We are going to send all their asses back to Mexico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">In light of several factors\u2014the timing of the Medical Center\u2019s termination decision (i.e., a few days after Brendia learned about Sada\u2019s DFEH complaint), the identity of the person making the decision (i.e., a supervisor who made anti-Mexican remarks before and after rejecting Sada for full-time employment), and Sada\u2019s job performance before termination (i.e., praiseworthy until Brendia ordered a \u201creevaluation\u201d)\u2014we conclude that Sada raised a triable issue as to whether the Medical Center terminated her in retaliation for her DFEH complaint.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">2. <em>FEHA Coverage of Nonemployees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">As stated, the FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against \u201cany person\u201d for opposing practices prohibited by the Act or for participating in proceedings under the Act. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (f).) The Medical Center argues that Sada cannot maintain a retaliation claim because the FEHA does not protect independent contractors from retaliation. Sada <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>counters that we should interpret the term \u201cany person\u201d in accordance with its plain meaning, which would include her.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Where constitutional rights are involved, public employers may be prohibited from retaliating against independent contractors. (See <em>Board of County Commrs. </em>v. <em>Umbehr </em>(1996) 518 U.S. _ [116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843] [First Amendment of federal Constitution prevents government employer from terminating at-will contract of independent contractor in retaliation for contractor\u2019s criticism of government]; <em>O\u2019Hare Truck Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Northlake </em>(1996) 518 U.S. _ [116 S.Ct. 2353, 135 L.Ed.2d 874] [independent contractors are covered by First Amendment rule that public employees cannot be discharged for refusing to support political party or its candidates unless party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for effective performance of job].) However, under antidiscrimination statutes, independent contractors arguably do not fare as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The Medical Center argues forcefully that the FEHA does not apply to independent contractors. The Fair Employment and Housing Commission (FEHC), the administrative agency charged with interpreting the Act (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 12935, subds. (a), (h)), has consistently taken the position, through its decisions and regulations, that the Act affords no protection to independent contractors <em>qua </em>independent contractors. (See <em>Dept. Fair Empl. &amp; Hous. </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hospital and Health Center </em>(1987) No. 87-24, FEHA Precedential Decs. 1986-1987, CEB 10, pp. 5-7; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7286.5, subd. (b)(1); see also <em>Lumia </em>v. <em>Roper Pump Co. </em>(N.D. Cal. 1989) 724 F.Supp. 694, 697-698 [adopting FEHC\u2019s position in age discrimination case].)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Further, to the extent that the California Fair Employment Practice Act, the predecessor of the FEHA, was modeled after New York\u2019s antidiscrimination law (see <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 237), we note that New York courts have held that their statute \u201capplies solely to employees and not to independent contractors.\u201d <em>(Mehtani </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 145 A.D.2d 90, 93 [537 N.Y.S.2d 800, 802] [construing N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296(1)(a) (McKinney 1993), derived from former N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 131(1) (1945 N.Y. Laws, ch. 118, \u00a7 1)]; accord, <em>Sone </em>v. <em>Tsumura </em>(1995) 222 A.D.2d 231, 232 [634 N.Y.S.2d 689, 691].) Moreover, Title VIPs antidiscrimination provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1))<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> has been interpreted to exclude independent contractors. (See, e.g., <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Rush North Shore Medical Center </em>(7th Cir. 1996) 101 F.3d 487, 491-492; <em>Wilde </em>v. <em>County of Kandiyohi </em>(8th Cir. 1994) 15 F.3d 103, 104; <em>Tadros </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1989) 717 F.Supp. 996, 1002-1006, affd. (2d Cir. 1990) 898 F.2d 10; see also <em>Falls </em>v. <em>Sporting News Pub. Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1987) 834 F.2d 611, 613 [Michigan statute prohibiting employers from discriminating against \u201can individual\u201d does not apply to independent contractors].)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Nevertheless, regardless of the strength of the Medical Center\u2019s argument, we find it unnecessary to decide in this case whether the FEHA protects independent contractors against retaliation. This is so because Sada\u2019s termination claim is not premised on her status as an independent contractor. Rather, she was allegedly retaliated against because she complained about discrimination as an <em>applicant for an employee position.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Unquestionably, the FEHA\u2019s antidiscrimination provision protects applicants for employee positions from discrimination based on national origin, ancestry, and other specified grounds. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12940, subd. (a), 12941, subd. (a).) That provision makes it actionable for an employer \u201cto refuse to hire or employ [a] <em>person </em>... or to discharge [a] person from employment\u201d for an unlawful discriminatory reason. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (a), italics added; see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 12941.) Thus, the statutory language makes clear that an applicant\u2014a \u201cperson\u201d who seeks to be hired or employed\u2014is protected against discrimination.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">As stated, the FEHA\u2019s antiretaliation provision makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cdischarge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against <em>any person </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this [Act] or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this [Act].\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (f), italics added.) We can think of no reason why the word \u201cperson,\u201d as used in the antidiscrimination provision, should be interpreted more narrowly for purposes of the antiretaliation provision. Significantly, the Legislature has directed that \u201c[t]he provisions of [the Act] ... be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12993, subd. (a).) One of the primary goals of the prohibition on discrimination\u2014to eliminate bias in hiring\u2014would be undermined if an employer could lawfully retaliate against an applicant because she had complained about discriminatory hiring practices. The antiretaliation provision should not be interpreted in a way that encourages silence among those who reasonably believe that an employer has refused to hire them for prohibited reasons.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> To effectively remedy discrimination in hiring, an applicant should be able to come forward with her complaint without fear of reprisal.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Consequently, we conclude that the antiretaliation provision of the FEHA covers applicants for employee positions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">It does not matter that the Medical Center may have retaliated against Sada <em>after </em>the hiring decision was made, i.e., when Sada was technically a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201cformer applicant.\u201d By definition, \u201cretaliation\u201d occurs only after the applicant has complained about not getting the job or after she has begun to participate in a proceeding under the Act. At that point, she is obviously no longer applying for the position. She is nonetheless permitted to pursue a retaliation claim because it arises out of the employer\u2019s allegedly discriminatory rejection of her as an applicant. To hold otherwise would insulate a whole category of retaliatory conduct from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">For similar reasons, the United States Supreme Court recently held that Title VII\u2019s antiretaliation provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a)) applies to former, as well as current, employees even though Title VII expressly covers \u201cemployees,\u201d not \u201cformer employees.\u201d <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(1997) 519 U.S__[117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808]; see fn. 25, <em>ante </em>[quoting Title VII antiretaliation provision].) In <em>Robinson, </em>the plaintiff filed an administrative charge of race discrimination against his former employer after he had been discharged. While the charge was pending, the plaintiff applied for a job with another company. The former employer allegedly retaliated against the plaintiff by giving the prospective employer a negative job reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In holding that Title VII prohibits postemployment retaliation, the high court explained: \u201c[The plaintiff] argues that the word \u2018employees\u2019 includes former employees because to hold otherwise would effectively vitiate much of the protection afforded by [the antiretaliation provision]. . . . According to [the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)], exclusion of former employees from the protection of [the antiretaliation provision] would undermine the effectiveness of Title VII by allowing the threat of post-employment retaliation to deter victims of discrimination from complaining to EEOC ....[']{] Those arguments carry persuasive force given their coherence and their consistency with a primary purpose of antiretaliation provisions: Maintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms. . . . EEOC quite persuasively maintains that it would be destructive of this purpose of the antiretaliation provision for an employer to be able to retaliate with impunity against an entire class of acts under Title VII\u2014for example, complaints regarding discriminatory termination.\u201d (519 U.S. at p\u2014 [117 S.Ct. at pp. 848-849].) We believe that this same analysis applies to an applicant\u2019s complaint about discriminatory hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Finally, we conclude that Sada\u2019s termination as a temporary nurse was a form of prohibited retaliation. Although the Act does not actually use the words \u201cretaliate\u201d or \u201cretaliation,\u201d it does broadly prohibit an employer from \u201cdischarging], expel[ling], or otherwise discriminating]\u201d against any person because she has engaged in protected activity. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (f).) The FEHC has interpreted the Act to prohibit a variety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>retaliatory conduct, including the denial or loss of compensation. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 7287.8, subd. (a), 7286.5, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We think it plain that Sada was \u201cexpelled\u201d or \u201cdischarged\u201d from the Medical Center. She was also denied further compensation as a temporary nurse. Put simply, if a negative job reference can constitute an unlawful form of retaliation (see <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>519 U.S._[117 S.Ct. 843,136 L.Ed.2d 808]; <em>Rutherford </em>v. <em>American Bank of Commerce </em>(10th Cir. 1977) 565 F.2d 1162, 1164), so can the loss of compensation from temporary work. (See also 1 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law (3d ed. 1996) pp. 668-671 [discussing types of prohibited retaliatory conduct].</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in adjudicating the retaliation claim in favor of the Medical Center by way of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">C.-E<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The judgment is affirmed with respect to the adjudication of the cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

(See <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Jeffer, Mangels, Butler &amp; Marmaro </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 620, 635 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 329].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test is typically used in cases where the plaintiff lacks \u201cdirect\u201d evidence of the employer\u2019s discriminatory intent. <em>(Heard </em>v. <em>Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1735, 1748-1749 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 620] [discussing direct evidence cases, including \u201cmixed motive\u201d cases].) Both parties to this appeal rely on the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test, and we therefore do the same.

Second, if the Medical Center had wanted the answers to those questions, it could have filed a motion to compel. Finally, Sada stated in her declaration that she was not asked any such questions during the job selection process.

Consequently, we reject the Medical Center\u2019s assertion that the job application misstated Sada\u2019s position at McAllen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The Medical Center offered no evidence that Sada was unwilling to work at night or that she was even asked whether she would do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The Medical Center contends that, based on Sada\u2019s job application, Brendia believed during the job interview that Sada had only six months of telemetry experience (instead of approximately five years) and that she had had a break in employment of four years (instead of one and one-half years). However, even if we use Brendia\u2019s figures, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that Sada was less qualified than, for example, the hiree whose critical care and telemetry experience was not described in the summary judgment motion in any detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The evidence concerning Sada\u2019s qualifications (e.g., her deposition testimony and the information on her job application) does not consist of conclusory allegations or mere self-serving opinions. (See, e.g., <em>Sample </em>v. <em>Aldi Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1995) 61 F.3d 544, 549; <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>B. Green and Co., Inc. </em>(4th Cir. 1988) 836 F.2d 845, 848.) Consequently, the evidence is adequate to establish her qualifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Brendia\u2019s derogatory comments about Mexicans and her statements to Sada during the job interview raise a triable issue of fact as to pretext. They do not constitute the type of isolated or stray remarks that are immaterial in proving a discriminatory motive. (See, e.g., <em>Nesbit </em>v. <em>Pepsico, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 994 F.2d 703, 705; <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Group </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 892 F.2d 1434, 1438-1439; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Kemper Life Ins.

According to Brendia, she told Sada during the interview that, at some point in the future, Sada\u2019s performance would be reevaluated. Sada has denied that any such statements were made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The Medical Center emphasizes that the performance evaluation which lead to Sada\u2019s termination was performed by Heasley, who did not know about Sada\u2019s complaint to the DFEH. However, Brendia, who did know about the complaint, was the person who ordered the \u201creevaluation\u201d in the first place, and she terminated Sada\u2019s services based on Heasley\u2019s accusations. Moreover, according to Sada, Heasley had personal reasons to falsely criticize her performance. In light of this and other evidence of pretext, Heasley\u2019s lack of knowledge of the DFEH complaint does not dispose of the retaliation claim as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\">At the time Sada was terminated, the Act defined \u201cperson\u201d as including \u201cone or more individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, legal representatives, trustees in bankruptcy, and receivers or other fiduciaries.\" (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12925, subd. (d), added by Stats. 1980, ch. 992, \u00a74, p. 3143.)

Similarly, the FEHC\u2019s decisions and regulations apply the antidiscrimination provision to applicants. (See <em>Dept. Fair Empl.

(See <em>Flait </em>v. <em>North American Watch Corp., supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at o. 477.) Under the participation clause, an applicant is protected from retaliation regardless of the ultimate resolution of the underlying charge.
