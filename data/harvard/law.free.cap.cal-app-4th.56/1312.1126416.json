Further, the trial court properly found that due to the presence of special topographic circumstances, signs conforming to the ordinance would be materially less visible and less effective than the existing signs, and that plaintiffs therefore are entitled to retain their current signs. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">The City was incorporated in 1982. In 1985, the city council adopted Ordinance No. 75, which regulated signage within the City. The ordinance later was codified as Agoura Hills Municipal Code (AHMC) section 9655 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Pursuant to the ordinance, with certain exceptions, all freestanding or pole signs became nonconforming upon adoption of the ordinance, and subject to removal on March 19, 1992, upon expiration of a seven-year amortization period specified in the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">The plaintiff businesses include fast-food restaurants and gasoline service stations. The business establishments and their signs all predate the enactment of the ordinance. The signs in issue are freestanding or pole signs bearing the names or logos of plaintiffs\u2019 businesses. Many of the signs are highly visible from the Ventura Freeway due to their height and size. Plaintiffs filed applications for variances with the City\u2019s planning commission. The applications were denied, as were the subsequent appeals to the city council. The city council determined the pole sign owners had failed to demonstrate any \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to warrant the grant of any variances, and if the applicants were allowed to retain their pole signs, it would be inequitable to new and existing businesses which are not allowed to erect or maintain pole signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">Plaintiffs then filed their actions in the superior court seeking injunctive, declaratory and/or mandamus relief pursuant to section 5499 to prevent enforcement of the ordinance requiring removal of the pole signs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The actions were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">The matter was bifurcated. The threshold issue tried was whether the City\u2019s ordinance is preempted by section 5499. With the parties\u2019 consent, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>matter was submitted on declarations and exhibits, without live testimony. The trial court also traveled the freeway corridor in both directions to view the existing signage, the terrain, and the potential impact on the visibility of plaintiffs\u2019 businesses if the pole signs were eliminated and replaced by conforming signage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">1. <em>Trial court\u2019s ruling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">In an extensive statement of decision, the trial court ruled, inter alia:</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">The ordinance is within, and forbidden by, section 5499 because the statute prohibits local proscription of signs based on height, and that is precisely what the ordinance does. Although the City contended the ordinance categorically forbids all pole signs, not just pole signs exceeding a certain height, the ordinance was height based, in that short pole signs are not wholly forbidden. \u201cThe ordinance plainly discriminates between tall signs and short signs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">With respect to whether special topographic circumstances existed to preclude enforcement of the height-based ordinance, the trial court concluded the term \u201ctopography\u201d connotes not only natural surface contours but rather, \u201call nontemporary surface conditions of whatever origin.\u201d Further, \u201cthe term \u2018special topographic circumstances\u2019 is not to be taken as an isolated term, but rather to be read in the context of the whole statutory passage, and the subject matter that the Legislature had in view. Thus read in context, it seems plain that by the text \u2018special topographic circumstances . . . resulting] in a material impairment of visibility of the display . . . ,\u2019 the Legislature meant any material visual impediment other than the natural limits of human eyesight, based on the unique specifics of the particular site, sign, and visual obstructions. . . . [H Thus, <em>all </em>\u2018circumstances\u2019 must be taken into account, including not only nature\u2019s hills and trees, but also variant height terrain and vision interruptions from any other source, the height and size of the acclivity and concrete structure of the Kanan Road overpass, the building structures in the area, utility poles and wires, vehicles traveling the freeway, etc. [f] The evidence clearly establishes that these special topographic circumstances would materially impair the visibility of conforming signs for each plaintiff.\u201d Therefore, plaintiffs were \u201centitled to prevail, first of all, based on the material impairment of raw visibility, . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">As an alternative and additional basis for its decision, the trial court observed section 5499 has a disjunctive component to be analyzed, namely, whether \u201cspecial topographic circumstances would result in a material impairment of . . . the owner\u2019s or user\u2019s ability to adequately and effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>continue to communicate with the public through the use of the display.\u201d (\u00a7 5499.) From the disjunctive second element, \u201cit seems plain that the Legislature was concerned with something more than the \u2018raw\u2019 or \u2018naked\u2019 visibility of the sign, ... It is evident that the Legislature was also concerned with the communicative quality of the sign, on top of the sign\u2019s raw visibility. [*H \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HO \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [Tjhis second statutory element requires at a minimum a circumstantial analysis of not only the simple visibility of the sign, but also whether the sign will be <em>noticed, </em>and the message imparted to the viewer\u2019s brain. . . . [*]Q The additional circumstances bearing on notice-ability, or perceptibility, would include the origin and nature of the customer base and buying motivation, general visibility in the area, the high speed, high volume nature of the freeway, location of decision points for motorists along the freeway, identification time and reaction time, and time to make safe lane changes. . . . [U . . . [T]he evidence clearly establishes that these special topographic circumstances would materially impair the noticeability, or perceptibility, of conforming signs for each plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">The trial court went on to find as to each of the plaintiffs, there would be \u201ca material impairment in the commercial effectiveness of a conforming sign.\u201d Each of the businesses \u201crelies on its existing sign to attract customers . . . substantially . . . from the freeway . . . .\u201d The trial court reviewed the individual circumstances of the various businesses involved, and found, inter alia, a conforming sign would not be visible at all from the freeway, or that a conforming sign would not be visible to freeway motorists in time to exit safely at the off-ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Based thereon, the trial court declared the attempted enforcement of the sign ordinance against these plaintiffs was in contravention of section 5499 and invalid, and that plaintiffs were entitled to maintain the disputed signage at their premises. The trial court also enjoined the City from enforcing the ordinance against the signs at issue herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">The City appealed the judgment. The plaintiffs filed protective cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">The City contends the judgment should be reversed for three primary reasons: the ordinance does not regulate signs \u201con the basis of height or size,\u201d and therefore is not within the prohibitory scope of section 5499; even if the ordinance regulates advertising displays on the basis of height or size, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the existence of \u201cspecial topographic circumstances\u201d which would permit them to take advantage of section 5499, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>failed to demonstrate that by reason of such \u201cspecial topographic circumstances,\u201d prohibiting the use of pole signs would materially impair the visibility of their businesses; and the trial court deprived the City of a fair trial when it quashed the City\u2019s trial subpoenas, which sought evidence from third party witnesses as to the equal effectiveness of signage other than freestanding pole signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">1. <em>The statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqqU\">a. <em>Historical overview.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">Section 5499 originally was enacted in 1983 as part of Senate Bill No. 142, which added section 5490 et seq. to the Business and Professions Code. (Stats. 1983, ch. 1232, \u00a7 1, pp. 4801-4805; 4 Stats. 1983 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., ch. 1232, p. 453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">At that time, existing law provided generally that governmental entities were prohibited from compelling the removal of any lawfully erected outdoor advertising display unless just compensation were paid to the owner. The prohibition did not apply to certain on-premises displays. The new legislation enacted provisions to prohibit any city or county from requiring the removal of <em>on-premises </em>advertising displays without payment of fair and just compensation. (4 Stats. 1983 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., ch. 1232, pp. 453-454.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">Section 5499, as adopted, stated: \u201cNo city or county shall require the removal of any on-premise advertising display <em>on the basis of its height </em>if special topographic circumstances would result in a material impairment of visibility of the sign or the owner\u2019s ability to adequately and effectively continue to communicate with the public through the use of the on-premise advertising display by conformance with any ordinance or regulation of any city or county, introduced or adopted after March 12, 1983. Under these circumstances, the owner or user may maintain advertising displays at the business premise and at a location necessary to accomplish continued noticeability at the height the display was previously erected and in doing so, the owner or user is in conformance.\u201d (Stats. 1983, ch. 1232, \u00a7 1, p. 4805, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">Section 5490 et seq. was a response to the efforts of local jurisdictions to regulate outdoor signage in accordance with changing aesthetic views. It would appear section 5499 was included as a grandfather provision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>exempt from local signage ordinances those businesses which were unable, due to special topographic circumstances, to utilize alternative advertising displays to achieve continued public visibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">In 1986, the Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 286 to clarify Senate Bill No. 142 in certain respects not relevant here. Section 5499 was repealed and reenacted in substantially the same form. (Stats. 1986, ch. 513, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, p. 1849.) The new version of section 5499, which remains on the books, provides: \u201cRegardless of any other provision of this chapter or other law, no city or county shall require the removal of any on-premises advertising display on the basis of its <em>height or size </em>by requiring conformance with any ordinance or regulation introduced or adopted on or after March 12, 1983, if special topographic circumstances would result in a material impairment of visibility of the display or the owner\u2019s or user\u2019s ability to adequately and effectively continue to communicate with the public through the use of the display. Under these circumstances, the owner or user may maintain the advertising display at the business premises and at a location necessary for continued public visibility at the height or size at which the display was previously erected and, in doing so, the owner or user is in conformance.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Thus, the statute essentially contains a two-part test. First, does the local ordinance require removal of a sign based on its height or size? If so, would special topographic circumstances cause a conforming sign to be materially less visible or less effective at communicating the owner\u2019s message to the public?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">b. <em>Principles of statutory interpretation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">In approaching the issue, we are mindful \u201c[t]he fundamental task of statutory construction is to \u2018ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.] In order to determine this intent, we begin by examining the language of the statute.\u2019 [Citation.] The words of a statute are to be interpreted in the sense in which they would have been understood at the time of the enactment. [Citations.]\u2019\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 774-775 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731]; accord, <em>Resure, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 156, 164 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 354].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">2. <em>The City\u2019s ordinance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">The City enacted an extensive sign ordinance \u201cwith particular regard to developing a city that is visually attractive and to preserving and enhancing the visual qualities of the community\u2019s streets and highways.\u201d (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.) To eliminate visual blight, the ordinance prohibits various types of signs. (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">AHMC section 9655.3, which sets forth the types of signs that are banned, prohibits, inter alia, <em>\u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, freestanding or pole signs, except for on-site directional signs.\u201d </em>(AHMC, \u00a7 9655.3(L) italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">The ordinance defines a <em>\u201cfreestanding pole sign\u201d </em>as \u201ca sign supported by uprights or braces placed upon or into the ground and detached from any building.\u201d (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.2(L).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">The issue presented is whether the ordinance bars pole signs based on their height or size, so as to implicate section 5499. The City argues the statute is inapplicable because its ordinance categorically prohibits <em>all </em>pole signs. Plaintiffs contend, and the trial court agreed, the statute does apply because the ordinance regulates pole signs on the basis of height or size by exempting various shorter pole signs from the ordinance\u2019s general prohibition on pole signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>a. <em>Trial court properly found section 5499 is implicated because the ordinance prohibits the subject pole signs based on their height and size.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">As indicated, the trial court found the ordinance regulates plaintiffs\u2019 signs based on their height and size, and therefore the ordinance is within the ambit of the statute. Our scrutiny of the ordinance lead us to concur in the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">The ordinance does not prohibit all pole signs. AHMC section 9655.3(L), while prohibiting freestanding or pole signs generally, expressly permits \u201con-site directional signs\u201d as well as freestanding or pole signs \u201cas hereinafter provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">Pole signs \u201chereinafter provided\u201d in the AHMC include: signs expressing a political, social, religious or other noncommercial message, not exceeding eighteen square feet in area and, if located on a stake, not exceeding six feet in height (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.4(D)(6)); residential nameplates, not exceeding two square feet in area and, when attached to a stake, not more than four feet in height (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.6(A)(1)); agricultural signs, not exceeding six square feet in area and, when attached to a stake, not more than six feet in height (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.6(A)(2)); residential real estate advertising signs, or garage sale signs, not exceeding six square feet in area and six feet in height (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.6(A)(3) and (6)); real estate open house signs, not exceeding three square feet in area and, if located on a stake, not exceeding four feet in height (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.6(A)(4)); gasoline price signs, not exceeding twenty square feet in area and six feet in height (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.6(C)(15)(a));<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and commercial real estate advertising signs, not exceeding fifteen square feet in area and six feet in height (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.6(C)(18)(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">Thus, it is readily apparent the ordinance does not categorically prohibit freestanding or pole signs. Numerous types of <em>shorter </em>freestanding or pole signs, including commercial signs, are permitted. Therefore, it follows the ordinance bars plaintiffs\u2019 signs based on their height and size.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">b. <em>The City\u2019s arguments are without merit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">The City\u2019s basic argument is that the ordinance does not require removal of the subject signs based on their height or size. Rather, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>City, the ordinance prohibits pole signs as a class or type. Plaintiffs, in turn, contend the City\u2019s claim it has categorically prohibited all pole signs is a sham in that the City allows short pole signs but prohibits taller pole signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">In response, the City argues the short pole signs which are permitted under the AHMC are really not pole signs at all. The City cites, inter alia, the following definition of \u201cpole sign\u201d in a declaration by one of plaintiffs\u2019 experts: \u201cAs a matter of common understanding, both in the sign industry and among the regulatory agencies, \u2018pole signs\u2019 are signs of considerable size and height, at least 6 feet of grade clearance beneath the sign. The term is not generally used to refer to small real estate signs or similar small signs, even when they are mounted on a stake and physically resemble small versions of pole signs. Although the concepts are vague, as a rule of thumb, generally the term \u2018pole sign\u2019 is reserved for a sign mounted on a pole or other support that one can walk under.\u201d Therefore, according to the City, \u201creal estate \u2018for sale\u2019 signs, political placards . . . and Westec security signs are simply not \u2018pole signs.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">The City\u2019s contention pole signs are inherently tall, and that the ordinance contains a blanket prohibition on pole signs, is unpersuasive. The ordinance defines <em>\u201cfreestanding pole </em>sign\u201d to refer to signs \u201csupported by uprights or braces placed upon or into the ground and detached from any building.\u201d (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.2(L).) Thus, the ordinance defines \u201cfreestanding pole sign\u201d without regard to height.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Further, the ordinance provides pole signs, \u201c[ejxcept as hereinafter provided,\u201d are prohibited. (AHMC, \u00a7 9655.3(L).) As explained above, the pole signs \u201chereinafter provided\u201d for by the ordinance are various shorter pole signs. Therefore, the City\u2019s own ordinance regards these smaller pole signs as permissible pole signs. If, as the City argues, it has categorically banned all pole signs and small pole signs are really not pole signs, the \u201c[ejxcept as hereinafter\u201d language in AHMC section 9655.3(L) would be rendered surplusage. Such an interpretation is to be avoided. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 484 [208 Cal.Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">The City also argues the trial court ignored evidence the ordinance does not in fact regulate based on height. The City asserts the trial court failed to consider there are many legal, conforming signs in the City which are taller and larger in surface area than the subject pole signs which the City seeks to remove. For example, the Radisson Hotel\u2019s wall sign is 57 feet above ground and is legal, even though it is higher than many of plaintiffs\u2019 pole signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>The contention likewise is unpersuasive. The fact the City permits <em>wall </em>signs on buildings does not alter the fact the City permits short pole signs and prohibits those pole signs which are large or tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">In sum, contrary to the City\u2019s argument, the ordinance does not ban \u201cpole signs\u201d as a class. Rather, the ordinance bans those pole signs which are large or tall. Because the ordinance regulates pole signs on the basis of height and size, the trial court properly found section 5499 is implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">3. <em>Trial court properly found special topographic circumstances entitle plaintiffs to retain their signs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">As noted, section 5499 mandates a two-part analysis of local sign restrictions. The first question is whether the restriction requires removal of a sign based on its height or size. Once it is determined the restriction is height or size based, the inquiry is whether the terrain would impair the function of a conforming sign. Having concurred with the trial court that the ordinance requires removal of plaintiffs\u2019 signs based on their height and size, the remaining issue is whether special topographic circumstances are present so as to bring plaintiffs within the protection of section 5499.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">a. <em>Topography is not limited to natural contours.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">The trial court construed \u201ctopographic circumstances\u201d within section 5499 as \u201call nontemporary surface conditions of whatever origin.\u201d The City contends the trial court\u2019s interpretation was overbroad. The City argues topographic circumstances refer solely to <em>naturally occurring </em>topographic surface contours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">The trial court properly rejected the City\u2019s narrow definition. \u201cTopography\u201d is defined in the dictionary as \u201cthe configuration of a surface including its relief and the position of its natural <em>and man-made </em>features . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1986) p. 2411, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">Even assuming the City\u2019s definition were tenable, \u201c[wjhere a statute is theoretically capable of more than one construction we choose that which most comports with the intent of the Legislature. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(California Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 836, 844 [157 Cal.Rptr. 676, 598 P.2d 836].)  Clearly, the Legislature intended to protect business owners where the topography is such that a conforming sign would be inadequate to communicate with the public. Therefore, the trial court properly held the term \u201ctopographic circumstances\u201d embraces man-made features as well as the land\u2019s natural contours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>Having said that, it appears the trial court\u2019s interpretation was somewhat overbroad. The trial court ruled \u201ctopographic circumstances\u201d includes \u201cnot only nature\u2019s hills and trees, but also variant height terrain and vision interruptions from any other source, the height and size of the acclivity and concrete structure of the Kanan Road overpass, the building structures in the area, utility poles and wires, <em>vehicles traveling the freeway, </em>etc.\u201d (Italics added.) It would appear traffic is not a topographic circumstance, in that topography connotes the fixed surface features of the land. However, the error was harmless because, as discussed below, the record amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding special topographic circumstances are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">b. <em>Special topographic circumstances do not mean unique or exceptional circumstances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">The trial court concluded that by the term \u201cspecial topographic circumstances . . . resulting] in a material impairment of visibility of the display\u201d (\u00a7 5499), the Legislature meant \u201cany material visual impediment other than the natural limits of human eyesight, based on the unique specifics of the particular site, sign, and visual obstructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">Here again, the City criticizes the trial court\u2019s interpretation as overbroad. The City emphasizes the Legislature used the term \u201cspecial topographic circumstances,\u201d not <em>\u201cany </em>topographic circumstances\u201d or \u201cany <em>material visual </em>impediment.\u201d According to the City, \u201cspecial topographic circumstances\u201d must be read as requiring unique or exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">We are mindful the word \u201cspecial\u201d has numerous meanings. One definition is \u201cdistinguished by some unusual quality: uncommon, noteworthy, extraordinary.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict., <em>supra, </em>p. 2186.) However, \u201cspecial\u201d also is synonymous with \u201cparticular\u201d or \u201cindividual.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">Again, we observe that courts \u201c \u2018must give statutes a reasonable construction which conforms to the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Webster </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 338, 344 [250 Cal.Rptr. 268, 758 P.2d 596].) The Legislature\u2019s apparent purpose in enacting section 5499 was to protect the owner or user of an existing sign from a new signage ordinance in a situation where the topographic circumstances would make a conforming sign either materially less visible <em>or </em>less effective. Therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the statute\u2019s requirement of \u201cspecial\u201d topographic circumstances simply to mean <em>particular </em>or <em>individual </em>topographic circumstances which would make a conforming sign inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">To construe section 5499 as requiring an owner to make the lofty showing being urged by the City would be to defeat the purpose of the statute. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>trial court observed, in a state as large and geographically diverse as California, hardly any topography is unique or extraordinary. If that were what is required, few sign owners could avail themselves of the protection of the statute. Given the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting section 5499, the City\u2019s interpretation is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">c. <em>Special topographic circumstances relate to both the visibility and the commercial effectiveness of a conforming sign.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">Section 5499 protects the owner or user of an existing sign \u201cif special topographic circumstances would result in a material impairment of visibility of the display <em>or </em>the owner\u2019s or user\u2019s ability to adequately and effectively continue to communicate with the public through the use of the display.\u201d (Italics added.) These elements are in the disjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">Consequently, the trial court found the Legislature was concerned not only with what the trial court described as the \u201craw visibility\u201d of a conforming sign, but also, with whether such a sign would be commercially effective. Therefore, in addition to the sign\u2019s \u201csimple visibility,\u201d the trial court examined \u201cwhether the sign will be <em>noticed, </em>and the message imparted to the viewer\u2019s brain. ...[*]\u25a1 The additional circumstances bearing on noticeability, or perceptibility, would include the origin and nature of the customer base and buying motivation, general visibility in the area, the high speed, high volume nature of the freeway, location of decision points for motorists along the freeway, identification time and reaction time, and time to make safe lane changes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">Given the language of the statute, the trial court\u2019s examination of these various factors was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">d. <em>Substantial evidence supports trial court\u2019s finding of special topographic circumstances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">Having determined the trial court\u2019s legal interpretation of section 5499 was sound, the remaining issue is whether there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings concerning special topographic circumstances. In that regard, the trial court made alternative findings. It found the individual topographic circumstances \u201cwould materially impair the visibility of conforming signs for each plaintiff.\u201d In addition, the trial court found said circumstances would materially impair the owner\u2019s ability to communicate adequately and effectively with the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">As indicated, the trial court personally toured the freeway corridor in both directions to view the existing signage, the terrain, and the potential impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>on the visibility of respondents\u2019 businesses if the pole signs were eliminated and replaced by conforming signage. Therefore, the trial court was in the best position to determine whether the particular topographic circumstances would make a conforming sign materially less visible or less effective.  It is settled \u201cthat a view of the scene by the trial judge is independent evidence on which a finding may be made and sustained <em>(Otey </em>v. <em>Carmel Sanitary Dist. </em>[(1933)] 219 Cal. 310, 312 [26 P.2d 308]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 140).\u201d <em>(Hutcherson </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 126, 131 [70 Cal.Rptr. 366]; accord, <em>Gates </em>v. <em>McKinnon </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 179, 182-183 [114 P.2d 576]; <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>City of Pomona </em>(1947) 82 Cal.App.2d 622, 624-625 [186 P.2d 447]; see, generally, 2 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) Demonstrative, Experimental and Scientific Evidence, \u00a7 851, pp. 816-817.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">The record on appeal provides further support for the trial court\u2019s factual findings. The trial exhibits include photographs of plaintiffs\u2019 existing signs viewed from the perspective of a motorist on the freeway. In a second set of photographs, each of the nonconforming signs was digitally removed and the image revised by digitally inserting a hypothetical sign conforming to the ordinance. Given the drastic difference in these images between the existing and hypothetical signs in terms of visibility and visual impact, there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that conforming signs would be materially less visible or less effective at conveying the owner\u2019s messages to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">4. <em>No prejudicial error in quashing of the City\u2019s subpoenas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">On an ex parte application by Texaco, the trial court quashed numerous trial subpoenas for business records which the City had served on custodians of similar businesses in nearby communities which do not allow pole signs. The City asserts it was denied a fair trial because the gross sales information sought by the subpoenas would have borne directly on the test set forth in section 5499, namely, whether requiring removal of the pole signs would materially impair the businesses\u2019 \u201cability to adequately and effectively continue to communicate with the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">The record reflects the trial court quashed the subpoenas under Evidence Code section 352 because it reasoned \u201c[j]ust how commercially effective signs may be at other locations is not directly relevant here. [The City] claim[s] that many businesses with conforming signs, both within Agoura Hills and elsewhere, enjoy vigorous business and healthy sales. Such [may] well be generally true. But that is not the statutory test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">The statute supports the trial court\u2019s ruling. The relevant inquiry under section 5499 is whether \u201cspecial topographic circumstances would result in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>material impairment of . . . the owner\u2019s or user\u2019s ability to adequately and effectively continue to communicate with the public through the use of the display.\u201d (\u00a75499.) Thus, the issue is whether the particular topography would impair the efficacy of a conforming sign. The fact a similar business in an adjacent city is profitable despite the lack of a pole sign has no bearing on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">Further, and in any event, the City clearly was not prejudiced by the quashing of the subpoenas. Section 5499 protects existing signage if special topographic circumstances \u201cwould result in a material impairment of visibility of the display <em>or </em>the owner\u2019s or user\u2019s ability to adequately and effectively continue to communicate with the public through the use of the display.\u201d (\u00a7 5499, italics added.) In the statement of decision, the trial court ruled \u201cthe plaintiffs are entitled to prevail, first of all, based on the material impairment of raw visibility, . . . Anything more here is an alternative finding.\u201d Therefore, the subpoenas, which pertained only to the issue of the commercial effectiveness of conforming signage, would not have led to an outcome more favorable to the City.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>* <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">5. <em>Unnecessary to address cross-appeals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">On cross-appeal, the plaintiffs contend that in the event of a reversal and retrial, the trial court\u2019s case management order, with its restrictions on discovery and live testimony, should be vacated. Plaintiffs also contend that if the judgment is reversed, their remaining claims against the City, which the trial court dismissed as moot following resolution of the section 5499 issue, should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">Because the judgment is being affirmed on appeal, no ruling on the cross-appeals is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">The judgment is affirmed.
