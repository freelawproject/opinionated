Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Appellant Cory J. Chandler was convicted by jury of numerous sex offenses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> false imprisonment, and two counts of furnishing cocaine base (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352, subd. (a)). He was sentenced to a term of 185 years to life as a \u201cthird strike\u201d defendant under California\u2019s \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)). Appellant alleges error occurred at virtually every stage of the proceeding. With regard to pretrial matters, he claims the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to amend the information to add additional charges. He claims error in a number of the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, the most important of which challenges the court\u2019s limitation of evidence concerning the victim\u2019s previous exchanges of sex for drugs. In addition, he claims the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions for furnishing cocaine base. Finally, he raises instructional error and multiple issues concerning sentencing under the Three Strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">We affirm the convictions and judgment in all respects. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that the trial court correctly applied the appropriate statutory procedures provided for in Evidence Code section 1103, subdivision (c), to determine the limited admissibility of prior sexual conduct of a victim of sexual assault. However, it was error, although harmless in this instance, to consider the trustworthiness of the proffered evidence as a criterion in ruling upon its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>II. Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The facts underlying appellant\u2019s convictions were adduced predominantly through the testimony of the victim. By her own admission, at the time of these crimes, she was a five-month-pregnant mother of two who had been addicted to crack cocaine for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The victim testified she first met appellant on April 23, 1994, when he arrived at her apartment at Geneva Towers, a housing project in San Francisco, and indicated he knew her stepbrother. On that occasion, appellant supplied her with crack cocaine, which they smoked together. The victim made a date to see appellant again but later had to cancel it.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Around midnight on April 29, 1994, appellant appeared at the victim\u2019s door unannounced and unexpected. The victim\u2019s two sons were asleep in their bedroom, and because she perceived no threat from appellant, she let him in. Appellant declared he wanted \u201ca hit\u201d of cocaine, to which the victim replied, \u201cme[,j too.\u201d The victim testified after they smoked crack cocaine together, appellant took off his clothing and demanded the victim also take off her clothing. When she refused, he hit her on her cheek, after which she insisted they go into her bedroom so her children would not be awakened. She then submitted to numerous sexual acts over the course of 45 uninterrupted minutes, including sodomy and oral copulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The victim heard her 11-year-old son get up to use the bathroom, and she told appellant she was going to check on him. She left the bedroom and told her son to get the police. After she returned to the bedroom, appellant told her to get him his clothes. She gave him his clothes and then fled the apartment. As she was pounding on a neighbor\u2019s door, appellant left her apartment, saying as he left, \u201cyou know you\u2019re tripping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The defense argued the sexual encounter which formed the basis of appellant\u2019s prosecution was entirely consensual, because the victim was exchanging sexual acts for crack cocaine on the night in question. In so arguing, the defense highlighted the victim\u2019s admission that she had traded sex for drugs on two prior occasions. The defense also relied on expert testimony regarding the effects of long-term cocaine addiction to argue the victim\u2019s characterization of the events that night might well be the result of \u201cmemory gaps, confabulation, paranoia, [and] psychotic responses . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The victim denied, however, that the sexual acts performed with appellant were voluntary. The victim\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the testimony of one of the responding police officers, who noticed the victim\u2019s cheek was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>red and swollen. The officer also described the victim as crying, shaking, and nauseous during her reporting of the incident. The victim was examined at a rape treatment center shortly after the assault. The sexual assault examiner who conducted the examination testified that her observations and physical findings were consistent with forcible sexual conduct, specifically vaginal and anal rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">III. Exclusion of Evidence of Victim\u2019s Prior Sexual Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Appellant first assigns error to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of specific instances of the victim\u2019s past sexual behavior. Statutes enacted in 1974<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specify when and under what circumstances evidence of a victim\u2019s prior sexual behavior can be admitted in a trial of sexual assault charges. The statutory scheme actually consists of two statutes, Evidence Code sections 1103, subdivision (c), and 782. Section 1103, subdivision (c), provides that a defendant cannot introduce opinion evidence, reputation evidence, and evidence of specific instances of the alleged victim\u2019s previous sexual conduct with persons other than the defendant to prove the victim consented to the sexual acts alleged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In adopting this section the Legislature recognized that evidence of the alleged victim\u2019s consensual sexual activities with others has little relevance to whether consent was given in a particular instance. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Blackburn </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 685, 690 [128 Cal.Rptr. 864].)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">While strictly precluding admission of the victim\u2019s past sexual conduct for purposes of proving consent, Evidence Code section 1103, subdivision (c)(4), allows the admission of evidence of prior sexual history relevant to the credibility of the victim. Because the victim\u2019s credibility is almost always at issue in sexual assault cases, Evidence Code section 782<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> specifies a procedure requiring an in camera review of the proffered evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>diminish the potential abuse of section 1103, subdivision (c)(4). The defense may offer evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct to attack the victim\u2019s credibility if the trial judge concludes following the hearing that the prejudicial and other effects enumerated in Evidence Code section 352 are substantially outweighed by the probative value of the impeaching evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">By narrowly exercising the discretion conferred upon the trial court in this screening process, California courts have not allowed the credibility exception in the rape shield statutes to result in an undermining of the legislative intent to limit public exposure of the victim\u2019s prior sexual history. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Blackburn, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.3d at pp. 692-693; <em>In re Wright </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 788, 805-806 [144 Cal.Rptr. 535]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guthreau </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 436, 444 [162 Cal.Rptr. 376].) Thus, the credibility exception has been utilized sparingly, most often in cases where the victim\u2019s prior sexual history is one of prostitution. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Varona </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 566, 569-570 [192 Cal.Rptr. 44] [evidence of the victim\u2019s prior prostitution activities in the location where she claimed to have been raped should have been admitted]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Randle </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 286, 293-294 [181 Cal.Rptr. 745] [granting defendant a new trial after evidence of victim\u2019s habit of soliciting public sex acts in exchange for money and drugs was discovered].)  Evidence the victim participated in a form of prostitution is conduct involving moral turpitude which is admissible for impeachment purposes. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284, 297, fn. 7 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 841 P.2d 938] [allowing the admission of past criminal conduct involving moral turpitude amounting to a misdemeanor absent a conviction to impeach the credibility of witnesses and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>parties].) Prostitution is a crime of moral turpitude. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1238 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 105].)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Utilizing the appropriate hearing procedure set forth in Evidence Code section 1103, subdivision (c), appellant made a general offer of proof identifying five individuals who could testify the victim was a \u201ctoss up,\u201d or someone who \u201cregularly and frequently provides sex to men in exchange for crack cocaine.\u201d Acknowledging the evidence could not be used as evidence the victim consented to the sexual acts alleged, appellant contended the witnesses were only offered on the issue of credibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">At the hearing, the court first heard the proffered testimony of Tommy Bruce Isaac. Isaac testified he had a relationship with the victim for about 19 months during which they were \u201chaving sex all the time.\u201d During that time, he exchanged drugs or money for sex with the victim. However, he admitted he never saw her having sex with anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Vannessa Joseph testified she lived in Geneva Towers, where the victim resided, but she only knew the victim slightly. Joseph had heard the victim \u201cbe tossing up, doing things for drugs,\u201d explaining the victim was known to trade sexual favors for drugs. Joseph admitted she did not have any personal knowledge of the victim\u2019s lifestyle, explaining she was relying on \u201cjust rumors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Dwayne Davis, who was imprisoned on a burglary conviction, testified he had known the victim for about two years because he lived in Geneva Towers before going to jail. Davis testified he had exchanged crack cocaine for sex with the victim \u201cmaybe around three times\u201d within the previous two years. Davis said the victim had a reputation as a \u201ctoss up\u201d in the Sunnydale community.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">In the same vein, Reni Washington, who was imprisoned on a robbery conviction, testified he knew the victim because he lived in Geneva Towers before going to prison. Washington said he met the victim when he sold crack cocaine to her and gradually they developed a pattern of trading crack cocaine for sex. Washington said the victim was known as a \u201ctoss up,\u201d explaining the term as \u201can individual who exchange [sic] sex for drugs.\u201d Washington said he had never known the victim to deny sex after receiving drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>San Francisco Police Inspector Philip Dito was also called by the defense at the hearing. He testified that during an interview with the victim, she admitted exchanging sex for drugs on a few occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Before announcing its ruling, the court indicated it had reviewed the in camera testimony \u201cin the light of 1103 of the Evidence Code\u201d and \u201c[i]n doing so, we weigh what is probative, what is prejudicial, what is time consuming and endeavor to try to present the case appropriately.\u201d The court first ruled Isaac would be prevented from testifying because he had indicated that dining the time the victim exchanged sex for drugs they \u201cwere in a relationship during that period, relationship of some length.\u201d TTie court next ruled Joseph\u2019s testimony with regard to the victim\u2019s reputation as a toss up was \u201cso vague\u201d that it was \u201cnot appropriate for introduction in the case.\u201d With regard to the two remaining witnesses subpoenaed from state prison, Washington and Davis, the court indicated it had \u201cweighed their testimony and finds each to be an unbelievable witness, not worthy of being placed before the court and before the jury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">It is important to note, pursuant to the remaining portion of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, the defense at trial <em>was </em>allowed to question the victim about two prior incidents in which she admitted exchanging sex for crack cocaine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court\u2019s ruling also gave the defense the opportunity to question Inspector Dito about the report he took in which the victim admitted exchanging sex for drugs on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">On appeal, appellant criticizes the court\u2019s restriction of this evidence, claiming the court \u201cimproperly applied the rape shield law by ruling that the defense could only question [the victim] about two prior incidents in which she exchanged sex for drugs and by precluding the defense from presenting four witnesses who in themselves could have established that [the victim\u2019s] version of her activities was inaccurate.\u201d Appellant contends the exclusion of this evidence prevented him from having a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine the victim and gave her a false aura of credibility in the eyes of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>A trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of prior sexual conduct will be overturned on appeal only if appellant can show an abuse of discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Varona, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at p. 569.)  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct with Isaac would have dubious relevance to her credibility. Isaac admitted the victim\u2019s willingness to exchange sex for drugs had taken place during a long-term sexual relationship which would have little or no bearing on the victim\u2019s willingness to exchange sex for drugs on a routine basis. Furthermore, given the questionable foundation for Joseph\u2019s opinion evidence relating the victim\u2019s general reputation at Geneva Towers, we are satisfied the court acted within its discretion in concluding the balance between probative value and prejudicial effect weighed in favor of excluding her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">However, the court excluded the testimony of Davis and Washington based on the sole criterion that they were unbelievable. The rape shield statutes do not permit the trial judge to make a credibility determination at the in camera hearing. Instead, the trial judge must evaluate the proffered evidence under the admissibility guidelines set forth in Evidence Code section 352, i.e., weighing of prejudicial effect versus probative value and additional evidentiary criteria. Credibility of the proffered witness is not included under these guidelines. <em>(Vorse </em>v. <em>Sarasy </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 998, 1012-1013 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 164] [assessment of witness credibility is not a component of the Evidence Code section 352 balancing test]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cudjo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 585, 610 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 863 P.2d 635].) Therefore, we conclude it was error for the court to exclude Davis and Washington as witnesses on the sole criterion delineated, and we accept appellant\u2019s proffer of this testimony as stated. Consequently, we review whether the exclusion of this evidence requires appellant\u2019s convictions be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We conclude that any evidentiary error was harmless because, viewing the entire record, it is not reasonably probable the error affected the verdict. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zataray </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 390, 401 [219 Cal.Rptr. 33].) First, to the extent the victim\u2019s credibility might be affected by evidence she had engaged in an exchange of sex for drugs previously, that evidence was already before the jury from the victim\u2019s own admission at trial. Appellant argues the proffered testimony of Davis and Washington was additionally relevant to the victim\u2019s credibility because they disputed the number of times she admitted to having engaged in sex for drugs. Impeachment based upon such a showing would have little probative value. It is not the discrepancy in the victim\u2019s testimony concerning the <em>number of times </em>which is of impeachable importance, but the fact the victim engaged in this form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>conduct involving moral turpitude which arguably places her veracity in dispute. Moreover, the victim\u2019s version of events was supported by evidence recovered from the room where the sexual assault occurred, the records taken at the hospital which showed evidence of trauma to her vagina and rectum consistent with sexual assault, the reporting officer\u2019s observation that the victim\u2019s cheek was red and swollen, and her son\u2019s testimony about her highly emotional state when she asked him to get help. Appellant makes no attempt at explaining away the physical evidence of assaultive conduct, making his story of consensual sex patently unconvincing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tassell </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 77, 89 [201 Cal.Rptr. 567, 679 P.2d 1] overruled on other grounds <em>People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 398-401 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757].) In sum, we find no reasonable probability of a more favorable result had the jury heard the testimony of Davis and Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">IV.-VIIL<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">IX.
