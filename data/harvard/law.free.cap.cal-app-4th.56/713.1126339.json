The felony conviction was Mowatt\u2019s third strike; the jury also found he had served a prior prison term. The trial court sentenced Mowatt to 26 years to life in prison and ordered him to pay a $10,000 restitution fine. On appeal, Mowatt contends the hunting knife he was charged with carrying was not a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d under the applicable statutory definition. We agree. As a matter of law, an ordinary hunting knife is not \u201ca knife or other instrument . . . primarily designed, constructed, or altered to be a stabbing instrument designed to inflict great bodily injury or death,\u201d as provided by Penal Code section 12020, subdivision (c)(24)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 1994 and 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Because we reverse Mowatt\u2019s felony conviction, we need not reach his claims involving three strikes issues and the restitution fine. Our disposition also moots his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d issue, which he raises both on appeal and in a habeas corpus petition, which we consolidated with the appeal. In the unpublished portion of our opinion, we find no merit in Mowatt\u2019s appellate claims of instructional error on reasonable doubt and the insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Around 7:30 p.m. on the evening of December 8, 1994, Mowatt entered a bar in the town of Lucerne, in Lake County, and ordered a drink. There was one other customer in the bar, William Mathis, a retiree in his sixties. Mowatt, who was in his late 40\u2019s, thought Mathis was staring at him in a threatening manner. Mowatt felt uncomfortable \u201cbecause I was the only Indian in a Caucasian bar.\u201d He asked Mathis several times if he had a problem. Mathis said he did not and asked Mowatt if he had a problem. Mathis testified he did not speak in anger to Mowatt. Eventually, Mathis went to the restroom. Mowatt followed him, and in the restroom Mathis saw Mowatt take a knife from his jacket and put it in his back pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Mathis returned to the bar and told the owner Mowatt had a knife. Mowatt came back and again asked Mathis if he had a problem. Mathis said no. Mowatt pulled out the knife and began waving it at Mathis, saying \u201ccome on.\u201d Mathis described the knife as \u201ca little hunting knife.\u201d (When the knife was introduced into evidence, the trial court described it as \u201ctypical of what one would call a hunting knife,\u201d a little over eight and a quarter inches long altogether, with a straight four-and-a-quarter-inch fixed blade sharpened on one side, serrations along a portion of the unsharpened side, and a small guard to prevent the fingers from slipping off the handle.) Mathis picked up a bar stool and approached Mowatt, jabbing at him with the legs of the stool. Mowatt backed out of the bar, and went across the street to a store to buy some beer. There, he was arrested by an officer responding to a \u201c911\u201d call from the bar owner\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Defense counsel objected when the prosecutor offered the knife into evidence. He asked the court to find the knife was not a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d as a matter of law. The prosecutor argued \u201cthe legislature has defined what a . . . dirk or dagger is, and that includes a knife designed for stabbing and designed so that it can inflict great bodily injury or death. And I think, as the Court observes this knife, it obviously fits that definition . . . .\u201d Defense counsel responded by referring to the case law on dirks and daggers, and essentially conceding the status of the knife was a question of fact for the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court, after carefully examining the knife, concluded it was for the jury to decide whether it was a dirk or dagger \u201cunder the definition, the technical definition, as defined by case law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">1. A <em>Hunting Knife Was Not a \u201cDirk or Dagger\u201d in 1994</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">It is a felony for anyone to \u201ccarr[y] concealed upon his or her person any dirk or dagger.\u201d (\u00a7 12020, subd. (a).) Until 1994, case law provided the definition of \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d in prosecutions under section 12020. First stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1928) 88 Cal.App. 502 [263 P. 836], the following broad and flexible formulation was quoted and applied in numerous opinions. \u201cA dagger has been defined as any straight knife to be worn on the person which is capable of inflicting death except what is commonly known as a \u2018pocket-knife.\u2019 Dirk and dagger are used synonymously and consist of any straight stabbing weapon, as a dirk, stiletto, etc. (Century Dict.) They may consist of any weapon fitted primarily for stabbing. The word dagger is a generic term covering the dirk, stiletto, poniard, etc. (Standard Dict.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 504; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Forrest </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 478, 480 [62 Cal.Rptr. 766, 432 P.2d 374]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bain </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 839, 851 [97 Cal.Rptr. 684, 489 P.2d 564]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Villagren </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 720, 725 [165 Cal.Rptr. 470]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pettway </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1067, 1069-1070 [285 Cal.Rptr. 147].)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Application of this judicially derived definition was sometimes inconsistent. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrios </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 501, 504-505 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 666] [discussing conflict between First and Second Appellate Districts on whether attendant circumstances of possession, particularly defendant\u2019s intent, were relevant to \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d finding and agreeing with First Appellate District that they were not]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pettway, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1070-1071 [disagreeing with <em>In re Conrad V. </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 775, 778 [222 Cal.Rptr. 552], regarding status of very similar unorthodox stabbing weapons with short blades designed to protrude between fingers]; CALJIC No. 12.41 (5th ed. 1988) and Use Note, pp. 66-67 [providing alternate definitions based on divergent case law].) Courts of Appeal, noting the confusion in the cases, suggested the Legislature might clarify the situation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pettway, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1070, fn. 1 [urging Legislature \u201cto abandon, or at least define, the arcane term \u2018dirk or dagger\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wharton </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 72, 77, fn. 3 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 673] [\u201cIt is hoped the Legislature will examine these problem areas and produce a clear definition of a dagger and dirk\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In 1993 the Legislature enacted the definition governing Mowatt\u2019s case: \u201cAs used in this section, a \u2018dirk\u2019 or \u2018dagger\u2019 means a knife or other instrument with or without a handguard that is primarily designed, constructed, or altered to be a stabbing instrument designed to inflict great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>bodily injury or death.\u201d (\u00a7 12020, subd. (c)(24), as enacted by Stats. 1993, ch. 357, \u00a7 1.) It is immediately apparent that the 1993 Legislature chose a considerably more restrictive definition than the courts did. Instead of including \u201cany straight knife . . . capable of inflicting death,\u201d which <em>\u201cmay </em>consist of any weapon fitted primarily for stabbing\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruiz, supra, </em>88 Cal.App. at p. 504, italics added), the Legislature decided a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d must be <em>primarily designed </em>as a stabbing weapon, meant to kill or to grievously wound a victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">It has long been recognized that section 12020, subdivision (a) proscribes some weapons that are inherently dangerous, and some that are not designed for use as weapons but can be used to wound or kill.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe Legislature here sought to outlaw the classic instruments of violence and their homemade equivalents; the Legislature sought likewise to outlaw possession of the sometimes-useful object when the attendant circumstances, including the time, place, destination of the possessor, the alteration of the object from standard form, and other relevant facts indicated that the possessor would use the object for a dangerous, not harmless, purpose. [Fn. and citation omitted].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614, 620-621 [47 Cal.Rptr. 772, 408 P.2d 100] <em>(Grubb) </em>[weapon \u201c \u2018of the <em>kind </em>commonly known as a billy\u2019 \u201d included shortened baseball bat carried in car, but would not apply to Little Leaguer at bat]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrios, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at pp. 504-506 [distinguishing <em>Grubb, </em>and holding that \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d refers to stabbing instruments without regard to circumstances of use].)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The definition provided by the 1993 Legislature clearly designates dirks and daggers as \u201cclassic instruments of violence and their homemade equivalents,\u201d in the terms used by the <em>Grubb </em>court. While the case law definition was broad enough to include ordinary knives with stabbing capability, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Legislature\u2019s formulation tracked the technical definition of dirks and daggers as stabbing weapons distinct from knives, which are cutting tools that may also be used as weapons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIn pure usage the dagger, always a weapon, should have a symmetrical tapering blade with two, three, or even four edges and a sharp point. It is primarily designed for thrusting or stabbing. The knife, sometimes a weapon, sometimes a tool, should have a single edge for each blade, though the back can be sharpened for a short distance near the point. It is designed primarily for cutting but can also be used for thrusting. The dirk is a variant of the knife. In its original form it was a weapon with an evenly tapered blade sharpened on one edge. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, however, the name was applied to all the short side arms carried by naval officers. Thus, it included true daggers and sharply curved knives almost of cutlass length.\u201d (Peterson, American Knives: The First History and Collectors\u2019 Guide (1958) p. 2; cited in <em>People </em>v. <em>Forrest, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 481, and quoted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wharton, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The 1995 Legislature reconsidered the \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d question and substituted a much looser definition, encompassing both inherently dangerous stabbing weapons and instruments intended for harmless uses but also capable of inflicting serious harm: \u201cAs used in this section, a \u2018dirk\u2019 or \u2018dagger\u2019 means a knife or other instrument with or without a handguard that is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death.\u201d (\u00a7 12020, subd. (c)(24), as amended by Stats. 1995, ch. 128, \u00a7 2.) The hunting knife wielded by Mowatt would qualify as a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d under the amended version of section 12020, subdivision (c)(24), or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>trader the former case law definition (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Villagren, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at pp. 726-727 [\u201chunting knife\u201d much like Mowatt\u2019s was properly deemed- \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d by jury]).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">However, Mowatt was prosecuted under the 1994 statute, which only prohibited him from carrying a concealed \u201cknife or other instrument . . . primarily designed, constructed, or altered to be a stabbing instrument designed to inflict great bodily injury or death.\u201d We are bound to apply the law as it was enacted by the Legislature, regardless of our opinion of its wisdom (or syntax).  \u201cNo matter how lethal the instrument may be we cannot hold its concealed possession is a crime unless the Legislature has so provided. . . . \u2018[W]e cannot create an offense that the Legislature failed to create. We must assume that the Legislature meant the section to be read as it was written, however unwise we may think the Legislature was in not creating an offense that we may think should have been created. We cannot create such an offense by enlarging the statute, or by inserting or deleting words, nor should we do so by giving a false meaning to its words. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Forrest, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at pp. 481-482, quoting from dissent in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hallner </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 715, 723 [277 P.2d 393]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 44, 50 [69 Cal.Rptr. 595, 442 P.2d 675]; <em>In re Jerry R. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1437 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Our Supreme Court has ruled that the Legislature intended the term \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d in section 12020 to be strictly construed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bain, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 850.) No published cases have considered the definition in effect in 1994 and 1995. We think it is beyond dispute that a hunting knife like Mowatt\u2019s is primarily designed for use as a cutting implement in various recreational activities, not as a stabbing weapon meant to inflict great bodily injury or death (though it is certainly capable of such use).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is common knowledge that such knives are readily available from sporting goods retailers and are routinely possessed by many law-abiding citizens. The relevant statutory definition simply does not include instruments primarily designed for lawful uses but subject to criminal misuse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The Attorney General argues a hunting knife is designed to cut flesh and therefore fits the statutory description of a \u201cdirk or dagger.\u201d We might agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>if the Legislature had intended to protect the fish and game populations of California when it enacted section 12020, but that was clearly not the legislative purpose. \u201cThe Legislature obviously sought to condemn weapons common to the criminal\u2019s arsenal; it meant as well \u2018to outlaw instruments which are ordinarily used for criminal and unlawful purposes.\u2019 [Citations.] The Legislature\u2019s understandable concern with the promiscuous possession of objects dangerous to the lives of members of the public finds manifestation in section 12020.\u201d <em>(Grubb, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Attorney General further contends the knife\u2019s status as a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d was established by Mowatt\u2019s attempted use of the knife as a weapon. However, the trial court properly instructed the jury it was not to consider Mowatt\u2019s intent in possessing the knife when it determined whether he had violated section 12020. The statutory definition focused solely on the design of a dirk or dagger, without implicating the possessor\u2019s intent. Section 12020, subdivision (a) proscribes the possession of a concealed dirk or dagger, not its use. The rationale of the cases holding the possessor\u2019s intent irrelevant in prosecutions for carrying a concealed \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d as defined by case law applies with greater force in prosecutions governed by the 1994-1995 statute, which treats dirks and daggers as inherently dangerous weapons regardless of the circumstances in which they are carried. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrios, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at pp. 504-506 [prosecution may not rely on defendant\u2019s intended use of knife]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 229, 234-235 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 52] [defendant may not raise innocent intended use as defense].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Mowatt\u2019s conviction under section 12020 must be reversed, because his hunting knife was not a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d as defined by the statute at the time of his alleged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">2\u201e 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Mowatt\u2019s conviction for carrying a concealed dirk or dagger is reversed.

In <em>People </em>v. <em>Graham, supra, </em>a prosecution for robbery while \u201c \u2018armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon,\u2019 \u201d the court held that when \u201cthe defendant employs an instrumentality which in the strict sense of the word does not constitute a dangerous or deadly weapon,\u201d the jury must determine \u201cwhether the perpetrator intended to use it as a weapon.\u201d (71 Cal.2d at pp. 328-329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Significantly, cases holding the defendant\u2019s intent irrelevant under the case law definition focus on that part of the definition referring to a \u201cweapon fitted primarily for stabbing,\u201d rather than the part referring to a knife \u201ccapable of inflicting death.\u201d <em>(Bills </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.3d at p. 860; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrios, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at p. 503; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at p. 235.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 713.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
