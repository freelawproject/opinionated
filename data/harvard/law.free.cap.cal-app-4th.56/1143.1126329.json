J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1O\">By appeal and by petition for writ of habeas corpus, Noeline P. (the mother) challenges the order terminating her parental rights (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26) to her daughter, Meranda P.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On her appeal and in her petition, the mother contends the termination order was wrongly entered because it was the inevitable product of a collection of erroneous orders\u2014detention, jurisdiction, disposition and review\u2014that preceded it. According to the mother, when the superior court made each of these prior orders she was either wrongly denied counsel or was incompetently represented by appointed counsel. We will conclude the mother is barred from raising, by her appeal, the propriety of the orders antedating the termination order and from collaterally attacking, by her petition for writ of habeas corpus, the termination order or the orders antecedent to it. We will therefore affirm the juvenile court\u2019s termination order and deny the mother\u2019s habeas corpus petition. We will also decline the mother\u2019s request that we treat her appeal as a petition for extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">In September 1994, the Stanislaus County Superior Court, sitting as the juvenile court, adjudged Meranda, bom June 5, 1994, a juvenile dependent under section 361. The mother was unrepresented by counsel at the detention hearing and thereafter throughout the first 12 months of the reunification period; she had informed the court at the initial detention hearing that she did not want counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The mother was a teenager with a history of substance abuse. Both she and Meranda had tested positive for methamphetamine when Meranda was bom. At the September 1994 dispositional hearing, the court ordered Meranda removed from parental custody and approved a reunification plan for the child\u2019s parents. The reunification plan focused on the mother\u2019s substance abuse. It required her to: (1) complete a substance abuse evaluation and follow the recommendations of the counselor; (2) submit to drug testing on a random basis, as required by the substance abuse program; and (3) attend \u201cNA/AA\u201d meetings as required by the substance program. The plan also addressed the mother\u2019s need to provide a clean, healthy, and safe home for Meranda; the mother was to cooperate with a teaching homemaker and to attend and successfully complete a parenting program.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Between the dispositional hearing and the six-month review hearing (\u00a7 366.21, subd. (e)), the mother had not maintained contact with her social worker, kept the social worker apprised of her whereabouts, or begun any reunification program. In addition, the mother infrequently visited with Meranda, even though weekly visits were authorized. When she did visit with the child she refused to hold the baby or pay attention to her needs or well-being. The mother did not personally attend the review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">At the six-month review hearing, the juvenile court found that (1) reasonable services had been offered and made available but neither parent had satisfied the reunification plan, and (2) return of Meranda to either of her parents would pose a substantial risk of detriment to the child. The juvenile court therefore continued Meranda\u2019s out-of-home placement with her paternal grandparents and the provision of reunification services to the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">During the second six-month period, the mother gave birth to another child. While pregnant with this child, the mother appeared for an assessment appointment at the First Step Perinatal Substance Abuse Program. She attended some of the orientation groups offered by the Program, but appeared resistant to services. In April 1995, First Step dismissed the mother from the program because of her spotty attendance and apparent unwillingness to fully participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>The mother did little else to comply with the reunification plan, and she made no serious effort to establish a parental bond with Meranda. No social worker had any contact with the mother until a few weeks before the 12-month review hearing. The parents\u2019 whereabouts had been unknown for the majority of the preceding year. The parents were reported to have said that if Meranda could not be with them, then they would rather she be with the paternal grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">On the day of the 12-month review hearing, the department of social services took Meranda\u2019s infant brother into protective custody due to an apparent lack of proper medical care. The department also recommended that the court terminate services with respect to Meranda and refer her case for permanency planning. The mother attended the hearing and asked the court to extend her additional time for reunification and drug rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The court took the matter under submission pending the detention hearing in the dependency proceeding involving the mother\u2019s newborn son. At the August 11, 1995, detention hearing in that second proceeding, the mother said she wanted a court-appointed lawyer. The court appointed counsel for the mother in both proceedings. It also ordered another six months of reunification services with respect to Meranda.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">During the last six months of reunification, the mother reappeared at the First Step program and attended a few orientation groups between August and early October 1995. According to the program administrators, the mother seemed isolated, withdrawn and unmotivated. She did not participate in the services nor did she appear to have any insight into the consequences of her behavior. The program recommended to a social worker that the mother enter a residential treatment facility for teen substance abusers. The paternal grandmother obtained information for the mother about a nearby center which offered such services, but the mother was not interested in enrolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">In January 1996, the mother was assessed for the Reality Program, a 28-day in-patient substance abuse program. She failed to qualify, however, because she denied she had a drug or alcohol problem. The mother did nothing else to further reunification. She saw Meranda on approximately 10 occasions after the last court hearing; with the exception of a Christmas visit, the mother usually stayed 10 minutes or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">At the 18-month review hearing the mother testified she was willing to enter the Reality Program. She understood that before she could be reevaluated for Reality, she would have to attend a series of \u201cNA\u201d (Narcotics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>Anonymous) meetings. She said she wanted \u201ca fighting chance\u201d to regain custody of Meranda and appreciated the need to deal with her substance abuse. When asked why she waited so long to accept treatment, the mother blamed: (1) the Reality Program because it would not accept her until she turned 18; (2) her husband because he had not shared with her certain information her mother-in-law had obtained about the residential treatment program for teenagers; and (3) the teacher at First Step who, according to the mother, did not like her.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The court found: (1) the mother had received reasonable services but had made only minimal progress towards reunification; and (2) return of Meranda to parental custody would create a substantial risk of detriment to the child\u2019s physical and emotional well-being. The court therefore terminated reunification services and set the matter for a section 366.26 hearing (.26 hearing) in May 1996. The court also gave the mother notice of her right to seek writ review of these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">At the .26 hearing, it was undisputed that Meranda was adoptable and that her paternal grandparents wished to adopt her. The mother testified she had occasionally visited with Meranda and expressed her opposition to the selection of a permanent plan of adoption. The mother\u2019s counsel urged the court to select guardianship over adoption as the permanent plan, based on the mother\u2019s recent efforts to rehabilitate herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">The court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights to Meranda, finding by clear and convincing evidence that Meranda was adoptable and that the severance of the mother\u2019s rights would not be detrimental to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">The mother filed a timely notice of appeal in June 1996. On November 1, 1996, the mother filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Dependency appeals are governed by section 395, which provides in relevant part: \u201cA judgment in a proceeding under Section 300 may be appealed from in the same manner as any final judgment, and any subsequent order may be appealed from as from an order after judgment; but no such order or judgment shall be stayed by the appeal, unless, pending the appeal, suitable provision is made for the maintenance, care, and custody of the person alleged or found to come within the provisions of Section 300, and unless the provision is approved by an order of the juvenile court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>appeal shall have precedence over all other cases in the court to which the appeal is taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">This statute makes the dispositional order in a dependency proceeding the appealable \u201cjudgment.\u201d <em>(In re Eli F. </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 228, 233 [260 Cal.Rptr. 453].) Therefore, all subsequent orders are directly appealable without limitation, except for post-1994 orders setting a .26 hearing when the circumstances specified in section 366.26, subdivision <em>(I), </em>exist. <em>(In re Edward H. </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 584, 590-591 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 745]; <em>Steve J. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 798, 811-812 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 731].) A consequence of section 395 is that an unappealed disposition or postdisposition order is final and binding and may not be attacked on an appeal from a later appealable order. <em>(In re Edward H., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at pp. 590-591; <em>Wanda B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1391, 1395-1396 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 175]; <em>Steve J. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at pp. 810-812; <em>Karl S. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1402-1404 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 84]; <em>In re Elizabeth M. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 553, 563 [283 Cal.Rptr. 483]; see also <em>In re Matthew C. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 386, 393 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 862 P.2d 765]; see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 906.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The mother contends the entire dependency proceeding for Meranda was defective from its inception. To support this complaint she makes two specific points: (1) she was deprived of her constitutional and statutory<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights to counsel at the detention hearing and thereafter until the 18-month review hearing, and (2) she was deprived of her constitutional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>statutory<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rights to the effective assistance of trial counsel at and following the 18-month review hearing. These contentions call into question the propriety of the orders regarding Meranda made at each of the hearings which preceded the .26 hearing. The mother did not file an appeal from any of these appealable orders, and the time within which to do so has long since passed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.) Nor did the mother petition this court for extraordinary writ review of the order setting the .26 hearing entered at conclusion of the 18-month review hearing. (See \u00a7 366.26, subd. (/).)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Nevertheless, the mother maintains we are required to address her claims on their merits. She points out what she believes are several valid arguments an appointed counsel could have made at the hearings where she was unrepresented. She also says her appointed counsel was incompetent because he did not question at the 18-month review hearing the sufficiency of the reunification services she received. According to the mother, had any of these arguments been advanced on her behalf one or more of the interim orders would have been in her favor and the termination order would never have been entered. She also asserts her failure to raise her representational claims by means of a timely appeal from the disposition order or from a subsequent interim order was itself the result of the lack or inadequacy of counsel. In the mother\u2019s estimation, all \u201cthese deprivations and failures tainted the entire termination process\u201d and render her claims about the absence and inadequacy of counsel cognizable on her appeal from the termination order.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The principle\u2014which for convenience we will identify as the \u201cwaiver rule\u201d\u2014that an appellate court in a dependency proceeding may not inquire into the merits of a prior final appealable order on an appeal from a later appealable order is sound. We decline to carve out an exception to it here even though the issues raised involve the important constitutional and statutory rights to counsel and to the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Enforcing the waiver rule against the mother\u2019s representational claims does not infringe her due process rights.  Three elements must be assessed in order to determine \u201c \u2018what due process requires\u2019 for fundamental fairness, specifically, \u2018the private interests at stake, the government\u2019s interest, and the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number><em>(In re Sade C. </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 952, 987 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 771, 920 P.2d 716].) The interplay of these three factors favors application of the waiver rule because, whatever benefits might accrue to the parent in the absence of the rule, the resulting costs to the child and the state are \u201cgreater.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 992. ) Of the many private and public concerns which collide in a dependency proceeding, time is among the most important.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 990.) The action \u201c\u2018must be concluded as rapidly as is consistent with fairness . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 18, 32 [101 S.Ct. 2153, 2162, 68 L.Ed.2d 640]; <em>In re Sade C., supra, </em>at p. 990.) The state\u2019s interest in expedition and finality is \u201cstrong.\u201d <em>(In re Sade C., supra, </em>at p. 993. ) The child\u2019s interest in securing a stable, \u201cnormal\u201d home \u201csupports] the state\u2019s particular interest in finality.\u201d <em>(In re Sade C., supra, </em>at p. 993.) To permit a parent to raise issues which go to the validity of a final earlier appealable order would directly undermine these dominant concerns of finality and reasonable expedition.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The present case emphatically proves this thesis. A reversal based upon an error, whatever its nature, that occurred at the detention hearing would require the juvenile court on remand to literally commence the dependency anew, thereby adding at minimum another 14 months to the duration of the proceeding on top of the 20 or so months (excluding the time the case spends in this court) which have elapsed since the detention hearing. (See <em>Adoption of Alexander S. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 857, 868 [245 Cal.Rptr. 1, 750 P.2d 778]; <em>In re Arturo A. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 229, 244 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 131].) Although appeals from interim appealable orders do themselves introduce delay into a dependency proceeding, the waiver rule nonetheless ensures that a reversal and remand will not compel a repetition of proceedings which occurred earlier than the last final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Moreover, the risk that a parent will be erroneously deprived of his or her rights if the waiver rule is applied is diminished by two factors. First, that a parent lacked counsel or had the services of incompetent counsel does not mean the parent was in fact harmed as a consequence. Neither the absence nor the blunder of appointed counsel alone entitles the parent to obtain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>appellate relief he or she seeks. With respect to a parent\u2019s assertion of a violation of the statutory right to representation or the statutory right to adequate representation, the parent must also show \u201cit is \u2018reasonably probable ... a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Kristin H. </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1635, 1668 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 722]; <em>In re Ronald R. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1195 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 22]; <em>In re Malcolm D. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 904, 919 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 148].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With respect to a parent\u2019s assertion of a violation of the constitutional right to counsel, the parent must also show there was a \u201cdeterminative difference\u201d in the outcome of the proceeding by reason of the parent\u2019s lack of counsel, such that the proceeding was rendered fundamentally unfair to the parent. <em>(Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, supra, </em>452 U.S. at pp. 32-33 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2162]; see also <em>In re Malcolm D., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 921; <em>In re Ronald R., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1196.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to a parent\u2019s assertion of a violation of the constitutional right to competent counsel, we have not found any case law on the subject in the dependency context. However, in criminal cases a defendant who claims unconstitutionally inadequate representation must establish, in addition to the reasonable probability of a different outcome, that \u201ccounsel\u2019s deficient performance rendered] the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>(Lockhart </em>v. <em>Fretwell </em>(1993) 506 U.S. 364, 372 [113 S.Ct. 838, 844, 122 L.Ed.2d 180]; see also <em>In re Harris </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 813, 833 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 373, 855 P.2d 391].) Unreliability or unfairness is demonstrated when the ineffectiveness of counsel deprives the defendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him or her. <em>(Lockhart, supra, </em>at p. 372 [113 S.Ct. at p. 844].) Because a parent\u2019s right to counsel in a dependency is not coextensive with that of a criminal defendant, it is unlikely the United States Supreme Court would apply a more stringent measure of harm in a dependency case.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>Second, we recognize that \u201c[a] parent who is unable to present an adequate defense from the outset may be seriously disadvantaged later.\u201d <em>(In re Emilye </em>A. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1695, 1707 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 294]; see <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, supra, </em>452 U.S. at pp. 30-31 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2161].) Nevertheless, there are significant safeguards built into this state\u2019s dependency statutes which tend to work against the wrongful termination of a parent\u2019s right to a child even though a parent may be unrepresented or poorly represented. The dependency scheme is a \u201cremarkable system of checks and balances\" <em>(In re Andrew B. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 825, 865 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 604]) designed to \u201cpreserve the parent-child relationship and to reduce the risk of erroneous fact-finding in . . . many different ways . . . .\u201d <em>(Cynthia D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 242, 255 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 851 P.2d 1307].) Until permanency planning, the parent\u2019s interest in having a child returned to the parent is the paramount concern of the law. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 255-256; \u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subds. (e) &amp; (f), 366.22, subd. (a).) The parent is thus entitled to 12 months, and possibly 6 more months, of reunification services aimed at assisting the parent in overcoming the problems that led to the child\u2019s removal. (\u00a7\u00a7361.5, subd. (a), 366.21, subds. (e) &amp; (f).) There is also in force at the dispositional hearing and at all subsequent prepermanency planning hearings a statutory presumption that the child will be returned to parental custody. (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subds. (e) &amp; (f), 366.22, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">In addition, there are \u201cprecise and demanding substantive and procedural requirements\u201d which the petitioning agency must fulfill before it can propose termination. At the dispositional hearing, the agency must show by the enhanced standard of clear and convincing evidence that removal of the child is necessary. (\u00a7361, subd. (b).) At the interim review hearings, the agency has the burden of showing by a preponderance of evidence that the return of the child to the parent would be detrimental to the child and that reasonable reunification services have been provided. (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subds. (e) &amp; (f), 366.22, subd. (a).) Before reunification can be terminated, the agency must establish by a preponderance of evidence that it would be detrimental to return child to the parent. (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, subd. (f), 366.22, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Also, independent judicial review of the case is mandated at least every six months during the reunification period and a myriad of positive findings are required with respect to every critical pre-permanency planning decision. (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, 366.22.) \u201cThe number and quality of the judicial findings that are necessary preconditions to termination convey very powerfully to the fact finder the subjective certainty about parental unfitness and detriment required before the court may even consider ending the relationship between natural parent and child.\u201d <em>(Cynthia D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 255-256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>Last, the relevant statutes provide for early and complete notification to the parent of every stage of the proceedings during the entire course of the dependency. The agency must demonstrate its due diligence at the outset when a parent cannot be found. (\u00a7\u00a7311, subd. (a), 361.5, subd. (b)(1).) When a parent is located;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-5\">\u201cThe child dependency statutory scheme requires parents be notified of all proceedings involving the child. (\u00a7 302, subd. (b).) When a social worker, police officer or probation officer takes a child into protective custody, that person must immediately inform the parent and provide a written statement which explains the parent\u2019s procedural rights and the preliminary stages of the dependency investigation and hearing. (\u00a7 307.4, subd. (a).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-6\">\u201cThe parent must also be notified of the detention hearing and given a copy of the dependency petition \u2018if the whereabouts of each parent. . . can be ascertained by due diligence . . . .\u2019 (\u00a7311, subd. (a).) If it appears the parent cannot read, notice may be given orally. (\u00a7311, subd. (a).) The parent must be informed of the conditions under which the child will be released, the hearings which may be required, <em>the right to counsel, </em>the privilege against self-incrimination and <em>appeal rights. </em>(\u00a7 307.4, subd. (a).) The parent must also be notified of each review hearing by mail or personal service. (\u00a7 366.21.)\u201d <em>(In re Raymond R. </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 436, 440 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 551], italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Notification to the parent must also be given about the time and place of the .26 hearing and of the right to have counsel at such proceeding. (\u00a7 366.23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">By referring to these statutes we do not mean to trivialize or understate in the slightest the critical role in ensuring an accurate and just decision played by a capable appointed counsel for the parent. (See <em>In re Emilye A., supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 1709-1710.) We fully recognize that an error unfavorable to the interests of the parent during the course of a dependency may be \u201cirremediable.\u201d <em>(In re Sade C., supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 990.) We mention the statutory provisions simply to point out that the legitimate interests of an unrepresented or incompetently represented parent are protected to some\u2014 perhaps very limited\u2014extent by those provisions of the dependency laws which \u201cconstrain judicial discretion [and] diminish the risk of erroneous findings of parental inadequacy and detriment to the child . . . .\u201d <em>(Cynthia D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">In addition to finding no due process violation, we believe there are other important reasons for enforcing the waiver rule against the mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>representational claims. First and foremost, as we explained above, disregarding the rule would subvert the predominant interests of the child and the state in finality and reasonable expedition. (See <em>In re Sade C., supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 993; <em>Adoption of Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d at p. 868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Next, authorizing parents to attack final appealable orders by means of an appeal from a subsequent appealable order would sabotage the apparent legislative intention to expedite dependency cases and subordinate, to the extent consistent with fundamental fairness, the parent\u2019s right of appeal to the interests of the child and the state.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 310 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826].) The Legislature has made known its desire not to allow the child\u2019s future to be held hostage to a postponed appeal. First, it has enacted section 395, which affords a parent the opportunity to obtain immediate appellate review of each of the several crucial orders entered in a dependency. Second, the Legislature has not acted to counter those cases which have applied the waiver rule to dependency cases. Third, the Legislature did not wait long before it statutorily annulled the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>In re Matthew C., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 386, 388, that \u201cfindings subsumed within [an order setting a .26 hearing] are reviewable on appeal from the final order terminating . . . parental rights.\u201d (See \u00a7 366.26, subd. (/), enacted in 1994 and made applicable to orders issued on or after Jan. 1, 1995; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 39.1B(2).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Finally, failing to apply the waiver rule would insert an element of illogic into the law and subvert the Legislature\u2019s intent, evident in section 366.26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>subdivision <em>(I), </em>to restrict appeals challenging orders setting a .26 hearing. (Cf. <em>In re Arturo </em>A., <em>supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 242.) The dispositional order and the several postdispositional review orders collectively provide justification for an order setting the .26 hearing (\u00a7\u00a7 366.21, 366.22), which in turn furnishes grounds for a termination order (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)). Upsetting any one of these foundational orders on an appeal from the termination order by a parent who has neglected to bring a petition for extraordinary writ review of the order setting the .26 hearing would necessarily invalidate the order setting such hearing, a result which would seem to defeat the Legislature\u2019s express command that the order setting the .26 hearing be unimpeachable by appeal \u201cat any time\u201d in the absence of all of the conditions listed in section 366.26, subdivision (Z)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Our conclusion that the waiver rule should apply to the instant appeal is conceptually consistent with other cases which have held that claims relating to the right to, or the inadequacy of, parental counsel may be surrendered by inaction. Thus, courts have ruled that: (1) the statutory right to counsel (\u00a7 317, fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>imposes no duty upon the juvenile court to appoint counsel for an indigent parent when that parent has not made any request for counsel <em>(In re Ebony W. </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1643, 1645 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 337]); (2) a parent\u2019s appearance and participation in a dependency hearing without raising the court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel at an earlier hearing waives the claim on appeal from the order entered at the later hearing <em>(In re Gilberto M. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1200 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 285]); and (3) the juvenile court may, on notice, relieve counsel previously appointed for a parent when the facts before the court demonstrate the parent does not \u201cdesire\u201d further legal representation <em>(Janet O. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1065-1066 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 57]).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It has also been said that \u201cuntimeliness [in bringing a petition for writ relief] may . . . preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>review of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>(In re Kristin H., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at p. 1667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">In this case, the mother neither asked for counsel nor expressed any discontent with appointed counsel in the juvenile court; in fact, at the detention hearing she said she did not want a lawyer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She then squandered four different opportunities to complain to this court about any representational problems she believed she had. She could have appealed from the disposition order, the six-month review order, and the twelve-month review order. (\u00a7 395; <em>Steve J. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 812.) She could have challenged the order setting a permanency planning hearing by petition for extraordinary writ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 39.IB). At the outset the court informed her of her right to counsel and her right of appeal. At the appropriate time it apprised the mother of her right to seek writ relief from the order setting the .26 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Even if she could not articulate a legal issue such as right to counsel or ineffective assistance, she obviously knew that she did not have custody of Meranda. If she felt the loss of custody was improper for whatever reason, she had ample opportunity to express her concerns. Nonetheless, she made not the slightest effort to inform the social worker or the juvenile court that she wanted counsel, was unhappy with counsel at or after the 18-month review hearing, or disputed or was unsatisfied with, and desired appellate review of, any order entered prior to the termination order. Instead, she chose to remain silent throughout the juvenile court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Neither of the cases relied upon by the mother, <em>In re Diana G. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1468, 1479-1480 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 645] and <em>In re Brittany S. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1399, 1404 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 50], is of help to her. <em>Diana G. </em>was an appeal from an order terminating a father\u2019s rights under section 366.26. He complained in part that he had been denied effective legal assistance during the first 10 months of the dependency proceedings. The appellate court assumed, without deciding, the issue was cognizable on appeal, citing <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, supra, </em>452 U.S. 18, 24-31 [101 S.Ct. 2153, 2158-2161]. Although the <em>Diana G. </em>court acknowledged the father\u2019s contention arguably was not reviewable by virtue of former section 366.26, subdivision (k) <em>(Diana G., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 1479), the court nevertheless addressed the substance of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>We regard <em>Diana G. </em>as a case where the court reached the merits of the argument concerning inadequate counsel simply for purposes of efficiency. There were other issues properly before the court on the appeal from the termination order. Also, when <em>Diana G. </em>was published in November 1992, the state Supreme Court had granted review in <em>In re Matthew C. </em>(Cal.App.) to decide if then section 366.26, subdivision (k), precluded, on appeal from a termination order, the review of issues decided when the juvenile court set the .26 hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Matthew C., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\"><em>Lassiter, </em>relied upon in <em>Diana G. </em>and mentioned often by us in this opinion, had nothing to do with whether otherwise final appealable dependency orders may be challenged by way of an appeal from a termination order when the issues raised with respect to those final earlier orders entail claims of ineffective assistance or denial of counsel. Although <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, supra, </em>452 U.S. at pages 20-24 [101 S.Ct. at pages 2156-2158], concerned an appeal from an order terminating a mother\u2019s rights, the sole issue decided by the Supreme Court was whether due process entitled an indigent mother to the assistance of counsel at the termination hearing. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 20-24 [101 S.Ct. at pp. 2156-2158].)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">In <em>Brittany S., </em>the appellate court ruled that a parent\u2019s failure to seek writ relief under former section 366.26, subdivision (k), from an order setting a .26 hearing did not preclude review, by an appeal from the subsequent termination order, of a finding, essential to the order setting the .26 hearing, that the parent received adequate reunification services. <em>(In re Brittany S., supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1405.) In reaching this conclusion the court reasoned that because by express statutory command (then \u00a7 366.26, subd. (k)) the order setting the .26 hearing was not an appealable order, Code of Civil Procedure section 906 applied and authorized the appellate court to review \u201c \u2018any intermediate ruling, proceeding, order or decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brittany S., supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1404, italics omitted, quoting Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 906.) The Supreme Court later came to the same conclusion. <em>(In re Matthew C., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 401.) As we pointed out earlier, the holding in <em>Matthew C. </em>was legislatively abrogated in 1994. (See \u00a7 366.26, subd. <em>(l)\\ In re Edward H., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at pp. 590-591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">All the reasons we have given persuade us not to put aside the waiver rule when the parent, on appeal from a termination order, raises representational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>issues with respect to an earlier final appealable order. We therefore will not inquire into the propriety of the findings made or orders issued by the juvenile court at the detention, jurisdictional, dispositional, 6-month, 12-month and 18-month hearings, even though the mother may have been unrepresented or may have received inadequate legal assistance at the 18-month review hearing or thereafter. In the last analysis, at some point the interests of a parent, and therefore the correction of purported error which operates to the detriment of the parent, must give way to the interest of the child in a stable, secure, long-term, continuous home environment. Under California\u2019s dependency statutes, this moment arrives when the juvenile court terminates reunification and sets a permanency planning hearing. <em>(In re Sade C., supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 993; <em>In re Marilyn H., supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 309.) At this juncture, the balance of the competing interests is tipped well towards the child; it is presumed the interests of the child and the natural parents have diverged and are inconsistent. <em>(Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra, </em>455 U.S. at p. 760 [102 S.Ct. at p. 1398]; <em>In re Sade C., supra, </em>at p. 989; <em>In re Marilyn H., supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 309.) Therefore, if a parent, for whatever reason, has failed to timely and appropriately raise a claim about the existence or quality of counsel received at a proceeding antedating the .26 hearing, we will apply the waiver rule to foreclose the parent from raising such an objection on appeal from the termination order. We leave for another day the question whether we would apply the waiver rule when a final appealable order is challenged on representational grounds by an appeal taken from a subsequent interim order, such as a review order, or by a petition for extraordinary relief under section 366.26, subdivision <em>(l), </em>after entry of an order setting a .26 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Because the mother\u2019s appeal from the termination order does not present any issue concerning the validity of the juvenile court\u2019s findings of adopt-ability and lack of detriment made at the .26 hearing, we will affirm the order terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Perhaps because she apprehends the impact of the waiver rule on her appeal, the mother collaterally attacks the termination order by means of her petition for writ of habeas corpus, which is supported by several declarations. In her petition she advances the same claims of lack of counsel and ineffective assistance of counsel that she raised in her briefs on her appeal from the termination order. Leaving nothing to chance, the mother also asks us to treat her appeal, if we find it defective, as a petition for writ of mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>(see <em>In re Paul E. </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 996, 1000 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 289] [mandamus review of a dispositional order would be granted if appeal from order not viable]).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">We will not issue an order to show cause on the mother\u2019s habeas corpus petition. First, the Legislature has expressly prohibited the collateral dispute of a termination order. Section 366.26, subdivision (i), reads in full: \u201cAny order of the court permanently terminating parental rights under this section shall be conclusive and binding upon the minor person, upon the parent or parents and upon all other persons who have been served with citation by publication or otherwise as provided in this chapter. After making such an order, the court shall have no power to set aside, change, or modify it, but nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the right to appeal the order.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">This statute forbids alteration or revocation of an order terminating parental rights except by means of a direct appeal from the order. (See <em>In re Ronald V. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1803, 1806 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 334].) What we said in connection with the mother\u2019s appeal is also true here: Issuance of a writ directing the trial court to vacate the termination order would nullify the Legislature\u2019s unambiguous withdrawal of jurisdiction from the court to \u201cset aside, change, or modify\u201d such an order except by means of a direct appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Second, there is the rule of law, reaffirmed by the Supreme Court less than a decade ago, that \u201chabeas corpus may not be used to collaterally attack a final nonmodifiable judgment in an adoption-related action where the trial court had jurisdiction to render the final judgment.\u201d <em>(Adoption of Alexander S., </em>supra, 44 Cal.3d at pp. 867-868.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>In Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 857, the trial court denied a natural mother\u2019s petition to withdraw her consent to the adoption of her minor child. The mother did not appeal from the resulting judgment; she instead petitioned for an order establishing the alleged natural father\u2019s paternity and then appealed from the denial of that petition. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 862-863.) On her appeal, the mother raised claims which, if sustained, would have required the setting aside of the order refusing her application to withdraw her adoption consent. The Court of Appeal treated the mother\u2019s appeal as a petition for writ of habeas corpus and issued the writ, on the ground the mother had been denied the effective assistance of counsel in connection with her attempt to revoke the consent. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 863.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>The Supreme Court reversed and discredited the appellate court\u2019s \u201ccreative use of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>(Adoption of Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 864.) The Supreme Court traced the historical development of the principle forbidding the use of habeas corpus as a means of securing review of a nonmodifiable judgment in an adoption-related matter, citing among other authorities <em>Ex parte Miller </em>(1895) 109 Cal. 643 [42 P. 428].<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 866-867.) The court also rested its decision upon what it found to be sound public policy: \u201cProtracted litigation over the custody of a child may harm the child. For this reason, among others, the United States Supreme Court held that federal habeas corpus could not be used to litigate constitutional claims in child custody matters, observing that \u2018[t]he State\u2019s interest in finality is unusually strong in child-custody disputes. The grant of federal habeas would prolong uncertainty for children .... It is undisputed that children require secure, stable, long-term, continuous relationships with their parents or foster parents. There is little that can be as detrimental to a child\u2019s sound development as uncertainty over whether he is to remain in his current \u2018home,\u2019 under the care of his parents or foster parents, especially when such uncertainty is prolonged.\u2019 <em>(Lehman </em>v. <em>Lycoming County Children\u2019s Services </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 502, 513-514 [102 S.Ct. 3231, 3238-3239, 73 L.Ed.2d 928].)\u201d <em>(Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">We find <em>Alexander S. </em>controlling here. The termination order is now a final, statutorily (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (i)) nonmodifiable order, issued by a court with subject matter jurisdiction over the cause finding Meranda adoptable, terminating the mother\u2019s rights and freeing the child for adoption by a third person. In our view, the order, and the .26 hearing from which it came, were \u201cadoption-related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Another appellate court in this state has applied <em>Alexander S. </em>in a situation equivalent to the one now before us. In <em>In re Issac J., supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th 525, the Court of Appeal dismissed an untimely appeal by a parent from an order issued pursuant to former Civil Code section 232 involuntarily terminating the parent\u2019s rights to the minor. The parent then filed a habeas corpus petition, asserting he had received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. (4 Cal.App.4th at pp. 528-529.) The <em>Issac J. </em>court followed <em>Alexander S. </em>and held in relevant part that habeas could not be employed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>obtain collateral relief from the former Civil Code section 232 termination order. <em>(Issac J., supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th at p. 534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Third, the rationale which supports our holding that the waiver rule should be enforced on the mother\u2019s appeal from the termination order applies equally to the mother\u2019s habeas corpus petition. The now paramount interests of the child in a stable, secure, long-term, continuous home environment and the associated interest of the state in reasonable expedition and finality, which have overcome the parent\u2019s interests in maintaining the family relationship, would be no less subject to subversion by a habeas petition than they would be by a direct appeal. In fact, an attack on a termination order by a habeas petition carries the potential for considerably greater damage to the interests of the child and the state because the time for filing of such a petition is not strictly constrained in the same manner as is the filing of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">The mother makes a number of other arguments to support the writ relief she seeks. None are convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">The mother takes the position <em>Alexander S. </em>does not apply because it arose out of a parent\u2019s voluntary relinquishment of the minor and not, as here, out of an involuntary deprivation of custody brought about at the instigation of the state. We do not see anything in <em>Alexander S. </em>which restricts its application to voluntary surrenders of dependent children or which intimates the Supreme Court rested its holding upon the particularities of the relinquishment statutes then in effect. <em>(Adoption of Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 866-868.) Instead, the court determined habeas corpus was not available in all situations \u201c \u2018[wjhere a parent seeks custody of a child living with another.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (44 Cal.3d at p. 866.) It also relied upon, as we have pointed out, <em>Ex parte Miller, supra, </em>109 Cal. 643, which involved efforts by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>parents of a minor to undo the appointment of a guardian for the child. Most importantly, the court\u2019s articulation of the \u201csound public policy\u201d which underlies its decision is a quotation taken from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Lycoming County Children\u2019s Services </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 502 [102 S.Ct. 3231, 73 L.Ed.2d 928], where the court rejected a collateral attack under the federal habeas statute on an order involuntarily terminating parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The mother next contends the use of a habeas corpus petition to raise representational issues has been approved, citing <em>In re Kristin H., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th 1635 and <em>In re Emilye A., supra, </em>9 Cal.App.4th 1695. Although these two cases did sanction habeas corpus as a legitimate means of asserting ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a dependency, in both instances the petitions were filed shortly after entry of dispositional orders (\u00a7 358) by the juvenile courts. <em>(In re Kristin H., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1649, 1658; <em>In re Emilye A., supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1700.) At this early stage of a dependency, the parent, the child and the state share a common interest in preserving the family relationship, which is presumed to be in the child\u2019s best interests (\u00a7 202; <em>In re David H. </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 368, 384 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 313]), unless unique circumstances dictate otherwise (see \u00a7 361.5, subd. (b)). However, by the time a termination order is entered the \u201c \u2018interests of the child and parent collide, and ... the child\u2019s interest in finality prevails.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Kristin H., supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at p. 1664; see <em>Cynthia D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Failing also is the mother\u2019s argument that overturning the termination order would be in Meranda\u2019s best interest because the mother is now capable of providing adequate care for Meranda\u2019s younger brother. This contention proves the worth of section 366.26, subdivision (i), and the rule of <em>Alexander S.\\ </em>to agree with the mother would authorize the upsetting of termination orders\u2014and in some instances subsequent adoptions\u2014weeks, months and perhaps even years after the fact. Neither the child nor the law can wait for a parent to decide, at leisure, when he or she will accept in full the responsibilities of parenthood. <em>(Cynthia D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">We additionally do not agree with the mother, or with the opinion in <em>Mauro B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 949, 954-955 [281 Cal.Rptr. 507], that <em>Alexander S. </em>permits a petition for extraordinary relief to be brought after the time for appeal from a nonmodifiable adoption-related order has expired if there exist \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d which excuse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>failure to appeal, such as a violation of the constitutional right to counsel. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 954-955.) We cannot find anything in <em>Alexander S. </em>which justifies this reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion. <em>Alexander S. </em>articulated an unqualified \u201cbright line\u201d rule prohibiting the use of habeas corpus to challenge final, nonmodifiable adoption-related orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The basis for the mother\u2019s contention and Mauro's holding derives from the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation in <em>Alexander S. </em>of the many procedural flaws it had found in the Court of Appeal opinion under review. As a part of this exposition the <em>Alexander S. </em>court said that in the absence of some special circumstances \u201c \u2018constituting an excuse for failure to employ [the appellate] remedy,\u2019 \u201d such as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201c \u2018the writ will not lie where the claimed errors could have been, but were not, raised upon a timely appeal from a judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Adoption of Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 865.) However, the Supreme Court was referring to a principle which prevails only in criminal actions. The court also later explicitly set such actions apart from adoption-related proceedings: \u201cIt is important to distinguish habeas corpus relief in a criminal case, where the defendant has been unlawfully deprived of his or her libery, from the appropriateness of habeas corpus in adoption cases. As we shall explain, there are compelling reasons for prohibiting a collateral attack by habeas corpus in an adoption case where such an attack would only result in additional delay, uncertainty and potential harm to the prospective adoptee.\u201d <em>(Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The mother further maintains (1) the order terminating her rights is neither final nor unmodifiable because she filed a timely notice of appeal, and (2) all dependency orders, by reason of the provisions of section 388, are modifiable until an adoption actually occurs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> First, there is neither authority nor reason to allow a parent to file what is nothing more than a bogus appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>from a termination order in order to preserve the right to present a habeas corpus petition challenging the order. Second, the availability of section 388 to a parent to secure a change in a dependency order is limited by section 366.26, subdivision (i), which prohibits modification of an order terminating parental rights except by a direct appeal. <em>(In re Ronald V., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1806.)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Last, the mother\u2019s attempt to distinguish her situation from that of the parent in <em>Alexander S. </em>is ineffectual.

In addition, <em>Laura H. </em>remarked that the purpose of the statute there in issue, \u00a7 366.26, subdivision (g), was to protect the parent\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. (8 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1694-1695.) However, a dependency proceeding is civil, not criminal, in nature.

To attempt to gain custody of the child, the parents filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in which they presented their case for revoking the then final judgment appointing the guardian. The Supreme Court held habeas corpus was available for such a purpose only where the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the judgment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 646.)

First, it may be used to enforce an existing right to physical custody established by prior order. <em>(In re Richard M. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 783, 789 [122 Cal.Rptr. 531, 537 P.2d 363]; <em>In re Barr </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 25, 27 [243 P.2d 787]; 36 Cal.Jur.3d, Habeas Corpus, \u00a7 17, p. 37.) Second, habeas corpus may be brought to determine physical custody in the first instance where no previous custody order has issued, i.e., where habeas corpus is not brought as a collateral attack. <em>(In re Croze </em>(1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 492, 495 [302 P.2d 595].) Third, habeas corpus is available to modify a modifiable order. <em>(In re Wren[, supra, </em>] 48 Cal.2d [at p.] 163. . . .) Fourth, a parent may bring a habeas corpus action to protect a child from imminent danger. <em>(In re Dowell </em>(1935) 4 Cal.App.2d 688, 689 [41 P.2d 596].) Fifth, there is authority allowing a natural parent lacking physical custody to bring an original action in habeas corpus where his or her consent to an adoption was required but not obtained. <em>(In re Reyna </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 288 [(126 Cal.Rptr. 138)].) Finally, habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>corpus may be brought to collaterally attack a prior order where the court issuing the prior order lacked jurisdiction. <em>(In re Barr, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d at 28; 36 Cal.Jur.3d, Habeas Corpus, \u00a7 17, p. 36.)\u201d <em>(Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 866-867.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Section 388 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-8\">\u201cAny parent or other person having an interest in a child who is a dependent child of the juvenile court or the child himself through a properly appointed guardian may, upon grounds of change of circumstance or new evidence, petition the court in the same action in which the child was found to be a dependent child of the juvenile court or in which a guardianship was ordered pursuant to Section 360 for a hearing to change, modify, or set aside any order of court previously made or to terminate the jurisdiction of the court.
