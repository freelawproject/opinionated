BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b130-18\">In his <em>pro se </em>complaint, Williams alleged Weiss and Anderson, two attorneys for Billing, Cochran, Heath, Lyles, Mauro &amp; Anderson, P.A. (Billing, Cochran), illegally recorded statements he made at an aborted deposition. He also alleged Judge Carney considered these recorded statements before compelling the taking of his deposition, imposing sanctions on him, and revoking his <em>pro hoc vice </em>status in a case brought by a corporation affiliated with Williams against the city of Fort Lauder-dale, which was represented by Billing, Cochran. Williams attached as exhibits to his complaint transcripts of the aborted deposition and the hearing in which Judge Carney allegedly used these statements to sanction him.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-19\">The district court dismissed his complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Williams asserts the district court erred in finding: (1) Judge Carney was entitled to absolute judicial immunity; (2) Williams had no reasonable expectation of privacy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>his statements at issue; (3) Weiss, Anderson, and Billing, Cochran, were not \u201cstate actors\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983; and (4) Weiss, Anderson, and Billing, Cochran were entitled to assert Florida\u2019s litigation privilege as a defense to suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss, taking as true the facts as alleged in the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Doe v. Pryor, </em>344 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2003). Motions to dismiss are only granted \u201cwhen the movant demonstrates \u2018beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spain v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>363 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">A. <em>Judicial immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Under the doctrine of judicial immunity, a judge is entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages for those acts taken: (1) while acting in a judicial capacity; unless (2) acting in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000). Whether an act is done within a judge\u2019s judicial capacity is determined by \u201cthe nature of the act itself, <em>i.e., </em>whether it is a function normally performed by a judge, and to the expectations of the parties, <em>ie., </em>whether they dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity.\u201d <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 112 S.Ct. 286, 288, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). As to the second requirement, a judge does not act in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction\u201d when he acts erroneously, maliciously, or in excess of his authority, but rather when he acts without <em>subject matter </em>jurisdiction. <em>Dykes v. Hosemann, </em>776 F.2d 942, 947-48 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">\u201cInjunctive relief shall not be granted\u201d in an action brought against \u201ca judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity ... unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\u201d <em>Bolin, </em>225 F.3d at 1242 (quotation omitted). Declaratory relief is available if a plaintiff establishes a violation, a serious risk of continuing irreparable injury if the relief is not granted, and the absence of an adequate remedy at law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">Judge Carney\u2019s state court orders compelling the taking of Williams\u2019 deposition, imposing sanctions on Williams, and revoking his <em>pro hac vice </em>status, as well as any \u201cuse\u201d of Williams\u2019 \u201cintercepted\u201d statements, were judicial acts because they were normal judicial functions in a case pending before him, occurred in his courtroom, and arose from dealings with him in his official capacity. Moreover, even assuming the truth of Williams\u2019 allegations, that Judge Carney improperly considered the intercepted statements before entering his orders, Judge Carney did not act in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction,\u201d as he still had subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings, regardless of a particular act. <em>See Dykes, </em>776 F.2d at 947-48. As such, the district court did not err in dismissing Williams\u2019 claims for monetary damages against Judge Carney under the doctrine of judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Moreover, Williams sought two forms of injunctive relief. First, he asked for an injunction \u201cfrom further disclosure and use of the aforesaid communication and the other material integrated and packaged in the motion improperly presented to, and used by the defendant Judge Carney to penalize plaintiff.\u201d \u25a0 However, Williams failed to allege what \u201cserious risk of continuing irreparable injury\u201d he faced absent such relief. Indeed, he admitted in his complaint he voluntarily dismissed the pri- or state suit. Without such an allegation, declaratory relief was unavailable to him, and the district court did not err in dismissing this claim. <em>See Bolin, </em>225 F.3d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Williams also asked for a \u201cmandatory injunction\u201d directing the removal and destruction of any court files containing his statements. This claim also fails because there was an adequate remedy at law, namely, an extraordinary writ, such as a writ of mandamus, to compel the proper parties to remove and destroy these papers. <em>See Bolin, </em>225 F.3d at 1242. Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing Williams\u2019 claims for injunctive relief against Judge Carney.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">B. <em>Section 934..10, Florida Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Section 934.10, Florida Statutes provides a civil remedy for persons whose wire, oral, or electronic communications are intercepted, disclosed, or used in violation of sections 934.03 \u2014 .09, Florida Statutes. \u201cOral communication\u201d is defined as \u201cany oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation....\u201d \u00a7 934.02(2), Fla. Stat. \u201cFrom this language, it is clear that the legislature did not intend that every oral communication be free from interception without the prior consent of all the parties to the communication.\u201d <em>State v. Inciarrano, </em>473 So.2d 1272, 1275 (Fla.1985). Rather, \u201c[a] reasonable expectation of privacy under a given set of circumstances depends upon one\u2019s actual subjective expectation of privacy <em>as well as whether society is prepared to recognize </em>this expectation as reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). In determining reasonableness under this provision, Florida\u2019s courts look to Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. <em>Brandin v. State, </em>669 So.2d 280, 282 n. 2 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996). Factors used include the location where the communication occurs, the manner in which the communication is made, and the kind of communication at issue. <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>667 So.2d 410, 412 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Exhibits to the complaint showed Williams, who appears to be a licensed attorney in New York, made his statements at an aborted deposition after he had introduced himself and objected to the proceedings and the recording of his statements. Yet, after he made these objections, Williams directed the statements at issue to those present. These statements, as well as the manner in which they were made, concerned a public proceeding and even if not to be recorded, were not qualified, in advance, as confidential, privileged, or private. Thus, the statements were not communications that society is prepared to recognize as falling under an objective expectation of privacy. <em>See Inciarrano, </em>473 So.2d at 1275 (finding an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in statements made with intent to do harm to another). Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing his section 934.10 claims, as his statements were not \u201coral communications\u201d within the meaning of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">C. <em>Section 1983</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">In order to prevail in a \u00a7 1983 action, \u201ca plaintiff must show that he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cOnly in rare circumstances can a private party be viewed as a \u2018state actor\u2019 for section 1983 purposes.\u201d <em>Harvey v. Harvey, </em>949 F.2d 1127, 1130 (11th Cir.1992). In order for a private party to be considered a \u201cstate actor,\u201d we have held one of three conditions must be met: (1) the state has coerced or at least significantly encouraged the action alleged to violate the Constitution; (2) the private party performed a public function that was traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state; or (3) the state had so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private party that it was a joint participant in the enterprise. <em>Rayburn ex rel. Rayburn v. Hogue, </em>241 F.3d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a private attorney, representing a city in a civil action, is a \u201cstate actor\u201d for \u00a7 1983 purposes, and further assuming these attorneys were \u201cstate actors,\u201d Williams failed to allege sufficient facts to show a violation of a federal right. <em>See Calhoun v. Lillenas Publishing, </em>298 F.3d 1228, 1230 n.2 (11th Cir.2002) (holding we \u201cmay affirm the district court on different grounds as long as \u2018the judgment entered is correct on any legal ground regardless of the grounds addressed, adopted or rejected by the district court\u2019\u201d). The district court did not err in dismissing Williams\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against Weiss, Anderson, and Billing, Cochran.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">While the Supreme Court has expressly held the Fourth Amendment protects against the \u201crecording of oral statements,\u201d it has also held \u201c[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 511-12, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). Taking Williams\u2019 allegations as true, his remarks were made publicly, for all those within earshot to hear. Under these circumstances, he cannot show the Fourth Amendment precludes the recording of such statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Moreover, Williams also failed to allege sufficient facts to establish a procedural or substantive due process violation under the Fifth Amendment. \u201cProcedural due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before any governmental deprivation of a property interest.\u201d <em>Zipperer v. City of Fort Myers, </em>41 F.3d 619, 623 (11th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). The substantive due process clause \u201cprotects only those rights that are \u2018fundamental,\u2019 that is, rights that are \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1556 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Williams did not allege any facts he was denied notice or an opportunity to be heard. Rather, he alleges that a court reporter \u2014 not named as a defendant \u2014 recorded his statements made to opposing counsel at an aborted deposition, and the law firm and attorneys used that statement to seek to compel his deposition and obtain an order revoking his <em>pro hac vice </em>status. Such actions do not invoke a \u201cfundamental right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d As such, Williams has failed to allege facts sufficient to establish the deprivation of a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">D. <em>Litigation privilege</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Under Florida law, \u201cabsolute immunity must be afforded to any act occurring during the course of a judicial proceeding ... so long as the act has some relation to the proceeding.\u201d <em>Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., </em>341 F.3d 1292, 1302 n. 8 (11th Cir. 2003). This litigation privilege \u201cextends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>not only to the parties in a proceeding but to ... counsel as well.\u201d <em>Levin, Middlebrooks, Mabie, Thomas, Mayes &amp; Mitchell, P.A. v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>639 So.2d 606, 608 (Fla.1994). As such, this privilege bars tort claims based on counsel\u2019s conduct during the course of litigation. <em>See Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., </em>372 F.3d 1250, 1275-76 (11th Cir. 2004) (holding Florida\u2019s litigation privilege barred suit against attorneys). Further, we have held \u201cFlorida law suggests that the Florida courts would agree that \u2018events taking place outside the courtroom during discovery ... [are] deserving of the protection of the [litigation] privilege____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Williams based his state tort law claims on an attorney\u2019s conduct at an aborted deposition and at a subsequent hearing on a motion to compel. Such conduct by an attorney at a judicial proceeding is protected by absolute immunity under Florida\u2019s litigation privilege. Moreover, as discussed above, none of the Appellees engaged in criminal actions under Florida law, and thus Williams\u2019 argument that the privilege was waived necessarily fails.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The district court did not err in: (1) finding Judge Carney was entitled to absolute judicial immunity; (2) finding Williams had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his statements at issue; (3) dismissing Williams\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against Weiss, Anderson, and Billing, Cochran; and (4) concluding Weiss, Anderson, and Billing, Cochran were entitled to assert Florida\u2019s litigation privilege as a defense to suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-13\">.
