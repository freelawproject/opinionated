In his appeal brief, Jasem moves this Court to remand his case to the BIA for consideration, or to take judicial notice, of evidence allegedly proving changes in country conditions in Iraq since the BIA issued its removal order. Jasem also argues that substantial evidence did not support (1) the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination; (2) the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>that humanitarian asylum was not warranted, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii); and (3) the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s conclusions that Jasem was not statutorily eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny Jasem\u2019s motion to remand or to take judicial notice of new evidence, and we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On September 7, 2001, Jasem, a native and citizen of Iraq, illegally entered the United States and was detained. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> subsequently served Jasem with a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging him with removability, pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (7) (A) (i) (I), for entering the United States without proper documentation. In November 2001, during a preliminary hearing before an IJ, Jasem admitted the facts contained in his NTA and conceded removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In December 2001, Jasem filed a counseled application for asylum and for withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT. Jasem asserted in his application that, if he returned to Iraq, he would be persecuted by the government on account of his religious affiliations and political opinions imputed to him as a Shiite Muslim, and as the \u201cfirst next person old enough for questioning\u201d about his brother\u2019s disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">On September 24, 2003, at a hearing on Jasem\u2019s application for relief from removal, Jasem, who was the sole witness, offered the following testimony. Jasem was 41 years\u2019 old, was born in Baghdad, Iraq, and was a Shiite Muslin. Jasem had a sister who lived in the United States, and a wife, son, mother, four sisters, and an older brother, Kazim, who lived in Baghdad. Jasem\u2019s oldest brother, Falah, had disappeared in November 1981, during Iraq\u2019s war with Iran.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Jasem further testified that, in July 1991, officials with General Intelligence, a government agency, had come to his home and questioned him for approximately an hour and a half about his brother Falah, whom the officials believed had defected from the Iraq army in 1981, and had joined a group that was loyal to the Iranians. After Jasem denied having had any contact with Falah since his disappearance, the officials left, but stated that they would return. In September 1991, the \u201csame people\u201d returned to Jasem\u2019s home, made similar inquiries about Falah, and explained that they had stopped paying Falah\u2019s salary to Falah\u2019s wife because the officials believed that Falah was a traitor to Iraq.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Between September 1991 and December 2000, when Jasem left Iraq, government officials visited him approximately 15 times, each time attempting to get him to reveal information about Falah or Falah\u2019s whereabouts. In July 1995, during one of these visits, government officials came to Jasem\u2019s home and escorted him blindfolded in a vehicle to an eight-by-five-foot \u201cred room,\u201d which had a cupboard and a bathroom. The officials left Jasem in the \u201cred room\u201d overnight, after which time they took him to another room and interrogated him. During this interrogation, which lasted approximately an hour, an officer (1) again asked Jasem about Falah, and (2) stated that Jasem was a Shiite who <em>\u201cbelonged] </em>to Iran.\u201d Moreover, in February 1996, government officials drove Jasem blindfolded to another location to be interrogated. After Jasem again stated that he had no information, he was detained overnight and then told that he needed to bring information in the future.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In addition to stating generally that these officials visited him twice in 1997 and three times in 1998, Jasem testified that, in January 2000, the officials took him to an office, at which Jasem was interrogated by an official whom Jasem believed was high ranking in the Iraqi government. After Jasem informed this official that he had no information, the official told Jasem that the government had a new method that it intended to use on him to get him to cooperate. This official then instructed another person to take Jasem to \u201cthe place with the snakes.\u201d Jasem was taken to a glass-walled room that had a snake lying in one corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">During the two to three hours that Jasem was left in the room with the snake, he called the guard to take him to use the restroom. When the guard eventually responded, the snake was in front of Jasem and the guard told Jasem he had to wait. The guard later took Jasem to the \u201cred room,\u201d where Jasem spent the night before being taken to the official for another interrogation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">In November 2000, the last time the government officials visited Jasem, they took him to a new office and, this time, advised him in a threatening manner that, if he did not cooperate, the officials were going to turn his case over to a \u201cspecial court.\u201d The officials then took Jasem to the \u201cred room,\u201d where he stayed for seven days before the officials took him back to an office for additional interrogation. When Jasem arrived at the office, the official injected Jasem with an unknown substance to \u201crelax\u201d him. When Jasem stated that he knew nothing about Falah, the official yelled at him, called him names, and again told him that, if he did not give them information within the next month, they would take him to a \u201cspecial court.\u201d Jasem stated that he believed that this \u201cspecial court\u201d meant a court where he would have no rights, and the government either would order him killed or jailed. Thus, in December 2000, after Jasem was released, he left Iraq.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Jasem further stated that, after he left Iraq, his family sent him letters warning him that government officials had continued looking for him and had brought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Jasem\u2019s home a police order, directing him to appear\u2019 at the Intelligence Agency Center. One of Jasem\u2019s sisters also informed him in a letter that the officials had confiscated a medical center that he had operated for 12 years and had burned his vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, when Jasem\u2019s family attempted to report this burning, the police informed them that only the owner of the vehicle could make a report. Jasem also testified that, despite the change in regime in Iraq between his departure and the evidentiary hearing, and despite the fact that the government officials who had persecuted him no longer were part of the government, he believed that he would be subject to reprisals by these persons because he previously had refused to cooperate with them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The record also contained the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2002 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Iraq (\u201c2002 Country Reports\u201d). This document included that, in 2002, although Iraq claimed to be a democratic republic, political power rested exclusively in \u201ca harshly repressive one-party apparatus dominated by Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti and members of his extended family,\u201d and Iraq\u2019s human rights record remained extremely poor. Under Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, the government summarily executed alleged political opponents and leaders of the Shiite religious community, along with persons who merely were associated with opposition groups. The government also was responsible for disappearances and torturing persons suspected of, or related to persons suspected of, among other things, opposition politics, economic crimes, and military desertion. Although Iraq\u2019s Constitution and legal code explicitly prohibited arbitrary arrests and detentions, the authorities routinely engaged in these activities, along with denying detainees access to lawyers and fair public trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The government, however, introduced three articles from the Miami Herald, dated September 22 and 23, 2003, which included the following headlines: \u201cIraq\u2019s governing council takes U.N. seat,\u201d \u201cBush rejects call for quick Iraq handover,\u201d and \u201cIraq will be democratic, two leaders say.\u201d These articles discussed the changed political climate in Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime in March 2003. Moreover, the IJ stated that he \u201cwould be taking administrative notice of changes that ha[d] occurred in the country of Iraq, because they were of such a notable degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>At the conclusion of this hearing, the IJ issued an oral decision, denying Jasem\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and CAT, and ordering him removed to Iraq. After summarizing the evidence in the record, the IJ determined that, although Jasem\u2019s testimony, if true, established past persecution, his testimony lacked credibility. In reaching this adverse credibility determination, the IJ cited to (1) inconsistencies between Jasem\u2019s testimony and his application on the ages of his brothers and the reason why Jasem was contacted about Falah\u2019s disappearance; (2) Jasem\u2019s failure to state earlier all the facts to which he testified during his removal hearing, including that he was placed in a cell with a snake; and (3) inconsistencies in the record relating to Jasem\u2019s testimony that he was detained and beaten in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Alternatively, the IJ determined that, even if the IJ were to consider Jasem\u2019s testimony as credible, asylum was not warranted because a fundamental change in the country conditions had occurred, and Jasem had no well-founded fear of future persecution upon his return to Iraq. The IJ specifically noted that, in light of the end of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime- \u2014 the regime under which Jasem had resided before he entered the United States \u2014 a fundamental change in the country\u2019s conditions had occurred. The IJ also noted that, although \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201carmed strife\u201d remained in Iraq, the evidence in the record showed that, through military force, monies, and other assistance, Iraq was becoming a democratic country, free from the abuses described in the 2002 Country Reports. The IJ discussed that, due to these changed country conditions, Jasem also was not eligible for withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT. In addition, the IJ clarified that, although it understood that it could grant humanitarian asylum based on past persecution alone, the record did not reflect that Jasem would face problems on his return to Iraq, other than those associated with earning a livelihood.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Jasem appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. In a supporting brief, Jasem argued that the IJ\u2019s decision denying him asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT should be reversed because the IJ erred in (1) making an adverse credibility finding based on alleged inconsistencies and omissions in the record that either did not exist or were not central to Jasem\u2019s claims; (2) finding changed circumstances sufficient to rebut a presumption of a well-founded fear; and (3) failing to consider that, even if changed country conditions existed, a grant of asylum was warranted for humanitarian reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In March 2005, the BIA affirmed and adopted without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision as to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The BIA, however, also added that, even if Jasem had been credible, there had been a fundamental change in circumstances in Iraq, such that Jasem did not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on his original claims for asylum and withholding of removal. The BIA explained that it was taking administrative notice of the fact that Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime in Iraq had been replaced, the Ba\u2019ath Party no longer was in power, and Iraq, which subsequently was being governed by a Governing Council, was made up of different religions and political parties, with different agendas, and, therefore, represented all sections of Iraqi society. The BIA also stated that, although it recognized that the situation in Iraq was unstable, and that Ba\u2019ath Party loyalists were still physically present in Iraq, the basis of Jasem\u2019s claims for relief was from the Ba\u2019ath Party itself, and he could avoid these loyalists by relocating to another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>part of Iraq. Jasem then filed this timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">As a preliminary matter, as part of his brief on appeal, Jasem moves us to take judicial notice of political developments in Iraq that have occurred since the BIA issued its order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision in March 2005. Jasem also attaches for our review four newspaper articles, which he contends show ongoing \u201cgross, flagrant and mass violations of human rights in Iraq.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Before the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, we utilized 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2347(c) to invoke our discretionary authority to remand immigration cases, such that new non-record evidence could be admitted on appeal, or cases could be remanded for the BIA or the IJ to consider this evidence in the first instance. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). The IIR-IRA, however, expressly prohibits a court reviewing a BIA removal order from remanding a case for the consideration of additional evidence. <em>See </em>INA 242(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Moreover, the IIRIRA provides that \u201cthe court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). Thus, we have concluded that we \u201ccannot find, or consider, facts not raised in the administrative forum.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1278 (holding in a transitional rules case that we \u201ccannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below\u201d). Accordingly, to the extent Jasem is moving us to remand his case to the IJ or the BIA, or to consider new evidence of changed country conditions, we are foreclosed from granting this relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Issue 1: <em>The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Jasem argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination must be overturned because none of the IJ\u2019s factual determinations is supported by substantial evidence, and, even if substantial evidence existed, the alleged inconsistencies on which the IJ relied either were explained or were insignificant in light of the overwhelming weight of other evidence Jasem submitted. When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cInsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and marks omitted). Because the BIA expressly adopted, without opinion, the IJ\u2019s reasoning as to Jasem\u2019s credibility, we review only the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See id. </em>However, because the BIA articulated its reasons for adopting the IJ\u2019s other determinations, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA in deciding Jasem\u2019s remaining arguments. <em>See id. </em>(reviewing the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA when the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning and briefly articulated its reasons for do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Furthermore, to the extent that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions were based on legal determinations, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). On the other hand, the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [ ] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation and marks omitted). \u201cUnder the substantial evidence test, we review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). Thus, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">A credibility determination also is reviewed under the substantial evidence test; thus, we \u201cmay not substitute its judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments. <em>See In re B-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 66, 70, 1995 WL 326740 (BIA 1995); <em>see also Dailide v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>387 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2004) (affirming the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based upon its finding that the alien\u2019s testimony conflicted with his answers to interrogatories and other documentary evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. However, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If an applicant produces evidence beyond his own testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201cthe IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons!,]\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Here, the IJ offered \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for his adverse credibility finding. These reasons also were supported by substantial evidence in the record. To the extent the IJ cited to inconsistencies relating to the ages of Jasem\u2019s brothers, Jasem testified during his removal hearing that he was the youngest. Jasem, however, also testified during this hearing that \u201c[m]y older brother\u2019s name is Falah Hassan Jasem. And my youngest brother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>name is Kazim Hassan Jasem.\u201d Additionally, Jasem included in his asylum application, in explaining why officials questioned him about Falah\u2019s disappearance, that Jasem \u201cwas the first next person old enough for questioning (my brother\u2019s son is not old enough).\u201d Although Jasem subsequently attempted to explain this inconsistency and why the officials had not, instead, questioned his older brother liazim, by stating that Kazim was partially deaf and illiterate, the IJ properly considered the consistency of Jasem\u2019s testimony with his written application. <em>See Dailide, </em>387 F.3d at 1343. Moreover, this inconsistency related to Jasem\u2019s reason why he believed he was persecuted in the past and would be persecuted in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Similarly, to the extent the IJ relied on Jasem\u2019s failure to include in his application for relief his testimony on being detained in a room with a snake in January 2000, a review of the record reflects that Jasem failed to mention this incident either during his initial interview with an immigration officer, as part of his credible-fear interview, or in his application for relief. Despite Jasem\u2019s cross-examination testimony during his removal hearing that he was beaten while he was detained in 1996, he neither stated that he was beaten during direct examination, nor in his application. Moreover, although Jasem submitted a voluminous amount of supporting documents on the country conditions in Iraq during Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, along with evidence relating to his claim that he would face prosecution in a \u201cspecial court\u201d if he was returned to Iraq, he did not submit documentary evidence supporting his individual claims of past persecution. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Thus, Jasem has failed to show that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination \u201cwas not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons[,]\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Regardless, as the government asserts and as discussed below, even if the IJ erred in reaching its adverse credibility determination, and even if Jasem established past persecution, he failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal because of changed country conditions in Iraq.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Issue 2: <em>The IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determinations that humanitarian asylum was not warranted, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(in)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Jasem also argues that the IJ erred in failing to consider that, even if a well-founded fear of future persecution did not exist, a grant of humanitarian asylum was warranted based on the severity and length of Jasem\u2019s past persecution. Without citing to the record, Jasem contends that this exercise of authority was warranted because he suffered ten years of interrogation, arbitrary detentions, beatings, inadequate food and water, and severe psychological abuse and intimidation. Jasem also asserts that, because his past persecutors remain in Iraq and are being incorporated into the new government, he and his family still have legitimate fears.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">As discussed above, because the BIA commented on why it was adopting the IJ\u2019s decision denying relief from removal, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions. <em>See Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 956. An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General have discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201cThe asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u2018refugee\u2019 status.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">To establish asylum eligibility, the petitioner must, with specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. If the petitioner demonstrates past persecution, there is a rebut-table presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If he cannot show past persecution, then the petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be proved \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Jasem is not challenging on appeal the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s conclusions that, even if he established past persecution, the government rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution by establishing changed country conditions. Thus, we deem any arguments relating these determinations abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the petitioner abandoned the issue of the denial of relief under the CAT by not raising any challenges to it in her brief). Instead, Jasem is arguing that, despite these changed country conditions, the IJ and BIA abused their discretion in not granting him humanitarian asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">In <em>Matter of Chen, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 16, 1989 WL 331860 (BIA 1989), the BIA determined that, even if the presumption of future persecution arising from past persecution has been rebutted, an alien may have suffered such severe or atrocious forms of persecution at the hands of the former regime such that it would be inhumane to require the alien to return to his home country. <em>Id. </em>at 19. The BIA further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">[Tjhere may be cases where the favorable exercise of discretion is warranted for humanitarian reasons even if there is little likelihood of future persecution. ... It is frequently recognized that a person who \u2014 or whose family\u2014 has suffered under atrocious forms of persecution should not be expected to repatriate. Even though there may have been a change of regime in the country, this may not always produce a complete change in the attitude of the population, nor, in view of his past experiences, in the mind of the refugee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-12\"><em>Id. </em>Applying this analysis, the BIA in <em>Chen </em>granted humanitarian asylum to an applicant who had been disabled by torture and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the denial of medical care during China\u2019s \u201cCultural Revolution,\u201d and who was suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. <em>Id. </em>at 19-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">This category of asylum is now codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii), which provides that an IJ may grant an applicant humanitarian asylum on a discretionary basis if the applicant has demonstrated \u201ccompelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution,\u201d or \u201ca reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii)(A), (B). As discussed above, \u201c[t]he burden of proof is on the applicant for asylum to establish that he is a refugee.... The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We have not in a previous opinion applied this regulation. The BIA, however, has interpreted this form of relief to require an applicant first to show \u201csevere harm\u201d and \u201clong-lasting effects.\u201d <em>See In re N-M-A </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 312, 326, 1998 WL 744095 (BIA 1998); <em>see also Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1327 n. 4 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to \u201cgreat deference,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he degree of deference is especially great in the field of immigration\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">In the instant case, contrary to Jasem\u2019s argument on appeal, the IJ explicitly stated that he had considered the applicability of humanitarian asylum. Nevertheless, the IJ concluded that the record did not reflect that Jasem would face problems on his return to Iraq, other than those associated with earning a living. Indeed, at the time of the hearing, Jasem\u2019s wife, son, mother, four sisters, and a brother still were living in the Baghdad area. Moreover, although Jasem testified that, for a period of approximately ten years, he suffered repeated detentions and interrogations, including being beaten on one occasion and being placed in a room with a snake, he did not testify that this treatment resulted in \u201csevere harm\u201d or \u201clong-lasting effects.\u201d <em>See In re N-M-A </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. at 326. Thus, we conclude that Jasem failed to show either extreme past persecution or compelling reasons why humanitarian asylum was warranted in his case. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a), (b)(l)(iii)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Issue 3: <em>The IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s conclusions that Jasem was not statutorily eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Jasem last argues that the IJ and BIA erred in failing to consider independently Jasem\u2019s claim for withholding of removal under the CAT. Jasem asserts that the IJ wrongly denied Jasem\u2019s claim for CAT relief based on the IJ\u2019s finding that Jasem lacked credibility, and, thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ignored documentary evidence in the record reflecting that members of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime still were torturing and killing Iraqi citizens. Jasem concludes that, because he established past torture and that opponents of the regime change in Iraq still are torturing civilians, his case should be remanded to the IJ for independent consideration of his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">As discussed above, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions denying CAT relief, <em>see Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 956, and their factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84. To be entitled to mandatory withholding of removal under the CAT, an applicant must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). \u201cTorture\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected or having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2). We have concluded that the burden of proof for an applicant seeking withholding of removal under the CAT, like that for an applicant seeking withholding of removal under the INA, is higher than the burden imposed on an asylum applicant. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303-04. Thus, if a petitioner fails to demonstrate a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d sufficient to support an asylum claim, he or she likewise cannot demonstrate \u201ctorture\u201d sufficient to warrant relief under the CAT. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Here, because Jasem is not challenging the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determinations that he failed to demonstrate a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution,\u201d he cannot meet the higher burden of demonstrating \u201ctorture\u201d sufficient to warrant CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>Regardless, even if Jasem established that, upon his return to Iraq, he will suffer \u201can extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment\u201d at the hands of his past persecutors who have remained in Iraq, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2), his argument fails. Although Jasem is arguing that the IJ and the BIA erroneously relied solely on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in denying him withholding of removal under the CAT, the record reflects that the IJ and the BIA, at least implicitly, also examined Iraq\u2019s changed country conditions. Moreover, Jasem has not challenged the IJ\u2019s determination that, following the demise of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, Iraq\u2019s official government has changed, and these persecutors no longer are in control. Thus, applying \u00a7 208.18(a)(l)\u2019s definition of \u201ctorture,\u201d Jasem failed to show that, on return to Iraq, he will be tortured by a \u201cpublic official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). The IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determinations that Jasem was not eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT, therefore, were supported by substantial evidence in the record and should be affirmed. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that we are foreclosed under the IIRIRA from either remanding Jasem\u2019s case to the IJ or the BIA, or considering new evidence of changed country conditions. We also conclude that Jasem has failed to show that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons,\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence in the record. Jasem has failed to show that, assuming the availability of humanitarian asylum, this extraordinary relief was warranted in this case. Furthermore, because Jasem failed to show that he will be \u201ctortured\u201d by a \u201cpublic official\u201d on his return to Iraq, the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determinations that Jasem was not statutorily eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT was supported by substantial evidence. We, therefore, deny Jasem\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">.
