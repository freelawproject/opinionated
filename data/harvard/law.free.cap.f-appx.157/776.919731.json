Miles\u2019s civil rights suit was dismissed by the district court pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Fearing that upon exhaustion of his habeas remedies his federal suit will be deemed time-barred, he seeks the aforementioned relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-17\">However, a suit brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that challenges the legality of the plaintiffs conviction, or in Miles\u2019s case a disciplinary conviction, is not cognizable unless the conviction has been invalidated. <em>See Arvie v. Broussard, </em>42 F.3d 249, 250 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). Given that Miles has not secured the invalidation of his disciplinary conviction on habeas review, his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 cause of action has not yet accrued, and, consequently, the statute of limitations has not commenced. Miles\u2019s motion for a stay or, in the alternative, equitable tolling is therefore denied. Furthermore, given that any appeal would be frivolous, <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983), the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-22\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b802-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
