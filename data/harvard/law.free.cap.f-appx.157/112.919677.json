Gamba was a probationary police officer for the City, but was terminated for failing to complete his probationary period satisfactorily. Gamba contends that his termination was in retaliation for having requested leave under the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">The FMLA does not insulate an employee who has requested medical leave from being terminated for poor performance. So long as the employer would have taken the same action it did regardless of the request for leave, there is no statutory violation. <em>Strickland v. Water Works and Sewer Bd. of the City of Birmingham, </em>239 F.3d 1199 (11th Cir.2001). Although Gamba contends his termination was in retaliation for having requested leave under FMLA, the City\u2019s position that he was terminated after numerous documented instances of unsatisfactory job performance is well-supported by the record. Gamba was given, and does not dispute that he received, several written notices of problems in his job performance during his probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">The district court noted that Gamba \u201cproduced virtually no evidence in response\u201d except to point to the temporal relationship between the leave request and his termination. Where the employer produces significant evidence of the employee\u2019s poor performance, it is not enough that the request for leave and the termination are closely related in time. <em>Wascura v. City of South Miami, </em>257 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir.2001) (affirming summary judgment for employer where employee presented virtually no evidence, other than temporal proximity of the events).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">Having carefully reviewed the briefs and the record, and finding no error in the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, we conclude that the judgment is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
