On appeal, Johnson argues that there is insufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict as to Count Two because he never possessed the firearm used in the offense. In addition, Johnson argues that the district court violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, as defined by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), by considering the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALH\">\n<em>Insufficient Evidence as to Count Two</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-27\">We review <em>de novo </em>the disposition of a defendant\u2019s properly preserved motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir. 1994). We must determine whether a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Pistone, </em>177 F.3d 957, 958 (11th Cir. 1999). We must view the facts, and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1236 (11th Cir.2001). Reasonable inferences, and not mere speculation, must support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. <em>PerezTosta, </em>36 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), an individual who uses, carries, or possesses a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and who brandishes the firearm, shall receive a mandatory sentence of not less than seven years to be served consecutively with the sentence for the violent crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). In addition, an individual that aids or abets a criminal offense shall be punished as a principal of the crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">To prove aiding and abetting others in violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), the government must show that \u201ca substantive offense was committed, that the defendant associated himself with the criminal venture, and that he committed some act which furthered the crime.\u201d <em>See Bazemore v. United States, </em>138 F.3d 947, 949 (11th Cir.1998) (addressing a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate); <em>see also United States v. Thomas, </em>987 F.2d 697, 701-02 (11th Cir. 1993). In addition, there must be \u201csome proof \u2018linking\u2019 the defendant to the gun, because section 924(c) does not permit \u2018guilt by association.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bazemore, </em>138 F.3d at 949. We held in <em>Thomas </em>that \u201ca 924(c) conviction must be supported by evidence directly showing defendant\u2019s knowledge that a gun would be used in the commission of the offense.\u201d 987 F.2d at 702 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In this case, when the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) a crime was committed, (2) Johnson associated himself with the criminal endeavor, (3) Johnson knew a firearm would be used or that it was reasonably foreseeable that a firearm would be used, and (4) Johnson was linked to the gun through testimony of witnesses. Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction as to Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\n<em>Booker Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Johnson raises this issue for the first time on appeal. If a defendant does not raise <em>Booker </em>objections in the district court, this Court reviews the district court\u2019s decision for plain error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir.2005), <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In the case at bar, there were no constitutional errors under <em>Booker </em>because there were no enhancements made to Johnson\u2019s sentence. However, there was a statutory <em>Booker </em>error because Johnson was sentenced using a mandatory Guidelines system, and that error is plain. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. Despite this error, Johnson cannot meet the third prong of the plain-error standard because he cannot demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected by the error. Because the district court never indicated that it would have sentenced Johnson differently if the Guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory, Johnson cannot prevail. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1332. Accordingly, the error was harmless, and we affirm Johnson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-19\">.

I concur without qualification in the affix<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>manee of Johnson\u2019s conviction. I concur in the court\u2019s affirmance of Johnson\u2019s sentence only because binding precedent requires that the sentence be upheld. It must be upheld \u201c[b]ecause the district court never indicated that it would have sentenced Johnson differently if the Guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory.\u201d Ante at-.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">As I have explained at length, our precedent, <em>United States v. </em>Rodriguez<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and its progeny, including <em>United States v. Shelton </em>(relied on by the court, ante at-), though <em>Booker </em>error, which is \u201cplain,\u201d has occurred, we are precluded from vacating the defendant\u2019s sentence unless the record \u201ccontains some indication that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had the law permitted it to treat the guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. We look to what the court said prior to or in the course of imposing sentence. We look for what I call \u2018magic words.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1302 (11th Cir.2005) (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring). This \u201cmagic words\u201d standard is bad law; it does \u201cdisservice ... to rule-of-law values, to the criminal justice system in general, and to the defendant in particular.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1304 n. 2. Why so? Because telling the defendant that but for the mandatory nature of the guidelines he would receive a lesser sentence is, in so many words, telling the defendant that the sentence he is receiving is \u201cunjust and unfair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1303. Having heard this from the court, itself, the defendant is inclined to believe it and, moreover, is \u201cunlikely to accept the justice of his punishment and \u2018enter the correctional system in a frame of mind that affords hope for success in rehabilitation over a shorter period of time than might otherwise be necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he judge may also unwittingly encourage the defendant to persist in attacking his sentence on direct appeal and collateral review, notwithstanding that its substance and the manner of its imposition are legally correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Were we not bound by precedent, I would vacate Johnson\u2019s sentence and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing held under the sentencing model <em>Booker </em>has created.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-21\">. 406 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
