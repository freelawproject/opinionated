Vazquez argues that the district court clearly erred by failing to award him a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) for having a minor role in the offense. He argues that he was a mere courier who was hired to drive a car loaded with cocaine across the border to a certain destination within the United States, leave the car, and return to Mexico. He asserts that other participants in the offense were more culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-18\">A defendant\u2019s status as a courier does not necessarily render him a minor participant. <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). The defendant bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that his role was minor, but the district court need not accept self-serving statements about the defendant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-19\">Following his arrest, Vazquez admitted to officers that he knew the vehicle contained contraband and that he was to be paid $7,000 for smuggling the drugs into the United States. In view of the quantity and purity of the cocaine found in the vehicle, the district court did not clearly err by denying Vazquez an adjustment for playing a minor role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 713 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d at 137-38; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.9).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b778-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
