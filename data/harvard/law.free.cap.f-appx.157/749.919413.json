He seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The record reflects that Ramirez-Nunez knowingly and voluntarily waived his \u201cright to appeal any sentence imposed within the guidelines range.\u201d Specifically, Ramirez-Nunez waived \u201cthe right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined\u201d unless the sentence was \u201cimposed above the statutory maximum\u201d or constituted \u201can upward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines .... \u201d The exceptions to Ramirez-Nunez\u2019s waiver-of-appeal provision do not permit an appeal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">As Ramirez-Nunez\u2019s appeal waiver clearly precludes this appeal, and as Ramirez-Nunez has not raised any argument that the waiver-of-appeal provision is invalid or otherwise inapplicable, we DISMISS the appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Larry Warner, Ramirez-Nunez\u2019s attorney on appeal, is warned that pursuing frivolous appeals will invite sanctions. <em>See United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 224 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
