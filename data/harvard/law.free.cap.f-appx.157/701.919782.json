He asserts that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-22\">Because Conner\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on facts neither admitted by him nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, it was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment and <em>Booker:</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Where, as here, the defendant preserved the error in district court, we will vacate the sentence and remand unless the Government shows that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To do this, it must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the court would have given the defendant the same sentence had it thought the Guidelines were advisory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-23\">The Government has not met this burden. Although the district court stated that it would have imposed a 36-month sentence had the Guidelines been advisory, the court was able to impose that longer sentence at the time as it was within the Guidelines range of 33 to 41 months. As a result, we are unsure whether its statement was a misstatement. Because we must vacate Conner\u2019s sentence due to <em>Booker </em>error, we do not address Conner\u2019s argument that the district court erred by denying him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-24\">Conner\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
