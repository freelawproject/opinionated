He argues that the district court erred in computing his criminal history category because it failed to consider certain prior convictions as \u201crelated\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2. He contends that the sentences in those cases were consolidated because the sentences were concurrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-22\">The prior sentences were based on separate convictions in cases that involved various types of crimes. These crimes involved independent arrests and were distinguished by different offense dates' and cause numbers. Thus, there is no basis to conclude that the prior sentences are \u201crelated\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>962 F.2d 479, 482-83 (5th Cir.1992), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001); <em>United States v. Velazquez-Overa, </em>100 F.3d 418, 423-24 (5th Cir.1996). Bennette\u2019s argument that <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Velasquez-Overa </em>were wrongly decided and should be overruled is unavailing. We are bound by this court\u2019s precedent on the issue. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Velasquez, </em>322 F.3d 868, 876 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
