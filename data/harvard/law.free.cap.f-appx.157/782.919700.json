Ekwerekwu argues that his sentence was unconstitutional in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) because it was based on drug quantities not determined by the jury. He contends that he is entitled to seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 offers an inadequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Because Ekwerekwu challenges errors that occurred at sentencing, the claim may not be asserted in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Ekwerekwu\u2019s argument that he is entitled to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because relief under that section is \"inadequate or ineffective\u201d is unavailing. <em>Id. </em>at 427. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b808-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
