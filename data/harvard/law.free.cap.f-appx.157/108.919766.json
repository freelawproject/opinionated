We affirm Defendant\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">Defendant contends that his Confrontation Clause rights were violated by the introduction at trial of a 911 call. The West Palm Beach Police Department received a 911 call on 5 November 2003 that disconnected; a civilian 911 dispatch operator immediately returned the call. The dispatcher spoke with an unidentified female who said that a man was holding his girlfriend at gunpoint in a nearby apartment. The unidentified female also said that the parties in the nearby apartment had been fighting, and she described the male as a black male named \u201cHarold\u201d and described the gun as a black handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">Police officers responded to the address of the 911 caller and heard a woman screaming loudly for help. A gathering crowd directed the officers to apartment 4. The officers entered apartment 4 and saw Defendant striking a woman. In plain view, on the bed, was a .38 caliber revolver within Defendant\u2019s reach. At first, Defendant ignored the officers command to stop; one officer struck Defendant. Although Defendant dropped down on one knee, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>officers observed that he lunged toward the firearm. At the police station, Defendant told the officers that he used the gun only to scare his girlfriend and acknowledged that he was not allowed to have a firearm as a convicted felon. Defendant also said the gun was given to him by his father who recently died.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The government offered the 911 tape into evidence relying on the excited-utterance and present-sense-impression exceptions to the hearsay rule. Defendant objected to the applicability of the exceptions and argued further that, hearsay exceptions notwithstanding, the 911 tape was inadmissible \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The district court admitted the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On appeal, Defendant pursues only his Confrontation Clause challenge to the admission of the 911 tape. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court determined that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause prohibits the government from introducing \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay, irrespective of indicia of reliability unless the witness who made the out-of-court statement was unavailable and previously had been subjected to cross-examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1374. <em>Crawford </em>leaves expressly to another day a comprehensive definition of \u201ctestimonial,\u201d but offers this guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">Whatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations. These are the modern practices with closest kinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-9\"><em>Id. </em>Testimonial statements under <em>Crawford </em>may possibly also include, among others, affidavits, custodial examinations, confessions, depositions, prior testimony without the benefit of cross-examination, and \u201cstatements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Federal and state court decisions post-<em>Crawford </em>have struggled with the meaning of \u201ctestimonial\u201d in the context of 911 calls; most courts have concluded that the 911 statements under review were not testimonial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brun, </em>416 F.3d 703, 707 (8th Cir.2005) (child\u2019s excited utterances during 911 call nontestimonial); <em>Pitts v. State, </em>272 Ga.App. 182, 612 S.E.2d 1, 5 (2005) (statements in 911 calls made while incident actually occurring not testimonial); <em>Leavitt v. Arave, </em>383 F.3d 809, 830 n. 22 (9th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2540, 162 L.Ed.2d 277 (2005) (murder victim\u2019s identification of defendant in 911 call made during a home intrusion the night before the murder not testimonial); <em>State v. Wright, </em>686 N.W.2d 295, 302 (Minn.Ct.App.2004) (statements in 911 call made moments after a criminal offense not testimonial); <em>but see State v. Parks, </em>211 Ariz. 19, 116 P.3d 631, 640 (App.Div.2005) (rejecting categorical classification of all excited utterances as non-testimonial for <em>Crawford </em>purposes); <em>People v. Cortes, 4 </em>Misc.3d 575, 781 N.Y.S.2d 401, 415 (Sup.Ct.2004) (statements of witness to on-going shooting made to 911 dispatcher testimonial under Crawford). We need not weigh in on this issue: even if we were to assume that Defendant\u2019s Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>frontation Clause rights were violated, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Two police officers responding to the 911 call heard screaming from apartment 4. Upon entry, Defendant was observed by them striking a woman. The officers saw a revolver in plain view within Defendant\u2019s reach. Although neither officer saw Defendant actually hold the gun, testimony was presented that Defendant appeared to reach for the gun during his struggle with the officers. One officer testified also that Defendant \u2014 after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights \u2014 admitted to possession of the gun to scare his girlfriend, albeit he claimed to have no intent to fire it. Defendant also told the officers that the gun was given to him by his father and that he knew, as a convicted felon, he was unallowed to possess a firearm. In the light of the evidence linking Defendant to the gun, the introduction of the 911 tape was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 106 5. Ct. 1431, 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) (no reversal of conviction for Confrontation Clause violation that was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Defendant also challenges his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when it enhanced his sentence under the armed career criminal provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) where (i) the indictment did not include his prior felony convictions; and (ii) the sentencing court made the additional factual determinations that his prior felony convictions qualified as \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court determined that the fact of prior convictions need not be alleged in the indictment nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt to form the basis for a sentence enhancement. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, confirmed <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>when it too spoke to \u201ca fact (other than a prior conviction).\u201d And we have stated expressly <em>post-Booker </em>that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law. <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, 405 F.3d </em>960, 962-63 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 1, 2005) (No. 04-6961). No constitutional <em>Booker </em>error has been shown. <em>See United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.2004) (rejecting argument that district court erred under <em>Blakely </em>when it enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 based on uncharged prior convictions); <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (whether predicate convictions are \u201cviolent felonies\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(b) remains matter of law to be determined by court by reference to statutory elements, charging documents and jury instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Defendant\u2019s preserved constitutional challenge under <em>Blakely </em>also serves to preserve a statutory claim under <em>Booker. See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that a \u201ccitation to <em>Apprendi </em>or to other cases in that line of cases\u201d allows preserved <em>Booker-error </em>review). Statutory <em>Booker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the sentencing guidelines by considering them as mandatory as opposed to advisory. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2005). The district court determined the sentencing range under the guidelines to be 262 to 327 months; it sentenced Defendant under the mandatory guidelines to 262 months. Statutory <em>Booker </em>error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">We must determine whether the statutory error was harmless. As we have stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">[t]here are two harmless error standards. One of them applies to <em>Booker </em>constitutional errors, the other to <em>Booker </em>statutory errors.... <em>Booker </em>statutory errors ... are subject to [a] less demanding test.... A non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\"><em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2005) (citations, quotations, and alterations omitted). And, in preserved error review, the government bears the burden of proving harmless error. <em>Id. </em>at 1292. After review of the sentencing proceedings, we cannot say with fair assurance that Defendant\u2019s sentence was not swayed substantially by the mandatory application of the guidelines. \u2018We simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We AFFIRM Defendant\u2019s conviction; we VACATE Defendant\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing consistent with the remedial holding of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. In so ruling, the Supreme Court concluded that the previously applicable test set out in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), was fundamentally flawed. <em>Crawford, </em>124 S.Ct. at 1371. Under <em>Roberts, </em>the Confrontation Clause was deemed satisfied if the out-of-court statement had \"adequate \u2018indicia of reliability,\u2019 \u201d a standard that was met if the statement fell within a \"firmly rooted hearsay exception\" or had \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>100 S.Ct. at 2539.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">. Defendant\u2019s brief, filed before the <em>Booker </em>decision was announced, casts his claim in terms of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Because <em>Booker </em>applies to all cases pending on direct appeal, 125 S.Ct. at 769, we review Defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Booker. </em>Because Defendant raised his constitutional challenge in the district court, preserved error review applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
