While petition for <em>certiorari </em>with the Supreme Court was pending in this case, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It subsequently granted Jimenez-Cid\u2019s petition for certiorari and vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">The Government concedes, for purposes of argument, that there was <em>Booker </em>error because the district court enhanced Jimenez-Cid\u2019s sentence based on facts, other than a prior conviction, neither alleged in the indictment and proven to a jury nor admitted by Jimenez-Cid. However, because Jimenez-Cid concedes that he did not preserve this error, he must show that the error was plain by showing that the district court would have sentenced him less harshly had it known the Sentencing Guidelines were not mandatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He has not done so. There is no indication in the record that the court would have given a lower sentence; indeed, the only indication at all \u2014 that the court sentenced him at the top of the Guidelines range \u2014 suggests the opposite. Finally, Jimenez-Cid\u2019s argument that <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding cannot be applied to him retroactively is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">Jiminez-Cid\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b724-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AVt\">. 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-27\">. <em>See United States v.
