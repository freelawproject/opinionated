Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On appeal, Jackson concedes that he cannot raise a <em>Booker </em>claim through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, but argues that the inadequacy of \u00a7 2255 allows him to use the writ of <em>audita querela </em>to obtain postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Audita querela </em>was an ancient writ used to attack the enforcement of a judgment after it was rendered. <em>United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a prisoner may challenge his sentence by filing a motion for a writ of <em>audita querela. </em>\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u201c[Fjederal courts may properly fill the interstices of the federal postconviction remedial framework through remedies available at common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1175 (internal quotation omitted). The writ of <em>audita querela, </em>however, may not be granted when relief is cognizable under \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Because Jackson is collaterally attacking his sentence as unconstitutional, the appropriate avenue of relief is \u00a7 2255. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Federal courts must look beyond the labels of motions filed by <em>pro se </em>inmates to interpret them under whatever statute would provide relief. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). Here, Jackson specifically requested that his motion not be recharacterized as a \u00a7 2255 motion. However, Jackson would be unable to obtain <em>Booker </em>relief even through a \u00a7 2255 motion, as <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), ce<em>rt. denied by </em>\u2014 S.Ct. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 312, 163 L.Ed.2d 269 (2005). Therefore, the district court correctly denied Jackson\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that ... the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law ... may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
