Vargas argues that he was persecuted by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) guerillas in Colombia because they considered him disloyal to the revolution due to his work for his father assisting poor people in buying homes and land. To support his claim of persecution, Vargas states that his father was briefly kidnaped, his father\u2019s business partner was murdered, and Vargas received four threatening letters from the FARC telling him that they considered him and his family \u201cmilitary objectives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">On appeal, Vargas argues that individuals fleeing from persecution should have more than one year to decide to file for asylum. In response, the government argues that we do not have jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary decision that Vargas failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">\u201cWe review subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>Ortega v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>416 F.3d 1348, 1350 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002)). An alien can apply for asylum<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The Attorney General can accept an otherwise untimely applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tion if the alien demonstrates either 1) \u201cthe existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum,\u201d or 2) \u201cextraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified....\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). This decision is entirely up to the Attorney General, however, as \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General [under section 208(a)(2)(D) ].\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). We have held that this provision \u201cdivests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003). Further, we recently held that the recently enacted REAL ID Act does not change this conclusion. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the REAL ID Act, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005), did not change our existing precedent on this point).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Vargas admitted that he filed his application for asylum late, and both the IJ and the BIA determined that no special circumstances existed to except him from that requirement. We lack jurisdiction to review this decision. Accordingly, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction that much of the petition that addresses the timeliness of Vargas\u2019s asylum petition or the circumstances that Vargas argues excuses the untimely filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Vargas also argues that the BIA erred in finding that he failed to meet his burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted upon return to Colombia. Vargas argues that, in addition to the three threatening letters from the FARC that he received while still in Colombia, he received the final threatening letter long after the triggering events, and yet it still indicated that he was considered a military objective by the guerillas. In addition, Vargas argues that the police complaint that he filed against the FARC makes him an even more important target for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the Id\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Nreka v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001)). In this case, the BIA both expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision and made its own additional observations, so we will review both. \u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>(citing <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001)). We review the IJ and BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and we must \u201c \u2018affirm the [IJ and BIA\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (citation omitted)). Furthermore, under this standard we must \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). To reverse the BIA\u2019s decision, we must conclude that the record not only supports such a conclusion, but compels it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">In a withholding of removal claim, an alien will not be removed to a country if his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of his race, religion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The alien has the burden to establish that he would face persecution on account of one of the five enumerated grounds upon return to the proposed country of removal. <em>Antipova v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1264 (11th Cir.2004); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that an alien\u2019s \u201clife or freedom\u201d would again be threatened upon removal to the proposed country. <em>Antipova, </em>392 F.3d at 1264. Where the alien has not actually suffered past persecution, he bears the burden of establishing that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would suffer persecution upon removal. <em>Id.; </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(iii) and (b)(2). \u201cAn alien cannot demonstrate that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted on a protected ground if the IJ finds that the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of his country.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u201c \u2018[P]ersecution\u2019 is an \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u2019 and ... \u2018[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). \u201cNot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). In addition, \u201c[t]o qualify for withholding of removal based on persecution by a guerilla group on account of a political opinion, [Vargas] must establish that the guerillas persecuted [him] or will seek to persecute [him] in the future <em>because of </em>[his] actual or imputed political opinion.... It is not enough to show that [he] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [his] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (emphasis in the original). <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that an asylum applicant may not show merely that he has a political opinion, but must show that he was persecuted because of that opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">We note that the IJ did not specifically find Vargas credible or not credible and that therefore we will presume that credibility was not a dispositive issue. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (lack of credibility finding left the Court \u201cin the dark\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The record in this case does not show circumstances so \u201cextreme\u201d as to compel a finding of past persecution. Vargas\u2019s father was harassed and kidnaped, and a business associate was harassed and murdered, but Vargas himself has only received four threatening letters. Further, it is not even clear that Vargas actually was being persecuted for his political opinion, rather than his family\u2019s collective refusal to cooperate with the FARC, which is insufficient to support the charge of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">In addition, there is nothing to compel us to overturn the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determinations that Vargas has failed to demonstrate that he will more likely than not face persecution if he returns. Vargas\u2019s family has lived safely in Bogota since 1999. This is strong evidence that Vargas will be able to relocate and avoid the FARC. This makes it impossible for Vargas to claim that he will more likely than not face persecution. Accordingly, we deny Vargas\u2019s petition for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">PETITION DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-12\">.
