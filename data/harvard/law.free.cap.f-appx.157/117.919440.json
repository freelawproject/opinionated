Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Garner v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 41, 163 L.Ed.2d 31 (2005). As Garner acknowledged in his reply brief when we first heard his appeal of his sentence, he did not raise his <em>Booker </em>objection <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>initial brief but raised it in his motions for supplemental briefing on the issue. Normally, under our established prudential rule, we would not consider issues not raised in the initial briefs on appeal. <em>United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1275-76 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The fact that the Supreme Court has remanded a case to be reconsidered in light of <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cmandate any particular outcome as to the defendant\u2019s sentence, nor [does it] preclude this Court from applying its prudential rules in a uniform and consistent manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280 (citations omitted). Accordingly, having applied our prudential rule, we affirm Garner\u2019s sentence and reinstate our panel\u2019s prior decision in <em>United States v. Garner, </em>126 Fed.Appx. 463 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">AFFIRMED AND PRIOR OPINION REINSTATED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-25\">.
