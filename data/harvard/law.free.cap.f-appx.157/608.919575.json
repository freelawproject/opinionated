(collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d), natives and citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s orders affirming, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s denial of their requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Huang is the primary applicant for asylum; the claims of her son are derivative of her application. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158(b)(3) (West Supp.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(a) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">In their petitions for review, the Petitioners challenge the immigration judge\u2019s determination that they failed to establish eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that the Petitioners fail to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that the Petitioners seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the Petitioners\u2019 request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because the Petitioners fail to show that they are eligible for asylum, they cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s finding that the Petitioners fail to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). We find that the Petitioners failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">Finally, Huang claims that the immigration judge deprived her of the right to have her husband testify, thereby violating her right to due process. Our review of the record reveals that Huang declined the immigration judge\u2019s offer to continue the case in order to present her husband\u2019s testimony. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that Huang was denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
