On February 25, 2005, the court sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 180 months on Count One and 120 months on Count Two. The court sentenced appellant to 180 months on Count One because he had three prior convictions and under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), the court had to impose a prison sentence of at least 180 months (rather than of the maximum sentence of 120 months established by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)). He now appeals his Count One sentence, contending that the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2363, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), barred the district court \u2014 absent a jury determination beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed the prior convictions \u2014 from sentencing him to the 180 months\u2019 term.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">Appellant submits that the <em>Apprendi </em>Court relied upon <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), to carve out an exception for prior convictions, and that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was wrongly decided. Moreover, since <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), declared it unconstitutional for a court to impose a sentence above the maximum guideline sentence, and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), held that it was unconstitutional for a defendant\u2019s sentence to be enhanced based upon facts found by the judge, under a preponderance of evidence standard, and not by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the court erred in enhancing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Reduced to its essentials, what appellant is asking us to hold is that the Supreme Court has overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>This we cannot do. In <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257-58 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004), we refused to do what appellant asks us to do \u2014 to disregard <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and extend <em>Apprendi\u2019 </em>s rationale to the situation at hand. We said that Marseille\u2019s \u201cwish was beyond our power to grant.\u201d So is appellant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
