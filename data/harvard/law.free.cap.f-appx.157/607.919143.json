We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order. We agree with the district court that the doctrine of res judicata resolves this case. Accordingly, we affirm for that reason, as more fully espoused in the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>See Bennett v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., </em>No. CA-04-374-5-FL (E.D.N.C. Jan. 20, 2005 &amp; Mar. 28, 2005). We also deny Bennett\u2019s objection to the request to take judicial notice of the state court opinion affirming the trial court\u2019s order dismissing her cross-claims.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-10\"> We deny Bennett\u2019s requests for judicial notice of a state court order, two state court motions filed by the Appellee and a portion of the December 1, 2003 transcript. Those items were part of or referred to in the district court record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
