At sentencing, Castanon-Hernandez faced an enhanced statutory maximum, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), based on his prior conviction for an aggravated felony (possession of cocaine). For the first time on appeal, Castanon-Hernandez argues that the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because his prior conviction was not alleged in the indictment, admitted by him, or established beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-18\">Because Castanon-Hernandez raised no objection in the district court regarding the enhancement of his sentence, we review the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for only plain error. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005). Under the plain error test, before we can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Heath, </em>419 F.3d 1312, 1314 (11th Cir.2005). If the first three conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">The Supreme Court has held that the government need not allege in the indictment nor prove beyond a reasonable doubt the fact that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a district court to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>hance a defendant\u2019s sentence based on those convictions. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In <em>Booker, </em>the Court reiterated its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres. See </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the m\u00e1ximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We have observed that the <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>decision \u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi. Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329. Castanon-Hernandez recognizes that we have consistently rejected the argument that district courts err by basing a sentence enhancement on a prior conviction that is neither proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury nor admitted by the defendant. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005); <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005). We reject his invitation to revisit the issue. Pursuant to <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and our uniform line of cases applying it, the district court did not err in sentencing Castanon-Hernandez based on his prior conviction for an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-14\">. <em>See United States v.
