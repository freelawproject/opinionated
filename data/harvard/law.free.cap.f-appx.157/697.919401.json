Green seeks to have the BOP ordered to credit him the total amount of good-time credits (648 days) to which he believes he is entitled, based on his 12-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-23\">In <em>Sample v. Morrison, </em>406 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2005), for the claim Green advances, the appeal was dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the petition was not ripe for review. The court concluded the \u201ctemporally distant and speculative nature\u201d of the claims rendered the \u00a7 2241 petition premature. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-24\">Green is seeking the same relief found premature in <em>Sample. </em>Therefore, this instant appeal is DISMISSED for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-25\">\n<em>APPEAL DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
