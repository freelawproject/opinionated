Duran-Gomez, </em>115 Fed.Appx. 743 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-21\">Duran argued in his initial brief and in his petition for a writ of certiorari that his sentence should be vacated because he was sentenced under the erroneous assumption that the Guidelines were mandatory. Our review of this issue is for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). Although Duran has satisfied the first two criteria for establishing plain error, he is required to demonstrate that \u201cthe sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. </em>denied \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005); <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733. Duran has not met his burden because there is \u201cno evidence in the record suggesting that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines system.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 677 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-25\">In his initial brief, Duran challenged the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) and the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Duran conceded that his argument was foreclosed by existing precedent, but he sought to preserve the issue for further review. Nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision affected the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres. See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number><em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (the <em>Booker </em>holding applies to any fact (other than a prior conviction)). The decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), left <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>intact. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (\u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d need not be submitted to a jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case, we therefore reinstate our judgment affirming Duran\u2019s conviction. For the reasons set forth in this opinion on remand, his sentence is also AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
