Reliford raises two issues on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>appeal: (1) whether the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) improperly applied the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 (\u201cthe grids\u201d), and (2) whether the ALJ properly considered the combined effect of Reliford\u2019s impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 &amp; 1529 n. 11 (11th Cir.1990). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>894 F.2d at 1529. \u201c[I]t is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">First, Reliford argues that the ALJ erred in relying exclusively on the grids in determining whether jobs exist in the national economy that Reliford could perform. \u201c[T]he ALJ may use the grids [instead of testimony from a vocational expert] to determine whether other jobs exist in the national economy that a claimant is able to perform.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1242 (11th Cir. 2004). The ALJ may not rely exclusively on the grids when either: (1) the claimant, due to exertional limitations, \u201cis unable to perform the full range of work at a given residual functional level\u201d; or (2) when \u201ca claimant has non-exertional impairments that significantly limit basic work skills.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We have held that \u201csignificantly limit basic work skills\u201d means that the limitations \u201cprohibit a claimant from performing \u2018a <em>wide </em>range\u2019 of work at a given work level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1243. Reliford has chosen to focus her appeal on nonexertional limitations that she claims were not considered by the ALJ. According to Reliford, these limitations were documented by Dr. Payne, one of the physicians who examined her.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Reliford argues that the ALJ did not properly consider Payne\u2019s findings that Reliford is \u201cin the borderline range of intellectual functioning,\u201d with a \u201cguarded to fair\u201d prognosis for her mental capacity; that she is \u201cseriously limited in her ability to use judgment, deal with the public, deal with work stresses, and maintain attention and concentration;\u201d and that she has no ability to maintain her personal appearance. Reliford argues that these limitations make the ALJ\u2019s use of the grids inappropriate since these limitations show she cannot perform a wide range of light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Reliford\u2019s capacity for light work was not compromised by any nonexertional mental impairments. Both Disability Determination Services (\u201cDDS\u201d) physicians that conducted psychiatric review technique forms did not identify any limitations under the listings. Even Payne considered her problem \u201cto be mostly physical,\u201d and rated many of her abilities in the good category, including her abilities to follow work rules and interact with supervisors, relate to co-workers, deal with the public, and function independently. Payne and the two DDS physicians also found that Reliford could handle stressful work conditions without a mental or emotional breakdown. The assessment of Reliford\u2019s mental Residual Functional Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) showed that while she faces limitations to her work in more detail-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>oriented, complicated settings, she would have no problem working at simpler tasks. Further, the examining physician found no evidence of any limitations regarding Reliford\u2019s abilities to work within a schedule, keep a routine without special supervision, work with others without being distracted, and make simple work-related decisions. Nor were there limitations regarding social interaction or adaptation, except that Reliford\u2019s ability to respond appropriately to changes in the work setting was moderately limited. Because there is substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding that the nonexertional impairments did not compromise Reliford\u2019s capacity to perform light work, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s application of the grids.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Second, Reliford argues that the ALJ did not consider the combined effects of all her impairments. Specifically, Reliford argues that the ALJ did not properly address the combined impact of her obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high blood pressure, severe mental impairments as found by Payne, and her inability to afford proper medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u201cIn determining whether [a claimant is] disabled, [the ALJ] considers] all ... symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which ... symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence, and other evidence.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u201cWhen a claimant has alleged [multiple impairments], a claim for [SSI] may lie even though none of the impairments, considered individually, is disabling.\u201d <em>Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996, 1001 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (internal quotation omitted). The ALJ must \u201cmake specific and well-articulated findings as to the effect of the combination of impairments and to decide whether the combined impairments cause the claimant to be disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have repeatedly held that an ALJ\u2019s finding regarding a claimant\u2019s \u201cimpairment or combination of impairments\u201d established that the ALJ had indeed considered the impact of the claimant\u2019s combined impairments. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1224-1225 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">In addition to considering each of Rediford\u2019s impairments individually, the ALJ also considered the effect of the combination of Reliford\u2019s impairments. Specifically, the ALJ found that Reliford has an \u201cimpairment or a combination of impairments\u201d considered severe, but that her medically determinable impairments did not meet or equal one of the impairments listed in the regulations. Thus, the ALJ sufficiently considered the impact of Reliford\u2019s impairments in combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Upon careful review of the administrative proceedings, the medical record, the proceedings in the district court, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\">. \"Exertional limitations\u201d are limitations on a person\u2019s ability to meet the seven strength demands: \"sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling\u201d at the level required by the level of work at issue. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1242 n. 11. \"Nonexertional limitations\u201d affect a person\u2019s \"ability to meet the other demands of jobs and include mental limitations, pain limitations, and all physical limitations that are not included in the seven strength demands.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
