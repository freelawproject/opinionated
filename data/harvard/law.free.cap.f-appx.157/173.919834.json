For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petitioners\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">On March 9, 2001, Galeano, a native and citizen of Colombia, entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor for pleasure, with authorization to remain in the United States for a period not to exceed June 9, 2001. On September 26, 2001, Galeano, who had remained in the United States, filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA, along with an attached narrative addendum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Galeano asserted in her application that, if she returned to Colombia, she would be persecuted by paramilitaries on account of her membership in a particular social group and her political opinion as a member of the Liberal Party. As part of her application, Galeano cited to several instances that she alleged constituted past persecution, including that, in the beginning of 2001, her father had received at work threatening phone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">In October 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> served Galeano and her husband with notices to appear (\u201cNTAs\u201d), charging them with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>movability, pursuant to INA \u00a7 287(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15), for remaining in the United States for a period longer than permitted. Galeano appeared before an IJ and, through counsel, admitted the facts contained in her NTA and conceded removability. After Galeano declined to designate a country of removal, the IJ designated Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">In October 2003, at a hearing on Galeano\u2019s application for relief from removal, Galeano, who was 24 years\u2019 old at the time of the hearing and the sole witness, offered the following testimony. Galeano had a four-year-old daughter who was living in Cali, Colombia with her husband\u2019s mother. Galeano also had a brother and sister who resided in Tulua, Colombia, a brother who lived in Medellin, Colombia, and a sister who resided in Canada.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When Galeano lived in Colombia, she resided with her parents in Tulua, which was approximately an hour-and-a-half drive from Cali. Galeano\u2019s family owned a veterinarian\u2019s product store and a home in Tulua, as well as a farm in Monteloro, Colombia, Galeano routinely traveled, from Tulua to Cali, where she would visit her husband and attend classes at the Santiago de Cali University, at which she enrolled in 1996 to study economics.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">In March 1999, Galeano became an active member of the Liberal Party in Colombia. As a Community Projects Coordinator, Galeano taught the Liberal Party\u2019s \u201cphilosophy\u201d in Monteloro, Bentioleros, and La Punta la Coka \u2014 towns in Colombia that also were approximately an hour-and-a-half drive from her family\u2019s home in Tulua.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In June 1999, either members of a guerilla party or the paramilitary approached her Liberal Party group, threatened them, and instructed them to leave the area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although this event scared Galeano, and she filed a police report, she continued with her activities and nothing resulted from her report. Moreover, in August 1999, while Galeano and her family were enjoying a day at their farm in Monteloro, some of the farm workers informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>her family that \u201ca terrorist group\u201d was nearby, and her family left the area. Galeano subsequently learned that, after her family left the farm, members of the paramilitary had arrived and had interrogated the farm workers about Galeano\u2019s \u201cwork in the zone\u201d and her \u201cpolitical affiliation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Starting in early 2000, persons who identified themselves as paramilitaries called Galeano at her family\u2019s home in Tulua on three occasions, during which calls they threatened her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the first phone call, which Galeano received either in January or February 2000, the caller told Galeano to \u201cstop giving ideas to those people,\u201d along with informing her that her life, otherwise, \u201cwould be short.\u201d In April 2000, before Galeano received the second threatening phone call, a man in a vehicle pulled up beside her as she was walking home from a party meeting in Tulua, identified himself as a paramilitary member, told Galeano that her \u201cdays were counted\u201d and her life \u201cwas going to be very short,\u201d and called her a \u201cbastard.\u201d Although this encounter frightened Galeano, she neither reported it to the police nor her family. Approximately six months after the first threatening call,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Galeano received a second call from a person purporting to be an alleged member of the paramilitary who accused her of \u201chiding those boxes from the guerillas\u201d and warned her not to have contact with the guerillas.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Galeano also disclosed for the first time during this hearing that, on June 17, 2000, she entered the United States to clear her mind and \u201ctake out the stress [she] had.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> During this visit, which lasted for five months, Galeano left her daughter with her parents in Colombia, and she stayed with her then future husband. Galeano did not seek asylum during this visit because she (1) was concerned about her daughter\u2019s safety; and (2) did not feel as much pressure at that time as she subsequently felt in September 2001, when she filed her asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">Between November 2000, when Galeano returned to Colombia, and March 2001, when she reentered the United States, she received threats that were more \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cacute\u201d than she previously had received. Galeano specifically stated that, in January 2001, she received at her home a third threatening phone call from a member of the paramilitary, during which the caller informed her that she had been placed on a death list.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In describing this time period, Galeano initially testified that \u201cI \u2014 we got another call \u2014 there was another call, which \u2014 with the same type of message.\u201d However, after the IJ asked Galeano exactly how many threatening phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>calls she received, Galeano responded as follows: \u201c[w]ell, exactly that was one call, but was \u2014 that was so horrible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Galeano testified that she stopped her studies in March 2001, when she left Colombia and entered the United States.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She also stated that she was afraid to return to Colombia because she believed that she would be killed. On questioning from the IJ, Galeano stated that she had not tried to move to another place other than Tulua or Cali, and that she did not believe that she could safely relocate to another location in Colombia because \u201ceverywhere in Colombia [she would] be in danger, because the paramilitaries move around continuously and they ha[d] others, others [sic] groups and operated] in other zones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In addition to this testimony, the record contained the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2001 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Colombia (\u201c2001 Country Report\u201d). This document included that Colombia, which is a constitutional, multiparty democracy, generally has a poor human rights record. Internal security is maintained by both the armed forces and the national police. As a result of armed conflict between the government, paramilitary groups, leftist guerillas, and narcotic traffickers, between 3,000 and 3,500 civilians were killed during 2001, including combat casualties, political murders, and forced disappearances. The paramilitary umbrella organization, which has an estimated membership of between 8,000 and 11,000 combatants, \u201cexercised increasing influence during the year and fought to extend its presence through violence and intimidation into areas previously under guerilla control while conducting selective killings of civilians whom it alleged collaborated with guerillas.\u201d The 2001 Country Report also included that, although the paramilitaries had increasing popular support in 2001 due, in part, to the guerillas\u2019 continued human rights violations, the paramilitaries relied less on massacres, and the government and law enforcement officials increased their efforts to combat paramilitary groups and to prosecute persons who financed the paramilitaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Furthermore, Galeano submitted a report prepared by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2002, which was titled \u201cInternal Protection Considerations Regarding Colombian Asylum-Seekers and Refugees\u201d (\u201cUNHCR Report\u201d). The UNHCR Report included that \u201c[t]he Colombian political scene has long been dominated by two rival political parties, the Conservative Party ... and the Liberal Party ... and is characterized by organized violence and a weak [s]tate.\u201d Paramilitary organizations, which emerged in Colombia in the 1980s, initially to provide protection to large landowners and drug lords, combined in 1997, and, since, have used \u201cextreme brutality\u201d toward civilian populations, including killing, torturing, kidnaping, extortion, and threatening civilians suspected of sympathizing with guerillas. The paramilitaries, who were responsible for generating about half of all internal displacement in Colombia in 2002, typically enter a community with a list of suspected guerilla collaborators and conduct summary executions. Although the number of massacres had decreased from 2001, the number of selective assassinations and disappearances in areas under the paramilitaries\u2019 control had increased. The UNHCR Report also included that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>persons at special risk of being persecuted in Colombia by both the paramilitaries and the guerillas include, among other groups, persons with a high public/community profile, including women leaders who work to improve living conditions for their communities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the IJ issued an oral decision, denying the petitioners\u2019 application for asylum and withholding of removal, and ordering them removed to Colombia. After summarizing Galeano\u2019s allegations of past persecution, the IJ determined that \u201c[t]here [were] many inconsistencies between [Galeano\u2019s] testimony and her written asylum application and also internally in [her] testimony [during the hearing].\u201d In explaining these inconsistencies, the IJ first noted that Galeano had failed to include in either her application for relief, or in her detailed narrative addendum to this application, that she had visited the United States in 2000,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> before she entered for the second time in March 2001, even though this application specifically instructed her to list all previous trips. Second, the IJ explained that Galeano\u2019s testimony, that she had stopped being a student in Cali, Colombia in March 2001, was inconsistent with her statement in her application that she stopped attending classes in 1999. Third, the IJ discussed that Galeano (i) had failed to include in her application the threatening phone call that she testified she received in January 2001; (ii) initially had indicated during her testimony that she had received other threatening calls after that date; and (iii) had stated in her application, instead, that her father had received threatening phone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">In addition to identifying these inconsistencies, the IJ discussed that Galeano had failed to produce supporting documentary evidence, including police reports that she claimed she filed in relation to several allegations of past persecution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The IJ explained that, \u201c[g]iven the previously mentioned inconsistencies, corroborating evidence about the incidents becomes more important.\u201d The IJ concluded that he could not find that Galeano \u201cha[d] provided consistent and credible evidence to the [IJ] on which she can support her application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Alternatively, the IJ determined that, even if the IJ were to consider Galeano\u2019s testimony as credible, Galeano had failed to establish that she was eligible for asylum or withholding of removal by showing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a protected factor. In making this determination, the IJ specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">All of the main problems that she allegedly suffered were before her trip in June 2000 to this country. She came here, stayed for five months with her present husband, and did not request asylum. Despite the supposed terror of the incidents, she returned to Colombia in November of 2001[,]<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and is then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>frightened by one phone call, if that phone call actually took place. Her father, who was also threatened and was a member of the Liberal Party, remains in her home in Tulua, Colombia, and there is no evidence that anything further has happened to him or that there have been any further threats____ [At] most, she received several phone calls and one physical warming. She was never mistreated or harmed and there has been no showing why she cannot return to Colombia and live there without being harmed for any of the five ... enumerated grounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Galeano appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, arguing in her brief that the IJ erred in denying her asylum and withholding of removal because the evidence established that she was persecuted in the past in Colombia by paramilitaries because of her political opinion, and that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her past persecution. As part of this appeal, Galeano moved the court to remand the case to the IJ to consider new evidence that she had attached to the brief, that is, evidence showing that, six days after the evidentiary hearing, Galeano\u2019s brother was shot while he was walking on a street in Medellin, Colombia. Galeano also attached in support a document her father had filed with the authorities after this killing, in which he reported this incident, summarized other threats the family had received, and requested protection. The BIA affirmed without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), without discussing the new evidence. Galeano then filed this timely petition for review.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Issue 1: <em>Adverse Credibility Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Galeano generally argues that, if we conclude that the IJ\u2019s comments in his oral decision constituted an adverse credibility determination, the IJ erroneously reached this determination based on (1) minor and irrelevant discrepancies in the record, (2) the IJ\u2019s unreasonable expectation that Galeano provide supporting police reports, and (3) the IJ\u2019s failure to consider all of the evidence in the record. Galeano specifically contends that her omission from her application of her June 2000, trip to the United States did not support the adverse credibility determination because (1) this omission was minor, (2) Galeano corrected it when she testified about it during the evidentiary hearing, and (3) she explained that she did not initially include it because she did not realize that such inclusion was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Galeano similarly asserts that, any discrepancy between her application and her testimony as to when she stopped being a student was minor, collateral to her claims for relief, and explained by the fact that she first left her studies in 1999, when she gave birth to her child. In addition, Galeano argues that her failure to include in her asylum application her testimony that she, instead of her father, received a threatening phone call in January 2001, and inconsistencies during her testimony on how many calls she received during this time period, in addition to being minor, either were ambiguous omissions, or involved matters for which the IJ should have developed a better record. Finally, Galeano contends that the IJ (1) erroneously relied on the fact that she did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>introduce police reports that she claimed she filed as a result of harassing incidents, (2) did not allow her sufficient time to obtain these police reports, and (3) did not consider other supporting evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">When a single member of the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, such as here, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final removal order subject to review. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). On the other hand, the IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation and internal marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201cWe cannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278. Moreover, \u201c[u]nder the substantial evidence test, we review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). Thus, a finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">A credibility determination also is reviewed under the substantial evidence test; thus, we \u201cmay not substitute its judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 418 </em>F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d Id. Indications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments. See <em>In re B-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 66, 70 (BIA 1995); <em>see also Dailide v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>387 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir. 2004) (affirming the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based upon its finding that the alien\u2019s testimony conflicted with his answers to interrogatories and other documentary evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). However, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If an applicant produces evidence beyond his own testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201cthe IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons[,]\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent Galeano\u2019s brief can be construed as raising the claim that the IJ did not make an adverse credibility determination, we recently have clarified that, when an IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u201csays not that [the IJ] believes the asylum seeker or [that] [the IJ] disbelieves her ... the reviewing Court is left in the dark,\u201d and that an IJ must make a \u201cclean determination[ ] of credibility.\u201d <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201 (internal quotations omitted). However, in addition to finding that \u201c[t]here [were] many inconsistencies between [Galeano\u2019s] testimony and her written asylum application and also internally in [her] testimony [during the hearing],\u201d the IJ in the instant case explicitly stated that Galeano \u201cha[d] not provided credible and consistent evidence to the [c]ourt in support of her application.\u201d Thus, we conclude that, despite the IJ\u2019s offering an alternative explanation for concluding that Galeano was not eligible for relief from removal, the IJ made an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Moreover, the IJ offered \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for his adverse credibility finding that are supported by the record. Although Galeano disclosed during her testimony that she traveled to the United States in June 2000, and that she remained in the United States for five months before returning to Colombia, she failed to either include this fact in her application or her attached narrative when the application specifically instructed her to include all such information, or to explain during her testimony why she previously omitted this fact. Contrary to Galeano\u2019s argument that this omission was immaterial, it involved five months during the time period that she alleged the paramilitaries were persecuting her. Moreover, as discussed below, Galeano\u2019s failure to apply for asylum and her voluntary return to Colombia in November 2000, was relevant to the issue whether she subjectively had a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b) (requiring petitioner seeking asylum to establish either past persecution or a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution based on a protected factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Similarly, to the extent the IJ focused on the inconsistency relating to when Galeano stopped being a student, the record reflects that Galeano stated in her application that she stopped her studies in 1999, while she testified during the hearing that she stopped being a student in March 2001, when she left Colombia and entered the United States. Although this discrepancy arguably was not sufficiently significant on its own to support an adverse credibility determination, and it was, at least partially, explained by the fact that Galeano temporarily left her studies in 1999 to give birth. Galeano\u2019s status as a full-time student in Cali, Colombia, was material to the extent that she also offered evidence that, during this time period, she was an \u201cactive member\u201d of the Liberal Party, and that she was a community leader in Tulua, Colombia \u2014 a town that was approximately an hour-and-a-half drive from Cali, Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Finally, although Galeano testified that she primarily decided to leave Colombia due to a threatening phone call she received in January 2001, during which the caller informed her that she had been placed on a death list, Galeano offered inconsistent, or at least confusing, testimony on how many threatening phone calls she received after she returned to Colombia in November 2000. Galeano also only included in her application that her father received threatening phone calls during this time period. Thus, Galeano has failed to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision \u201cwas not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons[,]\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">To the extent Galeano also is arguing that the IJ erred in requiring her to produce police reports that she claimed she filed after some of the alleged inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>dents, as discussed above, if credible, the alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration. <em>See id. </em>However, the IJ only noted that Galeano had failed to provide corroborating police reports after the IJ explained why Galeano\u2019s testimony on the incidents at issue in these reports was not credible. In addition, despite Galeano\u2019s argument that the court should have granted her a continuance to produce this evidence, Galeano failed to request such a continuance, and Galeano has failed to explain why she could not have obtained this evidence prior to the evidentiary hearing, which was conducted in October 2003, more than two years after she arrived in the United States in March 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Moreover, although, as discussed above, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant,\u201d <em>see id., </em>the IJ\u2019s decision does not reflect that it relied solely on its adverse credibility determination. Indeed, the IJ explicitly stated in his decision that the record contained the 2001 Country Report for Colombia, along with explaining that this document advised the IJ on the conditions in Colombia as of the date of its issuance. Although the IJ did not discuss either the UNHCR Report or the local newspaper clippings Galeano submitted, these additional documents contained the same relevant information on the paramilitaries\u2019 activities in Colombia as outlined in the 2001 Country Report, and Galeano has not cited to evidence in these documents that compelled the IJ to reach a different finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In addition, to the extent Galeano submitted into evidence copies of (1) her identification card with the Liberal Party; and (2) a letter by the Liberal Party\u2019s President, which included that Galeano was an asset to the party, and that her departure was related to \u201csecurity reasons due to the risk she ha[d] found herself lately,\u201d along with a certification from a Tulua municipal agent, which confirmed her role as a leader in the community and included that her father had stated that she had left the country because she had received a death threat, the fact that evidence in the record also may support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>See Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027. Thus, the IJ\u2019s reasons for his adverse credibility determination are supported by substantial evidence, and nothing in the record compels us to substitute our judgment for that of the IJ regarding credibility. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Issue 2: <em>Statutory eligibility, for asylum or withholding of removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Galeano also argues that the IJ erred in alternatively concluding that she failed to establish statutory eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. Galeano generally asserts that the IJ\u2019s decision reflects that the IJ made incomplete findings of fact and failed to take into consideration all of the evidence in the record. Galeano contends that she showed past persecution based on her political affiliation by offering evidence that (1) she received death threats, (2) her father received calls regarding her safety, (3) she received a warning after her vehicle was intercepted, and (4) paramilitaries trespassed on her family\u2019s farm and inquired about her political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Galeano alternatively argues that she showed a well-founded subjective and objective fear of future persecution by offering credible testimony that she feared for her life, and by submitting evidence confirming the activities of the paramilitaries in the 2001 Country Report and the UNHCR Report. Galeano contends that the continued presence of her family mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>bers in Colombia did not contradict her claim that she has a well-founded fear of returning to Colombia because (1) the government failed to show that these family members were similarly situated, (2) the IJ failed to develop the record as to the threats her father received regarding her safety, and (3) new evidence she submitted to the BIA reflected that her family continued to be threatened. Moreover, Galeano argues for the first time in reply that, to the extent we may not engage in fact finding relating to new evidence that she submitted on appeal to the BIA, we should remand the case to allow the IJ to consider in the first instance all of the relevant evidence and to avoid a manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent Galeano\u2019s reply brief can be construed as arguing that the BIA erred in not remanding the case to the IJ to consider evidence showing that her brother had been killed in Colombia following the IJ\u2019s issuance of its decision, Galeano included in her statement of the facts that she submitted this evidence to the BIA, and she discussed in her argument section that the IJ\u2019s decision that she did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution was undercut by her brother\u2019s subsequent killing. Galeano, however, did not argue in her initial brief that the BIA erred either in not remanding the case to the IJ to consider this new evidence, or in not discussing this evidence in its order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision. Galeano, therefore, has abandoned this argument by failing to raise it in her initial brief. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, as discussed above, because the record does not reflect that either the IJ or the BIA considered this new evidence, we may not consider it in the first instance. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1278 (holding that we \u201ccannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below\u201d); <em>see also Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286 (explaining that we \u201ccannot find, or consider, facts not raised in the administrative forum\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Also as discussed above, the IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84.

If the petitioner demonstrates past persecution, there is a rebut-table presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If he cannot show past persecution, then the petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be proved \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">An alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). An alien seeking withholding of removal, however, must demonstrate that he \u201cmore-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tor-toed upon his return to the country in question,\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. An alien also cannot demonstrate that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted on a protected ground if the IJ finds that the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of his country. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we have determined that this burden of proof, although similar to the burden for asylum relief, is \u201cmore stringent.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">The statutes governing asylum and withholding of removal protect not only against persecution by government forces, but also against persecution by non-governmental groups that the government cannot control. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004). However, the applicant must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [s]he will be singled out for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Furthermore, although the INA does not define persecution, we have explained that \u201cmere harassment does not amount to persecution,\u201d and that persecution it as \u201can extreme concept requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotations and marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">Here, even accepting as trae Galeano\u2019s testimony, she did not establish that she suffered past persecution based on either her political opinion, or her membership in the Liberal Party. Galeano testified that (1) in June 1999, either guerillas or paramilitaries approached her Liberal Party group and threatened them; (2) in August 1999, paramilitaries trespassed on her family farm and asked about her \u201cpolitical affiliation\u201d; (3) in 2000 and 2001, persons who identified themselves as paramilitaries called her at her family home on three different occasions and threatened her; and (4) in April 2000, a man in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>vehicle pulled up to her while she was walking down the road, identified himself as a paramilitary, and threatened her. However, even assuming a nexus existed between Galeano\u2019s political opinion and the alleged incidents, none of these incidents rose to the level of persecution necessary to satisfy the showing for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (holding that \u201cmenacing telephone calls and threats\u201d did not rise to the level of past persecution for asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Galeano also failed to demonstrate, in the alternative, a future threat to her life or freedom on a protected ground in Colombia, or that she could not avoid a threat by relocating to a different part of Colombia. As discussed above, the IJ finding as not credible Galeano\u2019s testimony that she received a death threat in January 2001, was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Despite Galeano\u2019s testimony that she was afraid to return to Colombia because she believed that she would be killed, and that she did not seek asylum during her first trip to the United States because she was concerned about the safety of her minor daughter, who was still living in Colombia, she voluntarily returned to Colombia only several months before leaving it again, and she eventually sought asylum, despite that her daughter still is living in Colombia. In addition, Galeano\u2019s claim that a future threat exists is belied, at least in part, by the fact that the record does not contain evidence showing that other members of her remaining family in Colombia \u2014 including her father, who is also a member of the Liberal Party \u2014 have been persecuted based on a protected factor. <em>Cf. Tawm v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 740, 743 (8th Cir.2004) (concluding as persuasive authority that an alien did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution where, among other things, the alien\u2019s family continued to live in Lebanon without incident).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Finally, to the extent Galeano relies on the 2001 Country Report and the UNHC Report in asserting that she had a well-founded fear of returning to Colombia, both of these documents reflected that the paramilitaries had a wide membership in Colombia and exercised increasing influence in 2001. However, whether or not Galeano could relocate to another area where the presence of paramilitaries was non-existent or minimal, she failed to demonstrate that she would be singled out for persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33 &amp; n. 7 (affirming denial of asylum and withholding of removal, despite that Country Report in the record reflected that the petitioner could not relocate to an area in Colombia where the presence of guerillas would be non-existent or minimal). Thus, the IJ\u2019s determination that the petitioners failed to establish statutory eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary result. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supported both the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the IJ\u2019s alternative determination that the petitioners failed to establish statutory eligibility for either asylum or withholding of removal. We, therefore, deny their petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\">. To the extent the petitioners are appealing the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief, they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by challenging this denial in their appeal to the BIA. We, therefore, lack jurisdiction to review any challenges to the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1322, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \"[a] court may review a final order of removal only if 'the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)); <em>see also Fernandez-Bernal v. Att'y Gen. of U.S., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001) (interpreting this exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-17\">. Galeano also included in her application for relief her husband, Carlos Alberto Gomez, who entered the United States for pleasure on June 11, 1999, with permission to remain in the United States until December 10, 1999.

Galeano testified that, at the time of the hearing, her sister had been granted asylum in Canada. Although Galeano also attempted to introduce during her hearing a document that allegedly corroborated this testimony, the IJ refused to admit this document because it was not translated. Galeano has abandoned our review of this decision by not challenging it in her appeal brief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, \"[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\">.

In Galeano's application for relief, she elaborated that her duties as a Community Project Coordinator included attending weeldy organizational meetings; organizing and executing social projects in the community; advertising and promoting the Liberal Party; providing assistance to persons who had suffered violence; and directing programs for, and educating, women who were heads of their households. Galeano submitted into evidence copies of (1) her identification card with the Liberal Party; and (2) a signed letter by the Liberal Party\u2019s President, which included that Galeano was an asset to the party, and that her departure from Colombia was related to \"security reasons due to the risk she ha[d] found herself lately.\u201d In addition, Galeano submitted a certification from a Tulua municipal agent, which confirmed her role as a leader in the community and included that her father had informed the agent that Galeano had left the country because she had received a death threat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b202-12\">. Although Galeano first identified the persons who approached her group as guerillas, on further questioning by the IJ, Galeano stated that these persons, in fact, were paramilitaries. Galeano further clarified that the zone where her group was located had both guerillas and paramilitaries operating within it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\">. Again in response to further questioning by the IJ, Galeano added that (1) her father also had received two threatening telephone calls in January or February 2000; (2) she believed that the callers had contacted her father because he supported her work; and (3) as a result of these calls, her father feared for his life and decided to distance himself from the Liberal Party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">.

When the IJ asked Galeano why she did not include this June 2000, trip in either her application for relief or her attached narrative, Galeano first replied that \"I don\u2019t know [it was not included], because I have reported this when the application was made.\u201d On further questioning, Galeano stated, ''[w]ell, I did not consider that I had to include it in that case. I think I can amend this with my words.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b203-13\">. Galeano stated during her testimony that this third phone call was the event that ultimately motivated her to leave Colombia. She also stated that she reported this call to the police, but that she did not have a copy of the police report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">. On the other hand, Galeano included in her application for relief that she stopped being a student in Cali, Colombia in 1999. When the IJ asked her to explain this inconsistency, Galeano stated that, in November 1999, she took a break from her studies to give birth to her daughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\">. In addition to the 2001 Country Report and the UNHCR Report, Galeano submitted into evidence three newspaper clippings from the local press, which discussed that thousands of families had arrived in Tulua, Buga, and San Pedro because of confrontations in the mountainous zone between the paramilitaries and the guerillas, and that the presence of the paramilitaries in Tulua had caused a general atmosphere of terror.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\">.
