California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Diaz has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-24\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief, Diaz\u2019s response, and the record discloses one possible nonfrivolous issue. Diaz\u2019s offense level and sentence were increased for his having been removed after a conviction for a prior drug-trafficking offense that was not alleged in the indictment. An argument that the prior conviction should have been alleged in the indictment is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). However, the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been called into question by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Counsel thus could have raised the issue on appeal in order to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Because this is a possible nonfrivolous issue for appeal, we DENY counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. By our denial, Diaz preserves the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>issue for further review. We pretermit further briefing, however, and AFFIRM the judgment of the district court because <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005); <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
