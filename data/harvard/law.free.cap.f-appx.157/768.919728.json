The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the sentence appeal waiver in Cruz-Barraza\u2019s plea agreement bars his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-23\">Our review of the record indicates that, contrary to the plea agreement, the magistrate judge and the district court advised Cruz-Barraza that he retained the right to appeal an illegal sentence. Thus it cannot be said that Cruz-Barraza knowingly and voluntarily waived his appeal rights. Consequently, we hold that the appellate-waiver provision in Cruz-Barraza\u2019s plea agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ment is unenforceable. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Cruz-Barraza argues, for the first time, that his sentence pursuant to a mandatory sentencing guidelines regime was unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The parties agree that plain error review applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The mandatory application of the guidelines is an error that is plain. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). To prevail, however, Cruz-Barraza must show that his substantial rights have been affected. <em>Id. </em>To meet this burden, he must establish that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Nothing in the record indicates that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had the guidelines been advisory. Accordingly, Cruz-Barraza\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Cruz-Barraza next claims, for the first time, that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. Cruz-Barraza\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although CruzBarraza contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarezr-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Cruz-Barraza properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">Cruz-Barraza has moved for leave to supplement the record on appeal and to file a supplemental brief. In his supplemental brief, Cruz-Barraza seeks to argue that the district court plainly erred by applying a 16-level enhancement to his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based on his prior conviction for burglary of a habitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">Cruz-Barraza\u2019s motion and supplemental brief contain new arguments, raise new issues, do not supplement the initial brief as contemplated by the rules, and are not reply briefs. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a), (c), (j); 5th Cir. R. 28.5. Accordingly, they would not properly supplement the record or briefs. Moreover, because issues not raised in an appellant\u2019s initial brief as required by Fed. R.App. P. 28 are deemed waived, he has waived the arguments raised in his motion and supplemental brief. <em>See United States v. Ogle, </em>415 F.3d 382, 383 (5th Cir.2005). Cruz-Barraza\u2019s motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Cruz-Barraza has failed to raise a meritorious issue on appeal. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b795-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth, in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
