Cedillo appeals his conviction on the importation charge, and both defendants appeal their sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">Cedillo argues that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction for importation of cocaine. Because Cedillo did not renew his motion for judgment of acquittal following the close of all evidence, we review only to determine whether there was \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this standard, Cedillo will receive relief only if the record wholly lacks evidence of his guilt or if the evidence of guilt is \u201cso tenuous that a conviction if shocking.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This standard is not met. Rather, there was plentiful evidence that Cedillo knowingly played a part in bringing cocaine into the United States \u2014 he even admitted that he had gone into Mexico to buy cocaine. Consequently, Cedillo\u2019s importation conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">Cedillo and De La Pena both contend that their sentences are contrary to <em>United States v. </em>Booker,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They argue that them Sixth Amendment rights were violated because their sentences were based on drug-quantity facts neither admitted by them nor found by a jury. Both defendants preserved this claim for appeal by objecting to Sentencing Guidelines calculations and arguing that their sentences should not be based on quantities of drugs related to the crack charges for which they were acquitted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-18\">As the Government concedes, the district court erred by basing the defendants\u2019 sentences on drug-quantity facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>neither admitted by the defendants nor found by a jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, the Government has not shown this error to be harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, Cedillo\u2019s and De La Pena\u2019s sentences are VACATED, and the case is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING. Because resentencing is warranted, there is no need to address the defendants\u2019 remaining sentencing claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Cedillo was acquitted of possession with intent to distribute and convicted of the lesser-ineluded offense of simple possession, but the judgment of conviction signed by the district court states that he was convicted of the former. No one suggests that the district court did not sentence Cedillo for the correct crime. We leave to the district court correction of clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The judgments of conviction are AFFIRMED, the sentences are VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
