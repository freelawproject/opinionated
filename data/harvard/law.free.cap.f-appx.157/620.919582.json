Wise appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended construing Wise\u2019s motion for leave to exhaust administrative remedies as a motion to dismiss without prejudice and granting the motion. The magistrate judge also advised Wise that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation would waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Wise failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Wise has waived appellate review by failing to file objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">We deny Wise\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for an injunction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
