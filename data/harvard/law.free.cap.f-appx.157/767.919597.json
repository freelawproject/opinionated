Armendariz\u2019s complaint alleged that his due process and equal protection rights were violated when his request for transfer to a prison facility closer to his family was denied. Armendariz has failed to allege the deprivation of a liberty interest because the Due Process Clause does not provide prisoners with a protected liberty interest in being housed in a particular facility. <em>Yates v. Stalder, </em>217 F.3d 332, 334 (5th Cir.2000). Armendariz has similarly failed to state an equal protection claim because he has not shown, as an alien subject to an INS detainer, that he is similarly situated to prisoners who will remain in the United States following then-release. <em>See Samaad v. City of Dallas, </em>940 F.2d 925, 941 (5th Cir.1991). Armendariz\u2019s allegation that other inmates <em>with </em>INS detainers were allowed to participate in the \u201cnearer to release\u201d program was deemed unexhausted by the district court and therefore subject to dismissal. Armendariz does not address the district court\u2019s determination in this regard, and he has therefore waived its review. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
