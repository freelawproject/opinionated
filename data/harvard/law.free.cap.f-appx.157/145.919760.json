On appeal, Torres-Lugo challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a minor-role reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201c[T]he ultimate determination of role in the offense is also a fundamentally factual determination entitled to due deference and not a legal conclusion subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. The defendant has the burden of establishing his minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a two-point decrease of a defendant\u2019s offense level if the court finds the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the crime. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(b). To determine whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: [1], the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, [2], [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 940. In looking to relevant conduct, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>941. \u201cIn making the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Torres-Lugo argues that he is entitled to a minor-role reduction because his only role in the conspiracy consisted only of introducing one of his co-defendants to a drug supplier. As the district court acknowledged, however, Torres-Lugo and one of his co-defendants, who cooperated with the government prior to TorresLugo\u2019s cooperation, provided conflicting accounts concerning Torres-Lugo\u2019s participation. The earlier cooperating co-defendant immediately upon arrest identified Torres-Lugo as the supplier, while Torres-Lugo waited over four months to reveal the existence of a different person.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Contrary to Torres-Lugo\u2019s assertion, the district court did not consider dispositive the timing of his disclosure of the other drug supplier\u2019s existence in directly evaluating Torres-Lugo\u2019s role in the offense. Rather, the district court considered the timing to be relevant in weighing the credibility of the two competing versions of events. Our review of the sentencing hearing transcript reveals that the district court was troubled and frustrated by the conflicting versions of events. But in the end, the district court concluded, after highlighting Torres-Lugo\u2019s late disclosure of the name of a supplier and the earlier cooperating defendant\u2019s identification of Torres-Lugo as the supplier, that \u201csomething doesn\u2019t fit well\u201d in TorresLugo\u2019s version of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">On this record, we cannot say the district court clearly erred by concluding Torres-Lugo failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his version of events was the true one. Accordingly, the court did not clearly err by denying him a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-13\">. In its brief, the government argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction based on the appeal-waiver provision in Torres-Lugo\u2019s plea agreement. We previously rejected this exact argument twice, when we denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss and when we denied its motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
