We affirmed his sentence and denied rehearing. <em>United States v. Augustin, </em>102 Fed. Appx. 771 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court subsequently granted Augustin\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment, and remanded his case for further proceedings in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">Augustin was sentenced before the decisions in <em>Booker </em>and its predecessor, <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and he did not raise objections to his sentence based on the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements based on judicial fact finding rather than facts he admitted. Therefore, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). Augustin now contends that the district court plainly erred under <em>Booker </em>in applying the guidelines as mandatory and in enhancing his sentence for possession of a firearm during the offense, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2003), because the enhancement violated the Sixth Amendment. With respect to the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the guidelines, the district court gave no indication that it would impose a lower sentence under an advisory guideline system. Therefore, Augustin cannot show actual prejudice, and resentencing is not authorized on this ground alone. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223-24 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">Augustin\u2019s base offense level was 38 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(l) (1.5 kilograms or more of crack). He admitted responsibility for more than 1.5 kilograms of crack. With the two-level weapon enhancement and a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, his final offense level was 37. Augustin was in criminal history category I, which gave him a guideline range of 210-262 months. The district court imposed a sentence of 210 months. Without the enhancement for possession of a fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>arm during the offense, Augustin\u2019s offense level would have been 38 and the guideline range, based on facts he admitted, would have been 235-293 months. For purposes of determining <em>Booker </em>error, we consider the guideline range based on facts Augustin admitted before the reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005). Augustin\u2019s sentence of 210 months imprisonment thus does not exceed the maximum authorized based on the facts he admitted. <em>Id. </em>at 300-01. We conclude that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
