On appeal, Williams argues that because the district court was aware that he did not have the financial ability to pay the partial filing fee, it erred by dismissing his \u00a7 2254 without prejudice. He further argues that the district court violated his due process, equal protection, and First Amendment rights by denying him access to the court \u201cbecause he is poor.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Williams asks us to grant him leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) and remand this case in order for the district court to rule on the merits of his \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-19\">We review a district court\u2019s order dismissing an action for failure to comply with local rules for an abuse of discretion. <em>Kilgo v. Ricks, </em>983 F.2d 189, 192 (11th Cir.1993). Rule 4.07 of the Local Rules of the Middle District of Florida provides that a district court may enter an order \u201cthat [a] party seeking leave to proceed [IFP] shall pay a stated portion of the Clerk\u2019s and/or Marshal\u2019s fees within a prescribed time, failing which the action may be dismissed without prejudice.\u201d M.D. Fla. R. 4.07(a). Local Rule 4.07 specifically references Local Rule 4.14, which provides that, \u201c[i]n proceedings instituted [IFP] under [\u00a7 ] 2254 ..., the Court may order, as a condition to allowing the case to proceed, that the Clerk\u2019s and Marshal\u2019s fees be paid by the petitioner if it appears that he has $25.00 or more to his credit ... in any account maintained for him by custodial authorities.\u201d M.D. Fla. R. 4.14(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-20\">The district court ordered Williams to pay a partial filing fee without first determining, under Local Rule 4.14(b), whether he had $25 in his prison account, a prerequisite to the court\u2019s authority to order him to pay a filing fee. A review of Williams\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>prison account statement demonstrates that he did not have $25 in his prison account at the time when he filed his \u00a7 2254 petition. Because the district court lacked the authority under its local rules to order Williams to pay a partial filing fee, the district court abused its discretion by dismissing Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for failure to pay the partial filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">VACATE AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-17\">. The scope of this appeal is limited to the issue upon which the certificate of appealability (\"COA\u201d) was granted. See <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 1998). We granted the COA on the following issue: \"[w]hether the district court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s habeas petition without prejudice for failure to pay the partial filing fee.\u201d Accordingly, we will not discuss Williams's due process and equal protection claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
