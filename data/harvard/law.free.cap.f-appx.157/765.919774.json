Although Sepulveda-Rodriguez signed a waiver-of-appeal provision as part of his written plea agreement, we pretermit discussion of the validity of that waiver because SepulvedaRodriguez is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-20\">For the first time on appeal, Sepulveda-Rodriguez argues that the district court erred by sentencing him to the mandatory ten-year minimum term of imprisonment set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). He contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered discretionary a sentencing court\u2019s application of the minimum sentence set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). However, <em>Booker </em>is silent as to those issues, and Sepulveda-Rodriguez has cited no other authority for his argument. Sepulveda-Rodriguez has not shown error.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-21\">Also for the first time on appeal, Sepulveda-Rodriguez argues that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>trict court erred when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>Booker. </em>Application of the Guidelines in their mandatory form constitutes error that is plain. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). However, the district court\u2019s error did not affect the outcome of the sentencing proceedings. As Sepulveda-Rodriguez has not shown that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights, he has not established reversible plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 733-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b792-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
