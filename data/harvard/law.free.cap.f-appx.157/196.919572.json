California, 386 </em>U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Anchico filed a response, in which he states that he wishes to raise unspecified issues of arguable merit and that Swartz has provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Anchico also moves this Court for appointment of a new attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. To the extent Anchico seeks to assert ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims in this direct appeal, the Supreme Court has held that a motion brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, rather than a direct appeal, is the preferred method to assert such a claim. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Moreover, we do not find that counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness is apparent from the record before us. <em>Cf. United States v. Freixas, </em>332 F.3d 1314, 1319 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (Although we typically entertain ineffectiveness claims on collateral review, we may do so in the context of a direct appeal <em>\u201cif the record is sufficiently developed, </em>as it plainly is here.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Because independent examination of the record reveals no issues of arguable merit, Anchico\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Anchico\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
