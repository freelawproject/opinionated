Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 23 August 2001, a physician reported a case of suspected child abuse to defendants regarding J.D., a twelve year old girl, by James McDaniel Webb (\"Webb\"). The physician stated to defendants that Webb had contacted his office to inquire about a possible castration because he was having inappropriate sexual thoughts about J.D. The physician gave defendants J.D.'s name and Webb's name, address, and telephone number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 24 August 2001, defendants opened an investigation regarding the 23 August report. On 26 August 2001, a caseworker conducted a home visit and interviewed Webb and J.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the home visit, Webb stated to the caseworker that he was single and in the process of adopting J.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 28 August 2001, a second physician contacted defendants concerning J.D. Plaintiff alleged the second physician told defendants that Webb became upset when the physician conducted a full physical examination of J.D. and Webb stated to the physician that J.D. had a history of reporting sexual abuse. Defendants denied they were given Webb's name in the second report. In January 2002, the investigation was closed as unsubstantiated. From November 2001 to January 2003, Webb repeatedly sexually assaulted J.D. In January 2003, Webb was arrested and charged with numerous counts of sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 25 August 2006, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants alleging negligence, institutional negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff alleged defendants had failed to properly and thoroughly investigate two separate and independent reports of suspected child abuse of J.D. by Webb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 17 October 2006, defendants filed their answer and asserted as their fifth defense: \"[a]ll claims of Plaintiff against all Defendants are barred by sovereign immunity as there has been no waiver of immunity by the purchase of insurance.\" Defendants also filed and served a motion asserting entitlement to summary judgment on the basis of sovereign immunity. Additionally, defendants filed and served a motion for protective order and objection to discovery until final disposition of their motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, plaintiff filed a motion to compel discovery responses and gave notice of deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 23 March 2007, the trial court entered an order: (1) granting defendants' motion for summary judgment; (2) granting defendants' motion for protective order; and (3) denying plaintiff's motion to compel. Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff argues the trial court erred by: (1) granting defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ground of sovereign immunity and (2) denying plaintiff's motion to compel discovery and to continue the summary judgment hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    III. Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's appeal for failure to comply with the provisions of Rules 28 and 41 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure. Plaintiff subsequently obtained leave to file and filed an amended brief which corrected the prior rule violations. In our discretion, we decline to dismiss plaintiff's appeal and review the merits of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Summary Judgment and Motion to Compel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff argues the trial court erred by granting defendants' motion for summary judgment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    A. Standards of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    1. Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The party moving for summary judgment ultimately has the burden of establishing the lack of any triable issue of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A defendant may show entitlement to summary judgment by (1) proving that an essential element of the plaintiff's case is non-existent, or (2) showing through discovery that the plaintiff cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of his or her claim, or (3) showing that the plaintiff cannot surmount an affirmative defense. Summary judgment is not appropriate where matters of credibility and determining the weight of the evidence exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We review an order allowing summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   If the granting of summary\n   judgment can be sustained on any grounds, it should be affirmed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Wilkins v.
