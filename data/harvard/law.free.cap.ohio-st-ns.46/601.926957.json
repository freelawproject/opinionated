J. McFlroy, representing himself to be the agent of the \u201cCrawford, Henry &amp; Williams County Bohemian Oats Association,\u201d executed and delivered to said defendant a written agreement, said T. J. McElroy representing to said defendant that he, the said McFlroy, had full authority to bind said company as its agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-14\">It is expressly stated in said written agreement, executed and delivered by said McElroy to said defendant, that the note given by said defendant to said T. J. McElroy should not be due and payable, and the amount therein named be called for, until said Bohemian Oats Association should sell for said J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>W. Jacobs eighty bushels of Bohemian oats at ten dollars per \u2022bushel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-5\">This said agreement was taken by said J. W. Jacobs as a part consideratien for the amount named in said note, which \u25a0said Jacobs agreed to pay upon fulfillment of said written .agreement. The only other consideration ever received by \u25a0said Jacobs for said note was 40 bushels of oats, which were -not worth more than 40 cents per bushel when received. The -terms of said written agreement have never been complied with, either by said T. J. McElroy, or the said Oats Association.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-6\">The plaintiffs, before their alleged purchase of said note, knew that said written agreement existed, and had full notice \u2022of the force and intention thereof, and defendant denies that \u2022plaintiffs purchased said note before maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-7\"><em>Second defense. </em>\u2014 Said defendant says that the said note upon which this action was brought, was obtained from said defend\u2022ant by one T. J. McElroy (payee) by fraud, and was disposed of by said McElroy fraudulently, and that said fraud consisted of this, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-8\">The said T. J. McElroy, on or about the 9th day of December, 1884, represented to said defendant that he was the agent of the \u201c Crawford, Henry &amp; Williams County Bohemian Oats Association,\u201d and for the purpose of defrauding said \u2022defendant, and to obtain his signature to a promissory note, agreed to deliver to said defendant 40 bushels of so-called Bohemian oats, representing falsely that said oats were of an extraordinary quality and value, when in fact the said oats' were of no more value than oats ordinarily raised by farmers; and for the further purpose of defrauding said defendant, said T. J. McElroy represented and agreed on the part of said \u2022company, that if said defendant would take said 40 bushels of \u2022oats, and deliver to said McElroy his promissory note for the sum of $400, that he, the said McElroy, would hold said note and not dispose of it until after the said Bohemian Oats Company should sell for said Jacobs 80 bushels of oats out of the' next year\u2019s crop at $10 per bushel, and that said note would then, and not until then, have to be paid by said Jacobs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Said agreement by said McElroy on tbe part of said, company was in tbe form of a partly written and partly printed' bond, and was delivered by said McElroy to said defendant concurrent with the delivery of said note, who relying on the said false and fraudulent statements of said McElroy, and believing that they were true (when in fact said false representations were made with intent to defraud said defendant by said McElroy), did sign said note, and deliver the same to said McElroy, who, contrary to his said agreement and for the purpose of defrauding said defendant, disposed o\u00ed said-note so that defendant might not be able to make any defense thereto. Said agreement by said McElroy to sell, or cause-to be sold by said company, said eighty bushels of oats has not been performed, although the time has long since expired when said oats were to be sold, and said Jacobs retained 80 bushels of said oats, and still retains said oats, for the purpose of performing said contract on his part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-5\">The plaintiffs, defendant avers, took said note with knowledge of said contract between said McElroy and said defendant ; and defendant further avers that plaintiff is not a <em>bona fide </em>holder of said note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-6\">Wherefore defendant asks that he may go hence with his costs.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b636-7\">The demurrer was sustained and judgment rendered for the plaintiff; and, on proceedings in error, the judgment was affirmed by the circuit court.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-8\"><em>James 0. </em>Older, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b636-9\">This case stands as if between the maker and payee of the note, by the averments of the answer.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"An_\">We think the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the answer of the defendant. The first defense is based upon the non-performance of a contemporaneous written agreement, made and entered into by the parties in regard to the note, and of which, it is averred, the plaintiff had notice when he became the holder of it. He then stands in the shoes of the original payee, McElroy. Although the note stipulates that it is payable thirteen months after date, still this must be controlled, as between parties and holders with notice, by the written agreement, that it is not to become due and payable until th\u00a7 association has sold for the maker 80 bushels of oats at the price named. 2 Parsons on Notes and Bills, 144, 534. It is not necessary that an answer should be returned to the question, why the parties should have subjected the absolute stipulation of the note as to the time of payment, to the provisional terms of the written agreement. It is sufficient to say that they have seen fit to do so, and the\u2019 agreement is binding on the holder. The effect of it is to give the maker the right to pay the note according to its terms, or to decline to do so until the terms of the written agreement are complied with, if, in his judgment, it would be more prudent to do so. This branch of the answer, then, states a sufficient defense to the action \u2014 non-performance of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The case of <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Spicer, </em>66 Eng. Com. Law, 894, 898, is, when rightly considered, not in conflict with this holding. The point of that decision was, that the written agreement was-not between the parties to the note. Here, it is. The fact that the suit is not between the <em>original </em>parties to the note and agreement, does not affect the question, since the plaintiff' acquired his title'with notice, and stands in the shoes of the original payee</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The second defense is based upon the alleged fraud of McElroy in obtaining the defendant\u2019s signature to the note by fraudulent representations as to the value of the oats. As it is also averred that the plaintiff took the note with knowledge of the fraud, the facts averred certainly constitute a defense, and the demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Neither of these defenses show that the maker was a party to any contemplated fraud upon the public. If the averments be true, and they are admitted by the demurrer, he was simply deceived into the belief that money could honestly be made out of the introduction of a new variety of oats, and the assumption that he was a party to any contemplated fraud on others at the time he executed the note, is inconsistent with the averments of his answer. .</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">But if the assumption were true, still the illegal character of the consideration might be plead as a defense by the maker to an action on the note by the other party or any holder of it with notice. Complicity in a wrong may defeat a party who, by action, seeks to enforce an executory contract based upon. it, or to obtain affirmative relief against the contract, as by injunction or cancellation; but such complicity does not preclude a defendant from pleading the facts as a defense, although he may be <em>in pari delicto.
