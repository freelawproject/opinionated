Tbe lien given the \u201cperson\u201d by \u00a72 3212 and 3213, Revised Statutes, who furnishes feed and bestows care on a horse or other animal therein named, is a right in the nature of a common law lien to retain possession as a security for the charges; and may be waived by the \u201cperson\u201d voluntarily parting with the possession to the owner without the charges being paid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b592-8\">2. The plaintiff below was the keeper of a feed-stable in the city of Cincinnati. The owner of a horse, who lived out of the city, was in the habit of leaving it with the plaintiff, when in the city, to be fed and cared for as long as suited liis-convenience ; when called, for, the horse would be delivered to the owner, and not returned, except at such intervals as suited the owner\u2019s convenience when again in the city. The plaintiff kept an account in which the owner was charged with the feed and care of the horse from time to time, as it was left with him. On or about the 12th of November, 1884, the horse was called' for and delivered to the owner, as usual; the charges for feed and care then amounted to over a hundred dollars. Shortly afterward the owner was killed by being thrown from his buggy. And some time after that, the horse was driven to the city by a brother of the deceased and left at another feed stable, from which it was replevined by the plaintiff in an action against certain children of the deceased, who claimed to be the owners of the horse.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b592-10\"><em>Held: </em>That the delivery of the horse was a voluntary one, and the lien waived. Whether an express or implied contract to return the animal would have varied the rights of the parties, is not determined ; for the reason, that no express contract was claimed, and none can be implied from the circumstances of this case.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b592-11\">(Decided November 19, 1889.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-12\">Error to the Circuit Court of Hamilton County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-13\">The action below was replevin for a horse. It was commenced in a justice\u2019s court, and appealed to the common pleas. The petition averred a special ownership in the plaintiff by virtue of a lien for feeding the horse and paying the expense of shoeing for more than ten days before the commencement of the action. The answer is in substance a general denial of the petition. The case was tried to a jury upon the issues joined, which found for the plaintiff, and assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>his damages for the detention, at one cent. A motion for a new trial was then made' on the ground of a misdirection of the court to the jury and a refusal to charge as requested. The motion was overruled and judgment entered on the verdict. The defendants tendered their bill of exceptions, which was signed and made a part of the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-5\">The bill sets forth all the evidence offered as to the existence of the lien, the charge of the court, and the instructions which wrere asked and refused. The evidence offered consisted of the testimony of the plaintiff and the items of his account, and is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-6\"><em>Plaintiff\u2019s testimony </em>\u2014 I keep a livery stable on Seventh street in Cincinnati, and have done so for many years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-7\">Truman B. Handy, the father of the defendants, was in the habit for several years of putting up his horses at my stable; he paid me all! his bills up to August 1, 1883. After that he paid me nothing on account of stabling, shoeing, feeding or expense of any kind of caring for the horse <em>\u201c </em>Jim,\u201d which was replevied in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-8\">This account '(marked <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>and hereto attached), is a true \u25a0copy of my account against said Truman B. Handy up to November 1, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-9\">He brought his horse to my stable five times between November 1, 1884 and November 12, 1884, for which I charged $2.00 in addition to what is shown on this account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-10\">Mr. Handy\u2019s habit was to drive into the city in the morning, drive his horse and buggy to my stable, deliver them to some employe about the stable and go about his business. In the evening, or when he wanted to use the horse, ho would \u25a0come to the stable and order his horse, and some one of my employes would then harness his horse and give him the reins, and he would then drive away. During the day I would have the horse fed and watered, and give him whatever attention he required. This was the usual course of business between us. I charged 40 cents a day for the feed and care of the horse when left at my stable in this way. I made out my bills every month, and my account shows at the be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ginning of each month the amount of my bill for the preceding month; for instance, the charge of $1.20 June 1, for stabling during May, 1884, shows that Mr. Plandy stabled his horse there three days during that month. During the month of June he left his horse at the stable in the usual way twice, as shown by the charge of July 1. And during the month of July the horse was left there but one day, as shown by the 'charge of August 1, in said account. From the middle of August to the first of November, said horse was at my stable all the time, and I charged $20.00 a month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-5\">The last time the horse was at my stable before Mr. Handy\u2019s death, was, I think, November 12, 1884. On that occasion when Mr. Plandy called for him he was harnessed and delivered to Mr. Plandy in the usual way. Mr. Handy was living in Clifton at the time this bill was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-6\">Mr. Handy was killed, so it was reported, on the 15th day of November, by being thrown from his buggy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-7\">On the 24th of November, 1884, this horse w\u2019as driven into town by Charles E.

Bristol, on Walnut street, and was taken from there by proceedings in replevin in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-8\">On one occasion I was pressing Mr. Handy pretty hard to pay up his bill. He was a little irritated, and said : \u201c Dammit, if you are afraid you won\u2019t get your pay you can sell the horse,\u201d I answered : <em>\u201c </em>Oh no, Mr. Handy, I would not do that.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s Account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-11\">\n<em>\u201c Exhibit A.\u201d</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-12\">Mr. T.

The legislature of Pennsylvania passed a law almost identical with ours; Penn. Laws, 1807, p. 162. The Supreme Court of that state, in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Kimble, </em>23 Pa.

It was well understood in Ohio, that possession of a chattel was essential to a lien thereon. <em>Jordon, Ellis &amp; Co., </em>v. <em>James, </em>see 5 Ohio, 89. The legislature, therefore, must be presumed to have used that word according to its legal meaning, then well understood and established in this state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-7\">Moreover, the use of the word \u201c retain,\u201d in sec. 3213, shows affirmatively that the legislature presumed the stable keeper to be already in possession. For how could he <em>retain </em>that of which he was not possessed?</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-8\">When Seebaum gave to Handy the possession of the horse, the last time he was at the stable, he must have decided to look to Handy personally for the amount of his bill, and not to the security of the horse. <em>Vinal </em>v. <em>Stafford, </em>139 Mass. 126; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>14 Gray, 81; <em>Papineau </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>136 Mass. 543; <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>66 Eng. Com. Law, 680.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-9\">There was no implied contract. When a person has patronized a stable or a hotel for many years, there is a <em>probability </em>that he will continue to do so, and this <em>probability </em>of future patronage constitutes the \u201cgood will\u201d of the stable or the hotel; but it was clearly erroneous to say that this probability amounts to an \u201cimplied contract\u201d or any duty or obligation to continue the patronage.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Minshall, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5d1\">Whether the instructions of the court to the ]ury stated the law applicable to the case made by the tendency of the proof, depends upon the nature and character of the lien given by sections 3212 and 3213, Rev. Stats., to a person who furnishes food and care for any <em>\u201c </em>horse \u201d by virtue of an agreement with the owner, .to secure the payment of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">These sections are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Sec. 3212. A person who feeds or furnishes food and care for any horse, mare, foal, filly, gelding, mule, or ass, by virtue of any contract or agreement with the owner thereof, shall have a lien therefor, to secure the payment of the same, upon such animal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Sec. 3213. A person feeding or furnishing food and care for any horse, mare, foal, filly, gelding, mule, or ass, shall retain such animal for the period of ten days, at the expiration of which time, if the owner does not satisfy such lien, he may sell such animal at public auction, after giving the owner ten days\u2019 notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the services were rendered; and after satisfying the lien and costs that may accrue, any residue remaining shall be paid to the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">It seems to us very clear upon a view of these sections, that the intention of the legislature was, in enacting them, to give to the person furnishing such food and care a lien upon the animal as a security for the food furnished and care bestowed, with the incidents of a lien at common law in analogous cases. The first section gives the \u201c lien,\u201d and the next one provides the mode of maintaining and enforcing it: The \u201c person \u201d shall \u201c retain \u201d the animal for ten days, and if, at the expiration of that time, the owner does not satisfy the lien,- he may, on giving the requisite notice, sell it at public auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The nature and incidents of a common law lien of this kind are well settled : It is a right to retain property until certain claims against it are satisfied; and possession is not only essential to its creation, but also to its continuance. Where the party voluntarily parts with the possession of the property upon which the lien has attached, he is divested of his lien. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>2 Kent Com. 638; Smith\u2019s Mercantile Law, 697; <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Pym, </em>1 East. 4; <em>Lickbarrow </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>6 East. 21; <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Barclay, </em>2 East 227 ; <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>James, </em>5 Ohio R. 89, 98. In <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>26 Wend. 473, it is said, that \u201c the very definition of a lien as the right to retain, indicates that it must cease when the possession is relinquished. This principle, so clearly founded in reason and so congruous to public utility and the convenience of trade, is supported by the uniform testimony of the decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The right to sell the animal upon notice and apply the proceeds to satisfying the lien, does not affect its classification with similar common law liens; it only gives a plain and simple remedy for enforcing the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The evidence .tended to show, and the charge of the court was applicable to, a case where the owner of a horse temporarily leaves it with the owner of a feed-stable to be fed and cared for; there is no definite arrangement as to time; it may be for less or more than a day; this depends upon the convenience of the owner who resides out of the city; when he wishes to return home, the horse is delivered to him, and the feed and care is charged to him in an account by the keeper. There is no express agreement at any time that the horse is to be returned Now how, under these circumstances, it can be inferred, as the court charged the jury, that there is an implied contract on the part of the owner to return the horse, we are unable to see. The owner is, for the time, simply a customer of this particular feed-stable. The keeper may expect that when the owner again comes to the city he will again patronize him by sending his horse to his stable. But when this may be, he can neither rightfully demand to know, or expect to be informed. How would the owner, as a matter of law, violate any agreement for which damages could be recovered, if he should, in the meantime, conclude to change his patropage and never return the horse. If it were otherwise then it might be inferred that every customer of a store is under an implied contract to continue to deal with it. If he were in debt for goods previously sold, he might be under a moral obligation not to withdraw his custom until he had- discharged what he owed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>but there would be no legal obligation to that effect, arising from the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The lien provided by this statute does not arise upon contract., True, the fee.d must be furnished under an agreement with the owner, but where this has been done\u2019 the statute creates the lien in favor of the party furnishing it, irrespective of any agreement therefor to that effect. The lien given is a right to retain the property, that is its possession, as a security for the debt, and if this right is not insisted on when the horse is called for, the owner can not be said to violate any agreement in not afterward returning it; for he has no notice of an intention on the part of the keeper to assert a lien, when the property is voluntarily delivered to him ; and, therefore, any supposed agreement to return could only relate to a thing of which he has no notice, and, which in fact, has no existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Therefore, in a case like the one to which the court applied its charge, the person furnishing the feed and bestowing the care must, if he would assert a lien on the animal therefor, do so by retaining its possession when called for by the owner, unless his charges are p&gt;aid. If he do not, and voluntarily deliver the animal to the owner, he must be held to have waived his right to assert a lien under the statute, and to be satisfied with the personal liability of the owner for the charges. Such is the rule in common law liens based on possession, and we see no reason why the rule should not apply here as well as there. It is more in harmony with the general policy of our statutes \u201c which always strive to secure public registration when possession is not given and retained, and which expressly provide for such registration -when the/ in terms create a lien not depending on possession.\u201d Holmes, J., in <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>139 Mass. 126, 130. See also the following cases : <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>14 Gray, 481; <em>Papinsau </em>v. <em>Wontworth, </em>136 Mass. 543; <em>Forth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>66 Eng. Com. Law, 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">What should be the rule in cases where the animal is placed by the owner with a person to be fed and cared for, not temporarily \u2014 the horse being ordinarily kept at Tome or some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>where else by the owner \u2014 but, permanently for.some time either definite or indefinite, presents a different question. In such case where the owner is allowed to use it, its voluntary delivery to him for such purpose, might be said to imply a contract to return the animal, and a failure to do so would be such a fraud as to estop the owner from setting up that the lien had been lost by such voluntary delivery. But this is not the case before us, and we express no definite opinion upon it at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We have examined the cases cited by counsel for the plaintiff in error, but fail to find that they give any considerable support to his view of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The case of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>23 Penn. St. 195, is simply to the effect that where the owner forcibly or clandestinely obtains possession of the subject of the lien, the lienor\u2019s right is not impaired by such deprivation of the possession. <em>Munson </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>63 Ia. 453, rightly holds that demanding more than is due, will not entitle the owner to replevin the property without paying what is due. And <em>Eckland </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>9 Daly, 214, holds that replevin of the property cannot be had by bi\u2019inging it before the defendant had time to make out his bill and give notice of his intention to perfect a lien, as required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The cases of <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Tutt, </em>10 Lea. (Ten.) 258, and of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Marden, </em>60'N. H. 509, would tend to support the case where animals are, for the time being, permanently left with a person to be fed and cared for, with the right in the owner to use them. In such cases it is held that the lien is not thereby affected as against a creditor of the owner. The possession of the animal by the owner under such circumstances is not regarded as terminating the bailment, the pos\u2022session being constructively that of the bailee, and under an implied contract to return the animal as soon as the use is at an end. This seems somewhat plausible, but whether sound or not, we do not, for the reasons before stated, now determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
