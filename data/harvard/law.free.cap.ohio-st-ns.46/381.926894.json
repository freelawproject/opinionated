J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag5\">The action below was upon the drawing of a check by the defendant on the Kenton Savings Bank,, payable to one Caldwell, or his order, for the sum of $200. The plaintiff,' the owner by indorsement, presented the check to the Savings Bank, for payment; payment was refused and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>due notice given of non-payment. The defendant answered that the consideration of the check was small pieces of celluloid called \u201c checks, \u201d representing money, betted and lost by him upon a game of chance played with cards. Any knowledge of this, as well as the fact itself, was denied in the reply.. On the trial the court in substance charged the jury, as appears from the bill of exceptions, that though the consideration of the check was for money lost in a game of chance, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, if it had no knowledge of the same; and, observing to the. jury that it was conceded that the plaintiff was a <em>bona fide </em>holder without knowledge of the consideration for which the check had been given, directed a vei\u2019dict for the plaintiff for the amount of the check and interest. The judgment rendered upon the verdict was reversed by the circuit court, and the object of this proceeding is to-obtain a reversal of the judgment of the latter court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">It is provided in sec. 4269, Rev. Stats., that, \u201cAll promises, \u2019 agreements, notes, bills, bonds, or other contracts, * * * when the whole, or any part of the consideration of such promise, * * * is for money, * * * won or lost, * * * upon any game, * * * whatsoever, .* * * shall be absolutely void, and of no effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> It is claimed that a check is not included in this statute. But this, as we think, will hardly bear serious discussion. A check is at least a contract, for it imports an agreement upon the part of the drawer to pay it if on presentment to the drawee it is not paid, and due notice is given him of such nonpayment. The action below was upon the obligation so assumed, and the only support this obligation has is the consideration for which the cheek was drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\"><em>We </em>do not, however, understand that the common pleas placed its judgment on this ground. It assumed, and so charged the. jury, that the plaintiff could recover if he was an innocent holder for value, although the consideration for the drawing was money lost at cards. In this we think the common pleas erred, and that the judgment of the circuit court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Notwithstanding the general tendency of courts to construe the word <em>\u201c </em>void \u201d as \u201c voidable \u201d only when used in statutes that affect contracts made in disregard of their provisions, yet where a public policy is to be subserved, as the suppression of usury or gaming, the settled rule-is to give to the language employed -its full force and effect. The rule with its limitations is thus stated by a very reliable author on the interpretation of statutes: <em>\u201c </em>In general, however, it would seem that where the enactment has relation only to the benefit of particular persons, the word \u201c void \u201d would be understood as <em>\u201c </em>voidable \u201d only, at the election of the persons for whose protection the enactment was made, and who are capable of protecting themselves; but that when it relates to persons not capable of protecting themselves, or when it has some object of public policy in view which requires the strict construction, the word receives its natural full force and effect.\u201d Maxwell, Interp. Stat. 2d Ed. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">So, in <em>Bowyer </em>v. <em>Bampton, </em>2 Strange, 1155, it was held that the innocent indorsee of a gaming note can maintain no action against the drawer, the statute, 9 Anne, c. 14, being, \u201c That all notes, where the whole or any part\u00bbof the consideration is money knowingly lent for gaming, shall be void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\u201d The court said, <em>\u201c </em>it is making it of some use to the lender, if he can pay his own debts with <em>it; </em>and it will be a means to evade the act, it being so very difficult to prove notice on an indorsee. And though it will be some inconvenience to an innocent man, yet that will not be a balance to those on the other side.\u201d And so in <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>Doug. 736, which arose under the statute, 12 Anne, c. 2, \u00a7 16, making usurious contracts void, the action being by an indorsee of a bill against the acceptor, the indorsee having no knowledge of the consideration. Lord Mansfield, expressing a great leaning in favor of the plaintiff, said, \u201c But the words of the act are too strong. Besides, we can not get over the case of the statute against gaming, which stands on the same ground. This is one of those instances in which private must give way to public convenience,\u201d and a recovery was .denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>In <em>Weed </em>v <em>Bond, </em>21 Ga. 195, under a statute making void notes given an attorney where he fails to attend to the suit or procure some one to do so, a note so given was held void in the hands of an innocent indorsee, the attorney having failed to attend to the suit of the maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In <em>Groves </em>v. Clark, 21 La. Ann. 567, it was held that the third holder of a promissory note, given for the price of a slave, can not recover thereon, although he acquired the note in good faith, for a valuable consideration, before maturity, on the ground that \u201ccontracts for the sale of persons\u201d are declared by the constitution of the state, \u201c null and void.\u201d This seems to have been the general construction placed upon statutes making void securities based upon a gaming consideration. <em>Pickaway County Bank </em>v. <em>Prather, </em>12 Ohio St. 497, 509; <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>1 Woods\u2019s, 439, 448; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>3 Rand. 316, 324; Story on Bills, \u00a7 189 ; 3 Kent Comm. 80 (13th ed.); Danl. Neg. Inst. \u00a7 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The individual hardships that may arise in the enforcement of the policy of statutes of this kind, are regarded as less than the public inconvenience to be avoided by the suppression of the evils connected with the vice of gambling. Lord Mansfield observes in the case of <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>that \u201c It is less mischievous that the law should be as it is with respect to bills and. notes, than other securities; because they are generally payable in a short time, so that the indorsee has an early opportunity of recurring to the indorser, if he can not recover upon the bilk\u201d Douglas, 744. And it seems to be well settled that one who can make out his title through a person other than the one who executed the instrument on the vicious consideration, may, if an innocent holder, recover from his indorser. Maxwell, Interp. Stat. 250; <em>Bowyer </em>v. <em>Bampton, supra. </em>So that in this case the plaintiff might, on giving due notice, have recovered from its immediate or any prior indorser of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
