(minor) recorded photographs and video on his cellular phone of consensual sexual activity between himself and Jane Doe, both under 18 years old, and he later extorted money from Doe by threatening to disclose the recordings to other students at their high school. He was placed on juvenile probation after admitting to felony possession of child pornography (Pen. Code, \u00a7 311.11, subd. (a)) and extortion (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 518, 520). Minor argues that a probation condition requiring him to submit all electronic devices under his control to warrantless search by the probation department and to provide passwords necessary to access information on those devices is unconstitutionally overbroad. Given the direct relationship between minor\u2019s offenses and his use of an electronic device, we find the search condition appropriately tailored and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">I. JUVENILE COURT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">According to the probation report, juvenile Jane Doe reported to her father that she had engaged in sexual conduct with minor and another boy on separate occasions and was being blackmailed as a result. Doe\u2019s father contacted the police, who interviewed Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-11\">Doe told a police officer that she had engaged in sexual intercourse with minor multiple times. Minor recorded videos of them having sex. Minor and Doe had also exchanged nude photographs. They eventually broke up, at which point minor reportedly told other students at their high school that Doe had had sex with him. Minor started asking Doe for money, later blackmailing her by threatening to show the videos and photographs to others. Doe gave him money for a couple of months before telling her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-12\">In addition to extorting money from her, Doe reported that minor threatened to show the photographs and videos to others if she did not have sex with another boy. Doe \u201cbecame scared and felt she had to do whatever [minor] told her to do.\u201d Doe had sex with the other boy, who recorded a video of the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>Police officers obtained a warrant to search minor\u2019s cellular phone and discovered videos and nude photographs of Doe. Minor used a password-based application called KeepSafe on his phone to securely store videos and photographs, and he provided the password. When interviewed by police, minor denied having a sexual relationship with Doe. He then admitted blackmailing Doe for money, but denied pressuring her to have sex with someone else. According to a police report, officers discovered text messages on minor\u2019s phone in which he \u201cdemanded money from [Doe] and reminded her that he still had, \u2018pics and videos.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">Minor was arrested, and a Welfare &amp; Institutions Code section 602 petition was filed alleging forcible rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2); count 1); possession or control of matter depicting a person under 18 engaging in sexual conduct (Pen. Code, \u00a7 311.11, subd. (a); count 2); and extortion of property (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 518, 520; count 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">Minor admitted counts 2 and 3, and requested a contested jurisdiction hearing regarding count 1. After taking evidence, the juvenile court concluded that the prosecution had not met its burden and found the rape count not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">Minor was declared a ward of the juvenile court based on counts 2 and 3 and was placed on juvenile probation in the custody of his parents. At the disposition hearing, the prosecutor requested a probation condition prohibiting minor from using \u201cany type of cell phone unless in the case of an emergency.\u201d Alternatively, the prosecutor requested a condition requiring minor to submit all electronic devices under his control to search at any time with or without a warrant. Minor objected to the conditions based on \u201cthe issue of overbreadth and narrow tailoring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">The juvenile court declined to impose a condition forbidding minor from using a cellular phone, but adopted the prosecutor\u2019s search condition. As written in the disposition hearing minute order, the condition requires minor to \u201c[sjubmit all electronic devices under [his] control to a search of any text messages, voicemail messages, call logs, photographs, email accounts and social media accounts, with or without a search warrant, at any time of the day or night, and provide the probation or peace officer with any passwords necessary to access the information specified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-10\">Minor argues that the electronic search condition is unconstitutionally overbroad because it fails to adequately define \u201celectronic devices\u201d; implicates the privacy rights of third parties; allows searches of remotely stored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>information; and unnecessarily infringes upon his expectation of privacy in the contents of electronic devices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">Juvenile courts have broad discretion to fashion probation conditions, and \u201cmay impose \u2018 \u201cany reasonable condition that is \u2018fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done and the reformation and rehabilitation of the ward enhanced.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Sheena K. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 875, 889 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 716, 153 P.3d 282] <em>(Sheena K.).) </em>Juvenile probation conditions may be broader than those imposed on adult offenders \u201cbecause juveniles are deemed to be more in need of guidance and supervision than adults, and because a minor\u2019s constitutional rights are more circumscribed.\u201d <em>(In re Antonio R. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 937, 941 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 212].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">\u201cA probation condition that imposes limitations on a person\u2019s constitutional rights must closely tailor those limitations to the purpose of the condition to avoid being invalidated as unconstitutionally overbroad.\u201d <em>(Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 890.) We review constitutional challenges to probation conditions de novo. <em>(In re Malik J. </em>(2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 896, 901 [193 Cal.Rptr.3d 370] (Malik J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">B. Malik J. <em>is Distinguishable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-9\">Minor relies heavily on the reasoning of <em>Malik J., supra, </em>240 Cal.App.4th 896, but that decision is factually distinguishable. While on juvenile probation, Malik robbed three different women near a transit station. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 899.) Malik admitted the robberies as probation violations. The prosecutor asked the juvenile court to impose a probation condition subjecting Malik\u2019s electronic devices to warrantless search, arguing that \u201cMalik had been working with two other individuals, which \u2018would indicate electronic devices might be used to coordinate with other people, and one of these robberies involved an iPhone, which means electronic devices on his person might be stolen.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 900.) Over a defense objection, the juvenile court imposed a condition requiring Malik to provide passwords to social media accounts and any electronic devices within his custody and control, and to submit those devices to warrantless search at any time. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-10\">Malik appealed, arguing that the search condition was unconstitutionally overbroad. <em>(Malik J., supra, </em>240 Cal.App.4th at pp. 901-902.) The People justified the search condition as necessary to allow probation officers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>determine whether any cell phones in Malik\u2019s possession had been stolen. While the appellate court agreed that was a proper purpose, it found the condition overbroad because it \u201cgoes considerably farther than permitting police to search a cell phone to determine whether Malik is the owner.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 902.) The court reasoned that while officers \u201cmust be able to determine ownership of any devices in a probationer\u2019s custody or within his or her control,\u201d they \u201cmust show due regard for information that may be beyond a probationer\u2019s custody or control or implicate the privacy rights of the probationer or third parties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 903-904.) The appellate court concluded that in order to achieve the purpose of ensuring that electronic devices in Malik\u2019s possession were not stolen, the condition should be modified to \u201cauthorize warrantless searches of electronic devices in Malik\u2019s custody and control only after the device has been disabled from any internet or cellular connection and without utilizing specialized equipment designed to retrieve deleted information that is not readily accessible to users of the device.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 906.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">The <em>Malik J. </em>court\u2019s discussion must be read in that case\u2019s factual context. There was no evidence an electronic device was an instrumentality of the robberies Malik committed. By contrast, here it is undisputed that minor used his cell phone not only to store the illegal media but also to demand money from Jane Doe via text message. The <em>Malik J. </em>court limited the scope of the electronic search condition because its purpose\u2014ensuring electronic devices in Malik\u2019s possession were not stolen\u2014was limited and could be achieved through a relatively superficial search. But the purposes of the electronic search condition here\u2014ensuring that minor does not continue to use electronic devices to commit crimes\u2014cannot be accomplished by a superficial search. The need for robust access is particularly critical given that minor previously stored illegal content in a password-protected application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">C. <em>The Search Condition Is Not Overbroad as Applied to Minor</em></p>\n<p id=\"aur-dedup-0\">1. <em>Scope of \u201cElectronic Devices\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">Minor argues that the probation condition is unconstitutionally overbroad because the failure to define specific types of \u201celectronic devices\u201d allows probation officers to search \u201ca digital television; video game console, both hand-held and stationary; and something as innocuous as a Kindle Fire or DVD player merely because the device was in [minor\u2019s] control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">Minor used an electronic device\u2014his cell phone\u2014to perpetrate both offenses he admitted. Though it appears from the record that minor\u2019s cell phone was the only electronic device he used to commit those offenses, the search condition is not unconstitutionally overbroad merely because it encompasses other devices. By allowing the search of other devices, the condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>ensures that minor is neither storing illegal images nor attempting to extort money by the use of any electronic device. If the condition were limited to specific types of electronic devices, minor could attempt to circumvent it by using an unlisted device for inappropriate storage or communication. As drafted, the condition is directed at preventing minor from engaging in the very conduct that brought him under the court\u2019s supervision, while providing probation officers with flexibility in dealing with technological capabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">2. <em>Privacy Rights of Third Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">Minor argues that the condition is unconstitutionally overbroad because it enables probation officers to use minor\u2019s electronic device to obtain information from third parties that is not within minor\u2019s actual possession and control, which affects those third parties\u2019 privacy rights. Minor\u2019s argument appears to relate to his use of social media: by requiring minor to provide his social media account passwords, the condition allows probation officers to access information posted by third parties with whom minor is connected on social media even though some of that information would not be accessible to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">Minor can safeguard the rights of third parties by advising them that information they make accessible to him is not private. Further, any speculative impact on third parties is not a reason to strike the condition since minor lacks standing to assert the constitutional rights of third parties. (See <em>Rakas v. Illinois </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 128, 134 [58 L.Ed.2d 387, 99 S.Ct. 421] [\u201cA person who is aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure only through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search of a third person\u2019s premises or property has not had any of his Fourth Amendment rights infringed.\u201d].) The court in <em>Malik J. </em>discussed access to third party information as a reason the probation condition at issue in that case was unconstitutionally overbroad. <em>(Malik J., supra, </em>240 Cal.App.4th at pp. 902-904.) But there is no indication that the <em>Malik J. </em>court considered the standing argument presented by the People here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-8\">3. <em>Accessing Remotely Stored Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">Minor argues that the condition is unconstitutionally overbroad because probation officers will \u2018\u201chave an unfettered right to retrieve any information accessible from the electronic device, including information stored in a remote location.\u201d But limiting the condition to information stored only on the devices themselves would allow minor to circumvent the condition by using a cloud-based storage application. Though it is unclear from the record whether the KeepSafe application minor used to store illegal images was local or cloud based, he appears to have had the sophistication to protect the images <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>from discovery or deletion with a password. In the context of this case, allowing access to remotely stored information is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">4. <em>Expectation of Privacy in Contents of Electronic Devices</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">Minor argues that the search condition is unconstitutionally overbroad because it unnecessarily infringes on his expectation of privacy in the contents of electronic devices. In essence, minor argues that the burden of the condition is not narrowly tailored to its purpose \u201cbecause the condition is not limited in any way to the types of data that may be searched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">Though even as a juvenile probationer minor retains a constitutionally protected expectation of privacy, that expectation is greatly diminished as long as he remains a ward of the court. <em>(In re Jaime P. </em>(2006) 40 Cal.4th 128, 136 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 430, 146 P.3d 965].) By asserting jurisdiction over him, the juvenile court (and, by extension, the probation department) acts in loco parentis and may curtail minor\u2019s constitutional rights to a greater extent than if he were an adult probationer. <em>(In re Antonio R., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 941.) His expectation is markedly different from the broader privacy guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment to individuals who are not serving sentences or on grants of probation. It is that preconviction expectation of privacy that was at issue in <em>Riley v. California </em>(2014) 573 U.S. _ [189 L.Ed.2d 430, 134 S.Ct. 2473] <em>(Riley), </em>where the United States Supreme Court announced the general rule that police may not conduct a warrantless search of a cellular phone seized incident to an arrest. <em>(Riley, supra, </em>573 U.S. at p._ [134 S.Ct. at p. 2485].) <em>Riley </em>is thus distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">We note again that minor <em>used </em>an electronic device to commit both crimes he admitted. Minor stored the illegal photographs and videos on his cellular phone, and he used that phone to send text messages demanding money while implicitly threatening to share the \u201cpics and videos\u201d with others if Jane Doe did not comply. In the context of this case, robust access to minor\u2019s electronic devices is critical to monitor his progress on probation and to ensure that he is not continuing to engage in the sort of criminal conduct that led to him being declared a ward of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\">The nature of minor\u2019s crimes and their direct relationship to the use of an electronic device distinguishes this case from those where similar probation conditions have been rejected as unconstitutionally overbroad. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Appleton </em>(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th <em>111 </em>[199 Cal.Rptr.3d 637], a different panel of this court struck an electronic search condition imposed on an adult probationer in a false imprisonment case where the only connection to electronic devices was that the probationer had met the minor victim through social media several months before the crime occurred. <em>(Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>pp. 719-720, 728-729.) Similarly, in <em>In re P.O. </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 288 [200 Cal.Rptr.3d 841], the court modified an electronic search condition in a juvenile public intoxication case because the condition bore no relation to the crime and was imposed to monitor the juvenile\u2019s involvement with drugs. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 291-293, 298; see also <em>Malik J., supra, </em>240 Cal.App.4th at pp. 899-900, 902.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">Given the facts of this case, we conclude that the electronic search condition is not unconstitutionally overbroad as applied to minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">III. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">The disposition order is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1161-8\">Rushing, P. J., and Premo, J., concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b1161-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was granted April 12, 2017, S240222.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1157-11\"> The Supreme Court has granted review in several cases to determine the validity of probation conditions like the one imposed here.
