And, in newly enacted Penal Code section 1170.18, former subdivision (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Proposition authorized persons \u201ccurrently serving a sentence\u201d for a felony conviction for such crimes to petition for resentencing. However, those resentenced individuals are still subject to a ban on possessing a firearm. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Prior to the enactment of Proposition 47, appellant Franklin Bastidas had entered a plea of no contest to a felony charge of possession of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (b)), one of the offenses covered by Proposition 47. Imposition of sentence was suspended, and appellant was placed on felony probation for a period of five years. In 2015, the district attorney petitioned for revocation of probation, and appellant requested that his conviction be reduced to a misdemeanor. To avoid the restriction on firearm possession, appellant argued he was not \u201ccurrently serving a sentence\u201d under section 1170.18, and he was entitled to the reduction of his conviction to a misdemeanor pursuant to <em>In re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948] <em>(Estrada). Estrada </em>held that, in the absence of contrary legislative intent, statutory amendments mitigating criminal punishment are to be applied retroactively. The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s contention but granted appellant\u2019s subsequent petition under section 1170.18, subdivision (a). The court reduced appellant\u2019s conviction to a misdemeanor and terminated probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>On appeal, appellant contends he was entitled to resentencing under <em>Estrada </em>and should, therefore, be free from the prohibition on firearms possession. We agree with our colleagues in Division One who rejected the same contention in <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 127 [200 Cal.Rptr.3d 642], review granted July 13, 2016, S234324 <em>(Davis). </em>(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1105(e)(1)(B).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Appellant was charged by information with possession of cocaine base for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351.5; count one) and possession of heroin for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351; count two). In September 2013, pursuant to a plea bargain, appellant entered a plea of no contest to possession of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (b)) as a lesser included offense to count two, and count one was dismissed. Imposition of sentence was suspended and appellant was placed on probation for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In September 2015, the district attorney filed a petition to revoke probation following appellant\u2019s arrest for possession of controlled substances and paraphernalia. Appellant requested that the trial court reduce the level of the underlying conviction from a felony to a misdemeanor pursuant to <em>Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 740, arguing that the resentencing provisions in section 1170.18 did not apply because he had not been sentenced to prison. The trial court denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Subsequently, appellant petitioned for reduction of the felony conviction to a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18. Above appellant\u2019s signature on the petition the following sentence appears: \u201cBy signing below, defendant acknowledges that s/he understands that s/he may not use, own or possess firearms, even if this Petition is granted.\u201d The trial court granted the petition and designated the conviction as a misdemeanor. Appellant admitted the probation violation and probation was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Appellant contends he was entitled to have his conviction reduced to a misdemeanor under <em>Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 740, which \u201cestablished an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>exception to the general rule that no part of the Penal Code is retroactive.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hajek and Vo </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 1144, 1195 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 234, 324 P.3d 88], overruled on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rangel </em>(2016) 62 Cal.4th 1192, 1216 [200 Cal.Rptr.3d 265, 367 P.3d 649].) Under <em>Estrada, </em>\u2018\u201cwhere [an] amendatory statute mitigates punishment and there is no saving clause, the rule is that the amendment will operate retroactively so that the lighter punishment is imposed.\u201d (Estrada, at p. 748.) Appellant argues he was entitled under <em>Estrada </em>to retroactive application of Proposition 47 and, therefore, should not be prohibited from possessing firearms under section 1170.18, subdivision (k).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument turns on his claim that, because he was on probation with imposition of sentence suspended, he was not \u2018\u201cserving a sentence\u201d for purposes of section 1170.18, subdivision (a). Because we conclude persons on probation are \u2018\u201cserving a sentence\u201d for purposes of the statute, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">I. <em>Proposition 47</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The voters enacted Proposition 47 on November 4, 2014. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1089 [183 Cal.Rptr.3d 362].) Proposition 47 made \u2018\u201ccertain drug- and theft-related offenses misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible defendants.\u201d (Rivera, at p. 1091.) As relevant here, Proposition 47 amended Health and Safety Code section 11350; previously, possession of the controlled substances referenced in subdivision (a) was a felony and possession of the controlled substances referenced in subdivision (b) was a wobbler. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, former \u00a7 11350, subds. (a), (b); see also <em>Rivera, </em>at p. 1092.) As amended by Proposition 47, a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11350 is now a misdemeanor, \u201cunless the defendant \u2018has one or more prior convictions\u2019 for an offense specified in . . . section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv)\u2014which lists serious and violent felonies that are sometimes referred to as \u2018 \u201csuper strike\u201d offenses\u2019\u2014or for an offense that requires the defendant to register as a sex offender under section 290, subdivision (c).\u201d (Rivera, at p. 1092.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Proposition 47 also enacted a resentencing provision, codified at section 1170.18, which provided in former subdivision (a): \u201cA person currently serving a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section (\u2018this act\u2019) had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing in accordance with\u201d the statutes amended or added by Proposition 47. If the petitioner meets the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18, the felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>sentence \u201cshall be recalled and the petitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (b).) A petitioner resentenced as a misdemeanant \u201cshall be subject to parole for one year following completion of his or her sentence, unless the court, in its discretion, as part of its resentencing order, releases the person from parole.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Section 1170.18, subdivision (f) extends the benefits of Proposition 47 to persons who have completed their sentences. Thus, the statute states, \u201cA person who has completed his or her sentence for a conviction ... of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under this act had this act been in effect at the time of the offense, may file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the felony conviction or convictions designated as misdemeanors.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (1).) Under section 1170.18, subdivision (g), upon receipt of a qualifying application, a court is required to \u201cdesignate the felony offense or offenses as a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Section 1170.18, subdivision (j), requires that any petition or application under section 1170.18 be filed within three years, absent a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">As relevant to appellant\u2019s claim on appeal, Proposition 47 provides that the prohibition on firearm possession by felons continues to apply to persons benefitting from the enactment\u2019s resentencing and redesignation procedures. Thus, section 1170.18, subdivision (k) provides, \u201c[a]ny felony conviction that is recalled and resentenced under subdivision (b) or designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes, except that such resentencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm or prevent his or her conviction under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 29800) of Division 9 of Title 4 of Part 6.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">According to Proposition 47\u2019s \u201cFindings and Declarations,\u201d the purpose of the enactment was \u201cto ensure that prison spending is focused on violent and serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to invest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12 schools, victim services, and mental health and drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>treatment. This act ensures that sentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child molestation are not changed.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47, \u00a7 2, p. 70 (Ballot Pamphlet).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">II. Estrada <em>and Proposition 47</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Whether a criminal statute is to be applied retroactively is a matter of legislative intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319 [142 Cal.Rptr.3d 824, 278 P.3d 1182].) \u201c[T]he default rule,\u201d applied when the Legislature \u2018\u201chas not made its intent on the matter clear\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>is found in section 3: \u2018\u201cNo part of [the Penal Code] is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.\u201d As noted previously, <em>Estrada </em>created an exception to that rule in holding that a statutory amendment lessening a criminal punishment, enacted after a defendant\u2019s criminal act was committed but before the judgment became final, should be applied retroactively to mitigate his punishment, unless the Legislature has expressly indicated to the contrary through inclusion of a \u2018\u201csaving clause.\u201d <em>(Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 742, 744-745, 748; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Conley </em>(2016) 63 Cal.4th 646, 662 [203 Cal.Rptr.3d 622, 373 P.3d 435] (cone. opn. of Werdegar, J.) <em>(Conley), </em>[\u2018\u201cA saving clause is a provision in which the lawmakers articulate how the amended law is to apply, if at all, to cases decided under the prior law.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Shabazz </em>(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303 [187 Cal.Rptr.3d 828] (Shabazz) considered how to apply <em>Estrada </em>in the Proposition 47 context. There, a defendant\u2019s case was on appeal and the defendant asked the Court of Appeal to reduce his felony narcotics possession offenses to misdemeanors under Proposition 47, approved by the voters while his appeal was pending. <em>(Shabazz, </em>at pp. 307, 310.) The court held the defendant was required to seek that relief from the trial court \u201cbecause the voters have expressly required he file an application in the trial court to reduce his felony convictions to misdemeanors.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 307.) The court reasoned the defendant was not entitled to relief under <em>Estrada </em>because voters intended that persons seeking the benefits of the enactment follow the procedures described in section 1170.18. <em>(Shabazz, </em>at pp. 313-314; accord, <em>People v. Bradshaw </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1251, 1257-1258 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 431]; see also <em>People v. Yearwood </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 172 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 901] <em>(Yearwood) </em>[analogous provision in Prop. 36, which provides for resentencing in \u201cthree strikes\u201d cases, was \u201cthe functional equivalent of a saving clause\u201d and demonstrated voter intent that \u201ca petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>for recall of sentence [was] to be the sole remedy available under the Act\u201d for defendants seeking the retroactive application of its amendments]; Couzens et al., Sentencing California Crimes (The Rutter Group 2016) \u00a725:1 [\u2018\u201cthe basic structure of Proposition 47 is strikingly similar to Proposition 36\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Appellant argues <em>Shabazz </em>was incorrectly decided because the decision failed to take into account section 1170.18, subdivision (m), which provides, \u2018\u201cNothing in this section is intended to diminish or abrogate any rights or remedies otherwise available to the petitioner or applicant.\u201d He suggests retroactive relief under <em>Estrada </em>is one of the remedies preserved by that provision. However, because section 1170.18 reflects the voters\u2019 intent that persons seeking retroactive relief do so according to its provisions, there is no separate relief available under <em>Estrada. </em>In other words, relief under <em>Estrada </em>is not an otherwise available right or remedy because section 1170.18 itself specifies the conditions under which the Proposition 47 amendments may be retroactively applied. The California Supreme Court recently reached the same conclusion with respect to an identical provision in Proposition 36, reasoning there was \u201cno indication that automatic resentencing\u201d under <em>Estrada </em>\u201cranks among the \u2018rights\u2019 the electorate sought to preserve.\u201d (Conley, <em>supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 661; see also <em>Yearwood, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th at p. 178 [concluding that Prop. 36 provision \u201cdoes not have any impact in determining if amended sections . . . operate retroactively\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In any event, appellant contends that, even if <em>Shabazz </em>is correct with respect to requests for relief by imprisoned persons, the same reasoning does not apply to him because his situation is not encompassed by the language of section 1170.18. In particular, he contends that, as a person placed on probation with imposition of sentence suspended, he is not \u201c[a] person currently serving a sentence for a conviction\u201d within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a). He concludes that, because his situation is not encompassed within the procedures in section 1170.18, he is entitled to retroactive relief under <em>Estrada. </em>The import of appellant\u2019s claim is, if appellant is able to obtain redesignation of his offense outside the procedures in section 1170.18, then he can avoid the prohibition on firearm possession in section 1170.18, subdivision (k). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbreth </em>(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 53, 55 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d 10] [reversing a defendant\u2019s conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm where the predicate felony offense had been reduced to a misdemeanor].)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">III. <em>Interpretation of \u201cServing a Sentence\u2019\u2019 in Section 1170.18, Subdivision (a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">As discussed above, section 1170.18, former subdivision (a), permits \u201c[a] person currently serving a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>of a felony or felonies,\u201d who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor had Proposition 47 been in effect at the time of the offense, to petition for a recall of sentence. Appellant argues he is not covered by subdivision (a) because he was not serving a term of imprisonment at the time he sought redesignation of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">\u201c\u2018In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cThe fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018In determining intent, we look first to the words themselves. [Citations.] When the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction. [Citations.] When the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, however, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] We also \u2018 \u201crefer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Using these extrinsic aids, we \u201cselect the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Cervantes) (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1014 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 86] <em>(Cervantes).) </em>Proposition 47 directs that its provisions \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\u201d (Ballot Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 47, \u00a7 18, p. 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">A. <em>\u201cServing a Sentence </em>\u201d <em>Is Ambiguous</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We conclude the phrase \u201cserving a sentence\u201d as used in section 1170.18, subdivision (a) is ambiguous. In <em>People v. Garcia </em>(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 555 [199 Cal.Rptr.3d 396] <em>(Garcia), </em>the Sixth District was confronted with the same issue and concluded section 1170.18, subdivision (a) does not apply only to those serving a term of imprisonment. There, as in the present case, the defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and placed on felony probation with imposition of sentence suspended. <em>(Garcia, </em>at p. 557.) After passage of Proposition 47, the defendant filed a petition for resentencing under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), but the trial court denied the petition on the basis that the defendant was not serving a \u201csentence.\u201d <em>(Garcia, </em>at p. 557.) In reversing, the Court of Appeal impliedly found the word \u201csentence\u201d is ambiguous, observing \u201cgranting probation is in some contexts a \u2018sentencing choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 558.) <em>Garcia </em>cited rule 4.405(6) of the California Rules of Court, which provides, \u201c \u2018Sentence choice\u2019 means the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>selection of any disposition of the case that does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial.\u201d <em>Garcia </em>quoted <em>In re DeLong </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 562, 571 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 385], for the proposition that \u2018\u201can order granting probation and suspending imposition of sentence is a form of sentencing.\u201d (Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Tidwell </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 212, 218-219 [200 Cal.Rptr.3d 567] <em>(Tidwell).) Garcia </em>also quoted <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1034 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 375], where the court used the phrase \u2018\u201csentence of probation\u201d in reference to Proposition 36. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Murillo </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1418 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 358] [observing that Prop. 36 \u2018\u201crequires mandatory sentences of probation for nonviolent drug possessors\u201d]; Couzens et al., Sentencing Cal. Crimes, <em>supra, </em>\u00a725:1 [noting similarity between Props. 36 and 47].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In <em>Davis, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th 127, review granted, Division One of this court concluded \u2018\u201csentence\u201d as used in section 1170.18 can reasonably be understood to refer both to, as appellant argues, a term of confinement, or \u2018\u201cmore generally\u201d to a \u201ccriminal sanction, whether by probation, prison term, or otherwise.\u201d <em>(Davis, </em>at p. 139.) Under the broader construction of the term, the phrase \u201c \u2018serving a sentence\u2019 \u201d in section 1170.18 \u201ccan be interpreted to mean, in effect, \u2018currently subject to judicially imposed sanction\u2019 as a result of a felony conviction.\u201d <em>(Davis, </em>at p. 139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In a different statutory context, the Sixth District also recently impliedly concluded the word \u201csentence\u201d is ambiguous. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Santa Ana </em>(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1123 [203 Cal.Rptr.3d 60], the court applied section 2900.5, regarding credit awards for time in custody. The court interpreted language in section 2900.5, subdivision (b) that, \u201c[cjredit shall be given only once for a single period of custody attributable to multiple offenses for which a consecutive sentence is imposed.\u201d The court considered whether the \u201cword \u2018sentence\u2019 . . . included a jail term imposed as a condition of probation.\u201d <em>(Santa Ana, </em>at p. 1142.) The defendant in that case argued it did not, contending the word encompassed only \u201cimposition of punishment on the offenses of conviction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1142-1143.) The <em>Santa Ana </em>court observed that \u201cthe word \u2018sentence\u2019 is sometimes used in regard to a grant of probation or the imposition of a jail term as a condition of probation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1143.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Ultimately, the court concluded the purposes of the statute supported construing \u201csentence\u201d as used in section 2900.5, subdivision (b), to include a jail term imposed as part of a grant of probation. <em>(Santa Ana, </em>at p. 1142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In arguing he was not \u201cserving a sentence\u201d within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a), appellant first emphasizes that probation is defined as <em>not </em>involving the imposition and/or execution of a \u201csentence.\u201d (\u00a7 1203, subd. (a) [defining \u201cprobation\u201d as \u201cthe suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence and the order of conditional and revocable release in the community under the supervision of a probation officer.\u201d]) Appellant then emphasizes various other words, phrases, and provisions in section 1170.18 that make most sense as applied to persons sentenced to prison. For example, section 1170.18, subdivision (a) directs that the petition should be filed \u201cbefore the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction.\u201d Appellant points out that an order imposing probation is generally not considered a judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1081, 1092 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 946 P.2d 828] [\u201cProbation is neither \u2018punishment\u2019 (see \u00a7 15) nor a criminal \u2018judgment\u2019 (see \u00a7 1445)\u201d].) Appellant also focuses on the reference in section 1170.18, subdivision (a) to \u201crecall of sentence.\u201d He argues it is unnecessary to \u201crecall\u201d an order of probation because the court retains continuing jurisdiction over a probationer. (Compare <em>Howard, </em>at p. 1089 [\u201cgenerally a trial court lacks jurisdiction to resentence a criminal defendant after execution of sentence has begun\u201d] with <em>People </em>v. <em>Feyrer </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 426, 440 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 518, 226 P.3d 998] [\u201cthe probation statutes confer upon the trial court jurisdiction and authority over a defendant during the term of probation\u201d].) Appellant also points out that section 1170.18 is located in a portion of the Penal Code (pt. 2, tit. 7, ch. 4.5) devoted to procedures for fixing prison sentences. Finally, appellant emphasizes section 1170.18, subdivision (d), which mandates that a resentenced person \u201cshall be subject to parole for one year following completion of his or her sentence, unless the court, in its discretion, as part of its resentencing order, releases the person from parole.\u201d Appellant points out that parole is intended to aid the transition of persons from imprisonment, not following a period of probation. (See \u00a7 3000, subd. (a)(1) [declaring regarding parole that \u201cthe period immediately following incarceration is critical to successful reintegration of the offender into society and to positive citizenship\u201d].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Appellant\u2019s statutory interpretation arguments are thoughtful and substantial. However, they do not compel a conclusion that a person placed on probation with imposition of sentence suspended is not \u201cserving a sentence\u201d within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a). We agree with <em>Santa </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>Ana </em>s general observation that the word \u201csentence\u201d does not have a \u201cuniversal meaning in all contexts\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Santa Ana, supra, </em>247 Cal.App.4th at p. 1143), and we agree with the more specific conclusions of the <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Davis </em>decisions that \u201csentence\u201d is ambiguous as used in section 1170.18, subdivision (a). Appellant\u2019s arguments support his interpretation of the statutory language, but the lingering ambiguity in the phrase \u201cserving a sentence\u201d requires this court to also consider, in determining the voters\u2019 intent, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet\u201d \u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018the ostensible objects to be achieved\u2019 \u201d by Proposition 47. <em>(Cervantes, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">B. <em>The Ballot Materials and Purposes of the Enactment Support Construing \u201cServing a Sentence\u2019\u2019 to Encompass Probationers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">As it happens, the Proposition 47 ballot analysis provides powerful support for a conclusion that voters intended that probationers follow the section 1170.18 procedures. The Attorney General\u2019s brief summary of Proposition 47 in the Ballot Pamphlet does not provide any guidance, stating on the topic only that the proposition \u201c[rjequires resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for [covered] offenses unless [the] court finds [an] unreasonable public safety risk.\u201d (Ballot Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>Official Title and Summary of Prop. 47, p. 34.) The Legislative Analyst\u2019s more detailed analysis is, on the other hand, very helpful. The analysis begins with a \u201cBackground\u201d section that explains the difference between felonies, misdemeanors, and infractions. <em>{Id., </em>analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 34.) Next, still within the \u201cBackground\u201d and on the first page of the ballot materials for the proposition, there is a heading entitled \u201cFelony Sentencing\u201d that identifies \u201cState Prison\u201d and \u201cCounty Jail and Community Supervision\u201d as the two ways \u201c[offenders convicted of felonies can be <em>sentenced.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added &amp; omitted; see also <em>Garcia, supra, </em>245 Cal.App.4th at p. 558 [relying on same language].) Under the subheading for \u201cCounty Jail and Community Supervision,\u201d also still on the first page, the analysis states, \u201cFelony offenders who have no current or prior convictions for serious, violent, or sex offenses are typically <em>sentenced to </em>county jail or the supervision of a county probation officer in the community, or both. In addition, depending on the discretion of the judge and what crime was committed, some offenders who have current or prior convictions for serious, violent, or sex offenses can receive similar <em>sentences.\u201d </em>(Ballot Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 34, italics added &amp; omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Other portions of the ballot analysis also suggest that imposition of probation constitutes a sentence under Proposition 47. The analysis states that misdemeanor offenders \u201cmay be sentenced to county jail, county community supervision, a fine, or some combination of the three.\u201d (Ballot Pamphlet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, pp. 34-35.) The analysis states that under Proposition 47 \u201cthe length of sentences\u2014jail time and/or community supervision\u2014would be less.\u201d (Ballot Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 36.) In discussing the fiscal effects of the proposition, the analysis states, \u201cit is uncertain whether such offenders would be sentenced to jail or community supervision and for how long.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The analysis also predicts a reduction in \u201ccounty community supervision populations . . . because offenders would likely spend less time under such supervision if they were sentenced for a misdemeanor instead of a felony. Thus, county probation departments could experience a reduction in their caseloads.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Accordingly, although portions of section 1170.18, subdivision (a) contain language most suited to persons serving a prison term, the Proposition 47 ballot materials leave little doubt the voters understood that both prison terms and probation (usually referred to as \u201ccommunity supervision\u201d) were possible \u201csentences\u201d for the offenses within the scope of the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">This conclusion is also consistent with the objectives of the enactment. <em>(Cervantes, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1014 [courts \u201c\u2018 \u201cselect the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u201d \u2019 \u201d].) Section 1170.18, subdivision (k) retains the firearm prohibition for those sentenced before the proposition\u2019s enactment. Including persons sentenced to probation within the scope of section 1170.18 serves the apparent purpose of preserving the expectations of the parties at the time of conviction regarding the applicability of the firearm restriction. A clear logical distinction can be made between persons who have already suffered felony convictions for crimes declared to be misdemeanors by the enactment, and persons convicted of the subject offenses after the enactment\u2019s effective date. With respect to the latter group, prosecutors are aware at the time charging decisions are made or plea bargains are reached that the defendants are pleading to misdemeanors and will not be subject to the consequences that flow from a felony conviction, such as the prohibition on possessing a firearm. On the other hand, with respect to the former group, at the time charging decisions were made or plea bargains were reached prosecutors believed the defendants <em>would </em>be subject to the consequences that flow from a felony conviction. Appellant identifies no compelling reason why it would be logical to exempt defendants sentenced to probation from the firearm possession restriction, given the possibility that prosecutors might have made different charging or plea bargaining decisions had they known the defendants would not be subject to a felony conviction. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1333-1334 [174 Cal.Rptr.3d 499] [in construing Prop. 36, considering prosecutor\u2019s preenactment incentives with respect to charging decisions].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Moreover, appellant\u2019s construction excluding probationers from the scope of the section 1170.18 procedures might lead to the absurd result of making persons placed on probation who completed their sentences worse off than persons who completed prison sentences. That is because section 1170.18 provides that persons who have completed felony \u201csentence[s]\u201d for offenses that would now be misdemeanors under Proposition 47 \u201cmay file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the felony conviction or convictions designated as misdemeanors.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (1).) That appears to be broader relief than available under <em>Estrada, </em>because the retroactivity under that decision does not extend to persons subject to final judgments\u2014persons who have completed their sentences and exhausted any appeals. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Vieira </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 264, 305-306 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 337, 106 P.3d 990]; see also <em>Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 745 [\u201cThe amendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not final.\u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Thus, under appellant\u2019s interpretation of \u201csentence\u201d as used in section 1170.18, a person currently on probation could obtain relief under <em>Estrada, </em>but a person who <em>successfully completed </em>a term of probation could not have his conviction designated a misdemeanor under section 1170.18 or, it appears, <em>Estrada. </em>It would be illogical to conclude the electorate intended to enact a scheme under which persons sentenced to prison could have their convictions designated as misdemeanors under section 1170.18 (either while still in prison or following completion of a prison sentence) and persons currently on probation could have their convictions reduced under <em>Estrada, </em>but persons who completed a term of probation would be excluded from the benefits of Proposition 47. Appellant suggests no reason why the voters would have intended to leave that group without a remedy. (See Couzens et al., Sentencing Cal. Crimes, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25:13 [\u201cit would be anomalous for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>enactors to intend to benefit persons who complete a prison term, but not a defendant who successfully completes the requirements of probation\u201d]; see also <em>Tidwell, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 219 [stated purposes of Prop. 47 support permitting probationers who successfully completed probation and obtained a dismissal under \u00a7 1203.4 to petition for redesignation under \u00a7 1170.18].) As observed in <em>Davis, </em>\u2018\u201cBecause probationers are more likely to be nonviolent offenders and have a limited criminal history, they are ostensibly more \u2018worthy\u2019 of reduction in their crimes and sentences than persons sentenced to a prison term, at least as a general matter.\u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 142, review granted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In arguing his construction does not leave former probationers without a remedy, appellant suggests such a person <em>can </em>obtain relief under <em>Estrada </em>because \u2018\u201can order granting probation is not deemed a judgment that can become final for purposes of the rule.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He relies on the general propositions that an order granting probation is not considered a \u2018\u201cjudgment\u201d for most purposes <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Giron) </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 793, 796 [114 Cal.Rptr. 596, 523 P.2d 636]) and that \u2018\u201cthe expiration of a probationary period does not terminate a court\u2019s fundamental jurisdiction\u201d <em>(People v. Ford </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 282, 287 [187 Cal.Rptr.3d 919, 349 R3d 98]). However, in the cases appellant cites for the proposition that relief under <em>Estrada </em>can be provided after the expiration of a term of probation, the amendments took effect and the requests for relief occurred <em>during </em>the terms of probation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Eagle </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 275, 278-279 [200 Cal.Rptr.3d 773]; <em>In re May </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 165, 167-169 [133 Cal.Rptr. 33].) Appellant does not cite and this court is not aware of any cases granting relief under <em>Estrada </em>to a person who has completed a term of probation before a statutory amendment reducing the penalty. It appears that, under appellant\u2019s view, a criminal proceeding resulting in a successfully completed term of probation is <em>never </em>final for purposes of <em>Estrada, </em>and the former probationer could seek retroactive application of an amendment under <em>Estrada </em>at any time, even if an amendment occurs decades later. But appellant does not explain why the reasoning of <em>Estrada </em>justifies that result.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In any event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>given the lack of clarity whether a former probationer may obtain relief under <em>Estrada, </em>we cannot assume the electorate relied on the availability of that relief and, therefore, intended to exclude probationers from the section 1170.18 redesignation procedures. That is, given that the voters must have intended that persons placed on probation would benefit from redesignation of offenses under Proposition 47, it is illogical to conclude the voters would have relied on <em>uncertain </em>relief under <em>Estrada </em>to provide those benefits to persons who have successfully completed a term of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">\u201cLiberally construing\u201d Proposition 47 \u201cto effectuate its purposes\u201d (Prop. 47, \u00a7 18, as approved by voters, Gen.
