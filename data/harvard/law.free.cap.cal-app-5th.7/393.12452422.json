By petition for writ of habeas corpus, Petitioner challenged his sentence of 125 years to life in prison. Petitioner, who was 17 years old when he committed the crimes, contended his sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(2012) 567 U.S. 460 [183 L.Ed.2d 407, 132 S.Ct. 2455] (Miller) and, as relief, asked to be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">In <em>In re Cook </em>(Apr. 6, 2016, G050907) (nonpub. opn.) <em>(Cook), </em>we denied Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. We concluded, based on <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(2016) 577 U.S._[136 S.Ct. 718, 193 L.Ed.2d 599], that <em>Miller </em>applied retroactively to cases on collateral review but that recently enacted Penal Code sections 3051 and 4801 had the effect of curing the unconstitutional sentence imposed on Petitioner. <em>(Cook, supra, </em>G050907.) In July 2016, the California Supreme Court granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for review of our opinion and transferred the matter to this court with directions to vacate our decision and consider, in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>(2016) 63 Cal.4th 261, 268-269, 283-284 [202 Cal.Rptr.3d 496, 370 P.3d 1053] <em>(Franklin), </em>\u201cwhether petitioner is entitled to make a record before the superior court of \u2018mitigating evidence tied to his youth.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The petition is granted insofar as the relief sought in the prayer of Petitioner\u2019s supplemental opening brief seeks a hearing to allow Petitioner to make a record of mitigating evidence tied to his youth at the time of the offense. The matter is remanded with directions to the trial court to grant Petitioner a hearing at which he can make a record of such mitigating evidence. In doing so, we hold that the relief afforded by <em>Franklin </em>is available by both direct review and petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">In December 2003, Petitioner and Rufus Raymond Shaw shot and killed Odrum Nader Brooks and his son, Demarcus T. Brooks, while the latter two sat in an automobile. Petitioner was 17 years old at the time. In 2007, a jury convicted Petitioner of two counts of first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)) and one count of attempted murder <em>{id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a)), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>and found true the allegations that Petitioner personally and intentionally discharged a firearm <em>{id., </em>\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (c)) and personally and intentionally discharged a firearm proximately causing great bodily injury <em>(id.. </em>\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The trial court sentenced Petitioner to an indeterminate term of life with the possibility of parole for the attempted murder, plus five consecutive indeterminate terms of 25 years to life for murder and discharging a firearm, for a total sentence of 125 years to life. The convictions and sentence were affirmed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaw and Cook, supra, </em>G041439.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In 2014, Petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court in which he had been convicted. The superior court denied the petition without an evidentiary hearing in September 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">One month later, Petitioner, who was self-represented at the time, filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Court of Appeal. He sought relief based on <em>Miller, supra, </em>567 U.S. 460 [132 S.Ct. 2455]. Counsel was appointed to represent Petitioner, and counsel filed a supplement to the petition for writ of habeas corpus and an appendix of exhibits. We issued an order to show cause, in response to which the Attorney General (Respondent) filed a return. Petitioner filed a traverse, thereby joining the issues for review. In April 2016, we issued our opinion in <em>Cook, supra, </em>G050907, denying the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The California Supreme Court granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for review of our opinion and transferred the matter to this court with directions. Following transfer, Petitioner filed a supplemental opening brief. Respondent did not file a supplemental brief. After we issued an opinion, we received a petition for rehearing from Respondent informing us that Respondent had never been served with Petitioner\u2019s supplemental opening brief and requesting that we accept Respondent\u2019s supplemental brief. We granted Respondent\u2019s petition for rehearing and accepted Respondent\u2019s supplemental brief. Petitioner filed a supplemental responding brief. We have considered the supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">In Light of <em>Franklin, </em>Petitioner Is Entitled to a Hearing to Make a Record of Mitigating Evidence Tied to Youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">We noted in <em>Cook, supra, </em>G050907, it was undisputed that Petitioner\u2019s sentence of 125 years to life was a de facto sentence of life without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>possibility of parole and that, when sentencing Petitioner, the trial court did not consider his age, youthful attributes, and capacity for reform and rehabilitation. We concluded that <em>Miller </em>applies retroactively to matters on collateral review. <em>(Montgomery v. Louisiana, supra, </em>577 U.S._[136 S.Ct. 718].) As a consequence, we concluded, Petitioner\u2019s sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Miller, supra, </em>567 U.S. at page 465 [132 S.Ct. at page 2460] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Caballero </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 262 [145 Cal.Rptr.3d 286, 282 P.3d 291]. <em>(Cook, supra, </em>G050907.) But we were compelled by <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>577 U.S._[136 S.Ct. 718], to conclude that Penal Code section 3051 cured the constitutional error in sentencing by giving Petitioner the right to a parole hearing after serving 25 years of his sentence. <em>(Cook, supra, </em>G050907.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The California Supreme Court\u2019s order granting Petitioner\u2019s petition for review of our opinion transferred the matter to us with directions to vacate our decision and consider, in light of <em>Franklin, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th 261, \u201cwhether [Petitioner is entitled to make a record before the superior court of \u2018mitigating evidence tied to his youth.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Franklin, </em>the defendant was 16 years old when he shot and killed the victim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 269.) A jury convicted the defendant of first degree murder and found true a personal firearm-discharge enhancement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 268.) The defendant was sentenced to two 25-year-to-life sentences, giving him a total sentence of life in state prison with the possibility of parole after 50 years. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The California Supreme Court concluded that Penal Code sections 3051 and 4801 mooted the defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence was unconstitutional because \u201cthose statutes provide [the defendant] with the possibility of release after 25 years of imprisonment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3051, subd. (b)(3)) and require the Board of Parole Hearings (Board) to \u2018give great weight to the diminished culpability of juveniles as compared to adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth and increased maturity\u2019 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 4801, subd. (c)).\u201d <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>at p. 268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The California Supreme Court also concluded, however, that the defendant had raised \u201ccolorable concerns\u201d over \u201cwhether he was given adequate opportunity at sentencing to make a record of mitigating evidence tied to his youth.\u201d <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at pp. 268-269.) The court explained: \u201cThe criteria for parole suitability set forth in Penal Code sections 3051 and 4801 contemplate that the Board\u2019s decisionmaking at [the defendant]\u2019s eventual parole hearing will be informed by youth-related factors, such as his cognitive ability, character, and social and family background at the time of the offense. Because [the defendant] was sentenced before the high court decided <em>Miller </em>and before our Legislature enacted [Penal Code sections 3051 and 4801], the trial court understandably saw no relevance to mitigation evidence at sentencing. In light of the changed legal landscape, we remand this case so that the trial court may determine whether [the defendant] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>afforded sufficient opportunity to make such a record at sentencing. This remand is necessarily limited; as section 3051 contemplates, [the defendant]\u2019s two consecutive 25-year-to-life sentences remain valid, even though the statute has made him eligible for parole during his 25th year of incarceration.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Supreme Court explained that if, after remand, the trial court were to determine the defendant did not have sufficient opportunity to make a record at sentencing, then \u2018\u201cthe court may receive submissions and, if appropriate, testimony pursuant to procedures set forth in [Penal Code] section 1204 and rule 4.437 of the California Rules of Court, and subject to the rules of evidence.\u201d <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 284.) \u2018\u201c[The defendant] may place on the record any documents, evaluations, or testimony (subject to cross-examination) that may be relevant at his eventual youth offender parole hearing, and the prosecution likewise may put on the record any evidence that demonstrates the juvenile offender\u2019s culpability or cognitive maturity, or otherwise bears on the influence of youth-related factors. The goal of any such proceeding is to provide an opportunity for the parties to make an accurate record of the juvenile offender\u2019s characteristics and circumstances at the time of the offense so that the Board, years later, may properly discharge its obligation to \u2018give great weight to\u2019 youth-related factors ([Pen. Code,] \u00a7 4801, subd. (c)) in determining whether the offender is \u2018fit to rejoin society\u2019 despite having committed a serious crime \u2018while he was a child in the eyes of the law\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In this case, Petitioner asserts, \u2018\u201cthe record of [his] characteristics and circumstances at the time of the offense is bare bones at best, with the probation officer\u2019s report consisting of less than a half page of \u2018personal history\u2019; as opposed to ensuring a full and accurate record, the report noted that the information in that personal history section was \u2018not independently verified.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We agree with Petitioner. In <em>Franklin, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at page 284, it was \u2018\u201cnot clear\u201d whether the defendant \u2018\u201chad sufficient opportunity to put on the record the kinds of information that [Penal Code] sections 3051 and 4801 deem relevant at a youth offender parole hearing.\u201d Here, in contrast, it is clear that Petitioner was <em>not given </em>sufficient opportunity to make such a record. Petitioner\u2019s sentence was imposed before the decision in <em>Miller </em>and before enactment of Penal Code sections 3051 and 4801. We noted in <em>Cook, </em>that the trial court, when sentencing Petitioner, did not consider his age, youthful attributes, and capacity for reform and rehabilitation. <em>(Cook, supra, </em>G050907.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Thus, rather than direct the trial court to make the determination whether Petitioner had sufficient opportunity at sentencing to make a record of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u201cinformation that will be relevant to the Board as it fulfills its statutory obligations under [Penal Code] sections 3051 and 4801\u201d <em>(Franklin, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at pp. 286-287), we will direct the trial court to conduct a hearing at which Petitioner will have the opportunity to make such a record.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Relief Under <em>Franklin </em>Is Available on Habeas Corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Respondent asserts that relief by writ of habeas corpus is unavailable to Petitioner because he is not challenging the legality of his restraint. Respondent argues: \u201c[H]abeas corpus has traditionally been limited to providing a forum for challenges to a custodian\u2019s legal authority to hold a petitioner in custody or otherwise restrain his liberty or to the manner in which the petitioner is confined. It has not been used as a procedural mechanism for reopening or supplementing otherwise closed proceedings for any less fundamental purpose.\u201d The relief offered by <em>Franklin </em>is, according to Respondent, available only by direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The California Supreme Court\u2019s order directing us to reconsider the matter in light of <em>Franklin </em>strongly suggests the Supreme Court recognizes that the relief afforded by that opinion is available by habeas corpus. Otherwise, it seems, the Supreme Court would have denied Petitioner\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">In any event, Respondent takes an overly narrow view of the scope of the writ of habeas corpus. A previously convicted defendant may obtain relief by habeas corpus when changes in case law expanding a defendant\u2019s rights are given retroactive effect. (E.g., <em>In re Cortez </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 78, 82-83 [98 Cal.Rptr. 307, 490 P.2d 819] [new California Supreme Court decision justifies habeas corpus relief]; <em>In re Terry </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 911, 916 [95 Cal.Rptr. 31, 484 P.2d 1375] [new United States Supreme Court decision justifies habeas corpus relief]; <em>In re Johnson </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 404, 407-408, 409-410 [90 Cal.Rptr. 569, 475 P.2d 841] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">In <em>Franklin, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at pages 286-287, the California Supreme Court in effect expanded the defendant\u2019s rights by remanding the matter to the Court of Appeal with instructions to remand to the trial court to determine whether the defendant was afforded an adequate opportunity to make a record of information relevant to a future determination under Penal Code sections 3051 and 4801. <em>Franklin </em>thus holds that a defendant has the right at the time of sentencing to present evidence and make a record of information that may be relevant at the eventual youth offender parole hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Changes in case law customarily are fully retroactive. <em>(People v. Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 136 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073]; <em>Evangelatos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1207 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585].) There is an exception to the rule of retroactivity when a judicial opinion changes a settled rule on which the parties had relied. <em>(Claxton </em>v. <em>Waters </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 367, 378 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 246, 96 P.3d 496].) In that situation, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[considerations of fairness and public policy may require that a decision be given only prospective application.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) Franklin </em>did not change any settled rule on which the parties to this case relied in the trial court or on appeal. Nothing in <em>Franklin </em>suggests the California Supreme Court intended it to be excepted from the rule of full retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">As the deprivation of the rights granted by <em>Franklin </em>is cognizable on habeas corpus, we have inherent power to fashion the appropriate remedy <em>(In re Crow </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 613, 619-620, fn. 7 [94 Cal.Rptr. 254, 483 P.2d 1206]) with consideration toward factors of justice and equity <em>(In re Harris </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 813, 851 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 373, 855 P.2d 391]). The appropriate remedy, we have concluded, is to remand the matter to the trial court with directions to conduct a hearing at which Petitioner will have the opportunity to make such a record.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Respondent argues that Petitioner should not be afforded habeas corpus relief because, as a practical matter, a hearing conducted 13 years after the commission of the offenses and more than nine years after original sentencing would not be \u2018\u201can efficient or effective way of seeking to augment the existing sentencing record with any further evidence of [Petitioner]\u2019s particular characteristics as a youthful offender in 2003.\u201d According to Respondent, there is no guarantee the original sentencing judge will be available to conduct the hearing, and the parties likely will have to be represented by new defense counsel or prosecutors who might have no familiarity with the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The issues identified by Respondent are inherent in the remedy afforded by <em>Franklin, </em>whether granted by direct appeal or collateral challenge. We take judicial notice of the Court of Appeal docket in <em>People </em>v. <em>Franklin,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which shows that nearly four years elapsed from the date the notice of appeal was lodged (June 5, 2012) to the date on which the Supreme Court issued its opinion (May 26, 2016). Thus, when the court in <em>Franklin </em>remanded the matter for a determination whether the defendant had had the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>make a record of youth-related factors, it did so with the knowledge and understanding that such determination and any evidentiary hearing would be conducted more than four years after the date of original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">As explained in <em>Franklin, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at page 269, the criteria for parole suitability in Penal Code sections 3051 and 4801 \u201ccontemplate that the Board\u2019s decisionmaking at [the defendant]\u2019s eventual parole hearing will be informed by youth-related factors, such as his cognitive ability, character, and social and family background at the time of the offense.\u201d It would be most effective to make a record of those youth-related factors as near in time as possible to the date of original sentencing. Nine years after original sentencing is far from ideal, but it is better than the 15th, 20th, or 25th year of incarceration, which are the possible times for the youth offender parole hearing. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3051, subd. (b)(1), (2) &amp; (3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The petition for writ of habeas corpus is granted insofar as it challenges Petitioner\u2019s sentence of 125 years to life without affording Petitioner the opportunity to make a record of mitigating evidence tied to his youth at the time the offense was committed. The matter is remanded with directions to the trial court to conduct a hearing at which Petitioner has the opportunity to make a record of such mitigating evidence. The hearing must be conducted no later than 90 days from the date this opinion is final in this court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-8\">O\u2019Leary, P.
