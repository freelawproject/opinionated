Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.) were eligible for reimbursement. Fifteen years later, at the request of the Department of Finance (DOF), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Commission revisited that decision based on the passage of Proposition 83 in 2006. The Commission concluded that six of the duties it deemed state mandated in 1998 were instead mandated by the ballot initiative and, therefore, the costs of those activities to local governments were no longer eligible for reimbursement. The Counties of San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Sacramento and San Bernardino (Counties) challenged the Commission\u2019s decision by filing a petition for writ of administrative mandamus in San Diego County Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The Counties now appeal the trial court\u2019s judgment upholding the Commission\u2019s decision. Our review of the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions lead us to reach the opposite conclusion. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and direct the court to modify its judgment to issue a writ of mandate directing the Commission to set aside the decisions challenged in this action and reconsider the DOF\u2019s request in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">A. <em>Constitutional Subvention Requirement and Implementing Legislation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">When the Legislature mandates a new program or higher level of service on a local government, the state is constitutionally required to reimburse the locality for the costs of the mandate. (Cal. Const., art. XIII B, \u00a7 6, subd. (a).) This requirement was the result of the passage of two related ballot initiatives, Proposition 13 in 1978 and Proposition 4 in 1979. Proposition 13 added article XIII A to the Constitution, which was \u201caimed at controlling ad valorem property taxes and the imposition of new \u2018special taxes\u2019 \u201d on the citizens of California. <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 482, 486 [280 Cal.Rptr. 92, 808 P.2d 235] <em>(County of Fresno).) </em>Proposition 4 added article XIII B, placing \u201climitations on the ability of both state and local governments to appropriate funds for expenditures.\u201d <em>(County of Fresno, </em>at p. 486.) \u201c \u2018Articles XIII A and XIII B work in tandem, together restricting California governments\u2019 power both to levy and to spend [taxes] for public purposes.\u2019 <em>(City of Sacramento </em>[v. <em>State of California </em>(1990)] 50 Cal.3d [51,] 59, fn. 1 [266 Cal.Rptr. 139, 785 P.2d 522].)\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The initiatives\u2019 goals \u201cwere to protect residents from excessive taxation and government spending.\u201d <em>(County of Los Angeles v. State of California </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 46, 61 [233 Cal.Rptr. 38, 729 P.2d 202] <em>(County of Los Angeles).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Section 6 of article XIII B of the State Constitution (article XIII B, section 6) \u201chad the additional purpose of precluding a shift of financial responsibility for carrying out governmental functions from the state to local agencies which had had their taxing powers restricted by the enactment of article XIIIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>in the preceding year and were ill equipped to take responsibility for any new programs.\u201d <em>(County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 61; see <em>Department of Finance v. Commission on State Mandates </em>(2016) 1 Cal.5th 749, 758-759 [207 Cal.Rptr.3d 44, 378 P.3d 356] <em>(Department of Finance).) </em>Section 6 \u2018\u201cwas designed to protect the tax revenues of local governments from state mandates that would require expenditure of such revenues.\u201d <em>(County of Fresno, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 487.) The provision states \u2018\u201c[wjhenever the Legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government, the State shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse that local government for the costs of the program or increased level of service . . . .\u201d (Art. XIII B, \u00a7 6, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u201cIn 1984, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive statutory and administrative scheme for implementing article XIII B, section 6. ([Gov. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] \u00a7 17500 et seq.; [citations].) In so doing, the Legislature created the Commission ... to resolve questions as to whether a statute imposes \u2018state-mandated costs on a local agency within the meaning of section 6.' \u201d <em>(California School Bds. Assn. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 770, 780 [121 Cal.Rptr.3d 696].) The legislation directs \u201cthe Commission not to find local government costs reimbursable if, among other things, \u2018[t]he statute or executive order imposed duties which were expressly included in a ballot measure approved by the voters in a statewide election\u2019 (ballot measure mandates).\u201d <em>(California School Boards Assn. v. State of California </em>(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1183, 1191 [90 Cal.Rptr.3d 501] <em>(California School Boards).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Under this regulatory scheme, when the Legislature enacts a statute imposing obligations on a local agency or a school district without providing additional funding, the local entity may file a test claim with the Commission. (\u00a7\u00a7 17551, 17555.) After a public hearing, the Commission must then determine whether the statute requires a new program or increased level of service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u00a7\u00a7 17551, 17555.) \u201cIf the Commission determines the statute meets this criterion, [it] must determine the cost of the mandated program or service and then notify specified legislative entities and executive officers of this decision. (\u00a7\u00a7 17557, 17555.)\u201d <em>California School Bds. Assn. v. State of California, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.4th at p. 781.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Multiple claimants may join together to pursue a test claim, and the Commission\u2019s decision applies statewide to all similarly situated local agencies or school districts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 1183.1.) A test claim is the \u201cexclusive procedure\u201d for claiming and obtaining reimbursement for costs mandated by the state. (\u00a7 17552.) \u201cA local agency or school district may challenge the Commission\u2019s findings by administrative mandate proceedings. (\u00a7 17559; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.)\u201d <em>(California School Bds. Assn. v. State of California, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.4th at p. 781.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The statutory scheme implementing article XIII B, section 6 also provided \u201cthat if the Legislature identifies a particular mandate in the Budget Act as one for which reimbursement is not provided for that fiscal year, the local agencies are not required to comply with the mandate during that year. [\u00b6] For a number of years, the Legislature chose not to fund certain mandates, but did not identify the mandates in the Budget Act as those for which no reimbursement would be provided. Instead, the Legislature funded the mandates in the token amount of $1,000. This had the effect of <em>not </em>automatically suspending the operation of the mandates, but leaving them virtually unfunded. [Fn. omitted.] Local agencies advanced considerable funds complying with drastically underfunded mandates, with the expectation of ultimately obtaining reimbursement from the state.\u201d <em>(California School Bds. Assn. v. Brown </em>(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1507, 1512-1513 [122 Cal.Rptr.3d 674].)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">This issue led to the passage of Proposition 1A in November 2004, which, \u201camong other things[, added] section 6, subdivision (b) to . . . article XIII B. That subdivision provides that, for every fiscal year, \u2018for a mandate for which the costs of a local government claimant have been determined in a preceding fiscal year to be payable by the State pursuant to law, the Legislature shall either appropriate, in the annual Budget Act, the full payable amount that has not been previously paid, or suspend the operation of the mandate for the fiscal year for which the annual Budget Act is applicable in a manner prescribed by law.\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. XIII B, \u00a7 6, subd. (b)(1).) . . . Thus, with respect to a reimbursable mandate, for each fiscal year, the Legislature is required to choose to either fully fund the annual payment toward the arrearage or suspend the operation of the mandate.\u201d <em>(California School Bds. Assn. v. Brown, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1513-1514.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">B. <em>Sexually Violent Predators Act and Initial Test Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The SVPA, enacted in 1995, established commitment procedures for the civil detention and treatment of sexually violent predators (SVPs) after the completion of criminal sentences for certain sex-related offenses. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6600-6608.) The law outlines the qualifications for commitment under the SVPA and specifies the due process protections afforded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the identified offender. If an offender meets the criteria, he or she must undergo an evaluation by the State Department of State Hospitals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(3).) Before civil detention and treatment are imposed, the law requires county counsel or a district attorney to file a petition for civil commitment in superior court. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601.) A probable cause hearing (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6602), followed by a jury trial, is then conducted to determine beyond a reasonable doubt if the person is an SVP. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6602-6603.) If the person alleged to be an SVP is indigent, the county must provide him or her with the assistance of counsel and experts necessary to prepare a defense to the commitment petition at both the probable cause hearing and trial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">After the SVPA was enacted, the County of Los Angeles brought a test claim seeking reimbursement of the costs incurred by local governments in complying with the duties imposed by the SVPA. On June 25, 1998, the Commission adopted a statement of decision approving reimbursement for those costs. In its decision, the Commission \u201cconcluded that the test claim legislation^ identified by the claimants as Welfare and Institutions Code sections 6250 and 6600 through 6608,] impose[d] a new program or higher level of service upon local agencies within the meaning of article XIII B, section 6, of the California Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The statement of decision specified eight activities the Commission approved for reimbursement and identified the specific Welfare and Institutions Code provisions from which it determined each activity arose: \u201c[(1)] Designation by the County Board of Supervisors of the appropriate District Attorney or County Counsel who will be responsible for the sexually violent predator civil commitment proceedings. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subd. (i).) [\u00b6] [(2)] Initial review of reports and records by the county\u2019s designated counsel to determine if the county concurs with the state\u2019s recommendation. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subd. (i).) [\u00b6] [(3)] Preparation and filing of the petition for commitment by the county\u2019s designated counsel. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subd. ([i]).)[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] [\u00b6] [(4)] Preparation and attendance by the county\u2019s designated counsel and indigent defense counsel at the probable cause hearing. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6602.) [\u00b6] [(5)] Preparation and attendance by the county\u2019s designated counsel and indigent defense counsel at trial. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6603 [&amp;] 6604.) [\u00b6] [(6)] Preparation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>and attendance by the county\u2019s designated counsel and indigent defense counsel at subsequent hearings regarding the condition of the sexually violent predator. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6605, subds. (b)[-](d) [&amp;] 6608, subds. (a)[-](d).) [\u00b6] [(7)] Retention of necessary experts, investigators, and professionals for preparation for trial and subsequent hearings regarding the condition of the sexually violent predator. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6603 [&amp;] 6605, subd. (d).) [\u00b6] [(8)] Transportation and housing for each potential sexually violent predator at a secured facility while the individual awaits trial on the issue of whether he or she is a sexually violent predator. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6602.)\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The decision denied the test claim with respect to the remaining Welfare and Institutions Code provisions that make up the SVPA, concluding those provisions \u201cdo not impose reimbursable state mandated activities upon local agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">C. <em>Subsequent Changes to the SVPA and Proposition 83</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">On June 30, 2006, the Secretary of State announced that Proposition 83, also known as Jessica\u2019s Law, had qualified for the ballot for the November 7, 2006 General Election. The intent of the initiative, as set forth in section 2, subdivision (h) of the measure, was to \u201ctake additional steps to monitor sex offenders, to protect the public from them, and to provide adequate penalties for and safeguards against sex offenders, particularly those who prey on children.\u201d (Prop. 83, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006).) The focus of the initiative was to amend provisions of the Penal Code to \u201c[i]ncrease[] penalties for violent and habitual sex offenders and child molesters\u201d and to prevent such offenders from residing within close proximity of schools and parks. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 8, official title and summary.) The measure also called for lifetime Global Positioning System monitoring of registered felony sex offenders. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">With respect to the SVPA, the measure\u2019s introductory language stated that \u201c|c|xisting laws that provide for the commitment and control of sexually violent predators must be strengthened and improved.\u201d (Prop. 83, \u00a7 2, subd. (h).) Section 2, subdivision (k) of the initiative stated \u201cCalifornia is the only state, of the number of states that have enacted laws allowing involuntary civil commitments for persons identified as sexually violent predators, which does not provide for indeterminate commitments. California automatically allows for a jury trial every two years irrespective of whether there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>any evidence to suggest or prove that the committed person is no longer a sexually violent predator. As such, this act allows California to protect the civil rights of those persons committed as a sexually violent predator while at the same time protect society and the system from unnecessary or frivolous jury trial actions where there is no competent evidence to suggest a change in the committed person.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The proposition proposed changes to three of the SVPA provisions identified by the Commission as a basis for the state-mandated duties. The measure would amend Welfare and Institutions Code section 6604 so that SVPs would be committed for an indeterminate term, rather than a two-year term that could be extended with a court order. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006) text of Prop. 83, p. 137 (hereafter Pamphlet) [\u00a7 6604].) The proposition would amend Welfare and Institutions Code section 6605, subdivision (b), to require the DMH to deem an SVP\u2019s condition changed before he or she could petition the court for conditional release or unconditional discharge. (Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>at p. 137 [\u00a7 6605].) Before the measure passed, the statute required annual notice to the person of his or her right to petition and an annual examination of the person\u2019s mental condition by the DMH. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Finally, the proposition proposed a minor amendment to Welfare and Institutions Code section 6608. The existing provision stated a committed person could petition for \u2018\u201cconditional release <em>and subsequent . . </em>. unconditional discharge,\u201d and Proposition 83 amended the sentence to state that a committed person could petition for \u2018\u201cconditional release <em>... or an </em>unconditional discharge.\u201d (Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>at p. 138, italics added, strikethrough omitted [\u00a7 6608].)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The ballot initiative also proposed to amend provisions of the SVPA that were excluded by the Commission as a basis for the state mandate. The measure expanded the definition of SVP to include persons convicted of a sexually violent offense against only one victim. (Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 83, p. 135 [\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1)].) Prior to the initiative, the law required the person to be convicted of offenses against two or more victims. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The measure also removed the limitation on the number of juvenile adjudications that count as a sexually violent offense (the existing law was limited to one). (Pamphlet, at pp. 135-136 [\u00a7 6600, subds. (a)(1) &amp; (g)].) Finally, the measure amended Welfare and Institutions Code section 6601, subdivision (k), so that any parole imposed on a person deemed an SVP runs consecutive to, rather than simultaneously with, a civil commitment. (Pamphlet, at p. 137 [\u00a7 6601, subd. (k)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Proposition 83 also contained a provision to limit the Fegislature\u2019s ability to weaken or repeal any change made by the measure: \u2018\u201cThe provisions of this act shall not be amended by the Fegislature except by a statute passed in each house by rollcall vote entered in the journal, two-thirds of the membership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>each house concurring, or by a statute that becomes effective only when approved by the voters. However, the Legislature may amend the provisions of this act to expand the scope of their application or to increase the punishments or penalties provided herein by a statute passed by majority vote of each house thereof.\u201d (Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 83, p. 138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">As required by the Election Code, in September 2006 the Director of the DOF and the Legislative Analyst provided a joint letter to the Attorney General outlining the expected changes in revenues and costs associated with Proposition 83.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to the costs specifically related to changes to the SVPA, the analysis stated \u2018\u201cthe measure is likely to result in an increase in state operating costs in the tens of millions of dollars annually to (1) conduct preliminary screenings of additional sex offenders referred to the DMH by [the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation] for an SVP commitment, (2) complete full evaluations by psychiatrists or psychologists to ascertain the mental condition of criminal offenders being further considered for an SVP commitment, (3) provide court testimony in SVP commitment proceedings, and (4) reimburse counties for their costs for participation in the SVP commitment process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The analysis noted some of the costs would be offset by the longer prison sentences imposed on persons convicted of sexually violent offenses, but concluded that \u2018\u201cthe SVP-related provisions of th[e] measure could result in a net increase in state operating costs of at least $100 million after a few years.\u201d The Pamphlet informed voters that the <em>state\u2019s </em>costs related to sexually violent predator commitments would likely increase, stating \u201con balance the operating and capital outlay costs to the state are likely to be substantially greater than the savings.\u201d (Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 83 by Legis. Analyst, p. 45.) The material provided to voters did not identify any new costs to be imposed on local governments as a result of the referendum, and contained no indication that costs to local governments subsidized by the state would or could be shifted to local governments as a result of the initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">As the initiative was in the process of reaching the ballot, the Legislature was simultaneously working on changes to the laws relating to sex offenders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>On January 9, 2006, Senate Bill No. 1128 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) was introduced to enact \u201cthe Sex Offender Punishment, Control, and Containment Act of 2006, a comprehensive strategy to protect California communities from sex offenders.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 1128 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) 6 Stats. 2006, Summary Dig., p. 180.) The bill was approved by the Legislature on August 31, 2006, as urgency legislation and became effective on September 20, 2006. (Sen. Bill No. 1128 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.), chaptered as Stats. 2006, ch. 337, p. 2584.) The legislation contained some, but not all, of the changes to the SVPA presented in Proposition 83. It did not amend the law to include SVPs who only committed crimes against one victim, or remove the limit on the number of juvenile offenses available to be considered as a basis for a civil commitment. (Sen. Bill No. 1128 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 53, chaptered as Stats. 2006, ch. 337, \u00a7 53, p. 2660.) Senate Bill No. 1128 did provide for tolling of the term of parole while the SVP was civilly committed and for indeterminate commitments, rather than two-year terms. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">On November 7, 2006, the voters approved Proposition 83, which became effective immediately. The initiative overrode the amendments made to the Welfare and Institutions Code by Senate Bill No. 1128 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">D. <em>Redetermination of Earlier Test Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The year before the passage of Proposition 83, the Legislature enacted Assembly Bill No. 138 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) amending section 17556 to direct the Commission to \u201c \u2018set-aside\u2019 some of its test claim decisions and to \u2018reconsider\u2019 other test claim decisions. (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 138 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.).)\u201d <em>(California School Boards, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at p. 1191.) In <em>California School Boards </em>the court determined that amendment to section 17556 was invalid on the grounds that its direction to the Commission to revisit specific earlier decisions was a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. <em>(California School Boards, </em>at pp. 1200-1201.) The court held: \u201clike a judicial decision, a quasi-judicial decision of the Commission is not subject to the whim of the Legislature. Only the courts can set aside a specific Commission decision and command the Commission to reconsider.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\"><em>California School Boards </em>did not address whether the Commission had the ability to reconsider a decision on its own, but noted that \u201c[ojver time, any particular decision of the Commission may be rendered obsolete by changes in the law and material circumstances that originally justified the Commission\u2019s decision. While decisions of the Commission are not subject to collateral attack, logic may dictate that they must be subject to some procedure for modification after changes in the law or material circumstances. . . . [\u00b6] In deciding that the Legislature cannot direct, on a case-by-case basis, that a final decision of the Commission be set aside or reconsidered, we do not imply that there is no way to obtain reconsideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of a Commission decision when the law or material circumstances have changed. We only conclude that the Legislature\u2019s attempt to force a reconsideration in this case violated the separation of powers doctrine. Whether the Commission, exercising inherent powers, may agree to reconsider a decision or the Legislature may provide, generally, a process for obtaining reconsideration of a decision is beyond the scope of this opinion.\u201d <em>(California School Boards, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1202-1203, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In 2010, in response to <em>California School Boards, </em>the Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 856 (2009-2010 Reg.

The request asserted that the passage of Proposition 83 constituted a subsequent change in the law under section 17570. The DOF contended that because \u201call of the Welfare and Institutions Code sections of the SVP mandate are either expressly included in Prop 83 or are necessary to implement Prop 83,\u201d the costs incurred by local agencies \u201cto comply with the SVP mandate [are] no longer a cost mandated by the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The DOF asserted that because Welfare and Institutions Code sections 6601, 6604, 6605 and 6608 were amended and reenacted by Proposition 83, \u201cthe voters reenacted the entirety of those sections, \u2018including the portions not amended,\u2019 and therefore the test claim statutes impose duties expressly included in the voter-enacted ballot measure.\u201d The DOF further asserted that \u201cthe remainder of the mandate\u2019s Welfare and Institutions Code sections that were not expressly included in the ballot measure are, nevertheless, necessary to implement the ballot measure.\u201d The Counties of Los Angeles and San Bernardino, the California District Attorneys Association, the California State Associate of Counties, the California Public Defenders\u2019 Association, and several local prosecutors and public defenders opposed the DOF\u2019s request for redetermination.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The opposing agencies and associations argued (1) Proposition 83 did not substantively change any of the statutes that implemented the civil commitment program; (2) the definition of a change in law contained in section 17570 was unconstitutionally vague and violated the separation of powers doctrine; and (3) the DOF was estopped from obtaining a redetermination of the 1998 decision because the ballot materials for Proposition 83 represented that there would be no change in costs to local governments and the DOF had represented to the Attorney General in its analysis of the ballot measure that the costs of the SVP program would remain reimbursable by the state. On July 26, 2013, the Commission adopted its statement of decision rejecting all of the objections to the DOF\u2019s request and concluding the DOF had adequately shown the state\u2019s liability had been modified by Proposition 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The Commission reasoned that \u201c[t]he analysis of whether a subsequent change in the law has occurred turns on whether, under section 17556[, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>subdivision] (f), there are now any costs mandated by the state, where a ballot measure expressly includes some of the same activities as the test claim statutes that were found to impose a reimbursable mandate in [the Commission\u2019s 1998 test claim decision] CSM-4509.\u201d The Commission then found the DOF had made an adequate showing that it had a substantial possibility of prevailing at the second hearing because \u201cthe test claim statutes impose duties that are expressly included in a voter-enacted ballot-measure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">After receiving additional written comments opposing the DOF\u2019s request, and the DOF\u2019s responses to those comments, and after two days of public hearings, on December 6, 2013, the Commission issued a final statement of decision granting the DOF\u2019s request for redetermination and <em>partially </em>approving the DOF\u2019s request to end reimbursement for the activities identified in the 1998 test claim decision. The Commission again rejected the comments of the constituents who opposed the DOF\u2019s petition and found that with two exceptions, the activities previously found to be reimbursable state-mandated costs were no longer reimbursable state mandates. It concluded that the costs of \u201c[p]reparation and attendance by the county\u2019s designated counsel and indigent defense counsel at the probable cause hearing\u201d and \u201c[t]ransportation for each potential sexually violent predator from a secured facility to the probable cause hearing\u201d were neither expressly included in Proposition 83 nor necessary to implement the measure and, therefore, remained state mandated under Welfare and Institutions Code section 6602 and reimbursable.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">On February 28, 2014, the Counties filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus and complaint for declaratory relief under sections 17514 and 17559, subdivision (b) and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1060 in San Diego County Superior Court against the Commission, the State of California, the DOF, and John Chiang in his official capacity as the California State Controller.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Counties sought an order finding (1) the Commission\u2019s July 26, 2013 and December 6, 2013 statements of decision were not supported by substantial evidence and (2) sections 17556, subdivision (1) and 17570 are unconstitutional and, therefore, could not serve as a basis for the Commission\u2019s redetermination of its 1998 statement of decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After briefing and a hearing, on April 24, 2015, the trial court denied the Counties\u2019 requested relief and judgment was entered against them on May 12, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The trial court\u2019s order concluded that the definition of \u201csubsequent change in the law\u201d found in section 17570 did not conflict with article XIII B, section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>6 because the language of the provision \u201ccomports with how state-mandated and voter-approved mandates are funded.\u201d The court, referring to article XIII B, section 6, subdivision (b), reasoned that Proposition 83 constituted a subsequent change in the law because it \u201cchanged the funding dynamic of the SVP Act\u201d by eliminating the Governor\u2019s ability to defund the mandate \u201cthrough [his] line item veto power.\u201d The court further stated, \u201ceven if Prop 83 is construed as a simple reenactment, the effect of voter-approval cannot be ignored as transforming certain requirements of the Act into voter-approved mandates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On appeal, the Counties assert the Commission and the trial court erred in concluding that Proposition 83 constituted a subsequent change in the law that absolved the state of part of its funding liability for the civil commitment procedures created by the SVPA. The Counties also assert that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201csubsequent change in the law\u201d in section 17570 conflicts with the intent and purpose of article XIII B, section 6, subdivision (a) and is unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The Commission and the state respond that because Proposition 83 was approved by the voters and the initiative modified some of the statutory provisions that formed the basis for the Commission\u2019s 1998 statement of decision, the Commission and the trial court correctly found that the source of the mandated costs was now the People, and not the Legislature. They assert section 17570 does not conflict with article XIII B, section 6 precisely because Proposition 83 changed the character of the mandate. The Attorney General also contends the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad because section 17570 contains a clear definition of the phrase \u201csubsequent change in the law\u201d and references the \u201cdefinable sources\u201d of sections 17514 and 17556.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Whether Proposition 83 negated part of the state mandate found by the Commission in 1998 is subject to our independent review. It is a purely a legal question requiring no reliance on disputed facts. <em>(County of San Diego v.

As we explain, we reverse the decision of the trial court and hold that the Commission incorrectly interpreted sections 17556, subdivision (1) and 17570 to find there had been a subsequent change in the law that diminished the state\u2019s liability for the costs identified by the Commission in its 1998 statement of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u201cIn construing any statute, \u2018[w]ell-established rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018We first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.

This exemption for duties imposed by a ballot initiative applies \u201cregardless of whether the statute or executive order was enacted or adopted before or after the date on which the ballot measure was approved by the voters.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Section 17570, subdivision (b) allows the Commission to \u201cadopt a new test claim decision to supersede a previously adopted test claim decision only upon a showing that the state\u2019s liability for that test claim decision pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution has been modified based on a subsequent change in law.\u201d (\u00a7 17570, subd.

A \u201csubsequent change in law\u201d is defined as \u201ca change in law that requires a finding that an incurred cost is a cost mandated by the state, as defined by Section 17514, or is not a cost mandated by the state pursuant to Section 17556 . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 17570, subd.

As the Attorney General states: \u201cThe source of authority that mandates the program or service determines whether the reimbursement requirement under [article XIII B, section 6, subdivision (a)] applies.\u201d (Italics omitted.) Sections 17556 and 17570 do not easily answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>this novel question. We conclude, however, that the interpretation of section 17556, subdivision (f) adopted by the Commission and the trial court is too broad. We adopt a narrow construction of sections 17556, subdivision (f) and 17570 and hold that a ballot initiative that modifies statutes previously found to impose a state mandate only changes the source of the mandate if the initiative changes the duties imposed by the statutes. Under this narrow construction, the source of the SVPA mandate remains the state and the six duties at issue are subject to the Constitution\u2019s subvention requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The Commission may revisit an earlier test claim decision if the state\u2019s liability for that decision has been modified because of a \u201csubsequent change in law.\u201d (\u00a7 17570, subd. (b).) The definition of \u201csubsequent change in law\u201d contained in section 17570, subdivision (a), circularly, refers to sections 17514 and 17556. Sections 17514 and 17556 in turn define, respectively, what constitutes a state-mandated program and what does not. These statutes, however, do not explicitly address how the source of the mandate should be characterized when a statutory provision previously found to impose a state mandate is amended by a ballot initiative. Because the provisions are ambiguous in this regard, we are tasked with adopting a statutory construction that \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018harmonizes the statute[s] internally and with related statutes\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d and that preserves the constitutionality of the statutes. <em>(City of Dana Point </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 170, 195 [158 Cal.Rptr.3d 409]; see <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 186-187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Although Proposition 83 amended the SVPA, the measure did not change any of the duties the law imposed on the Counties and that the Commission found were state mandated. As set forth above, the 1998 statement of decision identified eight duties mandated by the SVPA that imposed costs on the Counties. Those duties can be described as providing legal representation and mental health expertise for both the county and the alleged SVP in commitment proceedings, and providing housing and transportation for the alleged SVP leading up to and during those proceedings. The Commission identified the specific Welfare and Institution Code provisions it determined were the basis for these activities and denied the test claim with respect to the \u201cremaining provisions of the test claim legislation because [those remaining provisions] do not impose reimbursable state mandated activities upon local agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">As discussed, just three of the Welfare and Institution Code provisions the Commission identified as forming the basis for the state-mandated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>activities were modified by Proposition 83.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the initiative made changes to these statutes, critically to our interpretation of section 17556, subdivision (1), the changes were not to the state-mandated duties. Proposition 83 amended Welfare and Institutions Code section 6604 to extend the term of commitment from two years to an indeterminate term.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This provision was identified in the 1998 statement of decision, along with Welfare and Institutions Code section 6603,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as the basis for the Counties\u2019 obligation to designate their own counsel and counsel for indigent offenders to prepare for and attend trial on an SVP petition. Proposition 83 amended Welfare and Institutions Code section 6605, subdivision (b), to require the DMH to deem an SVP\u2019s condition changed before he or she is permitted to petition for release, and amended Welfare and Institutions Code section 6608, subdivision (a), to state that a committed person may petition for a \u201cconditional release ... or an unconditional discharge without the recommendation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>concurrence of the Director of Mental Health.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 83, pp. 137, 138 [\u00a7\u00a7 6605, 6608].) The 1998 statement of decision identified these two subdivisions (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6605, subd. (b) and 6608, subd. (a)), along with subdivision (c) and former subdivision (d) of Welfare and Institutions Code section 6605 and subdivisions (b) through (d) of Welfare and Institutions Code section 6608, as the basis for the duty of county and indigent defense counsel to prepare for and attend \u2018\u201csubsequent hearings regarding the condition of the\u201d SVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The first change, extending the term of commitment under section 6604, did not impact the duty the Commission found was imposed by Welfare and Institutions Code sections 6603 and 6604 in its 1998 statement of decision. The duty, \u2018\u201cpreparation and attendance by the county\u2019s designated counsel and indigent defense counsel at trial,\u201d exists regardless of the term of commitment the SVP faces and, therefore, remained the same after Proposition 83 was passed. Likewise, the changes to Welfare and Institutions Code sections 6605, subdivision (b) and 6608, subdivision (a) did not alter the duties those provisions imposed on local governments. Those duties, \u2018\u201c[preparation and attendance by the county\u2019s designated counsel and indigent defense counsel at subsequent hearings regarding the condition of the sexually violent predator,\u201d remained the same after the passage of Proposition 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Because the duties imposed by the statutes at issue were not affected by Proposition 83, we reject the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the duties are \u2018\u201cnecessary to implement or expressly included\u201d the measure, and hold that the exclusion contained in section 17556, subdivision (f), does not apply. As the Attorney General states: \u2018\u201cThe relevant question in a mandates determination is whether, in the absence of a statutory provision that requires the duties at issue, local agencies would nevertheless have to perform the duties at issue\u201d because of the existence of the ballot measure. In this case, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>absence of Proposition 83, local agencies would still be required to perform the duties as mandated by the SVPA. The opposite is not true. In the absence of the SVPA, as enacted by the Legislature, the specific duties at issue would not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Our conclusion is supported by the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>San Diego Unified School Dist. v. Commission on State Mandates </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 859 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 466, 94 P.3d 589] <em>(San Diego Unified), </em>which addressed questions about the source of a mandate analogous to those presented here. In <em>San Diego Unified </em>the Commission and the courts were tasked with determining if certain procedural safeguards required for public schools in expulsion proceedings were mandated by state law or federal law. Like duties mandated by a ballot initiative, section 17556 also excludes costs mandated by federal law from the subvention requirement of article XIII B, section 6, subdivision (a). (\u00a7 17556, subd. (c).) The Education Code provisions at issue in <em>San Diego Unified </em>provided for specific procedural protections when a school principal recommended expulsion at his or her discretion, and when a school principal was <em>required </em>to recommend expulsion because a student brought a firearm to school. (Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 48915, 48918.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>San Diego Unified </em>held that the costs of the procedural protections afforded under the Education Code for mandatory expulsion for bringing a firearm to school were state mandated, while those for discretionary expulsion were federally mandated and, therefore, excluded from state subvention. <em>(San Diego Unified, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at pp. 880, 884.) The <em>San Diego Unified </em>court reasoned that with respect to discretionary expulsion, the procedural protections contained in Education Code sections 48915 and 48918 were \u201cdesigned to make the [student\u2019s] underlying <em>federal right </em>enforceable and to set forth procedural details that were not expressly articulated in the case law establishing the respective rights . . . .\u201d <em>(San Diego Unified, </em>at p. 889, italics added.) The costs associated with affording those protections, therefore, were federally mandated and fell within the exclusion to the subvention requirement found in section 17556, subdivision (c). <em>(San Diego Unified, </em>at p. 889.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The court concluded that the procedural protections afforded for mandatory expulsion proceedings, in contrast, were state mandated and not subject to the exclusion found in section 17556, subdivision (c). <em>(San Diego Unified, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 880.) At the time the case was decided, only California\u2019s statutes, and not federal law, required \u201can expulsion recommendation\u2014or expulsion\u2014for firearm possession\u201d by a public school student. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 881.) The costs associated with such proceedings, therefore, were not subject to section 17556\u2019s exclusion: \u201c[I]n its mandatory aspect, Education Code section 48915 appears to constitute a state mandate, in that it establishes conditions under which the state, rather than local officials [as in a discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>expulsion proceeding], has made the decision requiring a school district to incur the costs of an expulsion hearing.\u201d <em>(San Diego Unified, </em>at p. 880.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Here, the duties and costs at issue did not arise from Proposition 83. Unlike the federal due process protections afforded in the discretionary expulsion considered in <em>San Diego Unified, </em>the duties at issue here arose from the creation of the SVPA by the Legislature in 1995, not from Proposition 83\u2019s modifications to that law. The subsequent amendment of some of the provisions contained in the SVPA did not alter the source of the mandate in the way advanced by the defendants. Indeed, the provision providing explicitly for the right to a jury trial, the assistance of counsel and the right to retain experts, Welfare and Institutions Code section 6603, was not amended at all by Proposition 83. Without the initial enactment of the SVPA by the Legislature, it is conjecture to conclude, as the Attorney General does, that \u2018\u201clocal agencies would nevertheless have to perform the duties at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The Attorney General and the Commission also contend that Proposition 83 constituted a subsequent change in the law that modified the state\u2019s liability because the initiative broadened the definition of SVP contained in Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600 and because the measure\u2019s \u2018\u201camendment clause\u201d prohibits the Legislature from weakening the parts of the code the measure amended. The Commission\u2019s 1998 decision, however, concluded that Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600 was not a basis for any of the duties for which the Counties sought reimbursement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Likewise, the initiative\u2019s amendment clause did not impact any of the duties imposed by the SVPA or change the source of the mandated duties.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The Commission and the trial court concluded <em>any </em>modification by ballot initiative to a statute that supports what has previously been adjudged a state mandate converts the source of the mandate from one imposed by the Legislature to one imposed by the People. This construction of sections 17570 and 17556, subdivision (f) does not align with the purpose and policy of this state\u2019s mandate law. As discussed, article XIII B, section 6, subdivision (a) was enacted \u201cto preclude the state from shifting financial responsibility for carrying out governmental functions to local agencies, which are \u2018ill equipped\u2019 to assume increased financial responsibilities because of the taxing and spending limitations that articles XIII A and XIII B impose.\u201d <em>(County of San Diego v. State of California, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 81.) Defining a \u201csubsequent change in the law\u201d to include <em>any </em>modification to a state-mandated program by ballot initiative, as the Commission did, and not limiting the provisions to those modifications that change the duties imposed on local governments (or that impose new duties) directly conflicts with this constitutional dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Further, that interpretation leads to an absurd result, allowing the state to avoid the subvention requirement by advancing propositions that reenact without changing or that only marginally modify existing laws. This broad interpretation of the definition of \u201csubsequent change in the law\u201d under sections 17556, subdivision (1) and 17570 would allow the state to avoid its constitutional obligation to fund the costs it has placed on local governments, which are limited in their ability to raise funds by article XIII A. <em>(Department of Finance, supra, </em>1 Cal.5th at p. 762; <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Our narrow interpretation of these Government Code provisions is also supported by the \u201creenactment rule\u201d advanced by the Counties. Under the Constitution, \u201c[a] section of a statute may not be amended unless the section is re-enacted as amended.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 9.) A ballot initiative, therefore, must restate the entire provision it proposes to amend. Section 9605 further provides, \u201c[wjhere a section or part of a statute is amended, it is not to be considered as having been repealed and reenacted in the amended form. The portions which are not altered are to be considered as having been the law from the time when they were enacted; the new provisions are to be considered as having been enacted at the time of the amendment; and the omitted portions are to be considered as having been repealed at the time of the amendment.\u201d (\u00a7 9605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The purpose of this \u201creenactment rule\u201d is to \u201cavoid \u2018 \u201cthe enactment of statutes in terms so blind that [the legislative body is] deceived in regard to their effect, and the public, from the difficulty of making the necessary examination and comparison, fail[s] to become [apprised] of the changes made in the laws.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(American Lung Assn. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 743, 748 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 428].) Under the rule, it is the <em>actual changes </em>made by Proposition 83 that are relevant to the inquiry of whether the initiative changed the source of the mandate. To the extent that the Welfare and Institutions Code provisions were restated by the initiative to comply with the restatement rule, those restatements are not relevant. (See <em>In re Oluwa </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 439, 446 [255 Cal.Rptr. 35] [\u201camendment of a portion of a statute has no effect on portions which remain unchanged\u201d]; <em>County of Sacramento v. Pfund </em>(1913) 165 Cal. 84, 88 [130 P. 1041] [\u201cto construe a statute amended in certain particulars as having been wholly re-enacted as of the date of the amendment, is to do violence to the code and all canons of construction\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">To refute this point, the Attorney General relies on a footnote in <em>Yoshisato v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 978 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 102, 831 P.2d 327] and asserts the Supreme Court held that although the effective date of an unchanged, but reenacted statute, remains the same, the statute is reenacted for purposes of a mandate determination. <em>Yoshisato, </em>however, addressed whether changes to the same Penal Code statute by two ballot initiatives simultaneously passed were both effective. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 981.) The People argued section 9605 supported their position that the initiative that garnered the most votes was competing against the other initiative directly and, therefore, only the initiative with the most votes was operative. (Yoshisato, at p. 989.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The Supreme Court rejected this assertion and held that \u201cwhen a statute is \u2018reenacted\u2019 under the compulsion of the Constitution\u201d the reenactment does not, \u201cin and of itself, reflect intent of the voters to adopt a \u2018comprehensive scheme\u2019 that would prevail over all other provisions of any other measure enacted by a lesser affirmative vote at the same election.\u201d <em>(Yoshisato v. Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 990.) <em>Yoshisato </em>does not, as the Attorney General contends, address the question of whether a technical reenactment required by section 9605, without any change from existing law, changes the source of a mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Finally, the conclusion we reach is also supported by the fact that the initiative did not purport to remove the state\u2019s liability for costs it was required to reimburse to counties under the 1998 statement of decision. The parties agree that the statutory mechanism for the state to request a reevaluation of the 1998 determination, created by section 17570 in 2010, was not yet in place at the time the initiative was presented to voters. The exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>contained in section 17556, subdivision (f), however, was part of the statute as it was originally enacted in 1984. (Stats. 1984, ch. 1459, \u00a7 1, pp. 5113, 5119.) There was no barrier for the state to challenge its subvention obligation under article XIII B, section 6, subdivision (a), following the passage of Proposition 83. Further, if the proponents of a ballot initiative that amends the statutory provisions that are the basis for an existing state mandate propose to also eliminate the state\u2019s liability for the program, the ballot measure can easily indicate this intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In its order denying the petition, the trial court stated that Proposition 83 constituted a \u201csubsequent change in the law\u201d because \u201cvoter approval\u201d of the initiative \u201cchanged the funding dynamic of the SVP Act.\u201d The court explained: \u201cThe state is required to reimburse local agencies for state-imposed mandates\u201d but \u201c[v]oter-approved mandates are not subject to defunding through the Governor\u2019s line item veto power. [Citation.] Thus, through this voter-approved mandate procedure of re-enacting the SVP Act, the Act cannot be defunded by the State.\u201d This, according to the order, \u201cconstitutes a subsequent change in law.\u201d The Attorney General reiterates this point on appeal, contending that because \u201cthe six duties are now voter-imposed duties through voter approval of Proposition 83, no funding decision by the Legislature (either to fund or not fund) or the Governor (either to exercise his line-item veto power or not) can suspend operation of the duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion, however, puts the cart before the horse. Article XIII B, section 6, subdivision (b), adopted in 2004, requires the Legislature to either appropriate funds for a program that the Commission has determined is state mandated under section 6, subdivision (a), or suspend the operation of the mandate for the year for which it does not provide funding. (Cal. Const., art. XIII B, \u00a7 6, subd. (b)(1).) The trial court and the Attorney General correctly point out that if the source of a mandate is a ballot initiative, and not state legislation, this constitutional requirement does not apply. The Commission\u2019s determination of whether or not a program is state mandated controls the application of section 6, subdivision (b). Contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding, the suspend-or-fund requirement does not impact the Commission\u2019s determination as to whether a program is state mandated or mandated by the People through a ballot initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">As the Commission acknowledges, \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s ability ... to suspend a state-mandate by defunding the program is not an element indicating whether a voter-enacted ballot measure constitutes a subsequent change in law .... Rather, the requirement to fund or suspend a mandated program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>under article XIII B, section 6[, subdivision] (b) [results from] the Commission\u2019s finding in a prior year that the program at issue constitutes a reimbursable state-mandated program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The judgment is reversed. The trial court is directed to modify its judgment to issue a writ of mandate directing the Commission to set aside the decisions challenged in this action and to reconsider the test claim in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-6\">McConnell, P.

(c), (i)\u2014(j).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\"> Welfare and Institutions Code section 6605, subdivision (b), has been modified since the passage of Proposition 83. Before the ballot initiative was passed, subdivision (b) of the statute required the Director of the DMH (now State Dept, of State Hospitals) to provide a committed person with annual notice of his or her right to petition the court for release. Proposition 83 removed this requirement and instead authorized the DMH to authorize the person to petition the court for conditional release or an unconditional discharge if it determined the person\u2019s condition changed so that he or she no longer meets the definition of an SVP. The proposition did not, however, change Welfare and Institutions Code section 6608, which allowed an SVP to petition for release even if he or she is not provided authorization from the DMH. (Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 83, p. 138 [\u00a7 6608].) The statute was amended by Senate Bill No. 295 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) in 2013 to clarify which procedures must be used when a committed person petitions for unconditional release, or when a committed person petitions for conditional release. Senate Bill No. 295 also shifted the burden of proof from the committed person to the state when the State Department of Hospital\u2019s annual evaluation indicates that conditional release to a less restrictive alternative is in the best interests of the person and that conditions can be imposed to adequately protect the community.

The two duties related to probable cause hearings were excluded from the Commission\u2019s decision because Proposition 83 makes no reference to such hearings. All of the identified duties, however, are required under the SVPA regardless of the changes made by the ballot initiative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> In its opposition to the Counties\u2019 petition, the Attorney General asserted that Proposition 83 \u201cdramatically extended the reach of the SVPA by expanding the definition of a \u2018sexually violent predator\u2019 and lifting the ceiling on the number of juvenile adjudications that could count as a sexually violent offense.\u201d In support of this assertion, the Attorney General cited a 2012 report issued by the DMH as required by Welfare and Institutions Code section 6601, subdivision (m), which stated the number of referrals received by the Department of Corrections increased \u201c \u2018nearly 800 percent\u2019 \u201d after the passage of Proposition 83 and Senate Bill No. 1128 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.). The Counties contend the trial court abused its discretion by granting the Attorney General\u2019s request for judicial notice of this report. We agree with the Attorney General that even if the court did err in granting its request for judicial notice, the error was not prejudicial. In addition, the report does not provide any evidence concerning the impact, if any, that Proposition 83 and Senate Bill No. 1128 had on <em>counties\u2019 </em>SVP commitment duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\"> The Attorney General argues the \u201cAmendment Clause may have been prompted by legislative proposals that, if enacted, would have conflicted with the expanded provisions of Proposition 83\u201d and cites to an analysis by the Senate Commission on Public Safety prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>for a hearing on Senate Bill No. 1128 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.). The analysis, however, does not imply that any member of the Legislature did not support expanding the definition of an SVP as the Attorney General suggests. It merely contains counterarguments to the changes proposed by the bill.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
