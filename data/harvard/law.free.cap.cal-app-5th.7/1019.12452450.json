(Mother) and her daughter Harmony F. appeal from juvenile court orders establishing jurisdiction over Harmony and bypassing family reunification services for Mother. The court found that Mother\u2019s neglect contributed to the death of Harmony\u2019s baby sister Melody and that there was no clear and convincing evidence that offering Mother reunification services was in Harmony\u2019s best interest. Mother asserts neither finding is supported by the record and that the denial of reunification services was an abuse of discretion. Harmony also challenges the denial of reunification services. Harmony\u2019s father, Kevin F, joins in their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">In a separate appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mother challenges the juvenile court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over her son Carl H. (Carl Jr.). Carl Jr. contends the court erred when it dismissed his petition after establishing dependency jurisdiction over him. He also asserts the bypass of services for Mother was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Assessed under the relevant legal standard, the record supports the court\u2019s jurisdictional findings and the bypass of services to Mother. However, the dismissal of Carl Jr.\u2019s dependency case because findings were unsustained as to his custodial parent was error. We therefore reverse in part, affirm in part and remand to the juvenile court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">\n<em>Events Preceding Melody\u2019s Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">Raised by a mother who struggled with addiction, Mother\u2019s childhood was marked by abuse and neglect. When she was 13 years old she began an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>abusive and violent relationship with Carl Sr., then a 20-year-old high school dropout. Their child, Carl Jr., was born when Mother was 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">While she was still a minor, Mother left Carl Sr. and was in a relationship with Kevin F. That relationship, too, was characterized by domestic violence. Mother and Kevin F. had two children: Harmony F, born March 2012, and Melody F, born November 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The family, including both fathers, had at least 13 referrals to child protective services (CPS) for physical and emotional abuse and neglect before Melody died in 2015. In 2012 Carl Sr. learned that Kevin F. was hitting Carl Jr. and calling him names. This led to fighting between the two men and CPS intervention. To protect her son, Mother gave Carl Sr. full custody of Carl Jr. with visitation for her every other weekend. From then until December 2014, father and son lived with Carl Jr.\u2019s paternal grandfather. However, both parents used the maternal grandmother (Grandmother) as a respite caregiver. Carl Jr. thus stayed with Grandmother when Carl Sr. was arrested in January 2013 and again in May 2014, and she watched Carl Jr. when Carl Sr. ran errands. Grandmother also looked after all three children at least two weekends a month when Mother had to work and Kevin F. was unwilling to take care of their daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">In February 2014 Carl Jr., then six years old, was staying with Grandmother while his father was incarcerated. Grandmother asked the boy to pick up a methadone pill she had dropped. Carl Jr. picked up the pill and swallowed it. He was immediately taken to the hospital, and survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Following this incident, protective services worker Jonathan Newsome interviewed family members at the hospital and later in Grandmother\u2019s home. The home was extremely cluttered but did not appear dirty. Newsome did not see any inappropriately stored medications or other overt safety hazards. Mother said she lived in an HUD-approved apartment but was temporarily living in a hotel while repairs were being made. She had a court date in family court the next month to change Carl Jr.\u2019s custody arrangement. Mother told Newsome she could care for her son full time with help from a cousin and other family members. With Carl Sr. incarcerated, Newsome determined the hospital could release Carl Jr. to Mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">The San Francisco Human Services Agency (the Agency) convened a team decisionmaking meeting with Mother, Grandmother, and Carl Sr. to address the children\u2019s safety. They agreed the children would not return to Grandmother\u2019s home until it was properly cleaned and organized. Grandmother agreed not to take medications in front of the children or leave them within the children\u2019s reach. Carl Sr. agreed not to yell at his son or abuse him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>emotionally, verbally or physically, to use age-appropriate tools for discipline and redirection, and to follow up with services that had been ordered in his criminal case. Carl Jr. was to remain in Carl Sr.\u2019s care and his sisters would remain with Mother, \u201cwith a significant amount of services for both mother and father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Newsome wrote that \u201cmother appears to be very resilient yet at the same time overwhelmed. She is working, attending school, and caring for her children when at all possible. She appears to be utilizing the support she has at her disposal but the Department can only hope that her children don\u2019t suffer with [her] busy and ambitious schedule. It has been very clearly presented that so long as the [Grandmother\u2019s] home is in [its] current state (extreme clutter), the children are not allowed to be cared for there.\u201d Newsome concluded the children were not at an imminent risk in Mother\u2019s care, \u201cand therefore the Department feels that closing the referral after having connected the family to DR and Safe Care services is appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">On June 6, 2014, protective services worker Jane Phan visited Grandmother\u2019s home after hearing that Carl Jr. was staying there with Mother while Carl Sr. was in jail for non-compliance with court-ordered domestic violence classes, and that the house was so severely cluttered it was unsafe. Mother had left Kevin F. after he physically assaulted her while she was holding seven-month-old Melody. Mother reported she was working with Homeless Prenatal Program and SafeCare workers and asked for help obtaining other services.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">On June 10, Phan spoke with Carl Jr. and his father in their home at the paternal grandfather\u2019s house. Carl Jr. said that during his weekends with Mother he stayed at Grandmother\u2019s home. He did not stay at Mother\u2019s house because Kevin F. lived there. Carl Sr. told Phan he would drop Carl Jr. off at Grandmother\u2019s house for visits with Mother. He said there was some clutter there and mentioned Carl Jr.\u2019s February 2014 methadone incident, but overall he had \u201cno concerns\u201d about Grandmother. The Agency concluded no action was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">In December 2014 Carl Sr. got into a fight with the paternal grandfather. As a result, he and Carl Jr. moved out of the grandfather\u2019s home and moved in with Grandmother. He later told a social worker he did not think living at Grandmother\u2019s was a problem because Carl Jr. was now older and understood not to take her medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">\n<em>Melody\u2019s Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">On April 17, 2015, Mother dropped Harmony and Melody off with Grandmother. Carl Sr. got home around midnight and went to sleep in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>upstairs bedroom. Mother came back around 2:30 a.m. She checked on the children, who appeared to be fine. In the morning Grandmother discovered that Melody was not breathing and called an ambulance. Melody, then 17 months old, died that morning from acute methadone toxicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The incident was investigated by protective services worker (PSW) Nicole Lock. On July 16 she and PSW Alicia Rodriguez conducted an unannounced visit to Grandmother\u2019s home. The home \u201cwas extremely cluttered and there was a current hoarding issue in the home. Although there is space to walk around the home, the undersigned immediately determined that the home was not safe for children to reside. . . . [T]he home was filled with racks of clothes in the living room, boxes of clothes, paperwork, piles of other various items. The undersigned also observed medication containers on the piano, on the coffee table, and in brown grocery bags on the floor of the living room. . . . [T]he bedroom downstairs cannot be used for sleeping due to tremendous clutter.\u201d In the room where Melody spent her last night there were \u201ca lot of medication bottles kept on the side of the bed table, on top of the dressers, and there were miscellaneous pills on top of the furniture.\u201d Some of the medications were within the children\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Lock pointed out various safety concerns and told Carl Sr. that Grandmother\u2019s home was inappropriate for children. Carl Sr. said he never left his son alone or unsupervised in the house, and that he had nothing to do with Melody\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">In a forensic interview on July 20, Carl Jr. said his father and Grandmother smoked cigarettes and \u201cblunts,\u201d which were long and brown \u201cand they put some type of stuff, green stuff in it.\u201d In addition, both Grandmother and her mother (Nanny), who also lived in the house, had pills, like methadone, stomach pills, \u201cpooping pills,\u201d headache pills and pain pills. Carl Jr. knew where the pills were kept. He said \u201call three of us\u2014all the children can get into them, \u2019cause they need to put them in a safe place with a lock, that\u2019s where they need to put them, so no one can get to the pills and take one.\u201d Asked if that had ever happened, Carl Jr. answered: \u201cI picked one up off the floor and took one\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s what happened with my sister. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] The one that died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Carl Jr. said Nanny kept a pill bottle, as well as cookies and \u201ca lot of stuff\u2019 on her bed, so he thought Melody probably woke up and got a methadone pill from there. He knew the bottle contained methadone because \u201cevery time\u2014 she has me read the bottle. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] And she has me make her pills too.\u201d He explained that he usually prepared Nanny\u2019s pills when her caregiver did not come to work. The last time he remembered giving Nanny her pills was when he was seven, but he stopped doing it after the February 2014 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>Carl Jr. said he thought Grandmother kept methadone in three bags on the floor. She also had \u201checka pills\u201d in a pill box. It was \u2018\u201cso easy\u201d to get into Grandmother\u2019s pills, \u2018\u201call you have to do is lift the thing up and take a pill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">When the interviewer asked Carl Jr. about the rules at Grandmother\u2019s house, he replied, \u2018\u201cNo running in the house. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] That\u2019s it.\u201d Asked specifically if there were rules about the pills, lighters, cigarettes or blunts, he said, \u2018\u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">\n<em>The Dependency Petitions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">The Agency filed petitions on behalf of Carl Jr. and Harmony alleging failure to protect under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (b) because the parents allowed them to live in a home where dangerous medications were left within easy access despite Carl Jr.\u2019s methadone poisoning in February 2014; the home was highly cluttered, with medication containers on various surfaces and the living room floor; Mother failed to adequately supervise the children by frequently leaving them at Grandmother\u2019s home with Grandmother or Carl Sr. despite the earlier incident and warnings from the Agency; and Kevin F. was living in a residential facility and failed to protect his daughters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both children\u2019s petitions alleged sibling abuse pursuant to section 300, subdivision (j) and that Mother caused another child\u2019s death through abuse or neglect pursuant to section 300, subdivision (1). The children were detained in the care of a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">\n<em>Jurisdiction/Disposition Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">The Agency\u2019s combined jurisdiction/disposition report recommended that Harmony remain with caretaker Iona V., that no reunification services be provided to Mother pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.5, subdivision (b)(4), and that the court set a permanent planning hearing because the caretaker was willing to adopt Harmony. The Agency recommended that Carl Sr. participate in therapy to address his unstable lifestyle, anger management issues, and involvement in domestic violence; complete a parenting education program; and obtain and maintain suitable housing for himself and Carl Jr. for a reasonable period of time to be considered for reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">\n<em>Jurisdiction/Disposition Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">The combined jurisdiction/disposition hearing extended over multiple days, between November 9, 2015, through January 13, 2016. The Agency called the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>medical examiner, several child welfare workers and in-home service providers, and the forensic interviewer to testify to the facts recounted above, which are essentially undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">PSW Newsome testified about his investigation of the February 2014 incident involving Carl Jr. and the safety plan generated at the team decision-making meeting. He had \u201cmade it very clear,\u201d and Mother understood, that the children were not to be at Grandmother\u2019s home until it was cleaned. Newsome also went over medication safety with Mother and Grandmother and spoke to Grandmother about properly storing her medicines. PSW Lock testified that Mother acknowledged after Melody\u2019s death that she was aware of the safety plan and requirements for storing medications at Grandmother\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Child protection worker Myeshia Griece prepared the reports for the hearing. The Agency recommended out-of-home placement with reunification services for Carl Sr. and Kevin E, but not Mother. Carl Sr. was unemployed and had no other income. Griece believed he could benefit from services \u201cso that he could identify particular risks that he places his child in.\u201d She had concerns about \u201cthe decisions that he makes as a parent in the risk that he places his child in . . . because he left his child in a home where the child was dispensing medication as if he was an adult\u201d although he had other options for places to live. Carl Sr. also exposed Carl Jr. to marijuana: \u201cHe knew what it looked like; he knew the process of putting the stuff in. [\u00b6] So yes, that is definitely a concern.\u201d Moreover, Carl Sr. had not followed up on referrals to parenting, substance abuse, housing and other services.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Addressing the out-of-home placement recommendation for Carl Jr., Griece testified that despite having other housing options Carl Sr. placed his son at risk by choosing to live in an unsafe home. She believed even if they lived elsewhere Carl Jr. would remain at risk with his father, but Carl Sr. would benefit from services to \u201cstrengthen his parenting as well as helping him with making better judgment calls with regard to his child\u2019s safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Griece also recommended out-of-home placement for Harmony. Kevin F. had anger management issues and lacked a stable home and lifestyle. He drank \u201ca lot\u201d and abused other substances. Although he had been in substance abuse treatment, he refused to sign releases authorizing the Agency to access information about it, and his behavior indicated ongoing drug use. Griece\u2019s supervisor later elaborated that at every contact with him, Kevin F appeared to be either under the influence or coming down off of a substance. He had not participated in any of the services he had been offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Griece testified that the Agency considered Mother responsible for Melody\u2019s death. After the February 2014 incident with Carl Jr., Mother \u201chad a lot of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>things going on and she placed yet another minor, that was much younger, at risk as well because she didn\u2019t\u2014because she didn\u2019t take the proper steps to ensure that the house was safe prior to her kid going over there and visiting with the grandmother. . . . [E]ven with her participating in SafeCare, and different things like that, it just seems that there\u2019s something more that needs to happen with regards to ensuring Harmony\u2019s safety.\u201d But Mother also demonstrated strengths: \u201cMom appears to be a hard worker. You can definitely tell that she loves her kids. She\u2019s been able to maintain stable employment.\u201d Mother always provided for the children\u2019s food, clothing and shelter when they were in her care. Mother voluntarily participated in Agency-recommended services before Melody\u2019s death, including services specifically related to home safety, and there was no evidence Mother abused substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">In June 2014 Mother told Phan she would not leave Melody at Grandmother\u2019s home without supervision, but the night before Melody died she did just that, without checking Grandmother\u2019s home for safety. That was of concern \u201c[bjecause of the previous incidents and the constant clutter and the minor\u2019s accessibility to the medication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Griece felt it was appropriate for Mother to have a relationship with the children but that it would be detrimental for them to be in her care. \u201cI honestly believe\u2014it\u2019s the Agency\u2019s understanding and opinion that [Mother] has placed the minors at risk several times; and at this time, it would be in the child\u2019s better interest to be in a safer environment than what [Mother] can provide at this time. This is the second child that\u2019s ingested Methadone within a year span\u2014a little over a year span.\u201d Griece was concerned Mother would place the children at risk if she had unsupervised visits with them, \u201cmaking decisions that [weren\u2019t] necessarily in the kids\u2019 best interest with regards to letting the kids go to her mother\u2019s home, the domestic violence that she\u2019s experienced.\u201d Griece expected the children would be placed with relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">The parties stipulated to several facts about Carl Jr.\u2019s level of understanding and his actions. He (1) understood safe medication storage, and \u201c[s]pecifi-cally, that medicines are to be kept away from children, preferably in a locked box\u201d; (2) understood he should not touch medications and that children should stay away from them; (3) \u201chas stated that he will never take adult medications again\u201d; (4) \u201chas not touched his grandmother or great-grandmother\u2019s medications since February 2nd, 2014\u201d; and (5) if he did \u201chelp organize an adult\u2019s medications, it was before the February 2014 incident.\u201d Carl Jr.\u2019s counsel urged the court to take jurisdiction of both children and offer Mother reunification services: \u201cI think bypassing the mother would further traumatize the minors. I think separating these children from their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>mother would make the tragedy worse.\u201d Counsel\u2019s report noted it was unclear how long the current relative caretakers would be able to care for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Carl Sr. testified that he gained full custody of Carl Jr. in 2012 due to domestic violence at Mother\u2019s home with Kevin E, and Mother had visitation at Grandmother\u2019s house every other weekend. It was during one of those weekends, while Carl Sr. was incarcerated, that Carl Jr. ingested methadone. After that incident, he told Carl Jr. not to touch medication \u201cdon\u2019t even look at it, don\u2019t go near it, how dangerous it was.\u201d Carl Jr. said he understood and would not do it again. When Carl Sr. moved into Grandmother\u2019s house in January 2015 he \u201cindicated to grandmother to keep the medicine up, keep \u2019em out of reach of kids and children and so forth.\u201d He had other housing options with relatives in Tracy and Millbrae, but Tracy was too far away and his cousin in Millbrae was \u201cgoing through a bit of a situation\u201d with his wife, so he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like that was the best situation for my son to be in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Asked if he saw any issues with Carl Jr. living in Grandmother\u2019s home, Carl Sr. said, \u201cOther than the past incident, no. I mean, I understand his grandmother loves him to death. She wouldn\u2019t purposely harm him or anything like that.\u201d He was asked about the condition of the home, and said he had cleaned up the bedroom he shared with Carl Jr. so \u201cour living situation was a little bit different than the rest of the house.\u201d He had \u201cmoved out numerous . . . black big trash bags, there was a few of those in the room that I moved out. There was at least close to 10 boxes I moved out of the room, numerous clothes, clothes items, trash a little bit and just numerous items.\u201d Carl Sr. denied that his son ever prepared Nanny\u2019s medication. He did not believe Carl Jr. would take adult medicines again \u201cbasing off my son\u2019s character. I\u2019m not basing it on every eight-year-old. ... I feel like my son is a little bit above his age. I see my son like a 10- or 11-year-old, but he\u2019s only eight. He is a smart cookie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Carl Jr.\u2019s relationship with Mother was \u201c[vjery important. . . . Nice, caring, loving, very cuddly. I mean, like a mother should be to a son or a daughter. She\u2019s very loving and caring.\u201d Carl Jr. \u201cloves her to death sometimes more than me. He wants to be with his mom. He doesn\u2019t want to be without her, that\u2019s for sure. It would hurt him more for her to be taken away from him than reunited.\u201d Although the custody schedule called for Mother to visit every other weekend, visits were actually more frequent: \u201cTo be honest with you, me and her have an agreement, she can see him whenever she wanted to. It wasn\u2019t really scheduled. I mean, it was court ordered for her to see him every other weekend, but she could always call up and say, I want to see Little Carl and she would be able to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>After Carl Sr. and Carl Jr. moved into Grandmother\u2019s house, Carl Sr. estimated he was there 95 percent of the time. \u201cI was supposed to be there every day. At the time, I wasn\u2019t working. I didn\u2019t have a job. I wasn\u2019t doing too much but taking care of my son. So I was pretty much there all the time. Not all the time, but with my son, I was.\u201d There were times \u2018\u201c[wjhen I would go to the store or maybe sometimes I might go out with friends for an hour or two; but other than that, I was there. I rarely needed to go out.\u201d He left Carl Jr. in Grandmother\u2019s care fewer than five times between January and July 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Mother\u2019s sister Jewel described Mother as \u2018\u201ca very loving and caring mother. She always puts the best interest of her kids first. She will do whatever she can for her children. She works hard to provide for her kids. Her goal is to just not be a product of the system. She does whatever it takes to try to ensure that her kids are well taken care of.\u201d After the February 2014 incident she, Mother and Iona cleaned Grandmother\u2019s house and cleared out some of the clutter. Mother had always been overprotective, and was especially so since Melody\u2019s death. She had no social life \u2018\u201cbecause she has kids to take care of\u2019; it would be very unusual for her to go out to bars or clubbing. She did not know if Mother went out to dinner and a club the night Melody died.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Jewel said the children were doing \u201chorrible\u201d since they were removed: \u201cthey cry a lot. I\u2019ve never seen Carl cry, like really break down and cry, saying he misses his parents as much as I\u2019ve seen now. Even talking to the kids on the phone. I talk to them probably every other day at least, and every time I talk to Harmony, she\u2019s like, where\u2019s my mom, Ti-Ti? She with you? Is my mom with you? Can I talk to her? Can you call her? I want to see her. . . . [\u00b6] She just cries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">The sisters are very close. Mother and the children could live with Jewel if they could not stay with Iona. Jewel would help her with parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Rebecca is Mother\u2019s sister-in-law. She testified that Mother was \u201can excellent mom. She\u2019s an A-l mom\u201d and \u201csuper patrol mom. She is safety number one when she\u2019s with her kids.\u201d Jewel said Mother worked overtime and sacrificed to make sure the children had what they wanted. Asked whether Mother had an active social life, she said \u201cno, I don\u2019t see that. I see a mom who works, comes home to her kids, [gets] up the next morning, and goes back to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">\n<em>Jurisdictional Ridings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">On December 29, the court announced its jurisdictional findings. It first stated its findings on Carl Jr.\u2019s petition. It found untrue the Welfare and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (b) allegation that (1) the parents put Carl Jr. at risk of harm because dangerous medications were left within the easy reach of children at Grandmother\u2019s home: \u201cI do not find that [Carl Jr.] was put at threat by the charge in (b)(1). Just from the evidence that I heard during the course of the proceedings the child seemed to be aware.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The court also found untrue the Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (b) allegation that (2) Grandmother\u2019s home was highly cluttered, with little room to move around and medications left out. The court cited the testimony that Carl Sr. cleaned out the room he shared with his son and that some sporadic efforts had been made to clean the house. Although the court found the home was indeed cluttered, it found the \u2018\u201ccluttered nature of the place\u201d was not a threat because Carl Jr. \u201cseemed to be able to negotiate that aspect of the home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The court also found untrue the Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (b) allegation that (3) Mother frequently left Carl Jr. with Grandmother or Carl Sr. at Grandmother\u2019s house despite the known danger that he would have access to methadone. The court explained \u201cagain, because this is an older child, I am not going to find that that is true. I don\u2019t think the supervision was inadequate. I believe, as I understood from the testimony, that father was on-site most of the time. There was occasion that he was not. The Court was disappointed that father did not expand his role in supervision regarding the other children, but that is not what is charged here.\u201d The court also found untrue the parallel Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (b) allegation that (4) Carl Sr. failed to protect Carl Jr. from exposure to unguarded medications, again because Carl Jr. \u201cwas very well aware of the issues in regards to medication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">But the Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (f) allegation that Mother caused another child\u2019s death through abuse or neglect was found true by clear and convincing evidence that Melody died from ingesting drugs left within her reach despite Mother being on notice of the possible danger after the incident with Carl Jr. \u201cNow, the reason I\u2019m finding it in regards to mom is because mom was the supervising adult in regards to what happened. She\u2019s the one that knows and she\u2019s the one that has this allegation. Father does not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Finally, over the Agency\u2019s objection, the court found untrue the Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (j) sibling abuse allegation premised on Melody\u2019s death and the children\u2019s exposure to hazards in the home. After a recess, the court attempted to clarify its reason for striking this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>allegation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cI did re-review the 300 (j) section, and that\u2019s the reason I knocked it out with regards to . . . [Carl Jr.]. It says that \u2018the child\u2019s sibling has been abused or neglected as defined,\u2019 and it lists particular subsections, which was not the basis of the (j) section, but it also continues, \u2018The court shall consider the circumstances surrounding the abuse or neglect of the sibling, the age and gender of each child, and the nature of the abuse or neglect of the sibling.\u2019 And so those were the reasons that I did not find it to be applicable.\u201d The court reiterated its view that Carl Jr. \u201cwould not have ingested based on [his] hard-earned experience, which was his own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The Agency disagreed. Counsel argued that Carl Sr. put his son \u201cin a situation that an eight-year-old<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> shouldn\u2019t be required to make a determination that one drug is potentially fatal and one isn\u2019t. And there was actually testimony by Carl Jr. in his CASARC DVD four days after his sister passed away that he continued to place medication in a medication container for his grandmother months after Cal Jr.\u2019s initial ingestion.\u201d The court responded: \u201cI fully considered what you\u2019re saying, but it did not seem to me that given the circumstances that [Carl Jr.] stood in the same shoes as the\u2014well, the poor\u2014well, the other younger kids. And so after reading <em>Rocco </em>M.,<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> I felt that I was compelled to make the finding that I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">On December 29 the court found that Carl Sr. was a non-offending custodial parent and announced its intent to return Carl Jr. to his care. The Agency believed the child was still at risk, but that he had to be returned to his father\u2019s care because no allegations were sustained as to Carl Sr. The court declared Carl Jr. a dependent child and dismissed his petition in favor of family law custody orders specifying that the parents share joint legal custody with sole physical custody awarded to Carl Sr. The \u201cCustody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>Order\u2014Juvenile\u2014Final Judgment\u201d filed January 4, 2016, reflects the termination of juvenile court jurisdiction over Carl Jr. with supervised visitation for Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The court sustained each of the allegations of Harmony\u2019s petition, including the allegation under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivisions (j) (sibling abuse) and (1) (causing another child\u2019s death through abuse or neglect), and found by clear and convincing evidence that Mother should have known, and probably did know, that there was methadone in Grandmother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">\n<em>Disposition for Harmony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">On December 28 the Agency filed an addendum disposition report authored by protective services supervisor Pamela Connie. She outlined the long history of abuse in Mother\u2019s relationships with both fathers, noting that all three children were exposed to ongoing domestic violence. She reported that Kevin F. and his family had objected to Mother using Grandmother for childcare \u2018\u201cdue to [Grandmother] not changing their diapers when needed, clothing them appropriately for the weather and feeding them. . . . [M]other thought that the conditions in which her mother lived were normal because that\u2019s what she grew up in. ... A home which is frequently cluttered, has questionable individuals coming in and out, and has all the characteristics of an active addict. I would like to point out that [Grandmother] is an active addict although she may have stopped abusing illegal narcotics years ago, she is still using high doses of methadone and has numerous prescribed narcotics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">Connie discussed Carl Sr.\u2019s presence in the home at the time of Melody\u2019s death: \u201cMr. [H.] stated that Melody and Harmony were not his responsibility although he [has] known them their entire life and they are the half siblings to his son. Such callous disregard for children\u2019s lives and wellbeing is not something that a known service can address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">After consulting with numerous Agency personnel, trauma specialists, and mental health professionals, Connie determined that Mother needed intensive trauma-focused treatment. \u201cIt is the opinion of everyone consulted that [Mother] will need years of trauma therapy and will have to work very diligently to address her lifelong traumas. It is my opinion that [Mother] will not be able to parent or participate in her children\u2019s care until she addresses her trauma. The Agency is requesting that no services be offered to [Mother] because it will take years of treatment before [she] is at a minimal sufficient level of parenting; especially a child, Harmony, with multiple special needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>Connie strongly disagreed with a suggestion that Carl Sr. needed only to obtain appropriate housing to reunify with his son. \u201cI wholeheartedly disagree with any such assessment as [Carl Sr.] has had a sexual relationship with a minor, physically abused [Mother] in front of their son, chose to live with his son in an unsafe house when he had access to appropriate housing, and felt that it wasn\u2019t his responsibility to care for his son\u2019s two young siblings in the home where he lived. [Carl Sr.] needs to demonstrate his ability to make decisions in the best interest of his son and that demonstration should [be] monitored over a significant period of time. Carl Jr. has parented himself long enough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">At the hearing Connie recommended that Harmony live with a relative under Agency supervision and that reunification services be offered to Kevin E, but not to Mother. She reiterated the Agency\u2019s belief that Mother would need extensive therapy in order to put her children\u2019s needs ahead of her own and that it would take well beyond 24 months of services to enable Mother to safely and adequately care for her children. Nonetheless, it was in both children\u2019s best interest to maintain an ongoing relationship with her. Iona was an excellent caregiver and the children were doing remarkably well in her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Mother called social workers Nicole Lock and Bonnie Gordon and her sister Iona. Lock and Iona testified positively about Harmony\u2019s attachment to Mother. Iona testified that after the incident with Carl Jr. Mother made sure that medications were kept out of his reach. Iona was available and willing to provide Mother with whatever support she needed, including a place to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Bonnie Gordon, a private social worker, testified that Harmony would benefit if mother received services even if they did not reunify. Therapy would improve Mother\u2019s coping skills and ability to deal with past trauma, which in turn would allow her to be more present for Harmony. Domestic violence services could prepare her to be a good role model for Harmony, while joint work with a therapist would help improve their relationship. Gordon recommended intensive trauma-focused treatment, which she said can produce significant gains in as little as three to 12 weeks. Gordon believed that, with intensive therapy, Mother could provide a minimum sufficient level of care within 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The children\u2019s counsel called private social worker Abbie McGowan. McGowan reviewed the reports and met with Harmony twice, including during a visit with Mother. She testified that Harmony was attached to her mother and Mother was attentive and appropriate during visits. McGowan recommended that Mother receive intensive reunification services for Harmony\u2019s benefit, and repeated Gordon\u2019s recommendation that Harmony attend therapy with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>Mother. Asked why she thought it was in Harmony\u2019s best interest that Mother receive services, she testified that Mother had a lot of issues to work on and she needed support to be able to be there for Harmony and help her in a more positive way. Moreover, Harmony would be traumatized if she were not allowed to reunify. Further separation from Mother would be difficult for her, and it would be detrimental not to let her continue developing their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">\n<em>Dispositional Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The court found by clear and convincing evidence that Melody\u2019s death was due to Mother\u2019s neglect and found there was no clear and convincing evidence that reunification would be in Harmony\u2019s best interest. It approved Harmony\u2019s placement with Iona V. and set dates for six- and 12-month review hearings. Kevin F. was ordered to obtain and maintain suitable housing and complete reunification services including a residential drug treatment program, therapy to address anger management and domestic violence, and parenting education. Mother was granted therapeutic or supervised weekly visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Harmony, Carl Jr., Mother, and Kevin F. filed timely appeals, which we consolidate for argument and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">I. <em>Jurisdiction</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAL\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"51\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdgAAAA0AQAAAACximf7AAAA+ElEQVR4nO2YMU6EUBRFL8TCTnfg7ER2NnYuy0lYiOMKoHMSR46FQH5+ZxxyQ3JPe/JezgMqGrRbWnfAP0i7h7R7SLuHtHtIu4e0e0i7h7R7SLuHtHvYf/uLpJOks6SLpKukSRIqxDjLVSxTYzW15bqxFADTE/AAvAIfwAhcjnB9LkQ/y0WsU301teW6vhCt6tPP1enUp//tSd54Xflidv+9t5Ia6feyg6RHSfeS7krRzXIR61RXTW25riuEADgCb8A78Al8Ad/ARCGGWa5imRqqqS3XDYVo8i/VQto9pN1D2j2k3UPaPaTdQ9o9pN1D2j2k3cOe238AT2KtuUsW5IsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"1497\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">II. <em>Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"Alr\">A. <em>Carl Jr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">After sustaining the Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (f) allegation regarding Mother\u2019s role in the death of Carl Jr.\u2019s sibling, the court declared him to be a dependent of the court, then immediately dismissed his dependency petition with orders specifying that Carl Sr. was to retain physical custody. Carl Jr. asserts the court erred in dismissing the petition because further findings were required by rule or statute, and the court could not return Carl Jr. to his father\u2019s care without ordering services required by law. He also suggests the court erroneously believed the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number><em>compelled </em>it to dismiss his petition because Carl Sr. was a \u201cnon-offending\u201d custodial parent. We agree the dismissal was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">1. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">After the jurisdictional rulings, the parties and court turned to the appropriate disposition for Carl Jr. While the thread of the discussions is difficult to untangle, it seems clear that in varying measures the participants shared confusion over the relevant law. It was suggested, although without any clear resolution, that the untrue finding on the failure to protect allegations directed to Carl Sr. deprived the court of jurisdiction to do anything but return the boy to his father\u2019s custody. After addressing visitation issues, the court indicated it was inclined to dismiss Carl Jr.\u2019s dependency petition and place him with Carl Sr. This was explored during later colloquy: \u201c[Mother\u2019s Counsel]: [M]y understanding of what happened, if it helps the Court, and this is not because it impacts me at all, is I understood that there was a no\u2014[Carl Sr.] was a non-offending parent and, therefore, the Agency agreed that the case by law should be dismissed. [\u00b6] [The Court]: And that\u2019s in its entirety? [\u00b6] [Agency\u2019s Counsel]: And, your Honor, my understanding is, is that under\u2014what we discussed yesterday was that under 361,1 believe it is, is that the Agency\u2019s\u2014 there were no petition counts with regards to father. The Agency\u2014by law since there is no petition counts as to father, father is a non-offending parent, I think that\u2014the Agency continues to believe that there is still a risk to this child. [\u00b6] [The Court]: Of course. No, no, I understood that you objected to my findings. [\u00b6] . . . [I]n this case mom is the center of it. Then configured around mom ... [\u00b6] is the two fathers, that there are [sic] domestic violence conflict or conflict between the two fathers, and within that is the children, which is why I\u2019m making the decisions I\u2019m making, because the law requires me to. But that\u2019s the\u2014the difficulty of making decisions in regards to [Carl Sr.] was because of this configuration. I understand that. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] But the law tells me that I am not supposed to look at the best families. I\u2019m not supposed to look at what\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m supposed to look at what\u2014if there\u2019s a violation in regards to the petition. So that\u2019s what I did. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] So it\u2019s my understanding that that petition then is dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">First, we reject the argument raised by both the Agency and Carl Sr. that Carl Jr. forfeited his right to challenge the dismissal on appeal by acquiescing or failing to object to it at trial. \u201cWhere, as here, \u2018the facts are not disputed, the effect or legal significance of those facts is a question of law,\u2019 which \u2018is not automatically subject to the doctrine of forfeiture.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Rebecca S. </em>(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1314 [104 Cal.Rptr.3d 706].) We decline to deem this important issue forfeited because it appears that all participants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>the proceedings were unclear on the governing law, and an appellate determination on the validity of the dismissal could bear upon whether this child and family get the supervision, support and stability offered by our dependency system. (See <em>In re S.B. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1287, 1293-1294 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 786, 90 P.3d 746]; <em>In re Rebecca S., supra, </em>at pp. 1313-1314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">\u201cA section 300 dependency hearing is bifurcated to address two distinct issues. First, at the jurisdictional hearing, the court determines whether the child falls within any of the categories set forth in section 300. If so, the court may declare the minor a dependent child of the court. [Citation.] Then, at the dispositional hearing, the court must decide where the child will live while under its supervision, with the paramount concern being the child\u2019s best interest. [Citation.] The juvenile court has broad discretion to decide what means will best serve the child\u2019s interest and to fashion a dispositional order accordingly.\u201d <em>(In re Corey A. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 339, 345-346 [277 Cal.Rptr. 782], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Once the juvenile court has found the minor comes within its jurisdiction under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, it may choose among a number of alternative courses of action in selecting an appropriate disposition. \u2018\u201cIn most cases at the disposition hearing the court determines what services the child and the family need to be reunited and free of court supervision. The court may enter an order ranging from dismissal of the petition (\u00a7 390; [Cal. Rules of Court,] rule 5.695(a)(1)) to declaring dependency, removing physical custody from the parents and making a general placement order for the child (\u00a7 361; rule 5.695(a)(7)). If appropriate, the court may declare the child a dependent and, without removing the child from his or her home, order family maintenance services to ameliorate the conditions that made the child subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. (\u00a7 362, subd. (a); rule 5.695(a)(5).) Alternatively, if the court determines by clear and convincing evidence there is a substantial danger to the physical health, safety, protection or physical or emotional well-being of the child if the child remains in his or her home and there is no other reasonable means to protect the child (\u00a7 361, subd. (c)(1)\u2014(4); rule 5.695(d) [removal of custody\u2014 required findings]), in the absence of a noncustodial parent who desires custody (see \u00a7 361.2), the child must be removed from the physical custody of his or her parents and placed \u2018under the supervision of the [county] social worker who may place the child\u2019 in an appropriate home. (\u00a7 361.2, subd. (e).)\u201d <em>(Bridget A. v. Superior Court </em>(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 285, 302-303 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 647].)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Here, the court\u2019s dismissal of the petition is problematic for a number of reasons. First, it does not comply with the statutory requirements for dismissal. (4) Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.2, which the Agency suggests as a basis for the court\u2019s ruling, applies only when the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>places the dependent child with a parent \u201cwith whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of Section 300.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 361.2, subd. (a).) Carl Sr. was Carl Jr.\u2019s custodial parent when Melody died, so section 361.2 is inapplicable on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 390, which Carl Sr. and the Agency assert as authority for the court\u2019s action here, the juvenile court may \u201cdismiss the petition or may set aside the findings and dismiss the petition if the court finds that the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require the dismissal, and that the parent or guardian of the minor is not in need of treatment or rehabilitation.\u201d But a petition may not be dismissed under section 390 unless the court makes the statutorily required findings, namely (1) \u201cthat the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor require the dismissal\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the parent or guardian of the minor is not in need of treatment or rehabilitation.\u201d (See <em>Los Angeles County Dept. of Children &amp; Family Services v. Superior Court </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1408, 1418 [77 Cal.Rptr.3d 52] <em>(Los Angeles CFS): In re Natasha H. </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1151, 1156-1157 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 276] <em>(Natasha K); </em>Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.695.) \u201cSuch dismissals are rare and usually occur only when the goal of protecting the child has been achieved without court intervention.\u201d (Abbott et al., Cal. Juvenile Dependency Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 2015) \u00a7 5.15, p. 318.)</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Here, as in <em>Natasha H., </em>the court did not make the required findings. Nor could it. Despite the availability of other housing options, Carl Sr. chose to place his young son at risk by living with Grandmother, even after Carl Jr. was poisoned by the methadone left freely around the house in reach of the children. He exposed his son to marijuana. He had a sexual relationship with Mother when she was a minor, impregnating her when she was 13 or 14 years old. He abused her in front of their son. He exhibited callous disregard for the lives and well-being of his son\u2019s young half sisters when they were in Grandmother\u2019s home, feeling no responsibility to protect them from obvious hazards there. He lacked appropriate housing. None of that was seriously disputed. On this record, it is difficult to understand how a trier of fact could conclude Carl Jr.\u2019s welfare and the interests of justice demanded that the court terminate its dependency jurisdiction. As Connie wrote, \u201c[Carl Sr.] needs to demonstrate his ability to make decisions in the best interest of his son and that demonstration should [be] monitored over a significant period of time. Carl Jr. has parented himself long enough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Nor, contrary to Carl. Sr.\u2019s argument, does subdivision (a) of California Rules of Court, rule 5.695 authorize the dismissal of a petition without the findings required by Welfare and Institutions Code section 390. The rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>permits the court at disposition to \u201c(1) [d]ismiss the petition with specific reasons stated in the minutes.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.695(a)(1).) The term \u201cspecific reasons\u201d plainly refers to the findings required by section 390, which rule 5.695 implements. Any other interpretation would be inconsistent with the legislative intent expressed in the statutory enactment, and therefore invalid. (See <em>Los Angeles CFS, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420; <em>California Court Reporters Assn. v. Judicial Council of California </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 15, 23-26 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 44],)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The Agency\u2019s suggestion that Welfare and Institutions Code section 362, subdivision (c) authorizes the dismissal is equally unpersuasive. It provides: \u201cIf a child is adjudged a dependent child of the court, on the ground that the child is a person described by Section 300, and the court orders that a parent . . . shall retain custody of the child subject to the supervision of the social worker, the parents or guardians shall be required to participate in child welfare services or services provided by an appropriate agency designated by the court.\u201d This provision says nothing about the court\u2019s power to dismiss a dependency, and in any event seemingly would not apply where, as here, the court made no provision for Agency supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Carl Sr.\u2019s remaining arguments are also meritless. He claims the court did not find Carl Jr. to be a dependent of the court, but it clearly did. He contends there was no clear and convincing evidence to support removing Carl Jr. from his custody as required under Welfare and Institutions Code section 361, subdivision (c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but there is no challenge here to the court\u2019s placement of Carl Jr. in his custody. The question, rather, is whether the court erred when it dismissed the petition. Section 361, subdivision (c) has no bearing on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Lacking an apparent statutory basis and unjustified by the factual circumstances, the dismissal of Carl Jr.\u2019s adjudicated dependency must be reversed and the matter remanded to afford the court the opportunity to consider, in light of current circumstances, the array of dispositional options available for his support. (See, e.g., Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 360, subd. (b) [informal supervision with participation in services], 362, subd.

Mother\u2019s request for judicial notice of post-disposition orders regarding visitation or, alternatively, to introduce those orders as postjudgment evidence, is denied without prejudice to mother\u2019s right to incorporate and address any such orders should she seek modification of the juvenile court\u2019s orders upon grounds of changed circumstances pursuant to Welfare and Institution Code section 388.
