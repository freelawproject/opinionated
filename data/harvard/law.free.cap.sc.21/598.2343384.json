The return by the trial justice set forth all the proceedings, which showed a service by the trial justice upon the-defendant in that case of the summons and complaint, an appearance by the defendant, and that there was no plea of infancy, the trial justice stating \u201cthat no plea of minority ivas ever made before me in the oral answer or in evidence.\u201d Upon hearing, this return, the court, Witherspoon, J., dismissed the proceedings, with costs. An appeal from this judgment was dismissed, the court saying that the question must be determined by an inspection of the return and the face of the proceedings, and they failed to show the relator\u2019s infancy, and did show his voluntary appearance, even though there had been an irregular and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>perhaps unwarranted service.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
