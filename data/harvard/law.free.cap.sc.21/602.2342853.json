The bonds to the Probate Judge were then marked satisfied. This daughter seven years afterwards sued her mother on this note, but took a non-suit, the statute of limitations being pleaded. She then brought this action for partition of these lands and for an account of thp rents; or if the court held the partition valid, then for a foreclosure of the statutory lien. Judge Wallace dismissed the complaint. This court affirmed this judgment, approving the finding of master and Circuit judge that the note was received in payment; and holding that the subsequent acquiescence by plaintiff estopped her from questioning irregularities or want of jurisdiction in the Probate Court; and that if there' were any lien in this case under the statute of 1791 (\u201cwhich is by no means certain\u201d), it had been discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
