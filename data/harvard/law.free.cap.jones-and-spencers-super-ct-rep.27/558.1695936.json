The fact that the claimants had brought action against the defendant for the same fund does not call for any provision to be made in reference thereto in the order of interpleader. Such an order may require the claimants to deliver up to the clerk of the court the pass-book to await the determination of the action.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b586-7\">Before Sedgwick, Ch.
