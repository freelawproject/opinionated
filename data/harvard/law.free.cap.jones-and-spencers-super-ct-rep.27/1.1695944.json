That the name of \u201c The Harlem and Westchester Clothing Co.\u201d was not adopted and used by the plaintiffs until October, 1881.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-11\"><em>Held, </em>that it clearly appearing that the name of \u201c The Harlem and Westchester Clothing Co.\u201d was not adopted by the plaintiffs until 1881, they cannot prevent the use by the defendant of the name \u201c Westchester \u201d when it was adopted and used by defendant as a name under which his business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>was carried on before it was adopted by the plaintiffs. The case from the plaintiffs\u2019 standpoint does not present a strong claim for equitable relief. The stores of the plaintiffs and the defendant are a mile apart. The names adopted by each are not alike; neither are manufacturers of goods, and there is no question of trade mark in the case. According to plaintiffs \u2019 evidence the defendant was using this title a short time after plaintiffs adopted the name which they seek to protect, and plaintiffs have allowed, without objection or protest, the use of the name by defendant for over seven years, and this tends to show an acquiescence in the use by the.defendant of the name adopted by him. That it is not necessary to determine the question as to whether or not a party can, by adopting a geograph - ical name, under which he does business, acquire such a property right to use that name as to prevent others from using it in any combination for the same purpose. The judgment was right and should be affirmed.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b30-5\">Before Sedgwick, Ch.

The trial judge found as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u201cV. The defendant, in the year 1878, associated with himself in his said business his brother Louis Levy, and thereupon an addition was made to said business of dealing in hats, under the name of the \u2018Westchester Hat Company,\u2019 and the business was carried on and such name used for a few months, when the hat business was discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u201c VI. The defendant, in the year 1880, formed a copartnership with his brother Louis Levy and one Jacob Bach, who thereupon opened a retail clothing business at 138 Ewen street, in the city of Brooklyn, New York, and that said parties at that time began the use of the name \u2018Westchester Clothing Company\u2019 in the carrying on of said business.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u201cVIII. The defendant has had, since 1880, conspicuous signs in and about his place of business at number 2714 Third avenue, New York city, containing the words \u2018 New York and Westchester Clothing Company; \u2019 and his business which was, on or about the year 1882, enlarged to take in three stores, has been from that time until the present advertised in the Westchester Times newspaper, and has become well known to the residents of what was formerly Westchester county under said name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">The name of the \u201cHarlem and Westchester Clothing Co.\u201d was not adopted by the plaintiffs until October, 1881. It is clear that the plaintiffs cannot prevent the use by the defendant of the name \u201c Westchester \u201d when it was adopted and used by defendant as the name under which his business was carried on before it was adopted by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The case from the plaintiffs\u2019 standpoint does not present a strong claim for equitable relief. The stores of the plaintiffs and defendant are more than a mile apart. The names adopted are not alike, one being the \u201cHarlem and Westchester Clothing Company\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>and the other the \u201cNew York and Westchester Clothing Company.\u201d Neither are manufacturers of goods ; there is no question of trade mark, and according to plaintiffs\u2019 own evidence the defendant was using this title within a short time after the plaintiffs adopted the name which they seek to protect, and the plaintiffs have allowed, without objection or protest, the defendant to use the name for upward of seven years, although for a time having a branch store directly opposite the defendant\u2019s store and being thus competitors in business. All this tends to show an acquiescence in the use by the defendant of the name adopted by him. It is not, therefore, necessary to determine the interesting question as to Avhether or not a party can, by adopting a geographical name as the name under which he does business, acquire such property right to use that name as to prevent others from using it in any combination for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">I think the judgment was right and should be. affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Sedgwick Ch. J. and Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
