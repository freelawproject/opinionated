The Court (per- Curiam) held, that as the trial judge had superior opportunities for the determination of serious doubt upon conflicting evidence some deference should be accorded to-it, and that such deference sufficed to impel an affirmance of the judgment, and affirmed the judgment, with costs. -</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
