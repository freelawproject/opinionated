On the former trial it did not appear as now, that the policy, on which the insurance for advances was made, called the cargo policy, was accompanied by a policy called \u201c the freight policy.\u201d This freight policy does not contain the following special claim set forth in the cargo policy, as follows: \u201c Itis understood that freight and advances insured under this policy are subject to the terms and conditions of \u2018 freight policy\u2019 attached hereto.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that this fact does not imply the conclusion that insurances of advances are not subject to the terms of the cargo policy, which insures the advances, and the implied right of the plaintiff to be subrogated to the defendant\u2019s claim against the owner for the reimbursement of advances, secures the same result in this case as was reached in the former, in the consideration of the special clause in the cargo policy</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A1T\">On the trial the counsel for defendant objected to certain commissions on charter and expense of insuring advances being included in the recovery as a part of defendant\u2019s cl aim against the owner, on the ground that they were not a part of the advances which were insured. <em>Held, </em>that the objection was correctly overruled, for by the assignment of the claim to the plaintiff, there was an implied warranty that the claims amounted to $1,500, which, in fact, comprised the commissions and the expenses of insurance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AK9T\">Against the objection of defendant the court below allowed a recovery of certain expenses incurred by the plaintiff in connection with a litigation for the recovery against the owners of the claims for advances. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for services of counsel in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>litigation the charge of $250. That the costs of the action, amounting to the sum of $36.65, were rightfully included in the recovery, but there was not sufficient proof to justify the recovery of $8.51 for type-writing and copies of brief.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b171-5\">Judgment affirmed without costs to either party when modified by the deductions named.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b171-6\">Before Sedgwick, Ch.

Ct. </em>423.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">The learned counsel for appellant argues that there are in the present case differences from the former case which call for another result. He adverts to the fact that on the former trial it did not appear, as it does now, that the policy on which the insurance for advances was made, called the cargo policy, was accompanied by a policy called the freight policy. The freight policy does not contain a special clause upon which, the counsel argues, the former decision is based, and the cargo policy contained the following clause: \u201c It is understood that freight and advances insured under this policy are subject to the terms and conditions of freight policy attached hereto.\u201d This does not imply that insurance of advances are not subject to the terms of the cargo policy which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>insures the advances. And the implied right of the plaintiff to be subrogated to the defendant\u2019s claim against the owners for the re-imbursement of advances, would secure the same result in this action as has been placed before upon the special clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">On. the trial the counsel for defendant objected to there being included in the recovery as being part of defendant\u2019s claim against the owner, and yet not being advances, which was the thing insured, certain commissions on charter and expense of insuring advances. The objection was correctly overruled, for, by the assignment of the claims to the plaintiff, there was an implied warranty that the claims amounted to $1,500, which, in fact, comprised the commissions and expense of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Against the objection of defendant the court allowed a recovery for the amount of certain expenses incurred by plaintiff in connection with a litigation for the recovery .against the owners of the claims for advances. The matter involved was not much discussed on the argument of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The plaintiff was not entitled to recover for services of counsel the charge of $250. <em>Sedgwick on Dam. </em>[292] <em>note </em>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The costs of the action were rightly recovered. Although the defendant did not have notice of the action, the costs were an actual and definite expense to which the plaintiffs were subjected, by acting upon the defendant\u2019s warranty. Armstrong <em>v. </em>Percy, 5 <em>Wend. </em>535. These costs amounted to $36.65. There was not sufficient proof to justify the recovery of $8.51 for type-writing and copies of brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The judgment should be modified by deducting the amounts that have been specified, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
