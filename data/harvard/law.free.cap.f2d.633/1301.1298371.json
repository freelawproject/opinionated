MMC has two shareholders, Frances Taylor, M.D., and William Born. Taylor and Born together also own 20.46% of the limited partnership interests in the Hospital; the remaining interests are dispersed in small blocs among 54 other limited partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-6\">As a \u201cprovider of services\u201d, the Hospital is entitled to reimbursement for the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of hospital services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395f(b), 1395x(v).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Hospital\u2019s claims for reimbursement are audited by Blue Cross of Southern California, which acts as a \u201cfiscal intermediary\u201d of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395h. Blue Cross disallowed reimbursement for amounts the Hospital paid MMC for management services in excess of MMC\u2019s actual cost of rendering the services, consisting of $109,424 of the $190,495 paid MMC in 1973 and $222,376 of the $249,221 paid in 1974. The disallowance was based upon Blue Cross\u2019 determination that MMC was \u201crelated to\u201d the Hospital within the meaning of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-15\">As authorized by statute, the Hospital appealed to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo (a). The PRRB affirmed the disallowance. The Hospital\u2019s administrative remedies were exhausted when the Secretary declined to exercise his discretionary power of review of the PRRB\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395 00(f)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-16\">The Hospital brought this action in the district court seeking judicial review of the administrative decision disallowing reimbursement for amounts the Hospital paid MMC in excess of MMC\u2019s costs. The district court affirmed the administrative decision on the ground there was substantial evidence to support the administrative finding that MMC was an organization \u201crelated to\u201d the Hospital within the meaning of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Hospital appealed, invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>In seeking judicial review of the administrative determination, the Hospital does not contest the validity of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427. Rather, it attacks the disallowance of management costs on the ground that the PRRB\u2019s finding that MMC is \u201crelated to\u201d the Hospital is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">An organization may be \u201crelated to the provider\u201d by either \u201ccommon ownership or control.\u201d These terms are defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-6\">(1) <em>Related to provider. </em>Related to the provider means that the provider to a significant extent is associated or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by the organization furnishing the services, facilities, or supplies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-7\">(2) <em>Common ownership. </em>Common ownership exists when an individual or individuals possess significant ownership or equity in the provider and the institution or organization serving the provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-8\">(3) <em>Control. </em>Control exists where an individual or an organization has the power, directly or indirectly, significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1407-9\">We agree with the district court that there is substantial evidence that MMC is related to the Hospital by both common ownership and control as those terms are defined in \u00a7 405.427(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-10\">Given that Taylor and Born are the sole owners of MMC, the question of common ownership turns on whether Taylor and Born\u2019s 20.46% ownership of the limited partnership interests in the Hospital was significant under the circumstances. Appellant concedes that, under the applicable regulation, possession of a majority ownership interest is not required. How large a minority interest is necessary to constitute \u201csignificant ownership\u201d cannot be rigidly defined as a fixed percentage, such as 40%, 30% or even 20%, but must be a function of all the facts of the case, including how widely dispersed the remaining interests are.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When, as in this ease, the 20.46% bloc is viewed in light of the relatively small interests dispersed among the 54 other limited partners, w\u00e9 cannot, given the limited scope of judicial review, disturb the administrative finding of common ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-14\">There is also substantial evidence to support the PRRB\u2019s finding that MMC and the Hospital were under the \u201ccommon control\u201d of Taylor and Born. MMC was the general partner of the Hospital. Taylor and Born, as sole owners of MMC, effectively possessed the general partner\u2019s broad powers to manage the business of the Hospital. The Partnership Agreement, which gave MMC \u201cfull charge of the management, conduct and operation of the Partnership business in all respects and in all matters,\u201d was clearly not intended to limit the general management powers vested in a general partner by California law. <em>See </em>Cal.Corp. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15507, 15509 (West 1977 and Supp. 1980). Such broad management powers, standing alone, constitute substantial evidence of power \u201csignificantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-427(b)(3). <em>Accord, Fallston General Hospital v. Harris, </em>481 F.Supp. 1066, 1068-69 (D.Md.1979). In this case, the management powers vested in Taylor and Born'as owners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>of the Hospital\u2019s general partner are reinforced by the influence that derives from their ownership of a relatively large bloc of limited partnership interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">The Hospital argues that Taylor and Born do not \u201ccontrol\u201d the Hospital because their minority voting power in the limited partnership is insufficient, standing alone, to control the vote on the size of MMC\u2019s management fee. This argument is founded upon an unduly narrow reading of the regulation. The regulation, which speaks broadly of control as power to \u201cinfluence the actions or policies of the organization,\u201d has reasonably been interpreted by the Secretary as requiring less than the voting power necessary to decide every partnership question such as the size of the management fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">Finally, the Hospital contends that the Medicare statute entitles it to reimbursement for all reasonable costs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f(b), and that its payments for MMC\u2019s management services were in fact reasonable even though they exceeded MMC\u2019s costs in providing the services. The Hospital \u201cdoes not contend that the related organizations principle is [itself] inconsistent with the [provisions and] objectives of the Medicare Act but, rather, that its <em>application in this case </em>is in violation of the statute and regulations.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 23 (emphasis in original). This argument would have us ignore the regulation in favor of an adjudication of the reasonableness of the specific costs at issue. To do so would defeat the very purpose of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-6\">Particularly in a program as complex and ripe with potential for abuse as Medicare, the Secretary has broad discretion to control excessive costs by adopting general prophylactic rules which, despite their inherent imprecision, eliminate the need for a cumbersome and expensive process of adjudicating item-by-item the reasonableness of costs. See <em>Fairfax Hospital Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Califano, </em>585 F.2d 602, 606-07 (4th Cir. 1978). Section 405.427 is just such a prophylactic rule. <em>Medical Center v. Harris, </em>628 F.2d 1113 at 1119 (8th Cir. 1980). Hence, in light of the Hospital\u2019s concession that the regulation is valid, the sole question raised by its appeal is whether there is substantial evidence to support the administrative finding that MMC is \u201crelated to\u201d the Hospital within the meaning of \u00a7 405.-427. In answering that question in the affirmative, we moot the issue whether MMC\u2019s management fees were in fact reasonable. Since it is \u201crelated to\u201d the Hospital, any charge in excess of its actual cost is <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">.
