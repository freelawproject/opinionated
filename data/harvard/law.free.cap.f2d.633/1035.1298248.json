KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1140-19\">Fundamental tenets of administrative law and sound judicial administration require that courts show some measure of deference to an agency\u2019s findings of fact. Evaluations of witnesses\u2019 credibility and complex information are best performed by those who preside over the hearings or have special expertise in the particular subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-20\">Accordingly, judicial review is limited to determining whether an administrative decision is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the hearing conducted by an Administrative Law Judge in this case was both improper and incomplete, we are unable to state that the Secretary of Health and Human Services proved by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that appellant Roger Dorman was not \u201cwithout fault\u201d in aecept-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>ing overpayments of social security disability benefits. Therefore, we must reverse the order of summary judgment granted by Judge Elfvin and remand to the Secretary for additional fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">Roger Dorman, born in 1927, was employed as a pipefitter and mechanic in Buffalo-area factories until a severe heart condition forced him in September 1966 to retire and apply for disability and disability insurance benefits. The application was granted, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (now Health and Human Services) determined that Dorman was entitled to benefits commencing May 8, 1966. In 1972, the Social Security Administration (SSA) reevaluated Dorman\u2019s situation and concluded that he remained eligible for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">Dorman returned to work in February 1975 under the auspices of the CETA program (Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-992 (1976)). He was employed as a \u201cmanagement analyst\u201d for the City of Buffalo, evaluating the efficiency of the police and fire departments. Dorman claims that on approximately March 10, 1975, he mailed a \u201cbrown and tan\u201d card to the SSA reporting his new employment. The SSA, however, states that it has no record of this communication. Dorman continued to receive and endorse benefits checks while working, since he assumed (correctly) that the Secretary\u2019s Regulations grant a nine month trial work period to a formerly disabled person, during which time eligibility for benefits continues. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1536 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">The SSA learned of Dorman\u2019s employment in late December, 1975, when it discovered that his earnings had been reported for his Social Security records. A job questionnaire was then sent to Dorman, who returned it in mid-February, six weeks later. Dorman states that, before returning the questionnaire, he visited the SSA office in Buffalo on January 3 or 4, 1976. This was prompted by his receipt of the December 1975 check in early January, his tenth monthly check after starting his CETA job. He sought advice from the SSA about the propriety of cashing the check. Dorman notes he was told during this occasion, and on a subsequent visit in April, 1976, that if he did not hear anything from the SSA Headquarters in Baltimore, he could continue to endorse the benefits payments. The SSA\u2019s silence, he was purportedly told, indicated that no determination had been made that his status as a \u201cdisabled\u201d person had changed. During the April visit, an employee named Shaw purportedly spoke with Dorman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">In any event, the SSA continued to send disability checks to Dorman through June 1976. On June 16, 1976, however, the SSA determined that the nine month trial work period had ended in November 1975. It notified Dorman that his last month of entitlement to benefits was January 1976, the second full month after the nine month period ended. Dorman was informed of this determination on July 19, 1976, and was told that benefits for 5 months-from February through June 1976, amounting to $1383.50-were overpayments, and that arrangements should be made for their repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-14\">Dorman completed a refund questionnaire and a \u201cwithout fault\u201d questionnaire on October 28, 1976, stating that: \u201cI came right to this office in February with my check and was told that they determined me not capable.\u201d (Presumably, Dorman meant that SSA employees informed him that he was still \u201cdisabled\u201d for purposes of receiving disability benefits). A statement by the Buffalo district office, also filed on that date, noted that the \u201cclaimant appeared very truthful and worried about his situation ... There have been scheduled office visits ... he did appear without fault.\u201d Dorman\u2019s request for a waiver of the overpayment was denied on January 27, 1977. He applied twice for reconsideration-on March 28, 1977 and on August 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>1977. On September 22, 1977, the SSA issued a Notice of Reconsideration, informing Dorman that its original decision not to waive the overpayment was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">During this period, Dorman\u2019s health had deteriorated to a point where he was forced to leave his employment in December 1976. His reapplication for disability benefits, filed on December 29,1976, was granted on January 24, 1977. Dorman was informed, however, that because of the overpayments he had received the previous year, he would not receive any benefits until June 1977. From January to June 1977, therefore, Dor-man received nothing from the SSA, and survived on $106.00 per month from the Veterans Administration. Dorman was forced to file for bankruptcy in December 1977.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">Dorman requested an administrative hearing on October 6, 1977, to review the reconsideration determination. A <em>de novo </em>hearing was conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) on January 9, 1978. Dorman appeared without counsel and testified he had notified the SSA on \u201capproximately March 10, 1975\u201d of his employment. He described his account of the events of early 1976-his receipt of the tenth monthly check (for December) in early January, his visit to the SSA and conversations with its employees at that time, his endorsement of the December, January, and February checks, and his subsequent visit to the SSA and conversations with Mr. Shaw in April 1976 after receiving the March 1976 check. Dorman noted that Shaw would be able to identify the person who interviewed him in January. He also stated that the last check he endorsed was for May 1976; the June check, he insisted, was never received. The ALJ did not call any SSA employees to give testimony relating to Dorman\u2019s visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">The ALJ\u2019s decision on June 12,1978, concluded that Dorman was not \u201cwithout fault\u201d in receiving the 1976 overpayments, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b) (1976), and therefore a waiver would not be granted. The Administrative Law Judge viewed Dorman\u2019s background and education-Dorman had college degrees in business administration and marketing-as proof that he was a \u201ccompetent and intelligent individual.\u201d The Judge found no evidence in the record that Dor-man notified the SSA of his CETA employment in March 1975. He also found that, even if such notice were given, Dorman\u2019s failure to pursue the matter until January 1976 was evidence of a lack of good faith, as was Dorman\u2019s six week delay in returning the job questionnaire received in late December 1975. Finally, the ALJ stated that he conducted an independent search for the June 1976 check, and, having located it, found Dorman\u2019s signature on it. Since Dor-man claimed at the hearing that he never received the check, this evidence significantly impeached his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-9\">Dorman requested a review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, noting that the June 1976 check was examined <em>ex parte </em>by the Judge and was not presented at the hearing for handwriting comparison. He also claimed that upon filing for a hearing, he requested Mr. Shaw and another. SSA employee to be present. The Appeals Council of HEW rejected Dorman\u2019s claims, and approved the ALJ\u2019s decision on September 11,1978. Dor-man then commenced an action in the Western District of New York, and on April 21, 1980, Judge Elfvin granted summary judgment for the Secretary, holding that the ALJ was capable of evaluating Dor-man\u2019s credibility and that his finding that Dorman was not \u201cwithout fault\u201d was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Against this background of the facts, we approach the law. The Social Security Act states that the Secretary of HEW shall not recover overpayment from \u201cany person who is without fault if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of [the Act] or would be against equity and good conscience.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b) (1976). \u201cFault\u201d is defined in the Secretary\u2019s Regulations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-6\">(a) An incorrect statement made by the individual which he knew or should have known to be incorrect; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-7\">(b) Failure to furnish information which he knew or should have known to be material; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-8\">(c) With respect to the overpaid individual only, acceptance of a payment which he either knew or could have been expected to know was incorrect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.507 (1980). Using these standards the ALJ concluded that Dorman was not \u201cwithout fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">The conduct for which Dorman allegedly is at fault involves two specific instances: 1) his failure to notify the SSA of his CETA employment in February or March 1975, or alternatively, if he did mail a \u201cbrown and tan\u201d card to the SSA at that time, his failure to pursue the matter for nine months, and 2) his six week delay in returning the job questionnaire sent to him by the SSA on December 30, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-12\">Since the SSA did not have any record of the \u201cbrown and tan\u201d card, the ALJ was required to evaluate Dorman\u2019s credibility to determine whether he took reasonable actions in March 1975 to inform the SSA of his new employment. The Judge, however, based his credibility determination on an <em>ex parte </em>examination of the June 1976 check, which Dorman claimed he never received. Finding Dorman\u2019s \u201csignature\u201d on the check, he concluded that Dorman withheld material information from the SSA, and therefore was not \u201cwithout fault\u201d in accepting the overpayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-15\">This post-hearing examination of the check was highly improper since Dorman was never given the opportunity to confront this evidence. In fact, Dorman claims that he no longer lived at the address stated on the June 1976 check when it was mailed in early July of that year, and that someone else must have forged his signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-16\">We are of the view that when additional evidence became available, such as this check, the ALJ should have reopened the hearing for its consideration. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.927 (1980). The Secretary\u2019s decision must be based upon evidence adduced <em>at </em>the hearing. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b) (1976); <em>Gullo v. Calif ano, </em>609 F.2d 649 (2d Cir. 1979) (per curiam).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ\u2019s determination of Dorman\u2019s credibility was so tainted by this improper <em>ex parte </em>evaluation of the June 1976 check that his conclusion that Dorman was \u201cat fault\u201d for either fabricating the story about the \u201cbrown and tan\u201d card or failing to follow up the matter with the SSA is severely undermined. In addition, Dorman raised his objection to this <em>ex parte </em>procedure at the earliest possible moment-in his request to the Appeals Council for review of the hearing decision order. He reiterated this objection in his affidavit supporting his unsuccessful cross-motion for summary judgment before Judge Elf-vin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-17\">Once we discount the ALJ\u2019s tainted evaluation of Dorman we find that Dorman\u2019s failure to contact the SSA for nine months might be viewed in a different light. Dor-man reasonably and correctly assumed that his benefits would continue for nine months. By contacting the SSA after receiving the tenth check, Dorman indicated good faith. If the evidence of the June 1976 check were to be excluded, we believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>the ALJ could not have concluded that \u201cmore than a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence existed to show that Dorman was at fault. <em>See Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">The second set of circumstances-Dor-man\u2019s six week delay in returning the job questionnaire in early 1976-also fails to provide \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of fault. Three sources of information were relevant in evaluating the events of this period: 1) Dorman\u2019s testimony that he visited the SSA on January 3 or 4, 1976, several days after the job questionnaire was mailed to him, to discuss the problems with the 10th check, as well as his testimony of a visit in April; 2) an account of these visits by the SSA employees who interviewed Dorman; and 3) the district office evaluation of Dorman's October 28,1976 \u201cwithout fault\u201d application stating that he appeared \u201cvery truthful and worried\u201d and \u201cwithout fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">The ALJ was in error in evaluating Dor-man\u2019s testimony concerning these events, because the improperly-obtained evidence of the June 1976 check undoubtedly tainted his general credibility determination. If Dorman had been permitted at the hearing to present evidence that he did not sign the check, which he claims, it is reasonable to suppose that his account, as well as the October 28 district office report, would have been given more weight by the ALJ and might have tilted the scale in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">Moreover, Dorman\u2019s appearance at the hearing without counsel created a duty 'for the ALJ \u201cto scrupulously and conscientiously probe into, inquire of and explore for all the relevant facts.... \u201d <em>Gold v. Secretary of H. E. W., </em>463 F.2d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 1972). The ALJ neglected this duty in two crucial respects. First, he failed to elicit testimony from Dorman about his reasons for the six-week delay, save for asking Dorman at the end of the hearing in a most general manner whether Dorman had anything else to add. Dorman states on this appeal, that if specifically asked about the reasons for the delay, he would have informed the ALJ of his January visit to the district office and of a subsequent hospitalization which prevented his prompt completion of the form. We cannot evaluate the truthfulness of these assertions, of course, but note that these facts should have been developed in the record, especially where the claimant appeared <em>pro se. See Gold, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-9\">In addition, the ALJ failed to obtain the testimony of Mr. Shaw and the other SSA employee who spoke to Dorman in January 1976 about his overpayments. Their testimony is crucial, for if Dorman relied on their erroneous recommendations, he was not at fault in accepting the overpayments. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.510a (1980). The absence of their testimony-testimony which is \u201cnecessary to a just determination;\u201d <em>Cutler v. Weinberger, </em>516 F.2d 1282, 1285 (2d Cir. 1975)-weakens the bases for the ALJ\u2019s legal and factual conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-10\">We conclude that additional facts are required to determine whether Dorman was \u201cwithout fault.\u201d Therefore, a remand is appropriate to consider relevant, probative, and available evidence that was not explicitly weighed by the Secretary. <em>Id.; see also Parker v. Harris, </em>626 F.2d 225, 234-35 (2d Cir. 1980). The ALJ should be prepared to hear testimony by Dorman and handwriting experts regarding the signature appearing on the June 19, 1976 check, as well as testimony by Dorman and SSA employees concerning the events of early 1976, particularly Dorman\u2019s six week delay in returning the job questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-11\">Because the Secretary\u2019s findings were not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d Judge Elfvin\u2019s order granting summary judgment for the Secretary is incorrect as a matter of law, <em>Milton v. Harris, </em>616 F.2d 968, 975 (7th Cir. 1980); see <em>also </em>6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice f 56.17[3] at 56-694 &amp; nn. 6-8 (2d ed. 1980). Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the Secretary for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1140-12\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1976); <em>Richardson v.

N.L.R.B., </em>340 U.S. 474, 487-88, 71 S.Ct. 456, 463-64, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951) (findings by the National Labor Relations Board).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1142-7\"><em>. </em>In <em>Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979) the Supreme Court held that where a claimant\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d in receiving overpayments is in issue, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b) (1976), recoupment must be preceded by a hearing, since findings of \u201cfault\u201d require credibility evaluations which can only be properly considered at an oral hearing. Thus, if the SSA had recovered Dorman\u2019s overpayments following the date of the <em>Yamasaki </em>decision, its failure to hold an oral hearing prior to recoupment would have violated the Social Security Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1143-13\">. The ALJ\u2019s failure to afford Dorman an opportunity to confront this evidence may have violated Dorman\u2019s due process rights, <em>cf. Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970).
