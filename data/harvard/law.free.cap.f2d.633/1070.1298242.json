Staker, United States District Judge for the Southern District of West Virginia, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1176-4\">STAKER, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">Employee Leroy White was injured while unloading pipe in the shipyard of Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, and claimed compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">The threshold issue here is whether White was a shipbuilder entitled to compensation under the Act. After hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) held <em>inter alia </em>that White was a shipbuilder and was so entitled, and that holding was reversed by decision of the Benefits Review Board upon Newport News Shipbuilding\u2019s appeal thereto.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board did not decide other issues raised by White\u2019s appeal to the Board of other rulings and findings of the ALJ, and White presents them here. White, in No. 79-1134, and the Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, in No. 79-1141, filed here their separate petitions for review from the Board\u2019s decision, and consolidation thereof was ordered. We reverse the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">The uncontroverted evidence showed that White\u2019s work was performed in an area at or near Dry Dock # 3 of the shipyard at which suppliers delivered pipe of various grades intended for use in ship and submarine construction. Suppliers delivered pipe there on trucks or flatcars from which it was unloaded by an overhead crane. It remained stored there until subsequently distributed as needed to the fabricators who used it in such construction. White\u2019s duties included his helping in such unloading operations by indicating the specific points at which the crane was to place the craneloads of pipe unloaded from the trucks or flatcars, and after they were so placed, by disengaging the cable therefrom, and his then sorting the pipe and painting a color code upon, and also etching, each piece of pipe to identify its grade to the shipyard workers. When pieces of pipe were needed for use in fabrication, the \u201ctrades\u201d at the fabricating site would themselves bring, or else the shipyard\u2019s transportation department would send, a truck for the needed pipe and transport it from there to the fabricating site. In either case, White\u2019s duties also included the loading of the needed pipe on such trucks. His regular duties also included the routine verification by him that each shipment of pipe delivered by the suppliers was that described upon the invoice therefor, and his so indicating by signing the invoice and delivering a copy thereof to each of the delivering supplier and the shipyard office. Though it was not a part of White\u2019s regular duties to do so, on occasion he sawed pipe to lengths specified by the fabricators before it was transported to them from the area where he worked. At the time of the injury, White\u2019s job title, according to his testimony, was storekeeper, and according to that of his supervisor, was warehouseman; however, both testified that it was classified as clerical by the union contract under which White was employed. At the time of his injury, White was assisting in the unloading of several tons of pipe at Dry Dock # 3 of the shipyard when cables of the overhead crane snapped, causing a craneload of pipe to fall on his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-11\">In order to have been an employee entitled to compensation under the Act, White must meet the two-prong situs and status test. <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co., Inc. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 53 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977); <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Graham, </em>573 F.2d 167 (4th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 979, 99 S.Ct. 563, 58 L.Ed.2d 649 (1978); <em>P. C. Pfeiffer Co., Inc. v. Ford, </em>444 U.S. 69, 100 S.Ct. 328, 62 L.Ed.2d 225 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-12\">Under the \u201csitus\u201d requirement, a geographical one, White must have been employed \u201cupon the navigable waters of the United States (including any adjoining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel.)\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a). The uncontro-verted evidence clearly shows and it is not seriously disputed that White\u2019s place of employment in the shipyard fell within the situs requirement of that provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">Vigorously contested by the parties, however, is whether White\u2019s job functions fulfilled the \u201cstatus\u201d requirement, to meet which White must have been \u201cengaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in long-shoring operations, and any harborworker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker ...\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">White contends that he was a shipbuilder engaged in maritime employment within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3). He asserts that, given his job functions as shown by the evidence, then the liberal construction which must be accorded the provisions of the Act in conformance with its remedial purposes under pertinent case law, together with applicable case law by which the \u201cstatus\u201d issue must be determined, require that he be held to have been engaged in maritime employment within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3), and thus to have fulfilled the status requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">Conversely, Newport News Shipbuilding contends that White was not engaged in maritime employment. It asserts that White\u2019s duties were merely clerical, wherefore he is excluded from coverage; that his duties were unrelated to and not directly involved in the production or maintenance of component parts or equipment involved in shipbuilding, did not involve the alteration of materials used in ship construction in preparation for fabrication and did not constitute the integral part of the production process that this court looked to in <em>Graham </em>in order to determine whether claimants have met the status test of the Act\u2019s coverage; and that White was essentially an unskilled worker whose work was merely incidental to production and had no close functional nexus to shipbuilding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">Both White and Newport News Shipbuilding cite, but disparately apply to the facts here, almost all of the same cases as authority in support of their antipodal positions on the status issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">That White\u2019s duties included clerical ones is not decisive of his status. <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co., Inc. v. Caputo, supra, </em>held Blundo, employed as a checker, i. e., a clerical worker, participating as such in the unloading of cargo, to have been engaged in maritime employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">Furthermore, White\u2019s primary duties were not clerical ones. In <em>Maher Terminals, Inc. v. Farrell, </em>548 F.2d 476 (3d Cir. 1977), Farrell had once worked as a checker involved in longshoring, but for some time prior to his injury had worked as a clerk in an office where his primary duties were clerical ones not involving his participation in cargo loading or unloading, though on occasion he left the office to examine markings on cargo. The court said: \u201cWhat is controlling is the nature of his primary duties. As we perceive the congressional intent, that is the sole test. Farrell\u2019s primary duties being that of a clerk and not a checker, he is excluded from coverage.\u201d Here, in contradistinction to the facts in <em>Farrell, </em>the only \u201cclerical\u201d duty, in the traditional sense of that term, that White\u2019s job functions included was his verifying that pipe received at the shipyard conformed to the description thereof on the invoices therefor and his so indicating on the invoices. That duty was incidental to his primary duties of loading, unloading, color coding and etching pipe, and constituted a negligible portion of the whole of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">Moreover, that the union contract generally classified his job as a clerical one does not alter the factual nature of his primary duties and is thus not controlling. <em>Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc. v. Perdue, </em>539 F.2d 533, 539 n.16 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>vacated, </em>433 U.S. 904, 97 S.Ct. 2967, 53 L.Ed.2d 1088 (1977), <em>reaff\u2019d, </em>575 F.2d 79 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 967, 99 S.Ct. 1520, 59 L.Ed.2d 784 (1979); <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co., Inc. v. Caputo, supra, </em>432 U.S. n.30, at 268, 97 S.Ct. at 2359.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>In determining whether an employee meets the status test, the critical enquiry is not whether the employee performed clerical duties, but rather whether the employee was engaged in maritime employment within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3), which we must now decide as to White.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">Various phrases have been used by the courts generally to describe and delineate those functions that constitute engaging in maritime employment within the meaning of the 1972 amendments to the Act. <em>See, e. g., Alabama Dry Dock &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. Kininess, </em>554 F.2d 176 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 903, 98 S.Ct. 299, 54 L.Ed.2d 190 (1977) (\u201cdirectly involved\u201d in shipbuilding); <em>Dravo Corp. v. Banks, </em>567 F.2d 593 (3d Cir. 1976) (a necessary \u201cingredient\u201d of shipbuilding); <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co., Inc. v. Caputo, supra </em>(an \u201cintegral part\u201d of the unloading process); <em>Dravo Corp. v. Maxin, </em>545 F.2d 374 (3d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>433 U.S. 908, 97 S.Ct. 2973, 53 L.Ed.2d 1092 (1977) (an \u201cintegral part\u201d of ship construction). In <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. v. Graham, supra, </em>we held that Graham, who was injured while working in a submarine shop on a sonar shield later to be installed in a submarine, met the status test because he was engaged in an \u201cintegral part\u201d of submarine construction, and that Jones, who was injured in a foundry while oiling machinery used to build ships, also met the status test because his maintenance of that machine was \u201c[ejssential to keeping the shipyard\u2019s machinery in working order for the construction of ships ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">White\u2019s regular functions of affixing the color code and etching to the individual pieces of pipe for the purpose of identifying their respective grades to the ship fabricators effected a physical change to each piece of pipe and gave each an added characteristic essential to identify it by grade for its proper application and use by the fabricators in the construction by them of ships at the shipyard. Hence, White\u2019s performance of those functions on the pipe were the first steps taken physically to alter that pipe for its use in ship construction, and his doing so thus constituted an \u201cintegral part\u201d and necessary,\u201cingredient\u201d of shipbuilding and also caused him to be \u201cdirectly involved\u201d therein, as did his occasional cutting of pipe for ship construction. His doing so thus comes within the phraseology descriptive of maritime employment used in all of <em>Graham, Maxin </em>and <em>Kininess. </em>White\u2019s doing so thus constituted the performance by him of maritime employment, i. e., shipbuilding, within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3), and he thereby met the status test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">White requests us also to decide, and not to remand to the Board for decision, the following other issues which he appealed to the Board and the Board did not decide: First, whether there was substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that White\u2019s permanent partial disability was limited to only 35%; and second, whether the ALJ\u2019s decision and order were contrary to law by omitting therefrom the imposition of the statutory penalties pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(e) and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">As to this first issue, we hold there was substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that White suffered permanent partial disability of only 35%. The record shows that medical testimony was not offered at White\u2019s hearing; the medical evidence rather consisted of letters from physicians respectively stating that White had \u201ctotal disability amounting to 50% of his left lower extremity\u201d and \u201c25% permanent partial damage to left lower extremity.\u201d Based upon that evidence and the ALJ\u2019s \u201cobservation of the Claimant [White],\u201d the ALJ found White to have suffered permanent partial disability of 35%.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">Under the provisions of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919(a) and (d), the deputy commissioner has full power and authority \u201cto hear and determine all questions\u201d in respect to claims, and the administrative law judge is vested with all powers and responsibilities statutorily vested in the deputy commissioner with respect to such hearings. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>administrative law judge is thus the finder of the facts with respect to the hearing of claims. In the hearing of White\u2019s claim, the ALJ was not bound to accept the opinion of either of the two physicians. He properly could, as he did, consider and rely upon his own observations and judgment in connection with all of the evidence before him in reaching a finding on the factual issue of the percentage of permanent partial disability suffered by White. <em>Ennis v. O\u2019Hearne, </em>223 F.2d 755, 758 (4th Cir. 1955); <em>Contractors v. Pillsbury, </em>150 F.2d 310 (9th Cir. 1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">As to the second issue, the ALJ <em>merely </em>recited in his opinion and order that \u201cNo interest or statutory penalties are appropriate,\u201d without stating therein why the awarding thereof was inappropriate. The provisions of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(e) require an employer either to compensate a claimant or to file with the deputy commissioner a notice controverting his right to compensation within 14 days after the employer learns of the claimant\u2019s injury, and if he fails so to do, then the assessment of the penalty therein provided is mandatory unless the employer makes a showing that nonpayment is due to conditions beyond the employer's control. <em>Graham, supra </em>at 171; <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, U. S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>594 F.2d 986 (4th Cir. 1979). The ALJ having thus denied assessment of penalty and interest without stating any reason for such denial, and it being requisite to effective appellate review that the ALJ articulate the reason for denial thereof, if any there be, we must and do hereby remand to the Board for such further proceedings to be had as shall be necessary to satisfy that requisite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">White\u2019s attorney has moved for the allowance of an attorney fee for his services incident to appeal here pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a), which provides for allowance of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to counsel of a claimant who has successfully prosecuted his claim after the employer has denied liability for compensation. The procedure prescribed for the allowance of such fees by this court has previously been established in <em>Graham, supra </em>at 171. White\u2019s attorney has substantially complied with that procedure, and the employer has stated that it has no objection to the award of an attorney fee in the amount of $1,160.00, which we find to be reasonable and accordingly award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">We accordingly reverse the decision of the Benefits Review Board and Remand to the Board for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1176-13\">.
