The termination assessment was for the 1977 tax year and totaled $177,484.80. The assessment was satisfied from funds that had been seized by the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency in July of 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">Appellant requested administrative review of the assessment pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429(a)(2). Since the administrative process was not resolved, appellant filed a complaint in the district court pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429(b). The district court found that the making of the assessment was reasonable, but reduced the amount assessed by $21,000. Appellant noticed an appeal from a Statement of Intended Decision and also noticed an appeal from the Judgment Order. Both appeals raise the same issues and have been consolidated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">Appellant claims that the district court erred in several respects. She claims that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429, as applied to the facts of this case, is unconstitutional because it does not fully protect her rights to due process, that the district court erred in admitting appellee\u2019s affidavits into evidence, that the district court erred by determining that the making of the termination assessment was reasonable and by determining that appel-lee met its burden of proof in that regard, and that the district court erred in determining that the amount assessed, as reduced, was appropriate. We do not reach these issues because we have determined that this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain these appeals. We, therefore, dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">Section 7429 provides for summary review of termination and jeopardy assessments. Under \u00a7 7429, a taxpayer is entitled to prompt administrative review by the Internal Revenue Service and judicial review by the district court. Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 7429, taxpayers subjected to termination or jeopardy assessments were not provided with an avenue for speedy judicial review. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 94-938 (Part I), 94th Cong. 2d Sess. 363, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, pp. 2897, 3439, 3792-93. Section 7429 was added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Tax Reform Act of 1976 to alleviate the hardship that could be occasioned by a delay in review. Section 7429(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-16\">\u201cAny determination made by a district court under this section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be reviewed by any other Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">The statutory language is clear; jurisdiction for these appeals is precluded by \u00a7 7429(f). <em>Vicknair v. United States, </em>617 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-18\">Appellant contends that jurisdiction in this Court over the constitutional and evi-dentiary determinations by the district court is not precluded by \u00a7 7429(f) because the constitutional and evidentiary determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>nations can be considered to be determinations which are not made under \u00a7 7429. Appellant urges a narrow reading of \u00a7 7429(f): A narrow reading which would preclude appeals only from district court determinations as to the reasonableness of the making of the termination assessment and the appropriateness of the amount assessed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not adopt that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">The clear intent of Congress was to preclude appeals from district court proceedings under \u00a7 7429. <em>See Vicknair v. United States, supra, </em>at 1131. We will not frustrate that intent by a narrow reading of \u00a7 7429(f). The constitutional and evidentia-ry determinations by the district court are necessarily determinations made under \u00a7 7429. Therefore, we hold that review of the determinations below is precluded by \u00a7 7429. These appeals are, therefore, DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-14\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-15\"><em>\"Determination by the District Court-</em>Within 20 days after an action is commenced .... the district court shall determine whether or not-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-16\">(A) the making of the assessment under Section 6851, 6861, or 6862, as the case may be, is reasonable under the circumstances, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-29\">(B) the amount so assessed or demanded as a result of the action taken under section 6851, 6861, or 6862, is appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
