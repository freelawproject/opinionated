PCME had acquired the assets of a corporate Medicare provider by first purchasing 100 percent of the capital stock of that provider and shortly thereafter liquidating that corporation. The Secretary ruled, for purposes of recognizing a stepped-up basis in computing reimbursements, that this two-step transaction was not a purchase of assets under the Medicare regulations. The District Court reversed the Secretary\u2019s decision. The Court's order enjoined the Secretary from withholding Medicare reimbursements from PCME for not only the year under review, but all subsequent cost-reporting years as well, and directed the method for computation of goodwill. <em>Pacific Coast Medical Enterprises v. Califano, </em>440 F.Supp. 296 (C.D.Cal. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-21\">The Secretary appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We note jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the Secretary erred in treating the transaction as two unrelated events, and that the regulations, when applied to a single acquisition, are not susceptible to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation. We affirm, with minor modification, the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ap2\">A. MEDICARE</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">This case arises under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, known as the Medicare program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395-1395rr. This legislation provides for federal reimbursement of medical care for the aged and certain disabled persons. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395c. It accomplishes this, in part,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> through contractual arrangements with medical facilities to be \u201cproviders\u201d of such medical care. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395cc. These providers afford certain covered medical services to the program\u2019s beneficiaries, for which they receive reimbursement from the Government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">A provider is reimbursed for the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of the services provided, or, if lower, the customary charges for such services.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its 1972 amendments to the Medicare statutes, Congress defined \u201creasonable cost\u201d as \u201cthe cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A). Such actual costs include appropriate allowances for depreciation on buildings and equipment, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.415(a) (1978), and a reasonable return on equity capital, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v) (1)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.429 (1978). Assets and equity capital are valued at their historical cost. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.415(a), (b) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">The actual reimbursement for these costs is usually effected through a \u201cfiscal intermediary.\u201d These private non-government entities are frequently health and accident insurance companies such as \u201cBlue Cross\u201d organizations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The intermediaries serve as HEW\u2019s agents in the day to day administration of the Medicare program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h, making interim monthly payments to providers. At the end of a provider\u2019s fiscal year, the intermediary reviews the provider\u2019s reimbursement claims and makes a final decision on that year\u2019s reimbursable costs. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1803 (1978). If the provider is dissatisfied with the finding, it may request a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The decision of the Board, entered after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>hearing, is final unless the Secretary, \u201con his own motion,\u201d reverses or modifies it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f). The provider has a right to judicial review from the Board\u2019s decision or from the Secretary\u2019s subsequent action. Id</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">B. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The facts of this case are not in dispute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1969, Community Hospital of Los Angeles, a California corporation, was a duly authorized Medicare provider. At that time, PCME was also a provider, but was totally independent of Community Hospital. On May 21, 1969, the stockholders of Community Hospital and PCME entered an agreement under which PCME would acquire 100 percent of the stock of Community Hospital in exchange for approximately $7,000,000 worth of PCME stock. Immediately upon the closing of this exchange of stock, on May 30,1969, PCME made numerous changes in the operation of Community Hospital, including changes of administrator, accountant, attorneys, bank accounts, and directors. Nine months later, on February 25, 1970, PCME liquidated Community Hospital as a corporation, and Community Hospital\u2019s assets were distributed to PCME.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">It was at all times the intent of PCME to acquire the assets of Community Hospital, and the stock acquisition was a preliminary step to the dissolution of the corporation. This two-step method of acquisition was chosen to accommodate the tax planning desires of the former shareholders of Community Hospital, and to avoid an acceleration provision in a mortgage on Community Hospital property. Further, it is stipulated that the exchange of stock was undertaken between unrelated parties in an arm\u2019s length bona fide transaction. There is no dispute over the value of the consideration paid by PCME to the former shareholders of Community Hospital corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">In submitting its cost reports for cost reporting years ended June 30, 1970<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and thereafter, PCME treated the transaction as an acquisition of assets. Such treatment allows PCME to increase (step-up), for Medicare accounting purposes, the value (basis) of the Community Hospital assets to the cost of those assets (including goodwill) to PCME. The basis is stepped up from Community Hospital\u2019s basis \u2014 the cost of the assets to it. Reimbursement claims for depreciation and return on invested capital are calculated using this basis value. As a result of this increased cost basis, PCME may submit higher reimbursement claims for depreciation and return on invested capital than it would if forced to use as a cost basis the original cost of the assets to Community Hospital. The Secretary refused to recognize this form of acquisition as an arm\u2019s length purchase of assets for purposes of Medicare reimbursements, and disallowed PCME\u2019s claims for each of its cost reporting years. The IRS, the SEC, and California\u2019s Commissioner of Corporations, however, did each approve the transaction as such a purchase of assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">On April 28, 1975, PCME appealed the decision concerning its 1973 cost year to the PRRB.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On August 19, 1975, the PRRB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>rendered a decision favorable to PCME\u2019s claim. The Secretary, however, chose to review this decision of the PRRB. On October 17, 1975, the Commissioner of Social Security, duly acting for the Secretary,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> reversed the PRRB and denied PCME\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">C. JUDICIAL REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Asb\">PCME filed for judicial review in the District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>oo </em>(f), under which the Court accepted jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The District Court, reversing the Secretary, held that his<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> refusal to allow a step-up in basis or recognition of goodwill following the two-step transaction was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The District Court remanded the matter to the fiscal intermediary for computation of amounts due PCME, in accordance with the findings of fact and conclusions of law, effectively requiring that the computation be made using the stepped-up basis. One such finding was that goodwill be recognized as the entire difference between the consideration paid for Community Hospital and the value of the Hospital\u2019s tangible assets. The District Court also ordered that PCME was entitled to use the stepped-up basis in post-1973 reporting years.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">On August 22, 1977, the District Court entered a supplemental order granting PCME\u2019s motion for injunction pending appeal. 440 F.Supp. at 310. It enjoined the defendants from withholding further Medicare reimbursements under the terms of its order, for cost reporting years ended June 30, 1973 and thereafter. This order was conditioned upon PCME posting a bond for security equal to 100 percent of the amount to be paid. The Government appeals from the judgment and orders of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">II. THE SECRETARY\u2019S ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The Secretary denied PCME\u2019s reimbursement claims based upon his interpretation and application of certain HEW Medicare regulations. We will preface our analysis with an overview of these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">A. REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AGH\">Among the many regulations the Secretary has promulgated to administer the Medicare program are provisions addressing reimbursement, valuation of assets, and change of ownership of a provider. The Secretary here has applied these regulations so as to deny PCME a stepped-up basis after its two-step acquisition of Community Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">In outlining what is reimbursable, the regulations include costs attributable to long-term assets and capital. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.401-.402 (1978). They provide allowances for depreciation, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 405.415(a), and reasonable return on invested equity capital, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 405.429, (including goodwill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><footnotemark>15</footnotemark>). The amount of such reimbursement depends on the value of the assets, which for these purposes is to be fixed at their historical cost:<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cthe cost incurred by the present owner in acquiring the asset.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405.415(b)(1). In particular, when an ongoing provider is purchased, the cost incurred is the price paid by the purchaser, so long as the sale was bona fide and the price did not exceed the fair market value.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The regulations, however, restrict the use of the purchase price when the provider obtains facilities from an organization owned or controlled by the provider. In these cases, the provider may only claim the cost to the owned or controlled organization, not the cost to the provider from that entity. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427(c)(2).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In the context of the contractual relationship between the Secretary and the provider, the regulations state that the agreement terminates when the ownership of the provider changes. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 405.625. This rule is modified for corporations: \u201cIf the provider is a corporate body, a transfer of corporate stock would not, in itself, constitute a change of ownership for the purpose of section 1866 of the Act.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.-626(c).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Secretary applied these regulations to PCME.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">B. INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"AZX\">The Secretary chose not to view PCME\u2019s two-step transaction as one purchase of an ongoing operation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Instead, he characterized the transaction as two independent events, each to be separately evaluated under the Medicare regulations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\u201cIn establishing the cost basis for a facility purchased as an ongoing operation after July 1, 1966, the price paid by the purchaser shall be the cost basis where the purchaser can demonstrate that the sale was a bona fide sale and the price did not exceed the fair market value of the facility at the time of the sale. . . .\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.415(g) (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">The first event was PCME\u2019s 100 percent stock purchase, to which the Secretary applied \u00a7 405.626(c) (quoted above). Under this application, there was simply a change in Community Hospital\u2019s stockholders with no effect on the Medicare program.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Emphasizing the legal distinction between a corporation and its shareholders, and that shareholders do not own the corporation\u2019s assets, the Secretary concluded that there was no change in ownership of the assets due to the stock purchase. Thus, no revaluation of assets could be allowed at that time.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">The second event was the corporate dissolution of Community Hospital. The Secretary recognized a change in asset ownership when the Community Hospital facilities vested in PCME at liquidation, but also found that Community Hospital was an organization \u201cowned or controlled\u201d by PCME within the meaning of 42 C.F.R. 405.-427(c)(2). Under that regulation, PCME could not claim as its cost what it paid for Community Hospital\u2019s assets, but would be limited to Community Hospital\u2019s cost. Thus, the Secretary concluded, since the assets were acquired from a related organization, there could be no revaluation of assets at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation and application of his agency\u2019s regulations prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>PCME from using the price it paid for the Community Hospital stock as its cost basis for Medicare claims. According to the Secretary\u2019s decision, PCME was denied a step-up in basis in the amount of $6,075,288.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This affected PCME\u2019s depreciation and return on equity claims, reducing by $147,124 the amount of Medicare reimbursement due PCME for the cost year ending June 30, 1973. This decision similarly<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> affects PCME\u2019s reimbursements in all other cost reporting years as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">A. JUDICIAL REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AAe\">In establishing judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s action, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> specifies that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) is to govern the proper scope and standard of that review.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The APA provides that \u201cthe reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, [and] interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,\u201d and that the court must \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; <em>\u201d </em><footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">The primary question before us is whether the Secretary may interpret and apply the Medicare regulations above as he has done in denying PCME\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>erally, when the meaning of a provision within the expertise of an agency is involved, the courts will afford deference to that agency\u2019s construction. In such cases, the agency\u2019s expertise make it particularly suited to interpret the language. This is especially true when an agency\u2019s own regulation is involved, and ordinarily its construction will be affirmed if it is not clearly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 413-14, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945); <em>Montana Power Co. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>608 F.2d 334, 344-45 (9th Cir. 1979). <em>See Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 566, 100 S.Ct. 790, 797, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The deference which a reviewing court is to afford to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations is not total, however. Congress has vested in the court a reviewing function over the action of the agency, including its interpretative decisions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. We would be abdicating our judicial responsibility if we were to pass on the propriety of the Secretary\u2019s interpretation without subjecting it to some degree of scrutiny. As where courts review an agency\u2019s construction of a statute which the agency administers, \u201cthe deference owed to an expert tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia . . . .\u201d <em>American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB, </em>380 U.S. 300, 318, 85 S.Ct. 955, 967, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965); <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Federal Maritime Commission, </em>390 U.S. 261, 88 S.Ct. 929, 19 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1968). Even though the Medicare reimbursement area is complex, and to a great degree left to the Secretary to structure,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> his interpretations are nonetheless subject to our examination.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Our review of the Secretary\u2019s construction of the Medicare regulations concerned here involves several phases. We must first examine the interpretation itself in light of the language of the regulations. The words must be reasonably susceptible to the construction placed upon them by the Secretary, both on their face and in light of their prior interpretation and application. The interpretation must sensibly conform to the purpose and wording of the regulations. <em>Northern Indiana Public Service Co. v. Porter County Chapter of the Izaak Walton League of America, Inc., 423 </em>U.S. 12, 15, 96 S.Ct. 172, 173, 46 L.Ed.2d 156 (1975); <em>Ruangswang v. INS, </em>591 F.2d 39, 43 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Hart v. McLucas, </em>535 F.2d 516, 520 (9th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Second, the Secretary\u2019s construction must be reviewed in relation to the governing statutes. Initially, this will be a factor in determining whether the regulation can bear the interpretation placed upon it. Existing regulations must be construed in light of the statutory mandates under which they issue. Secondly, the statutory authority will also control the substantive review of the Secretary\u2019s new interpretation. Agency regulations must be consistent with and in furtherance of the purposes and policies embodied in the congressional statutes which authorize them. <em>United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 873, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 2156, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977); <em>Manhattan General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, </em>297 U.S. 129, 134, 56 S.Ct. 397, 399, 80 L.Ed. 528 (1936). Those which are not are contrary to law and must be set aside. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Thus, our deference does not extend to agencies\u2019 construction which conflict with statutory directives. <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 237, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1075, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201care not obliged to stand aside and rubber-stamp their affirmance of administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S.Ct. 980, 988, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965). Consequently, if the Secretary\u2019s regulatory interpretations are found to impede or inhibit congressional will, either on their face or as applied, they must be struck down. We now turn to the substance of the Secretary\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">B. CHARACTERIZATION</p>\n<p id=\"A-F\">Resolving whether the PCME transaction should be viewed as a single acquisition or multiple transactions nearly determines our consideration of the Secretary\u2019s decision. Thus, we must examine the threshold question of this characterization before moving to a detailed review of the regulations involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The Secretary has implicitly determined that PCME\u2019s action must be viewed as two independent events, each to receive a separate evaluation under the Medicare regulations. His opinion asserts that \u201c[actually, two separate transactions occurred,\u201d yet it offers forth no reasoning or supporting authority to substantiate this view. Nor did the Secretary in his arguments to this Court present any reason why the transaction should be viewed as two separate events.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Even conceding our desire to accord deference to the Secretary\u2019s judgment, we believe that his view ignores the substance of the transaction. When an agency proposes to define a transaction in a way which deviates from the common understanding, and which is not a definition foreseeably left to the Secretary\u2019s discretion to establish, we must require at least some basis before we can say that such a decision is not arbitrary and irrational. If there were some precedent or prior practice in the Medicare area for this characterization, or even if the Secretary was writing on a clean slate with respect to this type of transaction, we would be inclined to defer to his view. However, such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The characterization of a 100 percent stock purchase and subsequent dissolution is not unique to the Medicare area. It is a question concerning an ordinary business transaction. Its determination does not require expertise in the health care field or in the intricacies of the Medicare reimbursement program. There is no reason to infer that this particular characterization has been specifically left to the unfettered discretion of the Secretary. Moreover, there is no void in other fields with regard to this form of acquisition, for it has been often confronted outside of Medicare.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">The common usage and understanding of this transaction is overwhelmingly contrary to the Secretary\u2019s characterization. First, this method of acquisition is a common occurrence in this country\u2019s corporate business practice and is an accepted method for the purchase of assets. Second, this procedure is recognized as a single transaction in the professional sphere. Generally accepted accounting principles treat this two-step event as a purchase of assets.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Third, this transaction has been viewed as one event in other government contexts, both on the state and the federal level. PCME\u2019s acquisition was approved as a purchase of assets by the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and California\u2019s Commissioner of Corporations, in accordance with their usual treatment of such events.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we note that a characterization which denies that PCME\u2019s transaction was a single action acquiring assets infringes upon the congressional policy that those who partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>pate in Medicare be able to receive reimbursement for reasonable costs and return on equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Congress has by statute declared that Medicare providers should have the opportunity to recover their reasonable costs. Depreciation expense and return on equity are legitimate costs of doing business,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and it is Congress\u2019 desire, as evidenced by statute <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and by implementing regulations<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> that these costs be fully reimbursable. However, unless there is the opportunity for reimbursement for depreciation and return on equity to be based upon the full cost of assets to the present provider, it is not receiving full reimbursement. Thus, to deny such reimbursement to a provider who comes in good faith and engages in a fair, bona fide transaction is inconsistent with Congress\u2019 desire that they have the opportunity to receive full payment.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">PCME had no notice that the method it chose for acquiring Community Hospital would not be accorded full benefits as a purchase of an ongoing provider. It proceeded in good faith \u2014 its choice to structure the purchase as it did was based on considerations independent of the Medicare program. All indications, both within and outside government, suggested that this form of purchase would receive no different treatment than an outright purchase of assets for cash. To deny PCME\u2019s act as a single takeover would impermissibly frustrate congressional policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">We find that the PCME transaction must be considered, for purposes of applying the Medicare regulations, as a single action of acquisition of an ongoing provider, accomplished in two phases. We emphasize that the Secretary is not bound by the practices of other governmental entities or by accounting practice or common usage. However, where there is no internal basis or support nor compelling reason<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> for the Secretary\u2019s action, and it is not clearly committed to his absolute discretion, these external sources are relevant to whether the Secretary acted arbitrarily. We will now proceed to review in accordance with this view the Secretary\u2019s application of the regulations to PCME\u2019s transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">C. APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"APn\">The Secretary\u2019s action is principally the interpretation and application of two Medicare regulations to the present facts. We address each application separately, reviewing them in light of a single takeover transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">1. <em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.626(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">The first regulation which the Secretary invokes is \u00a7 405.626(c).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This regulation provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axz\">\u201cIf the provider is a corporate body, a transfer of corporate stock would not, in itself, constitute a change of ownership for the purpose of section 1866 of the Act. Similarly, a merger of one or more corporations with the participating provider corporation surviving would not generally require a new certification or the execution of a new provider agreement with the surviving entity. . . . \u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.626(c) (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">Section 405.626, however, is not found in the section of regulations concerning reimbursements, but rather it is in Subpart F which governs the contractual relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>between the Secretary and a provider. Specifically, \u00a7 405.626(c) relates to the status of the agreement in the event that any shares of the stock of a corporate provider are traded, and must be read along with the preceding section, \u00a7 405.625. That section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">\u201cA transfer of ownership of a provider of services participating in the health insurance program under an agreement with the Secretary will, under the conditions discussed in section 405.626 render such agreement invalid as between the Secretary and the transferee. In order for the new entity to participate in the program, it must be established that it meets the conditions for participation . . . . \u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.625(a) (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The thrust of these provisions is clear. Upon a change in ownership of a provider, there may be associated changes in staff, management, and possibly facilities. It is essential for the Secretary to be assured that a satisfactory level of medical care will continue to be forthcoming before the new owners are permitted to participate in the Medicare program. This is effectively accomplished by terminating the provider\u2019s contract until the new management qualifies itself to the Secretary\u2019s satisfaction. However, although the exchange of even small amounts of a corporation\u2019s capital stock is technically a change of ownership, the Secretary has recognized that this will not usually affect the management of a provider or the quality of health care administered. Consequently, \u00a7 405.626(c) provides an exception to the contract termination provisions of \u00a7 405.625, so that a transfer of corporate stock will not in itself cause a contract to terminate. The use of the phrase \u201cin itself\u201d further indicates that this section is intended to be applied to routine stock transfers. The phrase leaves open the possibility of a different application when unusual circumstances require. A 100 percent stock purchase is not routine in the realm of ordinary stock trading.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The Secretary refers us to no instances in which \u00a7 405.626(c) has been given any interpretation beyond this contract context, and we have discovered none. The Secretary\u2019s attempt to apply \u00a7 405.626(c) to the acquisition process for valuation of assets and reimbursement purposes goes beyond the narrow context of the regulation. We hold, therefore, that the regulation is not susceptible to the interpretation which the Secretary wishes to impose upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">2. <em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427(c)(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The second half of the regulatory basis for the Secretary\u2019s ruling is found in the related parties rule of \u00a7 405.427(c)(2). This provision states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">\u201cWhere the provider obtains items of services, facilities or supplies from an organization, even though it is a separate legal entity, and the organization is owned or controlled by the owner(s) of the provider, in effect, the items are obtained from itself. . . Therefore, reimbursable cost should include the costs for these items at the cost to the supplying organization. . . . \u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">Section 405.427(c)(2) is intended to prohibit \u201csweetheart contracts,\u201d where a provider effectively purchases goods or services from itself, through an owned or controlled company.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> If allowed to charge the Medicare program the cost of the service charged by the related party, the provider would ultimately be recovering from the Government not merely cost, but profit on the goods or services as well. Section 405.427(c)(2) allows providers to claim only their actual cost, whether it originally was to the provider or to an owned or controlled company.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">When the PCME transaction is viewed as a single acquisition, the Secretary\u2019s application of the related parties provision is inappropriate. The Secretary has stipulated that PCME and Community Hospital, Inc. were unrelated parties engaged in a bona fide arm\u2019s length transaction, and there is no dispute over the value of the consideration paid by PCME. Thus, the Secretary has essentially conceded that the values relevant to PCME\u2019s attempted step-up in basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>are fair, and there is no suggestion that unjustifiable profits are being charged to Medicare by virtue of the price paid for Community Hospital\u2019s assets. PCME\u2019s acquisition simply does not fall within the letter or spirit of this regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">For the reasons expressed above, we must reject the Secretary\u2019s attempt to restrict PCME\u2019s revaluation of assets by an interpretation of the Medicare regulations the Secretary has invoked.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">When the PCME transaction is properly viewed as a single acquisition of assets, the regulations invoked by the Secretary do not bear the application in this context. We find his construction and application to be arbitrary and erroneous, and must set aside his interpretations.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">D. SCOPE OF DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"ABV\">Our decision today is rendered in the context of a transaction which is stipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to be fair, bona fide, and executed at arm\u2019s length between unrelated parties. Nothing in this opinion is intended to prevent the Secretary from continuing to carefully examine the substance of acquisitions made by stock purchase and dissolution. Questions of fair market value and appropriate valuation are likewise properly subjected to his careful scrutiny, and transactions between truly related parties may receive a careful review. We are not minimizing the Secretary\u2019s authority to scrupulously regulate Medicare reimbursements \u2014 we are merely reversing his erroneous assumption that the PCME transaction was not a purchase of an ongoing provider.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In summary, we find that the Secretary\u2019s characterization of the PCME transaction as two independent events, instead of a single purchase of an ongoing provider, was arbitrary, erroneous and irrational. When the PCME transaction is properly viewed as a single purchase, the regulations invoked by the Secretary do not bear the interpretation and application he attempts to place upon them. Thus, the Secretary\u2019s refusal to allow PCME to revalue its assets for Medicare reimbursements was error, and must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">IV. SUBORDINATE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">A. STAY PENDING APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"ALG\">Several subordinate issues have been raised by the Secretary. He argues that the District Court acted improperly in granting injunctive relief in favor of PCME. The order required the Government to prepare an audit of PCME\u2019s claims for the cost reporting year ending June 30, 1973, and subsequent years, and to pay the reimbursement amounts due. This payment order was conditioned upon PCME posting bond for the full amount advanced.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Court simultaneously denied the Secretary\u2019s motion for a stay of the judgment.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The Secretary claims that Rule 62 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> entitled it to a stay of the judgment as of right, that the Court thus improperly denied the Secretary\u2019s motion for stay, and that the Court\u2019s injunction could not be issued under Rule 62(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">We believe the question is controlled by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Klaus v. Hi-Shear Corp., </em>528 F.2d 225 (9th Cir. 1975), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">\u201cThe purpose of an injunction issued pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 62(c) is preservation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>of the status quo until the court of appeals has acted on an appeal from an order granting or denying an injunction. The rule 62(c) injunctions thus have terminated automatically with our disposition of the other appeals. Objections to the validity of a rule 62(c) order could be made only by motion, pending action on the principal appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">It is clear that the District Court found its authority to grant the injunction in Fed.R. Civ.P. 62(e).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> While there appears to be a substantial question as to whether the original judgment of the District Court was one \u201cgranting, dissolving, or denying an injunction,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 62(c), we do not reach this issue. The Secretary\u2019s appeals from the Rule 62(c) injunction are dismissed as moot.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">B. EXTENSION TO POST-1973 YEARS</p>\n<p id=\"Ac-\">Subsumed within this dismissal for mootness are the Secretary\u2019s objections to the District Court\u2019s extending its order to post-1973 cost reporting years. However, these objections go beyond the procedural aspects to questioning the very jurisdiction of the District Court over claims from those later years. Because these issues may arise again should PCME seek additional equitable relief concerning these post-1973 cost reporting years, and do arise in the companion case decided today, we will address the jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">There has been much judicial discussion concerning judicial review of Medicare provider claims,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> so the background will be only briefly related here. In <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), the United States Supreme Court construed \u00a7 205(h) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h), concerning the availability of judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision regarding social security benefits. The section provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQf\">\u201cNo findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal or governmental agency except as herein provided.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR3\">This section has been incorporated by Congress into the Medicare Act, rendering <em>Salfi </em>important precedent for Medicare cases.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">The Supreme Court characterized the statute\u2019s prohibition against review of the Secretary\u2019s benefits decisions as \u201csweeping and direct,\u201d precluding review outside of the procedures established in the Act. The implication of this finding for the Medicare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Act has been enunciated by other courts on several occasions.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> With the \u00a7 205(h) language incorporated into the Medicare provisions, a party is likewise prohibited from seeking judicial review of any claim under the Medicare Act, except under the established review procedures. While this has caused some judicial disagreement concerning pre-1973 claims for which there is no provision for judicial review within the Medicare Act,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Congress\u2019 amendment of the Act to include a path for review now makes that route the exclusive vehicle for appealing the merits of the Secretary\u2019s denial of Medicare reimbursement claims. The Supreme Court in <em>Salfi </em>further ruled that \u00a7 205(h) was not merely a codification of the judicially developed exhaustion doctrine. Rather, it found it to be \u201ca statutorily specified jurisdictional prerequisite\u201d which could not be dispensed with by a \u201cjudicial conclusion of futility.\u201d 422 U.S. at 766, 95 S.Ct. at 2467.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The import of these decisions upon the present case is apparent. Congress has adopted a statutory scheme which provides one route for judicial review, exclusive of all others. It has determined that the Secretary and his delegated review procedure should have the opportunity to fully consider any Medicare benefit claims before they are submitted to a federal court. For the Medicare provider reimbursement claims, the designated avenue to judicial review is prescribed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo and requires appeal to the PRRB, with the Secretary having the opportunity to review the Board\u2019s decision prior to court action.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The application of this requirement is not discretionary with the District Court \u2014 adherence to the procedures of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo is a prerequisite to the Court\u2019s very jurisdiction. Even though the District Court may perceive equities in favor of hearing claims immediately, perhaps even the appearance of futility in forcing a party to pursue the statutory procedure, the District Court is utterly without power to entertain those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The language of \u00a7 205(h) is \u201csweeping and direct,\u201d and may at times require a seemingly unequitable result. However, even in the case of claims which appear to rest upon identical questions of law and fact, these procedures will allow the Secretary to affirm this similarity, or to define and resolve any differences which may not be apparent to the Court. The process of administrative review may also provide the agency, perhaps under a different administrator, to reconsider his original decision. Further, if indeed the subsequent claims are quite similar to the original claim, with no unresolved issues presented, review should be expedited and a minimal burden to the provider. It will be the rare case when administrative review of subsequent years\u2019 similar claims will be both an undue burden and entirely pointless.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The post-1973 claims which were included in the District Court\u2019s Rule 62(c) injunction were not, so far as we can determine, presented to the PRRB. In fact, the cause actually heard before the District Court was limited to a review of the Secretary\u2019s action on the 1973 claim. Thus, the 1973 cost reporting year claim is the only claim which has complied with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo, and, therefore, is the only claim upon which the District Court has jurisdiction to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">We do not believe that this ruling should cause undue delay in resolution of PCME\u2019s post-1973 year claims. We are confident that the Secretary will apply our rulings in good faith and with expediency. If in fact the only issue in dispute between the Secretary and PCME in these later claims is the question of revaluation which we decide today, we would expect payment to be made promptly, vitiating any need to appeal to the PRRB at all. And if there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>other factors complicating those claims, then it would not be appropriate, even absent the jurisdictional bar, for the District Court to consider them prior to exhaustion of administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">C. GOODWILL</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Regarding the issue of how goodwill should be calculated, we believe that the District Court\u2019s order was overbroad, although in this case it may ultimately make no difference. The District Court found that goodwill should be calculated as \u201cthe entire excess of the amount of consideration paid for Community Hospital over the fair market value of the tangible assets of Community Hospital.\u201d <em>Pacific Coast, </em>440 F.Supp. at 307. From our reading of the record, it appears that the question of how specifically to calculate goodwill was not presented to the District Court. Rather, goodwill was present in the District Court\u2019s proceedings only to the extent that it was a part of the equity capital that PCME claimed should have been revalued at the price it paid for Community Hospital. The District Court\u2019s judgment should have been limited to declaring that PCME was entitled to the revaluation, and that goodwill was properly includable within the amount of equity capital to be revalued. However, as we indicate more generally below, we are in agreement with the spirit of the District Court\u2019s ruling. Insofar as the District Court\u2019s formula reflects the computation applicable in the case of a regular purchase of an ongoing Medicare provider, it will be applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The purchase of an ongoing Medicare provider is not an uncommon event, and the Secretary has provided regulations dealing with the occurrence. In PCME\u2019s case, the Secretary has unreasonably chosen to treat the transaction differently. In these proceedings, we are not concerned with the specifics of how assets are valued nor with how amounts are calculated. Rather, we have addressed the Secretary\u2019s microscopic treatment of this two-step acquisition. Our findings and conclusions indicate that PCME\u2019s situation should not be treated differently from other cases where an ongoing provider\u2019s ownership has changed hands, with respect to valuation of PCME\u2019s assets. This identifies the applicable basis for treatment, and we leave it to the Secretary and his agents to properly apply the rules and regulations to determine the appropriate amounts to ultimately pay PCME.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">In conclusion, we find that the PCME transaction must be viewed as a single event, one purchase of an ongoing Medicare provider. As such, the Secretary\u2019s interpretations of the regulations he invokes are arbitrary, erroneous and irrational, and must be set aside. The District Court\u2019s order for computation of goodwill is modified to prescribe the computation normally applied when the facility of an ongoing Medicare provider is purchased. Other computations and resolution of PCME\u2019s claims based upon the revaluation issue shall proceed similarly. The cause is remanded to the District Court for such proceedings and remands as it shall deem appropriate, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-12\">. An entity is an authorized Medicare provider by virtue of a contract, called an 1866 agreement, between it and the Secretary. Such contracts arise under \u00a7 1866 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395cc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-22\">. PCME petitioned the District Court for review of agency action concerning cost reporting years ending June 30, 1970, 1971,1972, and 1973. The District Court dismissed the claims for pre-1973 cost reporting years for want of jurisdiction. The Court ruled in favor of PCME on the 1973 claims. PCME appealed from the dismissal of the pre-1973 claims, and the Secretary cross-appealed from the decision on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>merits. This Court, by order filed July 10, 1979, transferred the pre-1973 claims to the United States Court of Claims, thus mooting PCME\u2019s appeal. This decision, therefore, addresses only the Secretary\u2019s cross-appeal of the District Court\u2019s decision on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">.

PCME filed its first cost report with the Secretary on June 30, 1969, the end of PCME\u2019s fiscal year, seeking Medicare reimbursements for the operation of Community Hospital during the month of June. On May 31, 1969, Community Hospital\u2019s former accountants had filed a cost report for Community Hospital to terminate the old corporation\u2019s participation in the Medicare program. The defendants did not accept either of these cost reports because they did not recognize the sale of Community Hospital\u2019s stock as a change of ownership of the provider facility. After the dissolution of the Community Hospital corporation in February of 1970, the final report for that corporation was accepted. Simultaneously, a new provider agreement was entered into by PCME, as the new provider, and the Secretary. Consequently, PCME\u2019s first accepted cost report as a Medicare provider was for the cost reporting year ended June 30, 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b231-15\">.

The Secretary suggests that rejection of his interpretation will allow providers to avoid repayment of accelerated depreciation. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) (1978); note 39, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b237-20\">. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.626(c) (1978).

Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945), and its progeny, is misplaced. First, in light of the Secretary\u2019s mischaracterization of the PCME transaction, see Part III \u2014 B, <em>infra, </em>we do find the Secretary\u2019s interpretation inconsistent with the regulations and clearly erroneous. <em>Bowles </em>at 413-15, 65 S.Ct. at 1217. Second, in the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent statements on deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations, it has emphasized the prior consistent construction and application of such regulations. <em>Udall v. Tailman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). For example, in <em>Udall </em>the court noted: \u201cThe Secretary\u2019s interpretation had, long prior to respondents\u2019 applications, been a matter of public record and discussion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 85 S.Ct. at 802. <em>See Northern Indiana Public Service Co. v. Porter County Chapter of the Izaak Walton League of America, Inc., </em>423 U.S. 12, 15, 96 S.Ct. 172, 173, 46 L.Ed.2d 156 (1975); <em>Ehlert v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 99, 105, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 1323, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971); <em>McLaren v. Fleischer, </em>256 U.S. 477, 480-81, 41 S.Ct. 577, 578, 65 L.Ed. 1052 (1921). As is discussed in the text, there was no notice or suggestion of any kind that the Secretary would apply the policy he did. And because we find the Secretary\u2019s interpretation to be arbitrary, erroneous and irrational, there is no inconsistency between our decision today and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhoilin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 566, 100 S.Ct. 790, 797, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980). The Secretary suggests that affirmation of the District Court will cause administrative difficulties with respect to stock purchases of less than 100 percent and long delays between stock purchase and liquidation. These permutations are not before us and are not relevant to the merits of the present case. The Secretary is empowered to promulgate appropriate regulations to deal with such occurrences, as, for example, has been done by the Internal Revenue Service. <em>See, e. g\u201e </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 334(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The Secretary also asserts that affirmation will allow parties to avoid the recoupment of depreciation payments made to the acquired company which turn out to be in excess of the actual depreciation. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.415(d)(3) (1978). Again, the Secretary can develop regulations to deal fairly with this situation. As for the present case, it appears that PCME has paid, or has offered to pay, the recoupment due upon their purchase of Community Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b239-11\">. The Secretary here may be attempting to use these regulations as a vehicle to implement a new substantive policy concerning acquisitions. This view finds support in a letter which preceded the Secretary\u2019s decision. This letter was written in 1974 by the Deputy Director for Program Policy of the Bureau of Health Insurance, a Mr. Irwin Woikstein, to a fiscal intermediary administrator. The letter set forth BHI\u2019s \u201cpolicy concerning when assets may be revalued and when goodwill is established in corporate transactions occurring before August 1970.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It proceeded to describe several forms of corporate acquisitions, announcing the reimbursement policy in each case. Stock purchase and dissolution were characterized as two separate events, and not permitting revaluation. In announcing this policy, the Woikstein letter makes no citation to Medicare regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">If considered a promulgation of substantive policy, the Secretary\u2019s action is procedurally inadequate. The APA requires agencies to publish \u201cstatements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability\u201d in the Federal Register before they can be invoked. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1), (a)(1)(D) (1976). The Secretary\u2019s decision is clearly intended to be of general applicability, <em>Homan &amp; Crimen, Inc. v. Califano, </em>[1978] CCH Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide, 29, 213 (W.D.Tex.), <em>appeal docketed. </em>No. 78-3364 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Memorial, Inc. v. Califano, </em>No. CV 76-3517 RMT (C.D.Cal., March 30, 1978), <em>aff'd </em>(9th Cir. 1980), and there is no dispute in this case that PCME had no actual notice of what the Secretary\u2019s treatment of its transaction would be. Therefore, even if the Secretary\u2019s decision is viewed as a promulgation of policy and not as an attempt to interpret agency regulations, his action must be set aside. <em>See Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 232-35, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1073-74, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974); <em>St. John\u2019s Hickey Memorial Hospital, Inc. v. Califano, </em>599 F.2d 803, 814 (7th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b240-5\">. We do not today reach the question of whether the Secretary is absolutely prohibited from enacting a policy against revaluation of assets when they are acquired by stock purchase and subsequent dissolution. Whether a properly promulgated policy specifying approved methods of acquiring Medicare providers would be inconsistent with the governing congressional statutes is left for a case in which it is properly presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b240-6\">. <em>Pacific Coast Medical Enterprises v.
