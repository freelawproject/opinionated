We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-5\">Increased duty on sugar imported by Westway Trading Corp. (\u201cWestway\u201d) was assessed by the Customs Service under PP 4463.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Westway claims that its sugar was exempt under PP 4466 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the increase. The sugar in question was laded at the port of Salaverry, Peru. The ship departed Sa-laverry on September 18, 1976, and proceeded to Pimental, Peru, from which it departed for the United States on October 5,1976. On September 21, 1976, PP 4463 was issued increasing the duty on sugar imported into the United States. However, on October 4, 1976, PP 4466 was issued amending PP 4463 by exempting sugar \u201cexported to the United States before 12:01 A.M. .. ., September 21, 1976.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-7\">The Customs Court held that Westway failed to rebut the presumption of correctness attaching to the determination of the District Director of Customs. It stated that by use of the phrase \u201cexported to the United States\u201d the President intended that \u201cexported\u201d be construed as the final act of departing the country of exportation. It based this conclusion on instructions issued on January 24, 1972, by telegram from the Commissioner of Customs (\u201cCommissioner\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> interpreting Additional Duty Order Number 4 (\u201cADO-4\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and on prior decisions and regulations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> interpreting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>phrase \u201cdate of exportation\u201d in customs valuation eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-4\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-5\">Appellant contends that the sugar laded at Salaverry was exported on the date that it left that port and bases its contention on Presidential Proclamation 4074 (\u201cPP 4074\u201d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as modified by Additional Duty Order Number 3 (\u201cADO-3\u201d),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and a Commissioner\u2019s telegram of September 3,1971.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It argues that the language \u201cexported to the United States before\u201d a certain date is common to both PP 4074 (as modified by ADO-3) and PP 4466, which was adopted for the purpose of alleviating hardships to importers; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that, historically, such language has only been used twice and must have been intended to have the same meaning in both instances. Appellant also asserts that prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>decisions interpreting the phrase \u201cdate of exportation\u201d involved valuation cases and were unrelated to an expressed desire of the President to alleviate hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-4\">The Government adopts the rationale of the Customs Court, relying on the Commissioner\u2019s telegram of January 24,1972, interpreting ADO-4, and customs regulations and decisions interpreting \u201cdate of exportation.\u201d It underscores the fact that ADO-4 and the Commissioner\u2019s interpreting telegram of January 24, 1972, were later in time than ADO-3 and the interpreting telegram of September 3, 1971. It argues that the President would have been aware of the conflict between the interpretations of ADO-3 and ADO-4 and that, in using the language \u201cexported to the United States,\u201d he intended the Commissioner\u2019s most recent interpretation to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-5\">The decisive issue is whether Westway has carried its burden of proving that the determination of the District Director of Customs was not correct. A presumption of correctness attaches to the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, who, in this case, was the District Director of Customs. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2635(a) (1970); <em>United States v. Hugo Stinnes Steel &amp; Metals Co., </em>66 CCPA \u2014, \u2014, C.A.D. 1226, 599 F.2d 1037, 1042 (1979). The only evidence of Presidential intent cited by Westway is the earlier and unrepeated interpretation of \u201cdate of exportation\u201d contained in the September 3, 1971, telegram issued by the Commissioner of Customs. All court decisions, regulations, and the more recent Commissioner\u2019s telegram have uniformly interpreted \u201cdate of exportation\u201d to mean the date on which merchandise in issue <em>finally </em>leaves the country of exportation, regardless of departures from intermediate ports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-11\">It was reasonable for the District Director of Customs to infer that the President would have been aware that the Commissioner\u2019s September 3, 1971, telegram interpreting \u201cexported to the United States before\u201d a certain date in ADO-3 was unique and that the case law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> customs regulations,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Commissioner's more recent telegram interpreting \u201cexported to the United States on or after\u201d a certain date in ADO-4 were inconsistent with that interpretation. Also, we note that the telegram interpreting ADO-4 expressly directed that the method authorized in the telegram of September 3, 1971, for determining date of exportation for shipments where goods are laded at multiple ports within a single country was not to be followed. Accordingly, we conclude that the interpretation given ADO-4, and not that given ADO-3, would have been intended by the President when he promulgated PP 4466.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-12\">In view of the foregoing, we hold that Westway failed to carry its burden of proving that the involved sugar was exempt under Presidential Proclamation 4466 from increased duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-13\">The judgment of the Customs Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1493-8\">. 41 Fed.Reg. 41681 (1976).

Since the decision in <em>Froman v.

Walter &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>42 CCPA 114, C.A.D. 582 (1955); <em>Ava-kian Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>41 CCPA 80, C.A.D. 532 (1953). The fact that the cited cases dealt with the determination of \u201cvalue\u201d does not preclude reference to their interpretation of \u201cexported.\u201d In each instance the court is concerned with the definition of a term consistently used in customs law. In addition, this court has approved adopting definitions by analogy to other areas of customs law when necessary to define a term found in a presidential proclamation. <em>United States v.
