We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-20\">Appellants\u2019 tax problems date back to 1973, when the New York City Police Department placed Pasquale Laino under surveillance on suspicion of bookmaking activities. According to the sworn affidavit of Patrolman Robert Patterson, on five days in April beginning on April 2, 1973, Laino was observed receiving slips of paper and money in bill form from a variety of persons at a social club in Brooklyn. In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>typical transaction, a \u201crunner\u201d would enter the premises, hand an envelope or brown paper bag containing the policy slips and cash to Laino, who would then count the money, place the slips behind a counter and stash the bills in his pocket. Late in the afternoon Laino would put all the slips and bills in a large brown paper bag and give the bag to someone else, who would then leave the club and drive off. The affidavit also alleged that on one occasion the large brown paper bag containing the day\u2019s receipts was placed in the trunk of a Cadillac regularly used by Laino, and that on one afternoon late in April, the bag was taken directly to Laino\u2019s residence in Queens. Based on this affidavit, a search warrant issued and a raid of the Laino home took place on May 3,1973. In the course of their search, the police seized 8 banker statements, 142 controller statements, 9 pay and collect slips, 4 controller ribbons, 181 weekly collectors\u2019 records, one adding machine, and $1,713 in currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Pasquale Laino was arrested and indicted on one count of promoting gambling in the second degree and one count of possession of gambling records in the second degree. Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws of N.Y.Ann., \u00a7\u00a7 225.05, 225.15. On January 7, 1974, Laino withdrew his pleas of not guilty and pled guilty to the second count of possession of gambling records. Upon the recommendation of the district attorney, the court accepted the plea. Prior to sentencing, counsel for Laino made the following statement, which we shall relate because of the importance attached to it by appellants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQo\">He has not been previously convicted of any crime. His involvement I can say was a minor one. These were not his personal records. He was an employee of someone making a normal salary for just holding the records. He is not anything big in the hierachy. He is like a middle man. He is gainfully employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">This colloquy continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\"><em>The Court: </em>How old are your children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APl\"><em>The Defendant: </em>The oldest one is eight, six, three and three months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\"><em>The Court: </em>How old are you, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Thirty-three years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABEr\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, I don\u2019t think any useful purpose would be [served by] putting you on probation. If you have been fooling around with policy or gambling, this is the time to stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Laino received a fine of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">On July 20, 1977, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mailed a notice of deficiency to appellants, notifying them of unpaid taxes for 1973 in the amount of $57,677.87 plus interest and penalties. The amount of unreported taxable income was computed as follows: from 5 days of betting slips totall-ing $67,115.70 seized in the raid on Laino\u2019s house, an average per day of $13,423.14 was obtained. This daily average was multiplied by 29 days, yielding a figure for gross receipts equal to $389,271.06. Profits were estimated at thirty-five percent, resulting in unreported net taxable income of $136,-244.87. The tax owing on the Laino\u2019s reported and unreported income was then calculated to be $57,677.87.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">At no time did appellants take advantage of their right to file a petition with the Tax Court seeking redetermination of the deficiency, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213. Subsequently, in December, 1977, the IRS assessed the outstanding taxes, penalty and interest against them, and in March, 1978, filed notice of a tax lien in the office of the Register of Queens County, N.Y., where the Lai-nos\u2019 home is located. Another year passed, and in May, 1979, appellants brought this action in the district court seeking injunc-tive and declaratory relief. Their principal contention below, and again on appeal, was that Pasquale Laino had no proprietary interest in the bookmaking operation but served merely as a bookkeeper at a salary of $150 per week, and that the Commissioner had not presented any evidence of ownership. According to appellants, the Commissioner\u2019s assessment attributing the total profits of the scheme to Laino thus lacked any basis in fact. As noted above, the district court, for reasons which will appear more clearly below, dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Section 7421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a), commonly known as the Anti-Injunction Act (the Act), provides with certain exceptions that \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.\u201d The only statutory exception of which appellants might at one time have availed themselves is that set out in section 6213(a), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a), which prohibits the Commissioner from assessing or collecting a tax prior to the mailing of a notice of deficiency, prior to the expiration of the ninety-day period following such a mailing in which a taxpayer may petition the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency, or prior to the rendering of a final decision of the Tax Court if such a petition has been filed. In these circumstances, if the Commissioner makes an assessment or takes steps to collect a tax, section 6213(a) expressly allows injunctive relief. Appellants, however, have not questioned the validity or the receipt of the notice of deficiency sent to them, nor did they petition the Tax Court during the ninety-day period or at any time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Recognizing the force of this statutory bar to the maintenance of their suit, appellants seek to bring their cause within the judicially created exception to the Anti-Injunction Act articulated in <em>Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., </em>370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962). There the Court announced a two-part test permitting an injunction suit to be maintained \u201cif it is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail,\u201d and if equity jurisdiction otherwise exists. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 82 S.Ct. at 1129.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">[T]he question of whether the Government has a chance of ultimately prevailing is to be determined on the basis of the information available to it at the time of suit. Only if it is then apparent that, under the most liberal view of the law and the facts, the United States cannot establish its claim, may the suit for an injunction be maintained. Otherwise, the District Court is without jurisdiction, and the complaint must be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-9\"><em>Id. </em>Later decisions reaffirming this two-pronged test have noted the \u201calmost literal effect\u201d which <em>Williams Packing </em>gave to the Act, and characterized it as requiring that the Government\u2019s action be \u201cplainly without a legal basis\u201d or have \u201cno chance of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon, </em>416 U.S. 725, 737, 745, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 2046, 2050, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974). <em>See also Alexander v. \u201cAmericans United\u201d Inc., </em>416 U.S. 752, 94 S.Ct. 2053, 40 L.Ed.2d 518 (1974); <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Shapiro, </em>424 U.S. 614, 96 S.Ct. 1062, 47 L.Ed.2d 278 (1976). Appellants\u2019 attempt to invoke <em>Williams Packing </em>must be rejected because they have failed to satisfy either of its prerequisites, namely, a showing of equity jurisdiction or that \u201cunder no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Appellants assert that the one legal remedy still open to them \u2014 a refund suit which would require that they first pay in full the amount assessed against them by the Commissioner, <em>see Flora v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 145, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960) \u2014is inadequate because they are financially unable to \u201cpay first and litigate later.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 80 S.Ct. at 642. Moreover, they assert that if the IRS were to foreclose upon their house, in which they reside with their five minor children, they would suffer irreparable harm. Accepting these contentions as true for the purpose of argument, and acknowledging that no judge could regard with enthusiasm the prospect of the dispossession of a family of seven, we nevertheless must view the adequacy of appellants\u2019 legal remedies in the light of all the remedies afforded them by the Internal Revenue Code. From this perspective, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>decisive that appellants failed to exhaust their legal remedies by neglecting to petition the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213. Unlike a refund suit, a petition under section 6213 allows the taxpayer to litigate first and pay, if necessary, later. Appellants here have utterly failed to explain why they chose not to follow this generous avenue of relief. Under these circumstances, appellants cannot be heard to complain they now lack an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The case law supports this position. In <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Shapiro, supra, </em>a jeopardy assessment case in which the taxpayer sought injunctive relief while his petition before the Tax Court was still pending, the Court observed that if \u201cthe absence of a remedy at law at this time is due to respondent\u2019s failure to pursue that remedy, then equity will not intervene and the complaint should be dismissed. The inadequacy of his legal remedy would then be due to his own choice not to pursue it.\u201d 424 U.S. at 634 n. 15, 96 S.Ct. at 1074 n. 15. Likewise, in <em>Alexander v. \u201cAmericans United\u201d Inc., supra, </em>it was said: \u201cA taxpayer cannot render an available review procedure an inadequate remedy at law by voluntarily forgoing it.\u201d 416 U.S. at 762 n. 13, 94 S.Ct. at 2059 n. 13. <em>See Graham v. Du Pont, </em>262 U.S. 234, 256, 43 S.Ct. 567, 569, 67 L.Ed. 965 (1923); <em>Black v. United States, </em>534 F.2d 524, 527 (2 Cir. 1976); <em>County of Los Angeles v. Marshall, </em>442 F.Supp. 1186, 1189 n. 1 (D.D.C.1977); <em>Smaldone v. Kurtz, </em>450 F.Supp. 1138,1140 (D.D.C. 1978). Thus, taxpayers who-like appellants-failed to file a timely petition before the Tax Court for preassessment relief have been held unable to satisfy the prerequisites to equity jurisdiction .necessary to overcome the barrier of the Anti-Injunction Act. <em>Bowen v. United States, </em>331 F.2d 149, 150 (5 Cir. 1964) (per curiam); <em>Walker v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>333 F.2d 768, 771 (9 Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 926, 85 S.Ct. 910, 13 L.Ed.2d 811 (1965); <em>Boren v. Riddell, </em>56-2 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 9883 (S.D.Cal.1956), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>241 F.2d 670 (9 Cir. 1957); <em>Cooper Agency v. McLeod, </em>247 F.Supp. 57, 61 (E.D.S.C.1965). <em>See </em>9 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 49.210, at 49-347 (1977). Equity jurisdiction has also been held not to exist when the taxpayer simultaneously petitions the Tax Court for a redetermination of deficiency while seeking an injunction in the district court, <em>Blech </em>v. <em>United States, </em>595 F.2d 462, 467 (9 Cir. 1979), and to terminate when, after suit is begun in the district court, the Commissioner issues a notice of deficiency allowing the taxpayer to pursue Tax Court review. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>374 F.Supp. 1113, 1114 (S.D.Cal. 1974).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Our conclusion that appellants\u2019 failure to petition the Tax Court pursuant to section 6213 is dispositive of this appeal gains reinforcement from an understanding of the legislative history of that provision, first enacted in 1924. The House Report explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The Committee recommends the establishment of a Board of Tax Appeals [now the Tax Court] to which a taxpayer may appeal prior to the payment of an additional assessment of income, excess-profits, war-profits, or estate taxes. Although a taxpayer may, after payment of his tax, bring suit for the recovery thereof and thus secure a judicial determination on the questions involved, he cannot, in view of section 3224 of the Revised Statutes [the Anti-Injunction Act], which prohibits suits to enjoin the collection of taxes, secure such a determination prior to the payment of the tax. The right of appeal after payment of the tax is an incomplete remedy, and does little to remove the hardship occasioned by an incorrect assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">H.Rep.No. 179, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1924), <em>reprinted in </em>Cum. Bull. 1939-1, Pt. 2, at 246-47. Four years later Congress modified the predecessor of section 6213, by inserting a narrow exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, described above, which countenanced injunctive relief to restrain the Commissioner from assessing or collecting a tax before the mailing of a notice of deficiency, before the expiration of the period for filing a Tax Court petition, or if a petition were filed, before the decision of the Tax Court became final. Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 852. Thus it appears that the potential difficulty inherent in a refund suit, the very hardship of which appellants complain here, was an evil which Congress sought to overcome not by dissolving the bar of the Anti-Injunction Act altogether, but by providing for pre-payment review of the Commissioner\u2019s determination. The exception to the Act which accompanied this legislative solution was a limited one, designed solely to protect the taxpayer\u2019s right to seek Tax Court review before paying any assessment. It would be a patent violation of this legislative plan were we to encourage taxpayers to spurn redetermination by the Tax Court and to come instead into equity complaining of the hardship of a refund suit. <em>See Flora v. United States, supra, </em>362 U.S. at 175, 80 S.Ct. at 645.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">We hold alternatively that even if equity jurisdiction were established, the complaint would have to be dismissed because appellants have not shown that under no circumstances could the Government prevail on the merits. Appellants insist that Pasquale Laino was but a low-salaried scribe without any proprietary interest in the bookmaking operation. In support of this view, they rely chiefly on the \u201cunchallenged\u201d assertion by Laino\u2019s attorney immediately prior to sentencing that Laino was \u201can employee of someone making a normal salary for just holding the records,\u201d and not \u201canything big in the hierarchy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s silence in the face of these self-serving statements cannot be said to establish their veracity. As noted above, Laino was indicted on two counts and originally pled not guilty to both. As a result of plea bargaining, the prosecutor apparently decided to drop the count of promoting gambling in return for a guilty plea to the second count of possession of gambling records. The gist of the offense charged in the dropped count was knowingly advancing or profiting from illegal gambling activity. When Laino\u2019s counsel made the statements in question, implying that Laino had not shared in the gambling profits, the prosecutor had just recommended to the court that the plea be accepted. Under these circumstances it was not to be expected that the prosecutor would accuse Laino of a role in the gambling ring more appropriately described in the count he had agreed to drop. In effect, appellant would have us treat Laino\u2019s guilty plea to the second count as establishing his innocence on the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Apart from the dialogue at Laino\u2019s sentencing, appellants contend that the record is devoid of any evidence of a proprietary interest in the illegal operation on Lai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>no\u2019s part. Again we disagree. Under New York\u2019s standards, Laino\u2019s indictment for knowingly advancing or profiting from unlawful gambling activity could not have issued unless the grand jury considered the evidence sufficient, if unexplained or un-contradicted, to justify a jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>People v. Potwora, </em>44 A.D.2d 207, 354 N.Y.S.2d 492 (1974); <em>People v. Phillips, </em>14 Misc.2d 565, 177 N.Y.S.2d 804 (1958); and an indictment is presumed valid until properly impeached. <em>People v. Nitzberg, </em>289 N.Y. 523, 47 N.E.2d 37 (1943). The affidavit of Patrolman Patterson, the truthfulness of which appellants do not dispute, indicates that Laino was observed on numerous occasions receiving, counting, and safeguarding policy slips and what must have been large amounts of currency, a risk-laden task of central importance, one would think, to the gambling ring\u2019s success. In addition, the police surveillance revealed that a car regularly used by Laino was involved in transporting the day\u2019s receipts and that on at least one occasion, the large brown paper bag was delivered to his home. At the time of the raid, police discovered in the Laino residence a variety of gambling paraphernalia, as well as $1,713, a large amount of cash for a man allegedly earning $150 a week. While this evidence is not free from ambiguity, it was sufficient to allow the Commissioner to conclude that Laino occupied a role in the bookmaking operation likely to have netted him substantial income. To be sure, the same facts may also be consistent with a picture of Laino as the small fry who got nabbed while the big fish got away, but this does not suffice to meet appellants\u2019 burden. We have been instructed to take the view of the facts that is most liberal to the Commissioner, not to the taxpayer seeking injunctive relief. <em>See Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., supra, </em>370 U.S. at 7, 82 S.Ct. at 1129. Under this standard, we cannot say that the Government has \u201cno chance of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 745, 94 S.Ct. at 2050.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The cases relied on by appellants support only the proposition that when the Commissioner\u2019s assessment is lacking in any factual basis whatsoever, the <em>Williams Packing </em>requirement is satisfied. In <em>Pizzarello v. United States, </em>408 F.2d 579 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 986, 90 S.Ct. 481, 24 L.Ed.2d 450 (1969), the taxpayer had been indicted for illegally accepting wagers during a two-week period in 1965. The Commissioner, however, without any foundation in fact, assessed the wagering tax for a five-year period dating back to 1960, and we accordingly rejected the assessment as totally excessive because based on entirely inadequate information. 408 F.2d at 584.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Willits v. Richardson, </em>497 F.2d 240 (5 Cir. 1974), the Commissioner based his assessment on alleged sales of cocaine even though the evidence, \u201cscanty and largely inaccurate ... at best, amounted to nothing more than a vague suspicion\u201d that the taxpayer had acquired certain assets by im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>proper means. <em>Id. </em>at 245. <em>Gerardo v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>552 F.2d 549 (3 Cir. 1977), <em>Carson v. United States, </em>560 F.2d 693 (5 Cir. 1977), and <em>De Cavaleante v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>620 F.2d 23 (3 Cir. 1980) \u2014 refund suits or cases on appeal from the Tax Court and not injunction suits \u2014 were all actions in which the Commissioner failed to produce any evidence tending to show that the taxpayers engaged in gambling activities during portions of the periods for which taxes were said to be due. <em>See also Rinieri v. Scanlon, </em>254 F.Supp. 469 (S.D.N.Y.1966). In <em>Weimerskirch v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>596 F.2d 358 (9 Cir. 1979), a drug-income case on appeal from the Tax Court, the Commissioner had declined to introduce any evidence at all, choosing to rest instead on the presumption of the correctness of his determination. As we have established that the Commissioner did have a sufficient factual basis for concluding that Laino was a major figure in the gambling scheme, these cases are inapposite. Furthermore, the cases cited are uniformly concerned with the sufficiency of the evidence establishing the taxpayer\u2019s connection during a particular time period to the tax-generating, illegal activities. Appellants admit that Laino was involved in the bookmaking operation during the time in question, and in their brief and argument to this court, they have not questioned the Commissioner\u2019s determination that twenty-nine days in April and May of 1973 constitute an appropriate interval.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They dispute only Laino\u2019s status in the criminal hierarchy, an issue on which no case cited to us has reversed the Commissioner\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The decision of the Fifth Circuit in <em>Lucia v. United States, supra, </em>likewise does not advance appellants\u2019 cause. In that case, although there was ample evidence of the taxpayer\u2019s involvement in wagering activities, the court of appeals reversed and remanded to the district court to determine whether the method of computation, which projected one day\u2019s receipts over four-and-a-half years, was arbitrary and capricious. Appellants have not drawn the Commissioner\u2019s computational method into controversy, and indeed they would have been hard pressed to find fault with the extrapolation of five days\u2019 betting slips over twenty-nine days, especially given the regularity of the operation observed by the police. <em>See De Lorenzo v. United States, </em>555 F.2d 27, 29 (2 Cir. 1977); <em>Hamilton v. United States, </em>309 F.Supp. 468, 472-74 (S.D.N.Y.1969), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>429 F.2d 427 (2 Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 913, 91 S.Ct. 881, 27 L.Ed.2d 812 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Our decision that appellants have failed to show the impossibility of the Government\u2019s succeeding on the merits is fully in accord with the Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s purpose of permitting the United States \u201cto assess and collect taxes alleged to be due without judicial intervention.\u201d <em>Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., supra, </em>370 U.S. at 7, 82 S.Ct. at 1129.

Foley, </em>404 F.2d 1215 (2 Cir. 1968), <em>on rehearing, </em>408 F.2d 1331 (2 Cir. 1969), cited by counsel for appellants at oral argument, has no application to the facts of this case. There the plaintiff had not received actual notice of the deficiency until after the ninety-day period for petitioning the Tax Court had expired. Even more significantly, the plaintiff alleged that the joint notice of deficiency sent to her estranged husband was not legally effective with respect to her, the original joint returns either having been forged by the husband or signed under duress and therefore invalid. We remanded to the district court for further findings on the forgery and duress allegations upon the theory that if the facts alleged by the plaintiff were true, her remedy of petitioning the Tax Court for a rede-termination of the deficiency had been foreclosed, since she had received neither actual nor legal notice. Here, appellants have not disputed the validity of the notice sent to them, nor their actual receipt of it. Neither has appellant Minerva Laino claimed that she did not voluntarily join in the joint tax return for 1973. Given these critical factual dissimilarities, <em>Bauer </em>cannot be considered as supporting appellants\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">It is worth noting that although the <em>Bauer </em>court discussed the case in terms of the judicially created exception to the Anti-Injunction Act delineated in <em>Enochs v. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., supra, </em>this was unnecessary; if the joint notice of deficiency was defective, the plaintiff\u2019s request for injunctive relief could have been granted pursuant to the exception to the Anti-Injunction Act contained in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">. Our conclusion that appellants inexcusably bypassed an adequate legal remedy makes it unnecessary to determine whether in the circumstances of this case, a refund suit afforded them another adequate remedy at law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b736-4\">. We note in passing that <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Shapiro, supra, </em>while reaffirming the holding of <em>Williams Packing, </em>intimated that the Commissioner might be obliged to disclose facts amounting to \u201cprobable cause\u201d to support his determination, 424 U.S. at 633, 96 S.Ct. at 1073; <em>see Schildcrout v. McKeever, </em>580 F.2d 994, 997 (9 Cir. 1978), a standard arguably less favorable to the Government than that stated in <em>Williams Packing, see </em>424 U.S. at 634-35, 96 S.Ct. at 1074 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Blackmun). We have no occasion here to consider whether <em>Shapiro </em>weakened the <em>Williams Packing </em>test since the facts adduced by the Government would pass muster under a probable cause standard as well as under the language of <em>Williams Packing.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\">. The opinion in <em>Pizzarello </em>also took a skeptical view of the Commissioner\u2019s method of computation, 408 F.2d at 583-84, and further ruled that evidence obtained from an unlawful search could not be used to support an assessment. <em>Id. </em>at 584-86. Although the precedential force of the <em>Pizzarello </em>court\u2019s comments as to computation would seem to be eroded by our subsequent decision in <em>Hamilton v. United States, </em>429 F.2d 427 (2 Cir. 1969) (per curiam) (affirming 309 F.Supp. 468 (S.D.N.Y.1969)), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 913, 91 S.Ct. 881, 27 L.Ed.2d 812 (1971), despite our disclaimer, <em>id. </em>at 427, this is an issue we need not address, since in the instant case the Commissioner\u2019s method of calculation is not disputed, <em>see </em>our discussion of <em>Lucia v. United States, </em>474 F.2d 565 (5 Cir. 1973) (en banc), <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\">. In their complaint, appellants initially attacked as erroneous the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Laino was involved in gambling activities for the twenty-nine-day period, but they did not pursue the point. The period between the first police surveillance of Laino\u2019s gambling activities on April 2, 1973, and the raid on the Laino house on May 3 encompassed thirty-two days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b737-11\">. Appellants attempt to color their complaint as an action to quiet title under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(a). Because they clearly seek to attack the validity of the underlying assessment, our decision in <em>Falik v. United States, </em>343 F.2d 38 (2 Cir. 1965), presents an insurmountable barrier to this effort to circumvent the Anti-Injunction Act. <em>See </em>9 Mertens, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 54.60.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
