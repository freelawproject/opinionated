Plaintiff-appellant Charles Chulchian was denied a license to operate a movie theatre under the ordinance.

The theatre exhibits sexually explicit films. In years prior to 1979, Chulchian sought and obtained a license from the City. Chulchian\u2019s application for his 1979 license, however, was denied first by the license administrator and, after a hearing, by the controller. Both the administrator and the controller stated two reasons for refusing Chulchian\u2019s license. Both stated that Chulchian violated section 17-6(4) of the ordinance because there were at least ten arrests on the premises for \u201cillegal, immoral or obscene conduct.\u201d Second, they stated that the \u201cresidents of the area consider the Rivoli \u2018to create a nuisance,\u2019 \u201d in violation of section 17-6(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Chulchian then filed this suit, attacking the constitutionality of the licensing ordinance and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The License Review Board voluntarily stayed its consideration of Chulchian\u2019s appeal pending the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">On Chulchian\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court ruled that certain sections of the licensing ordinance were unconstitutional. <em>Evansville Book Mart, Inc. v. City of Indianapolis, </em>477 F.Supp. 128 (S.D.Ind.1979). The court first reviewed the arrests constituting the \u201cillegal, immoral or obscene conduct\u201d allegedly permitted by appellant. The arrests were made pursuant to Indianapolis Code \u00a7 20-44, the \u201cobscene conduct ordinance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>ruling on the ordinance\u2019s constitutionality, the court held it invalid under Indiana law as an attempted local law. <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The court next considered Chulchian\u2019s challenges to the two sections on which the controller based denial of his license. The court struck down section 17-31(c)(6) of the ordinance, which permits the controller</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnM\">to take into consideration the effect of the proposed business or calling upon surrounding property and upon residents or inhabitants thereof; and in granting, denying or revoking said license the controller may exercise his sound discretion as to whether said license should be granted, transferred, denied or revoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Code of Indianapolis \u00a7 17-31(c)(6). The court held the section \u201cunconstitutional due to its lack of guiding standards for the licensing officials.\u201d 477 F.Supp. at 132-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The second section provides that a licensee shall \u201c[n]ot permit any sort of illegal, immoral or obscene conduct or practices to take place on his premises or in the conduct of his business.\u201d Code of Indianapolis \u00a7 17-6(4). The City conceded, and the court ruled, that the use of the words \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d was unconstitutional. 477 F.Supp. at 131. The court upheld the rest of the ordinance \u201cbecause it is content neutral in that it does not single out adult theatres, and is the expression of an equally legitimate City concern, the City\u2019s interest in preventing the licensing of businesses the owners of which permit illegal occurrences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132. The court ruled that the City may constitutionally deny a license on the basis of illegal conduct other than prior convictions for showing obscene films. The court stated that it did not \u201chave before it documentation of arrests under valid statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court nevertheless denied appellant\u2019s request to order the issuance of a license because of representations by the City that \u201cother arrests for violations of valid state statutes had been made recently at the theatre.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also upheld as constitutionally sufficient the procedures governing the decision of the controller and the License Review Board. <em>Id. </em>at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Chulchian appeals, first, the district court\u2019s order upholding the \u201cpermitting illegal conduct\u201d portion of section 17-6(4); second, the court\u2019s ruling upholding the constitutionality of the procedures governing the controller\u2019s decision of the License Review Board; and third, the court\u2019s refusal to order the City to issue him a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">At the outset, we must resolve the procedural posture of this suit. A license to do business in Indianapolis is effective for only one year. We did not hear oral argument until April 1980, after appellant\u2019s 1979 license would have expired. The License Review Board, which had agreed to stay consideration of appellant\u2019s appeal until this court rendered its decision, dismissed Chul-ehian\u2019s appeal. The present appeal is not moot, however, because appellant\u2019s application for a 1980 license has also been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">The License Administrator denied appellant\u2019s application on the grounds that his 1979 license had been denied and that under section 17-6(2) the operation of his business constituted a nuisance. These reasons are substantially the same as those advanced to deny appellant\u2019s 1979 license. We therefore consider the merits of appellant\u2019s case as a situation \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 125, 93 S.Ct. 705, 713, 35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), <em>quoting Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. I.C.C., </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The district court\u2019s decision striking the words \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201cimmoral\u201d from section 17-6(4) is not challenged by the parties. As construed by the district court, the section now reads that a licensee \u201cshall not permit any sort of illegal conduct or practices to take place . . . . \u201d Appellant argues that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because \u201cpermit\u201d is undefined and because the type of illegal conduct which will justify denial is not specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Although the ordinance has not been authoritatively construed by the Indiana courts, the body charged with its enforcement, the City, has provided a narrowing construction of the statute. See Law <em>Students Civil Rights Research Council, Inc. v. Wadmond, </em>401 U.S. 154, 162-63, 91 S.Ct. 720, 726, 27 L.Ed.2d 749 (1971). The City first concedes that it cannot deny a license based on conduct beyond the licensee\u2019s control. The City acknowledges that section 17-6(4) requires knowledge of the illegal conduct by the licensee. We agree that such a construction sufficiently clarifies \u201cpermit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">We also agree that the ordinance has standards for its enforcement. The ordinance prohibits a licensee from knowingly allowing any illegal activity, <em>i. e., </em>any violation of law. It is hornbook law that all persons are deemed to have notice of the law. Other laws which similarly impose liability for violations of law have been upheld from vagueness attacks. <em>See, e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Polizzi, </em>500 F.2d 856, 874-75 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1121, 95 S.Ct. 802, 42 L.Ed.2d 820 (1975). (Interstate Travel Act.) <em>Compare Entertainment Concepts, Inc., III v. Maciejewski, </em>631 F.2d 497 (7th Cir. 1980) (no definition of \u201cadult\u201d in zoning ordinance). While the ordinance grants discretion to the controller and the License Review Board to consider the quantity and quality of illegal conduct, it is not vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Chulchian next challenges section 17-6(4) as an impermissible regulation of his movie theatre. Chulchian asserts that the ordinance impermissibly treads on constitutionally protected speech because it authorizes the closing of his theatre if he permits illegal conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\"> Businesses which deal in material protected by the First Amendment, for example bookstores and theatres, are not immune from all regulation. They can be subject to the usual panoply of health, safety, licensing, and zoning regulations as all other businesses. <em>See Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 62, 79, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2448, 2456, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (Powell, J., concurring) (1976); <em>Genusa v. City of Peoria, </em>619 F.2d 1203, 1214, 1218 (7th Cir. 1980). Enforcement of the ordinance here, however, implicates First Amendment rights. The four part test of <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), therefore governs our review. Under that test, a governmental regulation is justified, despite its incidental impact on speech,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-13\">if it is within the constitutional power of the Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 377, 88 S.Ct. at 1679. We hold that section 17-6(4), as now construed, meets all these requirements. Consequently, we hold that enforcement of the ordinance by denial of a license is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">First, the section applies to all businesses in Indianapolis. Although it covers theatres, it does not regulate them based on content. <em>Compare Entertainment Concepts, Inc., III v. Maciejewski; Genusa v. City of Peoria. </em>The Indianapolis provision is typical of many municipal licensing ordinances which hold the operator responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>for conduct on the premises. <em>See, e. g., James Bakalis &amp; Nickie Bakalis, Inc. v. Simonson, </em>434 F.2d 515, 519 (D.C.Cir.1970) (liquor license ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The district court held the ordinance valid as fulfilling \u201cthe City\u2019s interest in preventing the licensing of businesses the owners of which permit illegal occurrences.\u201d 477 F.Supp. at 132. The ordinance serves the dual goal of encouraging business responsibility and protecting patrons who frequent the premises. The City may reasonably desire to protect the health, safety, and welfare of patrons of business from illegal conduct, and the City\u2019s interest may properly extend beyond health and safety laws. <em>Ralston v. Ryan, </em>217 Ind. 482, 29 N.E.2d 202 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The ordinance furthers this interest. First, the illegal conduct must occur on the premises where it is likely to affect the patrons. Next, because of the knowledge requirement, the ordinance does not penalize a licensee for an isolated incident over which he has no control. The ordinance therefore furthers a legitimate and substantial governmental interest that is unrelated to the suppression of free expression. <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. at 377, 88 5. Ct. at 1679.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The ordinance here is distinguishable from an ordinance forbidding licensing of an applicant who has been convicted of certain crimes. <em>See, e. g., Genusa v. City of Peoria, </em>619 F.2d at 1218-19. Such regulations offend two constitutional values-they first deny a certain class of people the opportunity to exercise First Amendment rights; second, they have not been shown to further any legitimate state interest. <em>Id. </em>A licensee\u2019s conduct off the premises may or may not be related to the conduct of his business. In addition, the \u201ccriminal convictions\u201d type of statute invariably penalizes the licensee for prior conduct which again may or may not be related to his present conduct of his business. The Indianapolis ordinance, in contrast, holds a licensee responsible only for present conduct on the premises.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Finally, the means chosen are limited so as not to trample on protected expression. <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. at 377, 88 S.Ct. at 1679. The ordinance, as we have construed it, requires that a licensee knowingly permit illegal conduct. The City conceded that it cannot use obscenity convictions to justify denial of a license. <em>See Vance v. Universal Amusement Co., Inc., </em>445 U.S. 308, 100 S.Ct. 1156, 63 L.Ed.2d 413 (1980). The City acknowledged in oral argument that it bears the burden to prove knowledge, so that a licensee does not act at his peril. The City also indicated that it would not deny a license because of an isolated incident, but would require a pattern of arrests. The discretion granted under the ordinance is therefore not boundless. As construed by Judge Steckler and this opinion, the provision is constitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The scope of our review of the procedures contained in the Indianapolis licensing ordinance has been narrowed considerably due to several concessions by the City in its brief and oral argument. The City first concedes that the applicant must show only that he is generally qualified for a license under sections 17-31(e) and 17-29.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Indiana State Bd. of Registration v. Cummings, </em>387 N.E.2d 491, 494 (Ind.App.1979) (applicant for health facility administrator\u2019s license must make prima facie showing of qualifications). Once he has demonstrated that he has the qualifications listed in section 17-29, the burden \u201cshifts to the agency before whom the application is pending [to] present evidence to the contrary.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 7. The City further concedes that if the City fails to present sufficient contrary evidence the controller must issue the license.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">Two of appellant\u2019s contentions remain after the City\u2019s concessions. First, Chulchian argues that the provision for a trial <em>de novo </em>in which the City is free to assert new grounds to support its decision is improper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">The Board conducts its proceedings pursuant to the Indiana Administrative Adjudication and Court Review Act. Code of Indianapolis \u00a7 17-38(c). Indiana law provides that a hearing by a full administrative board governed by that Act may be <em>de novo. </em>Indiana cases have determined that the procedure comports with due process because the parties are afforded notice and an opportunity to prepare. <em>Warren v. Indiana Telephone Co., </em>217 Ind. 93, 26 N.E.2d 399, 409 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">Finally, we reject Chulchian\u2019s assertion that no standards govern the decision of the License Review Board. The Board must follow the requirements in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Licensing Ordinance. The Chairman of the License Review Board testified that the Board also refers to applicable Indiana law and court decisions in making a judgment. We conclude that on their face, the procedures of the License Review Board comport with due process. Any charge that the Board has acted arbitrarily or otherwise in violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights will have to await action by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We must now consider the current status of appellant\u2019s application. The proceedings on Chulchian\u2019s 1979 application were dismissed and further action on his 1980 application was stayed pending our decision. The License Administrator, however, denied Chulchian\u2019s 1980 application on the basis of the denial of his 1979 license. Counsel for the City admitted that it denied Chulchian\u2019s 1979 license because of violations of the obscene conduct ordinance struck down by Judge Steckler. Contrary to the City\u2019s assertion in brief, the judge also invalidated the finding that Chulchian\u2019s business was a nuisance since the controller based his determination on community opinion. 477 F.Supp. at 132. Judge Steckler was assured that there were other valid arrests sufficient to justify denial. But because the 1979 proceedings were dismissed, the License Review Board never had the opportunity to consider whether other arrests justified denial of Chulchian\u2019s 1979 license. We must assume therefore that at least for purposes of the 1979 license, the City failed to meet its burden that Chulchian was not qualified for a license. The 1979 license was therefore wrongfully withheld, and it is not permissible to base a further denial on the 1979 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We cannot order the City to issue a license because the administrative process is not complete. <em>See Indiana State Bd. of Registration v. Cummings, </em>387 N.E.2d at 497. We note, however, that the License Administrator also denied Chulchian\u2019s 1980 application because he \u201cconducted [his] business and premises in such a manner as to create a nuisance to the public\u201d in violation of section 17-6(2). While we have grave reservations about its validity on vagueness and overbreadth grounds, <em>see generally, </em>Rendleman, <em>Civilizing Pornography: The Case For an Exclusive Obscenity Nuisance Statute, </em>44 U.Chi.L.Rev. 509 (1977), the lower court did not rule on the section\u2019s constitutionality. We therefore do not consider it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">We affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-13\">.

We briefly considered a similar ordinance in <em>Genusa v. City of Peoria, </em>619 F.2d 1203 (7th Cir. 1980). The Peoria ordinance required \u201cthat no licensee or person associated with a licensee shall permit anything to occur on licensed premises that is in any manner unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1221 (footnote omitted). We held, \u201c[o]n the assumption that Peoria does not mean by this provision to enlarge the licensee\u2019s vicarious criminal liability beyond traditional bounds, we see no problem with the provision. As we construe it, it is merely a legal redundancy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Appellant\u2019s counsel interprets <em>Genusa </em>to mean that the ordinance makes the licensee responsible only for conduct sufficient to hold the licensee liable as a conspirator, accessory, or aider and abettor. We do not think that <em>Genusa </em>intended to define the kinds of conduct for which permits can be revoked by the criminality of the licensee. Were that the case, the provision would run smack into the court\u2019s holding striking down the \u201ccriminal convictions\u201d provision. <em>Id. </em>at 1218-19. Since the City cannot legitimately deny a license to a person convicted of a crime, it hardly seems logical to allow the City to deny a license to persons who conspire with or aid criminals. Under the interpretation pressed by appellant, the provisions would not be a \u201clegal redundancy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1221, but a legal nullity. We think that <em>Genusa </em>simply meant that the ordinance could not create a new level of vicarious <em>criminal </em>responsibility. We do think that it is more than a \u201clegal redundancy,\u201d however, because it creates a potential civil liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b137-5\">. Section 17-31(c)(3) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">(3) Before issuing or renewing a license, the controller may institute an investigation to determine the qualifications of the applicant or the surety, if a bond is required. Each applicant for a license or the renewal of a license shall have the burden of proving that he is qualified and is entitled to a hearing before the controller, or someone appointed by the controller, to present evidence as to his qualifications. Each applicant for a license or a surety on a bond may be required by the controller to submit evidence under oath or in the form of an affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Section 17-29 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">General qualifications of licensees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">In order to obtain any license required by this Code or other city ordinance, the applicant shall meet the following requirements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">(1) The applicant must be a citizen of the United States or a declarant for citizenship, as prescribed by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">(2) The applicant must not have had any license to operate a business revoked or suspended because of his conduct of the business or because of his violation of any law or regulation while conducting that business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">(3) The applicant must agree to comply with all laws, provisions of this Code and other ordinances, all regulations promulgated thereunder and the orders and decisions of all public officials which pertain to his business or premises; he shall also agree that his business and premises will not be used for any unlawful or immoral purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-17\">(4) Each corporation must be organized and controlled by the laws of the state or be authorized and qualified by its laws to engage in business in the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-18\">The qualifications required in section 17-29 are of the general type approved by <em>Genusa v. City of Peoria, </em>619 F.2d at 1215. We presume that the City will read the word \u201cimmoral\u201d out of section 17-29(3), as it has conceded its use is unconstitutional in section 17-6(4). <em>Supra </em>at 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b137-19\">. Sections 17-31(c)(4) and (5) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-20\">(4) If the controller finds an applicant qualified to receive the license for which he has applied, he shall issue the license with his official seal affixed after all license fees have been paid to him, and shall deposit them in the city general fund. All bonds required to be posted in connection with any license shall be approved by the controller as to the surety thereon, and shall be filed with the controller prior to the issuance of the license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-21\">(5) If any license or permit is refused by the controller, the reasons for the refusal shall be stated in writing and delivered to the applicant upon his request; and, if the applicant remedies the reasons for the refusal and becomes qualified for the license or permit, and such facts are presented to the controller and found by him to be correct, the license or permit shall then be issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-22\">Counsel for the City stated in oral argument that the language in sections (4) and (5) is mandatory in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
