At the outset, we must conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision is at least partially incorrect as a matter of law insofar as it finds that Gurley\u2019s refusal to rehire Huguley violated \u00a7 8(a)(1). That section prohibits an employer\u2019s interference with, or restraint or coercion of, <em>employees\u2019 </em>\u00a7 7 rights, the right to engage in \u2018concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u2019 Because, obviously, Huguley was no longer an <em>employee </em>when he reapplied, he is not protected by \u00a7 8(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-18\">626 F.2d 1287, 1295 (5th Cir. 1980). We acknowledge our error in concluding that Huguley was not an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 8(a)(1) protection at the time of his reapplication. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152(3); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Foodway of El Paso, </em>496 F.2d 117 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>N.L.R.B. v. AcClang, Inc., </em>466 F.2d 558 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Bob\u2019s Casing Crews, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>458 F.2d 1301 (5th Cir. 1972). To avoid further confusion, we delete and expunge from the opinion the aforementioned language. However, the result of the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement remaining the same, we modify our opinion in this respect only and DENY the petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-20\">REHEARING DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
