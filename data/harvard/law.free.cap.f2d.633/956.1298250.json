(Pasco), an Arizona corporation, is engaged in the marketing of gasoline and under the Department of Energy (DOE) regulations is a reseller-retailer as that term is defined in 10 CFR \u00a7 212.31. On June 29,1978, Pasco received a Data Statement Letter (DATS Letter) from George W. Hubbard, Area Manager, Enforcement Division of Region IX of the ERA of the DOE, advising the firm that it had been selected for investigation of its compliance with DOE pricing regulations for the sale of petroleum products during the period November 1, 1973-April 30, 1974. The letter requested Pasco to make available to DOE all data showing the firm\u2019s manner of computing its maximum lawful selling prices for its sales of petroleum products during this period, including information on the firm\u2019s May 15, 1973 selling prices and increased product costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">Pasco agreed to an August 22,1978 meeting with a DOE auditor for the examination of the records. Pasco\u2019s counsel,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> however, began to question the legality of the examination under a DOE audit policy statement published on June 23, 1978, and so informed the auditor and his superiors prior to the August meeting date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">Pursuant to the DATS Letter and arrangements previously made with Pasco\u2019s comptroller, a DOE auditor appeared at Pasco\u2019s office in Phoenix on August 22, 1978, and asked to inspect Pasco\u2019s records. After Pasco\u2019s refusal to produce any records except those pertaining to its May 15, 1973 selling prices, Hubbard issued a subpoena to Pasco requiring the company\u2019s custodian of records to appear before DOE\u2019s Los Angeles office on September 7, 1978, for the examination of documents and materials \u201crelating to all purchases, sales, storage, transportation, and exchanges of covered petroleum products by Pasco Petroleum Co., Inc. in its capacity as a reseller-retailer\u201d for the period April 1,1973-June 30, 1978. The request for documents included, but was not limited to, all sales and purchase invoices, schedules of all customers, a listing of all credit terms maintained by customers, corporate minutes for all special and regular shareholders\u2019 meetings, correspondence files, and copies of all documents relating to the purchase and sale of stock of Pasco Petroleum Co., Inc., and related entities. The subpoena was served on Pasco on August 23, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">Pasco pursued administrative remedies available under 10 CFR Part 205 but was unsuccessful in its efforts to quash the subpoena.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Office of Hearings and Appeals\u2019 denial of Pasco\u2019s application to quash on January 17,1979, constituted final agency action in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-14\">In light of Pasco\u2019s continued refusal to produce the requested documents, the DOE filed a petition for enforcement of the subpoena in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona on December 5, 1979. Having heard oral argument on February 4, 1980, the District Court issued an order on May 20, 1980, requiring Pasco\u2019s compliance with the subpoena. Pasco now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>appeals to this court, challenging the issuance of the subpoena on the basis of a DOE policy limiting audits of resellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">The DOE \u201cStatement of Policy Regarding Audits Begun After June 30, 1978 to Determine Compliance with the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (hereafter referred to as reseller audit policy) limits audits and civil liability of certain resellers by providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-5\">A. It is the policy of the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) not to commence any price regulation audits after June 30, 1978, at: (1) Any resellers, reseller-retailers or retailers (as defined in 10 CFR 212.31) of petroleum products other than propane, or (2) small resellers, small reseller-retailers or small retailers of propane, except on suspicion of a willful violation of the price regulations, by reason of complaints or other credible indications of significant violations, or if an exception or other special relief from the price regulations has been afforded. Resellers, reseller-retailers or retailers (as defined in 10 CFR 212.31) of propane are considered to be small if they had less than $2 million in sales of propane during calendar year 1977.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-6\">B. It is the policy of the ERA not to seek, as a result of price regulation audits commencing after June 30, 1978, to impose civil liability on: (1) Any firm described in paragraph A for transactions that occurred more than two years prior to commencement of the audit; or (2) Any other firm, except crude oil producers, crude oil resellers, and refiners in their crude oil production, sale and resale activities, for transactions that occurred more than five years prior to commencement of the audit, except where a firm has been convicted criminally for transactions covered by price regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">Relying on the reseller audit policy, Pasco makes several arguments:</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-13\">1. The DATS Letter Pasco received on June 29, 1978, was not the commencement of the audit and, therefore, the audit is barred by the new policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-14\">2. If the DATS Letter did begin the audit, then the policy precludes the expansion of the audit to all but the two most recent years preceding the audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-15\">3. The agency lacked \u201ccomplaints or other credible indications of significant violations\u201d under the \u201cspecial circumstances exception\u201d of the reseller audit policy. For this third argument, Pasco draws support from DOE\u2019s inability to produce any information regarding the identity of the alleged complainant or the complaint itself, a DOE auditor\u2019s previous approval of the firm\u2019s non product cost pass-throughs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and statements both in written memoranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and at the District Court hearing that the agency was auditing Pasco because it was necessary to \u201chave an enforcement presence in the Phoenix area.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-16\">DOE argues that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-17\">1. The subpoena was issued for a lawful purpose and seeks documents relevant to that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-18\">2. The new reseller audit policy does not limit DOE\u2019s right to subpoena Pasco\u2019s records. The audit began with the issuance of the DATS Letter before the effective date of the new policy; and, in any event, the audit can be justified under the \u201cspecial circumstances exception\u201d of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-19\">Although there has been some confusion within DOE itself as to the exact status of the new reseller audit policy,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that policy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>simply a policy, not a regulation or rule. The record in this case reflects that DOE had commenced the Pasco audit prior to the effective date of the DOE reseller audit policy, July 1, 1978;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> hence such policy is no bar to enforcement of the subpoena. Congress conferred broad subpoena authority on DOE by \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 751 et seq., incorporating \u00a7 206 of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 note; \u00a7 13(b), (e)(1) of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 761 et seq.; and \u00a7 645 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101 et seq., which grants to the Secretary of Energy and his duly authorized agents the same powers and authority granted the Federal Trade Commission under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 49, which authorizes the Commission \u201cto require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation.\u201d The regulations promulgated pursuant to these statutes, 10 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 205.201(a), 205.8, in no way restrict the subpoena authority of the DOE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">The limited role of the reviewing court in a subpoena enforcement proceeding has been throughly explored by this Court in <em>United States v. Empire Gas Corp., </em>547 F.2d 1147 (Em.App.1976), <em>cert. den. 430 </em>U.S. 915, 97 S.Ct. 1326, 51 L.Ed.2d 592, <em>United States v. Bell, </em>564 F.2d 953 (Em.App.1977), <em>United States v. First City National Bank, </em>598 F.2d 594 (Em.App.1979), and <em>United States v. Southwest National Bank, </em>598 F.2d 600 (Em.App.1979). The only issues properly before a court in any subpoena enforcement proceedings are \u201cwhether the subpoena was issued for a lawfully authorized purpose and whether it seeks information relevant to the agency\u2019s inquiry.\u201d <em>United States v. Southwest National Bank, </em>supra at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">The DOE is charged by Congress with determining compliance with and enforcing the Mandatory Allocation and Price Regulations. The subpoena to Pasco was issued in aid of a DOE investigation to determine Pasco\u2019s compliance with the reseller pricing regulations, clearly a lawfully authorized purpose. Unquestionably the subpoena seeks information relevant to the agency investigation. <em>United States v. Southwest National Bank, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">Pasco has, however, argued that DOE is attempting through this procedure to apply retroactively Ruling 1975-14 regarding non-product cost justification, despite DOE\u2019s approval of Pasco\u2019s selling prices and margins in a prior audit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A later regulation, 10 CFR \u00a7 212, imposes on resellers the obligation of justifying their non-product cost pass-throughs. Although by statutory amendment of the FEA Act, known as the Findley amendment, DOE is precluded from enforcing this regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>retroactively, Pasco maintains that its non-product cost pass-throughs form the basis of DOE\u2019s assertion that Pasco\u2019s overcharges may exceed $1 million. This matter is one which Pasco would be entitled to present in defense against an administrative complaint or in a collateral action, but it is not a proper defense to the enforcement of the subpoena. <em>United States v. Southwest National Bank, </em>supra, <em>United States v. Empire Gas Corp., </em>supra at 1152 n. 3, and <em>United States v. Bell, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">Pasco\u2019s challenge of the DOE subpoena is without merit; and Pasco\u2019s argument that the DOE reseller audit policy bars enforcement of the subpoena is also without merit. The order of the District Court appealed from is AFFIRMED. Pasco must comply with such subpoena forthwith. IT IS SO ORDERED. \u25a0</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1061-10\"> Pasco\u2019s counsel, James P. Tierney, certifies he is vice-president, secretary and director of Pas-co, and also \u201cofficer, director\u201d and shareholder (one of only three) of Pasco Industries Inc., parent corporation of respondent, Pasco Petroleum Co., Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1061-16\">.
