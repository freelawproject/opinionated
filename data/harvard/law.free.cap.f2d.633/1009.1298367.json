He currently is serving a sentence of 25 years to life in the Attica Correctional Facility. He petitioned the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Thomas C. Platt, Jr., <em>District Judge, </em>for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was improperly retried for murder after the prosecutor\u2019s conduct provoked a mistrial at his first trial. Judge Platt denied the petition. 481 F.Supp. 22. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-18\">Appellant was first tried for murder in January 1977. A mistrial was declared on a motion by appellant\u2019s trial counsel because of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Alice Sullivan, an eyewitness to the killing, who testified that appellant was not the man who shot the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-19\">The court ruled that the prosecutor misled the jury when he suggested to it that he had a stenographic transcript indicating that the witness had told the district attorney that she had identified a photograph of appellant as the murderer. There was no evidence that she had ever made such a statement to the district attorney and the trial court accordingly found that the prosecutor\u2019s question was \u201cnot asked in good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-20\">Appellant did not raise his double jeopardy claim before his second trial. There, Miss Sullivan testified again substantially as she had at the first trial. Her testimony was impeached by the testimony of a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>detective who testified that on the day of the killing Miss Sullivan had identified a photograph of appellant as that of the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\">Appellant appealed his conviction in the state courts but did not raise his double jeopardy claim on his direct appeal. Concurrently, he applied to the Appellate Division, Third Department, for a state writ of habeas corpus in which he raised the double jeopardy claim for the first time. It was denied as being without merit. <em>State of New York ex rel. Mitchell v. Wilmot, </em>67 A.D.2d 788 (3rd Dept. 1979). The New York Court of Appeals declined to entertain an appeal from the denial of the habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">I. <em>Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Appellees argue that under New York State law appellant had an obligation to raise his double jeopardy claim prior to his second trial or, at the very latest, on direct appeal of his conviction. New York Crim.Proc. Law \u00a7\u00a7 210.40, 470.15(3)(c) (McKinney Supp. 1979). Accordingly, appellees argue, the New York courts <em>could </em>have refused to hear appellant\u2019s state habeas corpus petition on the ground of appellant\u2019s \u201cunjustifiable failure to raise such ground or issue upon an appeal actually perfected by him.\u201d New York Crim.Proc. Law \u00a7 440.10(2)(c). Appellees argue that appellant\u2019s federal petition should be denied on comity grounds. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 81-85 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">Appellees\u2019 argument might be convincing if the state court in fact had refused to review appellant\u2019s claim on procedural grounds. On the facts of this case the argument is not convincing. The state court heard appellant\u2019s habeas petition on the merits. The purpose of the federal comity doctrine in this context is to extend federal recognition to state procedural restrictions. <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>425 U.S. 536, 541-42 (1976). When the state courts fail to give preclusive effect to their own procedural rules, comity concerns do not require that the federal courts give greater respect to those rules than the states themselves. <em>Albuquerque v. Bara, </em>628 F.2d 767, 771-72 (2 Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">Appellees also argue that double jeopardy immunity should be deemed waived if it is not asserted at trial. We find it neither necessary nor appropriate to rule on that contention since we find that appellant\u2019s claim lacks merit. <em>Accord, United States v. MacQueen, </em>596 F.2d 76, 81-82 (2 Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. DeFillipo, </em>590 F.2d 1228, 1232-33 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 920 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">II. <em>Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">The Fifth Amendment, held applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784 (1969), and New York Crim.Proc. Law \u00a7 40.20 (McKinney Supp. 1979) provide that a person may not be tried twice for the same offense. It is well established, however, that double jeopardy immunity may be waived by the defendant\u2019s motion for or consent to a mistrial at his first trial. <em>Lee v. United States, </em>432 U.S. 23, 32-33 (1977). The courts have come to recognize an exception to that traditional \u201cwaiver\u201d rule when the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial is provoked by prosecutorial \u201coverreaching\u201d. <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 611 (1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 485 (1971). The Supreme Court has not clearly delineated what kind of conduct constitutes such \u201coverreaching\u201d as will invoke the exception. This Court, however, recently has held that such overreaching occurs when the prosecutor or judge \u201cintentionally provokes\u201d a mistrial in order to obtain a second opportunity to convict or, \u201c[e]ven absent such a provocation ... if the judicial or prosecutorial error was \u2018motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice\u2019 the petitioner.\u201d <em>Drayton v. Hayes, </em>589 F.2d 117, 121 (2 Cir. 1979) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">Appellant in this case does not contend that the prosecutor at his first trial intended to provoke a mistrial. He does argue that the prosecutor\u2019s behavior was intended to prejudice appellant\u2019s prospect for an acquittal and under <em>Drayton </em>constituted \u201coverreaching\u201d which should have barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>the state from subjecting him to a second trial. Under a correct reading of <em>Jorn </em>and its progeny, however, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case cannot be said to have reached the level necessary to preclude a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Mere inadvertent error on the part of a prosecutor is not sufficient to justify barring retrial. What is required is \u201cbad faith conduct [that] is not an inevitable part of the trial process; rather, it signals a breakdown in the integrity of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Drayton, supra, </em>589 F.2d at 121. Accordingly, courts have been loath to bar retrial absent clearly prejudicial behavior which, if not proven to have been intended to impair the proceedings, at least could be considered to be flagrant overreaching. <em>E. g., United States v. Martin, </em>561 F.2d 135, 139-40 (8 Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Kessler, </em>530 F.2d 1246, 1254-58 (5 Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Gentile, </em>525 F.2d 252, 257 (2 Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 903 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">It is not clear in this case whether the prosecutor\u2019s error was intentional or merely inadvertent. At one point the trial court said the prosecutor\u2019s question was \u201cnot asked in good faith\u201d, while later it said the prosecutor \u201cmade a mistake\u201d. The district court below held that the \u201cfinding of unintentional provocation is not without support in the trial record.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">First, the trial court\u2019s finding that the prosecutor lacked a good faith basis for his question is not the same as a finding that he was motivated by bad faith. The prosecutor knew that he had been told that Miss Sullivan had identified appellant; and he may have been merely mistaken about the source of the information. Perhaps the strongest argument against finding intentional bad faith here was the ease with which Miss Sullivan\u2019s testimony was impeached at the second trial. In fact, at the <em>Wade </em>hearing before appellant\u2019s first trial even the defense attorney admitted that the witness had given \u201cdiametrically opposite testimony on three occasions\u201d, and that he was reluctant to call her as a witness. Under those circumstances, it is unlikely that the prosecutor would resort to bad faith efforts to impeach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">The adoption of a gross negligence standard suggested by appellant would constitute a significant liberalization of this doctrine which would be inconsistent with the prior holdings of this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Gentile, supra, </em>we endorsed the view that under these circumstances double jeopardy should be reserved for instances in which \u201cthere has been an abuse of the trial process resulting in prejudice to the accused . . . such as to outweigh society\u2019s interest in the punishment of crime.\u201d 525 F.2d at 257 n.3, quoting <em>United States v. Jorn, supra, </em>400 U.S. at 492 (Stewart, J., dissenting). Accordingly, we have read the exception relied upon by appellant narrowly. <em>Id. </em>at 257 &amp; n.4; <em>United States v. Estremera, </em>531 F.2d 1103, 1110 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 979 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">The argument in favor of a narrow application of this exception to the waiver rule appears especially compelling on the facts of this case. In <em>Gentile </em>we stressed that barring a retrial would be inappropriate where the mistrial was declared in the \u201csole interest of the defendant.\u201d We reasoned that we did not want to hinder the sound discretion of the trial judge to protect the criminal defendant from inadvertent prejudicial error by an expansive application of the double jeopardy doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-11\">\u201c[W]e do not think a trial judge must take one horn or the other of the dilemma of refusing to recognize what he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>siders a valid claim of prejudice or granting a severance in order to forfend a successful claim of double jeopardy.\u201d 525 F.2d at 258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">In view of the equivocal nature of the trial court\u2019s opinion of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case, it would be manifestly unfair to require the judge either to grant a mistrial, which would free the defendant and bar further prosecution, or allow the tainted questioning to remain in the case and go to the jury. If we were to adopt a standard under which conduct less than clear \u201cbad faith\u201d' conduct constituted \u201coverreaching\u201d, such a result would be inevitable. If a prosecutor deliberately provokes a mistrial in order to secure \u201ca more favorable opportunity to convict,\u201d <em>Downum v. United States, </em>372 U.S. 734, 736 (1963), that type of bad faith conduct would preclude retrial. And it may also happen that a prosecutor\u2019s overreaching is so intentional, so unfair, and so prejudicial that the sanction of barring further prosecution is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Appellant has failed to establish that the prosecution here engaged in bad faith conduct undertaken to harass or prejudice his case. Accordingly, this is not the exceptional case in which prosecutorial \u201coverreaching\u201d will bar a retrial following a declaration of mistrial on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">. A \u201cgross negligence\u201d standard has been mentioned in two opinions of the Fifth Circuit, although it does not appear that any prosecutor\u2019s conduct amounting only to gross negligence has barred a retrial. In <em>United States v. Kessler, supra, </em>530 F.2d at 1256, the court equated \u201cprosecutorial overreaching\u201d with \u201c \u2018gross negligence or intentional misconduct.\u2019 \u201d The internal quotation was from <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>479 F.2d 1124, 1126 (5 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 924 (1973). <em>Beasley </em>had relied on <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684 (1949), for the proposition that retrial is not barred when a mistrial results from prosecutorial error which does \u201cnot amount to gross negligence or intentional misconduct.\u201d 479 F.2d at 1126. (emphasis added). Nothing in <em>Wade v. Hunter, supra, </em>suggests that a mistrial resulting from a prosecutor\u2019s gross negligence would bar a retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
