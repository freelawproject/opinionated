The plaintiff claimed that Mr. Hamilton was the father of the two children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Social Security Administration determined that the two children failed to satisfy the requirements for entitlement as the children of Mr. Hamilton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-24\">After Appellant\u2019s request for a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>sidered the case <em>de novo </em>and on October 29, 1976, rendered a decision denying the surviving child\u2019s insurance benefits. In the view of the ALJ, the evidence failed to establish that either of the children was the \u201cchild\u201d of the deceased wage earner within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Appeals Council adopted the judgment of the ALJ which became the final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare on February 9, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Appellant then filed suit in the district court to obtain judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final decision. Although the District Court held that the Secretary\u2019s finding that the deceased wage earner was not the father of the two children was unsupported by substantial evidence in the record, the Court granted summary judgment for the Secretary. The District Court\u2019s ruling that the deceased Hamilton was the father of the two children would entitle the claimants to the benefits in question providing the wage earner was also found to be living with or contributing to the support of the children at the time of his death. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii). By granting summary judgment for the Secretary, the district court found substantial evidence that the deceased was not contributing to the support of the children at the time of his death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">At oral argument before this court, Appellant Boyland raised a separate issue for the first time: is the proper time for making the determination of when the wage earner was contributing to the support of the children the time of the wage earner\u2019s death, as has been assumed throughout the litigation, or at the time the wage earner himself became entitled to Social Security benefits?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we viewed this question as one of first impression, both parties received additional time to brief the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Appellant urges this court to adopt the vesting theory of entitlement. This theory asserts that the proper moment to determine whether the father of a child born out of wedlock contributed to the support of the ehild(ren) is when the wage earner himself became entitled to the Social Security benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This early \u201cvesting\u201d would eliminate any examination into the nature of the wage earners\u2019 contributions to his children\u2019s support just before his death except when the wage earner dies before he becomes entitled to benefits. Such would be the case, argues the appellant, even though the child did not apply for benefits until after the wage earner died.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">The government argues that contribution should be determined at the time of the wage earner\u2019s death because to do otherwise conflicts with the plain meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>applicable statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While it is true that the heading of the allegedly applicable statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii), states \u201cIn the case of a deceased individual\u201d, the question remains whether Congress intended an earlier moment of vesting based upon the eligibility date of the wage earner where the wage earner has died prior to a determination of eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We are of the opinion that the application by the claimant determines whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii) or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(A)(ii) controls. In other words, any vesting occurs by the filing of the application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Other provisions of the Act support this conclusion. For example 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(1)(A) requires a child to file an application before entitlement to child\u2019s insurance benefits \u201cvests.\u201d We think that Congress intended to create an alternative time to determine whether a deceased wage earner \u201ccontributed\u201d to the support of the claimant while the wageeamer was alive. Had the plaintiff filed an application for benefits prior to Mr. Hamilton\u2019s death, the controlling statutory provisions indicate that \u201ccontribution to the support of the children\u201d may be shown at the time of the eligibility of the wage earner. However we decline to interpret the introductory phrase of \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(i) \u201cin the case, of a deceased individual\u201d as applying only where the insured died prior to age 65 and prior to eligibility for benefits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There are no such qualifying words in the statute excluding those deceased individuals who were eligible for benefits before they died.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently we conclude, from the wording of the statute, that Congress provided a \u201cchild\u201d two opportunities for applying for benefits: One, when the wage earner, himself, becomes eligible for benefits and the other, when the wage earner dies. Unless an application has been filed by the child or on its behalf, whatever rights may exist, remain inchoate. We conclude that the government is correct on this issue and we must make an overall examination of the wage earner\u2019s contributions to his children before he died.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">\u201cevidence indicate(d) that Kennedy (insured) was a white liquor store owner in a black community in Kentucky and that plaintiff\u2019s mother was a 13 year-old black female at the time of plaintiffs conception. No bastardy action was brought against Kennedy because of the racial repercussions that might have arisen in the town; such an action, if successful, would have avoided the dispute under the terms of \u00a7 416(h)(3)(A)(i) or section 416(h)(3)(C)(i). <em>Id. </em>at 2199-65.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">There is no universally accepted test for determining what constitutes \u201ccontributing to the support of the applicant,\u201d under \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act. A majority of courts apply either a regular and substantial \u201csupport test\u201d or a \u201cregular and continuous support test.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Both approaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>stress that \u201csporadic\u201d contributions are insignificant for analytical purposes vis-\u00e1-vis the Act, presumably because the physical well being of the child is not enhanced by sporadic contributions. This is precisely the Secretary\u2019s position. In its argument, the Secretary concedes that the wage earner made some contributions, \u201c(t)hey were .... not continuous and probably had stopped altogether sometime before Hamilton\u2019s death. Hamilton\u2019s contributions, therefore, cannot qualify as sufficient under either test.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Assuming, as the Secretary maintains, that Mr. Hamilton\u2019s contributions are inadequate under \u201ceither test,\u201d we find the tests inappropriate under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Obviously, continuously regular and substantial contributions is a just standard when the wage earner\u2019s income is regular and substantial. But where the income of a wage earner lacks continuity and substantiality and contributions are nevertheless given, a different criterion should be applied. Where a wage earner is poor and earns an irregular income, it is ludicrous to require regular and substantial payments to his children born out of wedlock or not. The wage-earner is barely supporting himself. Instead, attention should be focused on whether the contributions that were made to the support of his children were important to them given their needs and the wage earner\u2019s economic circumstances and ability to support.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Certain facts place this case within the above category.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">At the time of his death Mr. James Henry Hamilton was a retired stone mason with a minimum income. Two of his children lived with him. Two others lived with Mrs. Nannie Lou Boyland, their mother, who alternatively worked or relied on public assistance for additional support. Despite his poverty, Mr. Hamilton on numerous occasions gave $5.00-$10.00 to his children (living with their mother) or to others for them, bought them clothing and presents, gave them lunch money and allowed them to stay in his home for weeks at a time. We cannot ignore the obvious importance of these contributions to Marilyn Lou and Lorenzo Knight.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">The lack of economic well-being or regular income does not eliminate the statutory requirement of \u201ccontribution.\u201d However, where the resources of the wage earner are scarce and the contributions to his children important to them, the statutory requirements can be satisfied. We emphasize that the periodic contributions were made to the wage earner\u2019s own children albeit born out of wedlock. The children should not be denied benefits because the wage earner could only afford small irregular payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">Accordingly, we find that the decision of the Secretary that James Henry Hamilton was not contributing to the support of his two children, Mary Lou and Lorenzo Knight, is unsupported by substantial evidence. This case is reversed and remanded for an award of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\">.
