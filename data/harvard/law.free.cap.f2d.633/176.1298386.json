Rosenblatt\u2019s grandfather established a trust for her benefit. The trust instrument provided the trustee with discretion to expend property or income from the trust property for her benefit as primary beneficiary. The trustee was to distribute the entire income and principal to Nancy when she reached age 21. If she died before she reached 21, the income and property were to be distributed to her estate. In addition, the trust agreement gave Nancy a general power of appointment enabling her to name the persons to whom the trust property and income should be distributed in the event of her death before attaining 21 years of age. This power could be exercised by will or by written instrument delivered to the trustee during Nancy\u2019s lifetime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Nancy died at the age of 16. It is undisputed that, due to her minority, decedent could not make an effective will, Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 74-1-1 (1953), nor could a guardian, acting on her behalf, make a will for her. Record, vol. 1, at 40-41. It is also clear that, under Utah law, a minor may disaf-firm her contracts, Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 15-2-2 (1953), with some limitations. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 15-2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The Commissioner determined that the value of the trust property was includable in decedent\u2019s estate under either I.R.C. \u00a7 2033 or \u00a7 2041. The trustee filed a petition challenging the inclusion of the trust property. The Tax Court held that Nancy owned a vested remainder interest in the trust income and property and that such interest is includable in her estate under I.R.C. \u00a7 2033.I. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court did not rule on the Commissioner\u2019s alternate assertion that decedent possessed at death a general power of appointment within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 2041(a)(2), which would require the inclusion of the value of the property subject to that power in her gross estate. The trustee has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">While the trial court decided to treat this case as controlled by \u00a7 2033, we think the better view is that \u201ca donated power of appointment . . . [is] governed exclusively by \u00a7 2041 and [is] not subject to \u00a7 2033.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>287 F.2d 821, 822 n.1 (8th Cir. 1961), <em>citing Helvering v.

The issues raised by decedent\u2019s minority are closely analogous to the issues raised when the holder of a general power dies mentally incompetent without having exercised or released the power. This latter issue has been consistently litigated under \u00a7 2041. <em>See, e. g., Alperstein v.

Rather, appellant contends that under applicable state law, <em>see Morgan v. Commissioner, </em>309 U.S. 78, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>80-81, 60 S.Ct. 424, 425-26, 84 L.Ed. 585 (1940), decedent\u2019s minority precluded her from exercising the general power.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This disability, it is urged, rendered the power incapable of exercise and beyond the pale of \u00a7 2041(a)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u201cThe federal estate tax is a tax on the exercise of the privilege of directing the course of property at one\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Estate of Bagley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>443 F.2d 1266, 1270 (5th Cir. 1971) (Ainsworth, J., dissenting); <em>see Estate of Rogers v. Commissioner, </em>320 U.S. 410, 413, 64 S.Ct. 172, 174, 88 L.Ed. 134 (1943). Prior to 1942, this rationale prompted Congress to include in a decedent\u2019s taxable estate property that passed via an <em>exercised </em>general power. Revenue Act of 1918, ch. 18, \u00a7 402(e), 40 Stat. 1057, 1097; <em>Alperstein v. Commissioner, </em>613 F.2d 1213, 1216 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 918, 100 S.Ct. 1852, 64 L.Ed.2d 272 (1980). Soon, an obvious deficiency inherent in this treatment of general powers was noted: one who holds a general power of appointment can effectively \u201cdirect the course\u201d of property subject to it by <em>failing </em>to exercise it and thus deciding in favor of the takers by default. S.Rep.No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 232 (1942); <em>Alperstein </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>613 F.2d at 1216; <em>Estate of Bagley v. United States, </em>443 F.2d at 1270 (Ainsworth, J., dissenting). Congress provided for the taxation of this passive exercise of control over property in the Revenue Act of 1942, ch. 619, \u00a7 403(a), 56 Stat. 798, 942, by taxing all general powers whether they were exercised or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The current I.R.C. \u00a7 2041 is, in material part, the present manifestation of the Powers of Appointment Act of 1951, ch. 165, \u00a7 2(a), 65 Stat. 91, 91-93. The 1951 act also gave an additional rationale for taxing all post-1942 general powers: to provide \u201ca test of taxability which is simple, clear-cut, and easy to apply.\u201d S.Rep.No. 382, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1951) (reprinted in [1951] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1530, 1531).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The general purpose of the federal estate tax <em>(i.e., </em>to tax the exercise of control of property at death), the realization that even an unexercised general power of appointment can constitute such control and Congress\u2019 interest in a rule that is easy to apply, combine and are given force in \u00a7 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">Three other circuits have concluded that the inability to exercise a power due to mental incompetence is not pertinent to a <em>court\u2019s </em>inquiry into whether property subject to that power is includable in a decedent\u2019s gross estate under \u00a7 2041(a)(2). The Second Circuit, in <em>Alperstein v. Commissioner, </em>613 F.2d 1213 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>denied, </em>446 U.S. 918, 100 S.Ct. 1852, 64 L.Ed.2d 272 (1980), included property subject to a decedent\u2019s general power in her gross estate despite the fact of her incompetence and consequent inability to exercise the power at death. The Third and Ninth Circuits have reached the same result on substantially similar facts. <em>Pennsylvania Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>597 F.2d 382 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 980, 100 S.Ct. 483, 62 L.Ed.2d 407 (1979); <em>Fish v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 1278 (9th Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The conclusions reached in these cases are entirely consistent with the considerations which provide the current rationale for \u00a7 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In its desire to tax the exercise of control over property at death, to serve notice that general powers of appointment constitute such control and to create a rule that is easy to administer, Congress drafted \u00a7 2041 in a way that makes capacity to exercise general powers irrelevant. This is not to say that Congress failed to consider capacity. Rather, \u00a7 2041 reflects a determination that all general powers of appointment carry with them some degree of control over the property subject to them. Thus, complex inquiry into a donee\u2019s capacity is unnecessary. \u201cIt would stretch the imagination to think that Congress intended to measure estate tax liability by an individual\u2019s fluctuating, day-by-day, hour-by-hour capacity to dispose of property which he owns.\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Estate of Noel, </em>380 U.S. 678, 684, 85 S.Ct. 1238, 1241, 14 L.Ed.2d 159 (1965). Similarly, it is not for us to ponder here whether the decedent might have been able to exercise her power.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is only necessary to ascertain the existence of the power in the granting instrument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The final blow to appellant\u2019s argument that Utah\u2019s limitations on decedent\u2019s ability to exercise her power should cause the property subject to it to be excluded from her estate is found in I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2056(b)(5), 2503(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">I.R.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(5) provides that property passing in trust to a surviving spouse can qualify for exclusion from the decedent\u2019s estate if, among other things, the surviving spouse has the power to appoint such property in favor of herself or her estate. Competency under local law has been determined to be \u201cirrelevant for determining whether a power is \u2018exerciseable\u2019 within the meaning of the marital deduction.\u201d <em>Alper-stein </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>613 F.2d 1213, 1217 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>(2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 918, 100 S.Ct. 1852, 64 L.Ed.2d 272 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">I.R.C. \u00a7 2503(c) states the conditions under which transfers to minors will be considered gifts of present interests sufficient to qualify for the $3,000 gift exclusion available under I.R.C. \u00a7 2503(b). Unless the property is made payable to the minor\u2019s estate in case of his death, \u00a7 2503(c)(2)(B) requires that the minor be given a general power of appointment over the property transferred to him in trust in order to qualify for the \u00a7 2503(b) exclusion. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 25.2503-4(b) explicitly makes incapacity to exercise the power due to the donee\u2019s minority irrelevant to the determination of whether the minor possesses a power for purposes of \u00a7 2503(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">These two treatments of incapacity to exercise a power, in light of the fact that the federal estate and gift tax laws \u201care in <em>pari materia </em>and must be construed together,\u201d <em>Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, </em>308 U.S. 39, 44, 60 S.Ct. 51, 56, 84 L.Ed. 20 (1939), suggest that the question of capacity should not be treated any differently under \u00a7 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Minority, like mental incompetency, is not pertinent to a determination of whether a decedent had a general power of appointment for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 2041. In this case the instrument creating the trust granted decedent a general power of appointment and did not, by its terms, limit its exercise. The property subject to that power is part of decedent\u2019s gross estate under I.R.C. \u00a7 2041(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\">.

Even if Utah has adopted \u00a7 345, which has not been shown, at most the section means that a minor lacks capacity to exercise a general power <em>to the extent that </em>he may disaffirm his contracts. Insofar as <em>some </em>contracts of minors are not subject to disaffirmance, Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 15-2-3 (1953), so would <em>some </em>exercises of a general power by a minor be valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b283-14\"><em>. </em>In relevant part, I.R.C. \u00a7 2041 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-15\">(a) ...

Similarly, there are circumstances under which decedent in this case could in fact have exercised her power. Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 15-2-1 (1953) would have provided decedent with majority status had she married, in which case she could have exercised the power by written instrument. In addition, Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 15-2-3 (1953) provides for instances in which a minor\u2019s right to disaffirm his contracts is limited. Thus, a written exercise of a general power could be binding under the limited circumstances of this statute. <em>See </em>note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">These observations do not form the basis of decision here.
