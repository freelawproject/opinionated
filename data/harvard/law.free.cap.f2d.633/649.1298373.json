(\u201cBAS\u201d) appeals from a judgment entered August 28,1979 in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont (Coffrin, D. J.), denying BAS\u2019s motion for a permanent injunction and entering judgment for the defendant-appellee, Subaru of New England, Inc. (\u201cSNE\u201d). The principal effect of this judgment is to remove any legal barrier to SNE\u2019s planned termination of its franchise relationship with BAS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">This lawsuit arises directly from certain business decisions made by BAS, and SNE\u2019s response to those decisions. For several years prior to 1978, BAS had operated a new car dealership and had acted as a sales representative for three automobile manufacturers: Saab, Subaru and International Harvester. BAS conducted this business out of its so-called \u201cOld Facility\u201d located in Brattleboro, Vermont. Sometime in 1977, however, economic considerations prompted BAS to begin preparations to move its business to larger, more modern quarters. The move to the so-called \u201cNew Facility,\u201d located diagonally across the street from the Old Facility, was accomplished in August 1978. To offset the increased overhead expenses involved in the operation of the New Facility, BAS decided to become a dealer representative for three additional lines of new cars: Buick, Pontiac and GMC light trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">Prior to the move, BAS consulted with and sought the approval of SNE officials. However, SNE took no action to indicate approval of, or even interest in, BAS\u2019s planned expansion. Instead, SNE officials informed BAS that if BAS went through with the planned move and took on the three additional lines of cars, SNE would terminate BAS as an authorized Subaru franchisee.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-18\">As indicated, BAS carried out its plans, and SNE followed through on its threat. SNE notified BAS by letter dated August 16, 1978 that it had decided to terminate \u201cfor due cause\u201d the existing franchise contract with BAS, the termination to take effect sixty days from receipt of the letter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>In response, BAS filed this action in the court below, on August 29, 1978, seeking injunctive relief to prevent SNE\u2019s threatened termination of BAS as an authorized Subaru dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">At trial, BAS advanced three reasons for prohibiting SNE\u2019s attempt to terminate its franchise relationship with BAS. It alleged that SNE\u2019s action violated the federal antitrust laws, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) requirement that merchants deal with each other in good faith (Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 9A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-203, 2-103(l)(b)), and the Vermont automobile dealers\u2019 \u201cBill of Rights\u201d (Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7\u00a7 4071-4082 (Supp. 1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">First, we fully agree with the amply detailed finding of the court below that BAS\u2019s antitrust claims are wholly without merit. To summarize the relevant points briefly, BAS\u2019s federal antitrust law claims involved allegations that SNE\u2019s refusal to continue the franchise relationship with BAS constituted both an unlawful refusal to deal in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, and was an example of an alleged SNE policy of exclusive dealing in contravention of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 14. However, as the court below noted, at trial BAS failed to present any evidence that SNE\u2019s alleged objectionable conduct operated in restraint of trade, had the effect of substantially lessening competition, tended to create a monopoly, or constituted an attempt to monopolize. Of course, BAS\u2019s failure to establish that SNE\u2019s objectionable conduct was associated with either anticompetitive motives or anticompetitive effects is fatal to BAS\u2019s Sherman Act and Clayton Act claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">Similarly, we agree with the district court\u2019s disposition of BAS\u2019s UCC \u201cgood faith\u201d claims. Assuming that Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code applies to the franchise agreement between SNE and BAS, the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement imposes on the parties to the agreement an obligation to be honest in fact and to observe the reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade. Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 9A, \u00a7 2 \u2014 103(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">As indicated by the court below, BAS did not establish in the context of a distributor\u2019s decision not to continue in a franchise relationship with a dealership what the \u201creasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade\u201d were.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, SNE\u2019s obligation to be \u201chonest in fact\u201d in its dealings with BAS may have required no more than that SNE give BAS adequate notice of SNE\u2019s anticipated response to BAS\u2019s planned action. However that may be, the standard of conduct required of SNE under the Vermont automobile dealers\u2019 \u201cBill of Rights\u201d would equal (if not exceed) the obligations imposed on SNE pursuant to the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">Accordingly, we now address BAS\u2019s final claim, the claim that SNE\u2019s decision to terminate its franchise relationship with BAS was not supported by the Vermont statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ry requirement of \u201cdue cause.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> BAS argued (1) that its past performance as a Subaru dealer had been satisfactory; (2) that it had met all SNE\u2019s objective standards concerning facility and staff size for Subaru dealerships; and (3) that the \u201cdue cause\u201d supporting SNE\u2019s action must be grounded in similar \u201chard\u201d objective data. In response, SNE advanced three factors, each of which it maintained was sufficient to meet the \u201cdue cause\u201d requirement for its action: (1) BAS breached the existing franchise contract by moving to the New Facility without SNE\u2019s prior approval;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) the New Facility and its personnel were inadequate to meet Subaru franchise requirements; <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (3) BAS could not provide the high quality sales and service SNE expected for the Subaru line if BAS simultaneously was operating five other franchises in the same location.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Finding no relevant legislative history or state court decisions on point to aid in the interpretation of the Vermont automobile dealers\u2019 \u201cBill of Rights,\u201d the district court turned to a Vermont Supreme Court decision, <em>In re Grievance of Brooks, </em>135 Vt. 563, 568, 382 A.2d 204, 207 (1977), construing a related \u201cjust cause\u201d provision in the context of a collective bargaining agreement, for guidance in determining the meaning of the \u201cdue cause\u201d requirement, and to the federal Automobile Dealers\u2019 Day in Court Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1222, to determine the allocation of the burden of proof between the parties on the \u201cdue cause\u201d issue. On this appeal, BAS maintains that this process resulted in a misinterpretation of the \u201cdue cause\u201d requirement and in a misallocation of the burden of proof between the parties which require that the judgment below be reversed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">As to the meaning of the \u201cdue cause\u201d requirement, BAS seems to agree with the appropriateness of the <em>Brooks </em>standard; that there would be \u201cdue cause\u201d for SNE\u2019s action if SNE had acted reasonably on the basis of some \u201csubstantial shortcoming detrimental\u201d to its interests. However, BAS asserts that the district court should not have considered SNE\u2019s testimony relative to SNE\u2019s \u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cprospective\u201d beliefs as to BAS\u2019s future ability to remain an effective Subaru dealer in support of the existence of \u201cdue cause\u201d for SNE\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\"> Contrary to BAS\u2019s assertions, we find nothing in the relevant statutory language which forbids consideration of \u201csubjective\u201d evidence as part of the \u201cdue cause\u201d inquiry. Moreover, in the automobile industry, as in other business endeavors, it' is both a legitimate and a necessary course of conduct to take action relative to one\u2019s probable future business results as affected by present occurrences. In the present situation, SNE reasonably could have concluded that BAS\u2019s sales and service of Subaru cars would suffer as a result of BAS\u2019s simultaneous promotion of several lines of directly competing cars, and SNE reasonably could have regarded such a prospect as a \u201csubstantial shortcoming detrimental\u201d to its interests, therefore supplying \u201cdue cause\u201d to justify its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Concerning the district court\u2019s allocation of the burden of proof between the parties on the \u201cdue cause\u201d issue, we regard the alleged error to be one of semantics rather than one of substance. Although the district court stated that BAS bore the burden of proving that SNE had acted \u201cwithout due cause,\u201d the court also spelled out in detail what was involved in this task.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In light of the district court\u2019s explanation, it is apparent that the result below was premised on the conclusion that SNE, by a preponderance of the evidence, had established the existence of \u201cdue cause\u201d for its action, and that the allocation of the burden of proof between the parties in no way prejudiced BAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Addressing the remaining allegations of error advanced by BAS, we conclude that none is material enough to warrant reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment. We find BAS\u2019s contentions concerning the trial court\u2019s failure to resolve conflicts in the evidence to be either unsupported or irrelevant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, although BAS correctly points out that the district court\u2019s opinion mistakenly states that the New Facility and its staff were not twice as large as the Old Facility and its staff, this misconception was no part of the basis for the district court\u2019s decision. Clearly, SNE\u2019s legitimate concerns regarding BAS\u2019s future performance as a Subaru dealer were not assuaged by the knowledge that the size of BAS\u2019s work force and facility would increase in direct proportion to the number of additional car manufacturers BAS would represent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-14\">. The final franchise agreement between BAS and SNE expired December 31, 1978. However, SNE has agreed not to formally terminate its franchise relationship with BAS until the conclusion of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-19\">. Inasmuch as the existing franchise agreement was to expire December 31, 1978, SNE decided prior to trial not to renew, rather than to terminate, that agreement. As the court below observed, this change in SNE\u2019s plan of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>most likely was undertaken as a tactical move to improve its position at trial. We, however, find nothing in the district court\u2019s decision to support the assertion BAS argues on appeal that the district court regarded the legal standards governing terminations and non-renewals to be other than identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">. Numerous other grounds exist to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of BAS\u2019s antitrust claims, among them being BAS\u2019s failure to present sufficient evidence to establish the existence of a relevant market.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\">. BAS contends that the prior course of dealing between the parties (i. e., SNE\u2019s routine renewals of past franchise agreements with BAS) is a relevant indicator of such \u201creasonable commercial standards.\u201d Such reasoning, of course, ignores the crucial distinction between BAS\u2019s past and present operations: representing Subaru and two other non-competing lines of cars, as contrasted with representing Subaru and five other lines of cars, two of which (Buick and Pontiac, each of which had recently introduced so-called \u201cX cars,\u201d small, front wheel drive models designed to compete with similar imported cars) compete directly with Subaru. We believe that this distinction is sufficient to render the prior course of dealing between SNE and BAS irrelevant in identifying the \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d which should apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b756-5\">. Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7 4074(c)(3) (Supp.1979), provides that \u201cThe nonrenewal of a franchise or selling agreement, without due cause, shall constitute an unfair termination of such franchise or selling agreement.\u201d By Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7 4073(a), such an unfair termination or cancellation is \u201cdeclared to be unlawful.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\">. SNE conceded that the principal purposes of conditioning a franchisee\u2019s move to a new location on 'SNE\u2019s prior approval were to insure that the franchisee\u2019s operations were of the type relied on when the franchise agreement was entered, as well as to prevent a dealer from invading another franchisee\u2019s territory. Under the circumstances of this case, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that this factor was not relevant to the determination of whether SNE acted with \u201cdue cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b756-12\">. The court below found that SNE had gathered the bulk of the evidence supporting the claimed inadequacies of BAS\u2019s New Facility and personnel after SNE had firmly decided to end its franchise relationship with BAS. Because the district court felt that SNE\u2019s investigation of BAS had been colored by SNE\u2019s previously adopted position, the court refused to afford any weight to evidence of BAS\u2019s alleged inadequacies developed in SNE\u2019s investigation of BAS, an investigation which was conducted after SNE had formally notified BAS of its intention to terminate the franchise relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b757-6\">. In a footnote to its opinion the district court described the effect of its allocation of the burden of proof between the parties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">[Pjlaintiff established a prima facie case that defendant lacked due cause by showing that the dealership met all of SNE\u2019s objective standards. SNE responded with evidence of other reasons for its termination which BAS did not effectively rebut. Thus plaintiff failed to meet the second level of the burden of proof, its burden of persuasion .. . not because it failed to prove a negative, but because it did not respond adequately to defendant\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\">. The alleged conflicts in the evidence primarily involve varying testimony concerning what transpired at several meetings'between officials of BAS and SNE prior to BAS\u2019s move to the New Facility. To the extent that these conflicts are germane to the outcome of the case, the district court appears to have credited BAS\u2019s version of the events. However, no conflicting evidence exists on the important point that prior to BAS\u2019s move to the New Facility SNE knew all the details of BAS\u2019s planned expansion, and BAS knew SNE\u2019s planned response.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b757-22\">. Regardless of the district court\u2019s misconception of the size of BAS\u2019s work force and facility, the court, in light of its decision to afford no weight to the bulk of SNE\u2019s evidence concerning the alleged inadequacy of the New Facility and its personnel, was all but compelled to find that, from an objective viewpoint, the New Facility was totally adequate. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
