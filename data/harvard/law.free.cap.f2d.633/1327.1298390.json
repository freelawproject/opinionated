The district court decision came after this court remanded the case for consideration of the effect of the 1976 FOIA amendments on the Postal Service\u2019s claimed exemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Church contends that the FOIA fully applies to the Postal Service and that the Postal Reorganization Act\u2019s investigatory files exemption, 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c)(6), is not an exempting statute within the meaning of the amended FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). We agree, and reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">The Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-5604, extended the reach of the FOIA to the newly created Postal Service. In accordance with the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Church sought to obtain any records in possession of the Postal Service that concerned the Church. The Postal Service released numerous documents to the Church, but withheld certain materials, compiled during its investigations of possible criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-19\">Unconvinced that the documents were properly withheld, the Church brought a district court action to compel disclosure. After an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the documents, the district court concluded that the files had been compiled for law enforcement purposes. The court granted summary judgment to the Postal Service, holding that the investigatory files were specifically exempted from disclosure by the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (Exemption 3),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which incorporates the postal exemption, 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c)(6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1432-20\">On appeal, this court remanded to the district court to determine whether section 410(c)(6) qualified as an exempting statute within the meaning of the amended version of Exemption 3. 593 F.2d at 904. The district court was also instructed that if it determined that section 410(c)(6) was such an exempting statute, it should then decide whether the Postal Service had complied with its own regulation, found at 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 265.6(c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and whether the documents were properly withheld under FOIA Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>emptions 5 and 7,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the alternative grounds claimed by the Postal Service. <em>Id. </em>at 905 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-4\">The parties simultaneously filed motions for summary judgment in the district court, addressing the issues raised in the remand order, reviving old arguments, and formulating new ones. The district court granted the Postal Service\u2019s motion for summary judgment finding that (1) section 410(c)(6) constitutes an exempting statute under the amended FOIA Exemption 3; (2) the information was properly withheld as material \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes; \u201d and (3) the Postal Service regulations are permissive and thus do not require disclosure. The Church again appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">\n<em>Section 410(c)(6) as an Exempting Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"APvZ\">The Church argues that the district court erred in holding that section 410(c)(6) is an exempting statute within the meaning of amended FOIA Exemption 3. As originally enacted, Exemption 3 simply shielded material \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute.\u201d In 1976, Congress narrowed Exemption 3 to cover a statute only if it \u201c(A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld ....\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-16\">The legislative purpose of this amendment has been thoroughly discussed elsewhere. For example, in <em>Irons &amp; Sears v. Dann, </em>606 F.2d 1215, 1219-20 (D.C.Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, Irons &amp; Sears v. Commissioner of Patents &amp; Trademarks, </em>444 U.S. 1075, 100 S.Ct. 1021, 62 L.Ed.2d 757 (1980), the court summed up the legislative history by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-17\">Congress\u2019 goal was to overrule legislatively the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Administrator, FAA v. Robertson, </em>422 U.S. 255, 95 S.Ct. 2140, 45 L.Ed.2d 164 (1975), which had given an expansive reading to the version of Exemption 3 then in force. The amended text and its legislative history make clear that Congress did not want the exemption to be triggered by every statute that in any way gives administrators discretion to withhold documents from the public. On the contrary, ... [i]t provided that only explicit nondisclosure statutes that evidence a congressional determination that certain materials ought to be kept in confidence will be sufficient to qualify under the exemption (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqj-dedup-0\">\u201cCongress did not, however, itself undertake to sort out those nondisclosure statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>that it comprehended as remaining within the exemption from those that it intended to exclude. Instead, it left that task for the courts .... \u201d <em>American Jewish Congress v. Kreps, </em>574 F.2d 624, 628 (D.C.Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">The Postal Service apparently concedes that section 410(c) fails to meet the requirements of subsection (A) of Exemption 3 because it gives the agency complete discretion to grant or withhold investigatory files by providing that the section incorporating the FOIA \u201cshall not require disclosure\u201d in certain cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It contends, however, that the (c)(6) provision need satisfy only one of the two subsections in order to qualify as an FOIA exempting statute, and that it in fact meets the subsection (B) criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-5\">a. <em>The Legal Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1434-6\">Subsection (B) necessarily contemplates some exercise of administrative discretion, \u201cbut its unmistakable thrust, like that of subsection (A), is to assure that the basic policy decision on governmental secrecy be made by the Legislative rather than the Executive branch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Postal Service argues that the \u201cinvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d protected by (c)(6), are \u201cparticular types of matters to be withheld,\u201d and therefore satisfy subsection (B). It points out that (c)(6) requires no \u201cguesswork\u201d and sets up no \u201cindefinite delineation of categories.\u201d Specifying such a concrete category, the Postal Service suggests, is all that subsection (B) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-7\">This Postal Service premise, however, rests on too simplistic an analysis of subsection (B) and its judicial gloss. In <em>American Jewish Congress, </em>the District of Columbia Circuit held that section 7(c) of the Export Administration - Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 2406(c), was not an exempting statute under Exemption 3. That statute prohibited disclosure of \u201cinformation ... deemed confidential or with reference to which a request for confidential treatment is made by the person furnishing such information,\u201d unless the agency decides that withholding the information, \u201cis contrary to the national interest.\u201d In determining that the requirements of neither subsection (A) nor (B) were satisfied, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adt\">Nondisclosure is countenanced by Subsection (B) if, but only if, the enactment is the product of congressional appreciation of the dangers inherent in airing particular data and incorporates a formula whereby the administrator may determine precisely whether disclosure in any instance would pose the hazard that Congress foresaw.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1434-10\">574 F.2d at 628-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-11\">In other words, the policy that the legislature, not the executive, should make decisions about secrecy is frustrated if a statute includes \u201cwithin its sweep provisions reflecting no more than a vague apprehension that an agency might someday fall heir to sensitive information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-12\">The <em>American Jewish Congress </em>court, then, suggests two necessary considerations in deciding whether a given \u201ccriterion\u201d or enumerated matter satisfies subsection (B). First, a court must consider the underlying congressional intent to exempt material from the FOIA. Somehow Congress must manifest its appreciation of the specific dangers of disclosure, and thus its intent to exempt, or subsection (B) goes unsatisfied. Second, a court must analyze, as it does under subsection (A), the amount of discretion left to the agency. For, as the court noted, statutes setting forth very general benchmarks for secrecy \u201cin fact delegate to administrators the entire burden of identifying the problems disclosure might generate\u201d and thus \u201cdo not satisfy subsection (B)\u2019s requirement that Congress have articulated \u2018particular criteria.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>Contrary to the Postal Service\u2019s contention, nothing in the line of cases that find certain provisions are exempting statutes within the meaning of Exemption 3 suggests otherwise. For example, in Lee <em>Pharmaceuticals v. Kreps, </em>577 F.2d 610 (9th Cir. 1978), this court examined section 122 of the Patent Act, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 122, in light of FOIA Exemption 3. Section 122 provides that patent applications must not be released unless the applicant gives authority, release is necessary to carry out other congressional provisions, or the Commissioner determines it is necessary because of \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d In holding that section 122 is a subsection (B) exempting statute, the court looked to both legislative intent and degree of discretion. It stressed that nothing in the legislative history supported the view that Congress intended to exclude section 122 from FOIA coverage. 577 F.2d at 617. In fact, it found to hold otherwise would mean \u201cdestruction of the patent system.\u201d <em>Id. Accord Irons &amp; Sears v. Dann, </em>606 F.2d at 1221. Further, although the court recognized that subsection (B) \u201ccould provide for limited discretionary disclosure,\u201d in quoting <em>Sears v. Gottschalk, </em>502 F.2d 122, 126-27 (4th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Sears v. Dann, </em>422 U.S. 1056, 95 S.Ct. 2680, 45 L.Ed.2d 709 (1975), the court suggested that the absence of guidelines for the Commissioner\u2019s exercise of discretion \u201cwould not be determinative\u201d because \u201capplications for patents\u201d is a narrow enough class of items. <em>Id. </em>at 616 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">Likewise, in <em>Founding Church of Scientology v. National Security Agency, </em>610 F.2d 824 (D.C.Cir.1979), the District of Columbia Circuit held that a provision involving the National Security Agency satisfied subsection (B), but not (A). In so holding, the court stated that an examination of the statute \u201cand its legislative history confirms the view that it manifests a \u2018congressional appreciation of the dangers inherent in airing particular data,\u2019 and thus satisfies the strictures of Subsection (B) (footnote omitted).\u201d 610 F.2d at 827-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">b. <em>Legislative Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-9\">In first turning to the question whether the legislature intended to exempt Postal Service investigatory files from FOIA disclosure, we do not find that Congress appreciated the dangers inherent in disclosing \u201cinvestigatory files\u201d, thereby formulating criteria \u201cwhereby the administrator may determine precisely whether disclosure in any instance would pose the hazard that Congress foresaw.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>American Jewish Congress, </em>574 F.2d at 628-29. To the contrary, in amending FOIA Exemption 7, Congress made strong statements about the hazards of agencies withholding, <em>carte blanche, </em>any information thrust into an \u201cinvestigatory file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-10\">The legislative history of Exemption 7, then, provides persuasive evidence of the congressional attitude toward exemption of investigatory materials. As originally enacted, Exemption 7 simply permitted nondisclosure of \u201cinvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes except to the extent available by law to a private party.\u201d 80 Stat. 251 (1966). The only difference between the original Exemption 7 and the (c)(6) postal exemption is that the latter additionally covers investigatory files, \u201cwhether or not considered closed.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In 1974, FOIA Exemption 7 was rewritten to permit the nondisclosure of \u201cinvestigatory <em>records </em>compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that producing such <em>records </em>\u201d would involve one of six enumerated dangers (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-11\">The Supreme Court thoroughly reviewed the legislative history and purpose of Exemption 7 in <em>NLRB v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>437 U.S. 214, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In proposing the amend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>merit, \u201cSenator Hart emphasized his concern that \u2018material cannot be and ought not be exempted merely because it can be categorized as an investigatory file compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227, 98 S.Ct. at 2319, <em>quoting </em>the Freedom of Information Act Source Book, Sen. Doc. 93-82, Subcommittee on Administrative Practice &amp; Procedure, Senate Judiciary Committee, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 332 (1974). As Congressman Moorehead explained to the House, this concern derived from \u201c \u2018recent court decisions\u2019 that had applied the exemptions to investigatory files \u2018even if they ha[d] long since lost any requirement for secrecy.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 98 S.Ct. at 2321, <em>quoting </em>H.R.Rep.No.92-1419, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such cases, \u201cin Senator Hart\u2019s view, erected a \u2018stone wall\u2019 against public access to any material in an investigatory file.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 98 S.Ct. at 2320.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">In originally enacting Exemption 7, then, Congress recognized that \u201claw enforcement agencies had legitimate needs to keep certain records confidential, lest the agencies be hindered in their investigations or placed at a disadvantage when it came time to present their case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 98 S.Ct. at 2318. The thrust of congressional concern and its purpose in its amendment of Exemption 7, however, \u201cwas to indicate that \u2018with passage of time, ... when the investigation is all over and the purpose and point of it has expired, it would no longer be an interference with enforcement proceedings and there ought to be ... disclosure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 98 S.Ct. at 2322.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-10\">The Postal Service argues that the congressional concern that led to amendment of Exemption 7 should have no bearing here. Rather, it suggests that by virtue of its \u201cspecial relationship to the Federal Government,\u201d the Postal Service enjoys the power to preempt the FOIA. This special relationship, the Postal Service contends, is manifested by section 410(a), 39 U.S.C., which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-11\">(a) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in this title or insofar as such laws remain in force as rules or regulations of the Postal Service, no Federal law dealing with public or Federal contracts, property, works, officers, employees, budgets, or funds, including the provisions of chapters 5 and 7 of title 5, shall apply to the exercise of the powers of the Postal Service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-12\">The argument is unconvincing. The Postal. Reorganization Act was passed to \u201c[ejliminate serious handicaps that [were then] imposed on the Postal Service by certain legislative, budgetary, financial, and personnel policies that are outmoded, unnecessary, and inconsistent with the modern management and business practices that must be available if the American public is to enjoy efficient and economical postal service ...\u201d H.R.Rep.No.91-1104, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>Cong. &amp; Ad. News, pp. 3649, 3650. In other words, by limiting the applicability of some federal laws, Congress intended to free the service from \u201cshared management\u201d so it could operate its day-to-day affairs in a more \u201cbusinesslike way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 3653. In this effort, Congress surely did not mean to place the Postal Service on a pedestal removed from the reaches of social policy and legislation. To the contrary, Congress envisioned that its fundamental postal reform would place responsibility for \u201cmanaging the system\u201d in a single place, but \u201cwith appropriate safeguards against abuse of that responsibility and appropriate assurances of continued congressional surveillance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-4\">The Postal Service cites <em>Zale Corp. v. United States Internal Revenue Service, </em>481 F.Supp. 486 (D.D.C.1979) as support for its theory of independence from the FOIA. In that case, the court held that a statute in the Internal Revenue Code governed despite a conflicting FOIA provision. The case is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">In <em>Zale, </em>the court emphasized that Congress passed the IRS statute after the FOIA. Further, the court found that \u201cthe secrecy of tax returns and related information has long been favored in practice, and it is not surprising that Congress would seek to carve out a special protection for this unique and highly sensitive type of information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489. Finally, the court noted the elaborate detail of the IRS section, and concluded that no evidence suggested Congress wished to frustrate its \u201cclear purpose and structure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Congress passed the FOIA amendment after the postal exemption, not before as in <em>Zale. </em>And Congress provided a far more detailed structure in Exemption 7 than it had in the (c)(6) postal exemption. Moreover, the express purpose of the IRS statute in <em>Zale </em>stood in \u201csharp contrast to FOIA\u2019s stated preference for disclosure to the general public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Presumably here the purpose of both statutes is to strike a balance between the public need for information and an agency\u2019s legitimate need to preserve confidentiality in its investigations. In any event, no evidence of a contrary purpose has been suggested, and we are unable to divine one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">c. <em>Amount of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"adc-dedup-0\">Not only do we find no congressional intent to exempt the Postal Service from the rigors of the FOIA, but we also conclude that section 410(c)(6) provides insufficient specificity to take it out of the impermissible range of agency discretion to make decisions rightfully belonging to the legislature. Unlike the exempting statute in <em>Lee Pharmaceuticals v. Kreps, </em>577 F.2d 610 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1073, 99 S.Ct. 847, 59 L.Ed.2d 40 (1979), section 410(c) permits the Postal Service <em>total </em>discretion to give or restrict any or all of its investigatory files.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, it is of no moment that (c)(6) narrows the range of documents to investigatory files \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d Moreover, in amending Exemption 7 to read \u201cinvestigatory records\u201d, Congress has already expressly decided that the term \u201cinvestigatory files\u201d allows too much agency discretion. Therefore, we hold that section 410(c)(6) is not an Exemption 3 statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>We reverse the judgment of the district court, but remand for a determination of the remaining issues whether the Postal Service failed to meet its statutory burden of proof,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and whether the requested information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemptions 5 and 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1432-7\">. <em>See Church of Scientology v.

In <em>Robertson, </em>the Supreme Court held that section 1104 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1504, was an exempting statute within the meaning of Exemption 3. Section 1104 permitted the FAA administrator to withhold certain reports when the administrator determined that disclosure \u201cwould adverse-' ly affect\u201d the subject of the report and was not \u201cin the interest of the public.\u201d The <em>Robertson </em>court reasoned that because there was no indication that Congress intended to exclude any existing nondisclosure statute from Exemption 3. all existing laws permitting confidentiality should stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1434-8\">.

First, by substituting the word \u201crecords\u201d for \u201cfiles,\u201d it would make clear that courts had to consider the nature of the particular document as to which exemption was claimed, in order to avoid the possibility of impermissible \u201ccommingling\u201d by an agency placing in an investigatory file material that did not legitimately have to be kept confidential. Second, it would explicitly enumerate the purposes and objectives of the Exemption, and thus require reviewing courts to \u201clook[ ] to the reasons\u201d for allowing withholding of investigatory files before making their decisions. The \u201cwooden[ ] and mechanical ]\u201d approach taken by the D. C.
