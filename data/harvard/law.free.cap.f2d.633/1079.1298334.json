The court ordered the Board to reinstate and further investigate the Committee\u2019s decerti-fication petition. Since we conclude that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the district court\u2019s judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-18\">The Union was certified in 1977 to represent a large number of the Company\u2019s employees, including those in the design unit. The action below involved only the employees in that unit. The Committee, representing the designers, had filed three separate petitions asking that the Union be decertified as bargaining representative for their unit. All three petitions were dismissed by the Regional Director, but it is only the third petition that is the subject of this appeal. The Regional Director dismissed it on November 7, 1979, indicating that bargaining had commenced on September 10 and 11, 1979, and that although progress had been made, the parties had not had reasonable time to engage in collective bargaining. The Board affirmed the petition\u2019s dismissal. The Company applied to the district court for an order compelling the Board to reinstate the petition and to conduct an investigation to determine if there were sufficient grounds for a repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>sentation hearing. The district court granted the requested relief by summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\">Although the Union was certified in May, 1977, the parties have yet to agree on a representation contract. In 1977, the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging unlawful bargaining tactics by the Company. After the normal course of litigation and appeal, the Board found a Company violation and its order was enforced by this court. <em>Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. v. NLRB, </em>602 F.2d 73 (4th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">The parties continued to bargain during the litigation, holding forty-two bargaining sessions ending in July, 1978. After this court\u2019s enforcement order, there were seven additional bargaining sessions, beginning on September 10, 1979. The crux of the Company\u2019s contentions is that the Board did not investigate the forty-two pre-enforcement order bargaining sessions in determining whether the parties had a reasonable time in which to bargain. The Company also argues that the Board\u2019s investigation of the third petition did not consider the section 7 majority rights of the design unit employees and that the Board was required to conduct a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">Section 9(c)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-7\">Whenever a petition shall have been filed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-8\">the Board shall investigate such petition and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation affecting commerce exists shall provide for an appropriate hearing upon due notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c)(1). The general rule, of course, is that courts do not directly review Board representation proceedings. <em>AFL v. NLRB, </em>308 U.S. 401, 60 S.Ct. 300, 84 L.Ed. 347 (1940). Section 9(c) hearings and investigations are particularly within the Board\u2019s discretion; the nature and scope of those proceedings were intentionally not specified in the Act but were to be developed in light of the Board\u2019s experience and expertise. <em>See, e. g., Lawrence Typographical Union v. McCulloch, </em>349 F.2d 704 (D.C.Cir.1965) (section 9(c)(1) hearing); <em>Schimmel v. Sperry, </em>48 Lab.Cas. \u00b6 18,494 (W.D.Mo.1963) (section 9(c)(1) investigation); <em>Marcie v. Madden, </em>37 Lab.Cas. 1165,557 (N.D.Ill.1959) (investigation). As has been said by the D.C. Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdP\">If representation hearings could be reviewed in the District Court to determine whether they were \u201cappropriate,\u201d most representation proceedings could be reviewed. This would violate the express intention of Congress to restrict review so as to prevent dilatory tactics and delay in certification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\"><em>Lawrence, supra, </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Leedom v. Kyne, </em>358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958), indicated there are few exceptions to the initial exclusiveness of the Board\u2019s determination in representation proceedings. <em>Kyne </em>involved an arbitrary action by the Board in certifying professional and nonprofessional employees as one bargaining unit without an election among the professional employees. The Supreme Court, although permitting judicial review of Board proceedings in that case, severely limited the application of its holding. The party claiming jurisdiction must show that there has been \u201can order of the Board made in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 79 S.Ct. at 184. <em>Kyne </em>is to be narrowly construed and should not be used to review alleged Board errors of fact. <em>Boire v. Greyhound Corp., </em>376 U.S. 473, 84 S.Ct. 894, 11 L.Ed.2d 849 (1964). Jurisdiction is appropriate only when there is a \u201cstrong and clear\u201d demonstration that a \u201cclear, specific and mandatory provision of the Act\" has been violated. <em>McCulloch v. Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co., </em>403 F.2d 916, 917 (D.C. Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1016, 89 S.Ct. 618, 21 L.Ed.2d 560 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-13\">The appellees contend that the Board\u2019s actions in this case are arbitrary and reviewable under the <em>Kyne </em>exception. They cite <em>Templeton v. Dixie Color Printing Co., </em>444 F.2d 1064 (5th Cir. 1971), and <em>Surratt v. NLRB, </em>463 F.2d 378, 381 n. 1 (5th Cir. 1972), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>to support their position. <em>Templeton </em>and <em>Surratt </em>both involved the automatic dismissal of decertification petitions because the union had filed \u201cblocking charges.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Surratt </em>the charges were found to be without merit, while in <em>Templeton </em>the charges had been pending for almost four years at the time the decertification petition was dismissed by the Regional Director. The Fifth Circuit Court characterized the petition- dismissals and refusal to review in those cases as arbitrary. It held that the effect of the Board\u2019s actions frustrated the purposes of the Act and was counter to the congressional mandate that the Board conduct an investigation upon the filing of a decertification petition. In <em>Bishop v. NLRB, </em>502 F.2d 1024 (5th Cir. 1974), however, the Fifth Circuit considered a similar case and pointed out the narrow confines of its <em>Templeton </em>and <em>Surratt </em>decisions. It noted those cases \u201chad carved out a precarious exception to the general rule of review,\u201d and both had carefully and explicitly restricted the holdings to their peculiar facts. <em>Id. </em>at 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">The appellees contend that the limited scope of the NLRB investigation in the instant case brings it within the \u201cprecarious exception\u201d to the general rule declining judicial intervention in representation proceedings. The district court, in issuing the order, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-5\">We hold that the conduct of the Regional Director and the Board simply did not constitute a meaningful investigation as mandated by \u00a7 9(c) of the Act and, therefore, that the Board arbitrarily failed to exercise its statutory responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The trial court supported its finding primarily on the Board\u2019s failure to analyze the forty-two pre-enforcement order bargaining sessions. The Regional Director\u2019s November 7, 1979, letter dismissing the petition, however, indicates he had conducted an investigation. He had explored the two prior decertification petitions, the earlier proceedings before the Board and in the courts, and recent progress in negotiations between the parties. The appellees and the district court, in attacking the scope of the investigation, implicitly admit its existence. The Regional Director apparently decided that this court\u2019s 1979 decision enforcing the Board\u2019s earlier order placed the bargaining sessions under a new light. He consequently decided to consider the time and progress of the 1979 bargaining sessions but not to consider the sessions occurring prior to the enforcement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">We do not judge the accuracy of the Board\u2019s selective investigative technique. It has the authority to determine the scope of an investigation necessary to act on a decertification petition. If the NLRB completely abrogates its responsibility, as in <em>Kyne, Surratt, </em>and <em>Templeton, </em>we will compel it to act. Neither the district court nor this court, however, has the subject matter jurisdiction to quantitatively gauge the Board\u2019s representation investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\">Similarly, the guidance furnished by section 9(c)(1) prohibits us from ordering the Board to conduct a hearing in this case. A hearing must be provided only after the Board has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists. Since the Board has met its statutory obligation by conducting an investigation, a judicial body cannot interfere with its evaluation of the investigation short of the Board\u2019s arbitrary action. The decision to dismiss the petition was based on the factors listed in its letter of November 7, 1979. The decision, whether right or wrong, was not arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\">The appellees argue, finally, that dismissal of the Committee\u2019s third decertification petition violates the employees\u2019 section 7 statutory right to freely choose their own bargaining representatives. By refusing to allow a decertification election, it is alleged, the Board will \u201cforce an unwanted action on an unwilling majority.\u201d The section 7 rights granted by Congress are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>certainly vital. It is, however, a specific congressional mandate which the Board is required to observe in conducting a 9(c)(1) representation investigation and hearing. To hold otherwise would be to require judicial oversight of every certification and decertification petition alleging majority status. The Act\u2019s general goals of free choice and majority rule do not contain a grant of federal jurisdiction; nor does the arguable contravention of those goals permit jurisdiction under <em>Kyne. See Physicians National House Staff Association v. Murphy, </em>443 F.Supp. 806, 810 (D.D.C.1978), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>\u2014 F.2d \u2014 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">As we indicated in our post-argument order the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to define the required scope of the Board\u2019s investigation nor to require the Committee\u2019s petition to be reinstated. Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court with directions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">. A \u201cblocking charge\u201d is the filing of an unfair labor practice charge by a Union while a decer-tification petition is pending. The bona fide filing of an unfair labor practice charge normally is the basis for dismissal of a decertification petition pending the resolution of the unfair labor practice charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
