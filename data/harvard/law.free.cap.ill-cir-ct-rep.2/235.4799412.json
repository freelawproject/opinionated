Dunne as mayor of said city, either by or through the said police department of said city or in any other way, to enforce or compel the observance of the said law or to prevent the violation thereof by said Kenna, or to punish or secure his punishment for violating the same, either by revocation of his licenses or in any other manner, and petitioner charges that it is the intention of said Kenna to conti/nue to and that he will disregard and disobey said law in the operation by him, of said saloons as long as he is permitted by said mayor to do so.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-3\" pgmap=\"264\">VII.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At_\" pgmap=\"264\">And our petitioner shows and charges specifically that the said Edward F. Dunne, during the course of his campaign for election as mayor of said city, openly and publicly declared to the people of the City of Chicago, and especially to the voters thereof, that if elected to the office of mayor of said city he would not enforce the said Sunday closing. law, nor take any steps or measures to compel the observance thereof; that said declaration was made as a campaign pledge or promise after a similar declaration had been publicly made by his chief opponent, a rival candidate for said office; and that since that Edward F. Dunne has entered upon the duties of his said office he has on several occasions openly and publicly repeated said declaration either directly or by specific reference to his said previous declaration; that on several occasions since his election many citizens of Chicago, individually and as delegations or representatives of various civic organizations in said city interested in the welfare and good order thereof, have called upon him and requested him to enforce said Sunday closing law, and that on every such occasion he has refused to do so, either expressly or by reference to his said previous declaration; and'your petitioner shows in particular that heretofore, to-wit: on the 11th day of September, 1905, relator William A. Bartlett with several other citizens of Chicago called upon said mayor and requested him to take measures for enforcing said Sunday closing law and inquired of him as to his intentions in that behalf, and that said mayor in reply to such requests and inquiries, then and there referred to the said declaration made by him as aforesaid during his said pre-election campaigning, saying that he had then stated his position on the question clearly and that he saw no reason now why he should change his position.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\" pgmap=\"264\">VIII.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\" pgmap=\"264(21) 265(327)\">And your-petitioner shows and charges that the said mayor has had full notice and knowledge of the said open and notorious habitual violation of said Sunday closing law by the said Michael Kenna, that he has full and ample means through the police force of said city, of ascertaining and keeping informed of such violations of said law, and full power and authority to enforce the observance thereof by said Kenna and to punish and secure his prosecution and punishment for violating the same and that his failure to execute said law and to compel the observance thereof by said Kenna is not because of any lack of knowledge on his part of such violation of said law, nor because of any lack of means or power or authority on his part to compel the observance of said law by said Kenna or to punish and cause him to be punished for his said violations thereof but because, as your petitioner is informed and believes and charges and as clearly appears from his declaration aforesaid, it is his deliberate intention not to take a/ny action in the matter of compelling the observance of said law, or preventing its violation, or punishing or causing to be punished the violators thereof, and because he is willing and intends to permit said Kenna to continue openly and publicly to disregard and violate said law, and to habitually keep his saloons or tippling houses open on Sundays. And your petitioner alleges that, unless compelled by the mandate of this court to perform his duty in that regard, the mayor will hereafter continue to permit said Kenna wholly to disregard said Sunday closing law, and habitually to keep his said saloons open and to dispense liquors therein on Sundays, and will wholly fail and refuse to perform his duty in that regard or to take any steps \u25a0or measures to compel obedience by said Kenna to the said Sunday closing law of this state or in any wise to prevent or punish or prosecute him for the violation thereof.</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-4\" pgmap=\"265\">That on the thirteenth day of December, 1906, the following notice and request in writing was given to said Edward F.

Dunne as mayor of the city of Chicago and his successors in office, enjoining and commanding him and them without delay, and by the use, so far as may be necessary for the purpose of every means, power and authority in that behalf conferred upon the mayor of said city by the law of this state or the ordinances of the city of Chicago to proceed, and thenceforth to continue to enforce against said Michael Kenna as the proprietor of said saloons at numbers 279 and 300 South Clark street in said city of Chicago the statute of this state.prohibiting the keeping open upon the first day of the week called Sunday, of tippling houses and other places where liquor is sold or given away (commonly called the Sunday closing law) by closing or compelling him to close and keep the same closed on each and every Sunday thereafter and in case of his refusal to obey the law in that behalf to secure his prosecution therefor and to punish such violation of said law by the revocation of his licenses; and that such other and further order may be made in the premises as the court shall deem just and necessary.</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-3\" pgmap=\"268\">The affidavits of the relators are attached to the petition.</p><p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-4\" pgmap=\"268\">The respondents each filed a motion to strike from the petition those portions thereof which are indicated by italics. The grounds of the motions were as follows:</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\" pgmap=\"268\">(a) That each of said portions of said petition respectively consists of allegations of matters of evidence and does not present issuable allegations of fact.</p><p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\" pgmap=\"268\">(b) That each of said portions of said petition respectively consists of allegations of items of evidence or of mere statements of evidence.</p><p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\" pgmap=\"268\">(c) That each of said portions- of said petition respectively consists of inferences of law drawn from the facts or matters of evidence alleged.</p><p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-8\" pgmap=\"268\">(d) That each of said portions of said petition respectively consists only of conclusions of law.</p><p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-9\" pgmap=\"268\">(e) That each of said portions of said'petition respectively contains only an allegation or allegations of law.</p><p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-10\" pgmap=\"268\">(f) That each of said portions of said petition respectively is irrelevant.</p><p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-11\" pgmap=\"268\">(g) That each of said portions of said petition respectively is immaterial.</p><p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-12\" pgmap=\"268\">(h) That each of said portions of said petition respectively is surplusage.</p><p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-13\" pgmap=\"268\">(i) That each of said portions of said petition respectively is impertinent.</p><p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-14\" pgmap=\"268\">Thereafter the relators filed a motion to strike from the files respondents\u2019 motions to strike. On January 8, 1907 this motion was denied, the court rendering the following opinion:</p> <opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b268-15\" pgmap=\"268\">Chytraus, J.</author> <p id=\"Ajb\" pgmap=\"268\">(orally): \u2014 \u2022</p> <p id=\"b268-16\" pgmap=\"268\">I am of the opinion now, as I have been all along, the proper practice is in. any state where the common law prevails, to reach matter that is immaterial or improper, is by motion to strike out. It is, in my judgment, 'the best and most orderly way by which to reduce pleadings to a single issue, or reduce questions to a single issue.</p> <p id=\"b268-17\" pgmap=\"268(10) 269(214)\">This case of the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad Company v. O\u2019Connor, 119 Ill. 586, while to an extent it sustains the contention of the petitioner here, yet I don\u2019t think it is an authority in point. It appears that the supreme court there made a remark as to what the proper practice was, without reference to any -authority at all, and then the remark was very much modified by the language that follows, where the court says that there was no prejudice by the procedure followed. These other cases cited by Mr. Mayer, I think, are about of the same kind. I do not think in any one of them, so far as I have observed, the question was squarely before the court, that is, the particular proposition was not the one upon which the decision hinged. So I do not think that the old common-law practice has been changed or altered in respect to a motion to strike being the proper way in which to reach improper, irrelevant or impertinent matter, and the court holds accordingly, that is, the motion will be entertained. As to the merits of the motion in this particular case, I believe, and you gentlemen both agree, it will take some time to argue it, and you both want to be heard at length.</p> <p id=\"b269-4\" pgmap=\"269\">On the merits of respondents\u2019 motions to strike the following opinion was rendered January 30, 1907.</p> <author id=\"b269-5\" pgmap=\"269\">Chytraus, J.</author> <p id=\"AW0\" pgmap=\"269\">(orally):\u2014</p> <p id=\"b269-6\" pgmap=\"269(146) 270(23)\">I believe in the strict enforcement of the rules of pleading, as I believe in the strict enforcement of the laws of our state. The courts have nothing to do with the policy or with the wisdom of the laws; and, I doubt if the court has anything to do with the rules of pleading. The rules of pleading that require him to strike from the record irrelevant, argumentative and repugnant matter, I think are good rules of pleading. If any one of these averments were necessary to enable this petitioner to introduce any evidence or any line of evidence competent in a case of this character, then as to such averment the motion to strike out should be overruled; but I fail to notice that any one of these averments that are objected to would enable the petitioners to introduce any evideuce that could not be introduced in the case without it; so I feel obliged here to sustain the motion to strike out.</p> <p id=\"b270-4\" pgmap=\"270\">I feel that' this is a ease of great importance, and may involve fundamental propositions and constitutional matters, and I do not want you gentlemen on either side to believe for a moment that I regard the matter lightly, because I do not. This point has been very ably argued by competent counsel ,on both sides and I am disposing of it in this way because I think that is the way .to dispose of matters; but, because I dispose of it immediately, I do not want you to think that I regard any of these matters trivial.</p> <p id=\"b270-5\" pgmap=\"270\">NOTE.</p> <p id=\"b270-6\" pgmap=\"270\">A motion to strike out is the proper method of ridding a pleading of impertinent, immaterial or irrelevant matter or that which is surplusage.
