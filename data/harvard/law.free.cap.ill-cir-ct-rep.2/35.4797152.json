Gifford, 10 Wend. 310; 1 Greenl. on Ev., Redfield ed., sec. 284a; Stephens\u2019 Dig. of Ev., p. 89, see. 3; Bell v. Lord Ingestre, 12 Q. B. 318 (E. C.

Defendant does not seek to contradict the writing, but to show that the writing never became operative.</p> <p id=\"b58-8\" pgmap=\"58\">The terms of the note cannot be varied by parol evidence; but in the present case the defense begins one step earlier. The defendant delivered the note and warrant of attorney to a third party, with the understanding that they were not to take effect except upon the happening of a contingent event, the contingent event never happened.</p> <p id=\"b58-9\" pgmap=\"58\">This is the prima facie case presented. I think the defendant is entitled to plead his defense, and have it submitted to a jury.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
