That clause forbidding Philip and Louis Gluckstern to engage in the restaurant business under the name, Gluckstern\u2019s Inc., so as to represent that their business is part of or that they are interested in the business of Gluckstern\u2019s Inc., was without limitation as to time, is applicable and in full force and effect. The 1940 agreement conferred no right upon defendant Philip Gluckstern to appropriate the good will created by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor at the particular site in question and defendants\u2019 acts considered together in their entirety were in that respect a violation of the contract as well as acts of unfair competition and were properly enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">We think, however, that the geographical prohibition in the judgment was too extensive and that the second decretal clause should be modified by substituting the words <em>\u201c </em>within three city blocks \u201d for the words \u201c within twelve city blocks \u201d and as so modified, the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, without costs. Settle order.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">Peek, P. J., Dore, Cohn and Callahan, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">Judgment unanimously modified in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. Settle order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
