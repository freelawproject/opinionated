A surveillance videotape makes clear that there was no reasonable view of the evidence, viewed most favorably to defendant, that he entered the victim\u2019s apartment without criminal intent and formed an intent to steal only once he was inside (see <em>People v Zokari, </em>68 AD3d 578 [2009], <em>lv denied </em>15 NY3d 758 [2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Assuming, without deciding, that the court was required to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in <em>People v O\u2019Rama </em>(78 NY2d 270, 277-278 [1991]) when the jury sent a note stating it had reached a partial verdict, we find that the court fulfilled its \u201ccore responsibility\u201d under <em>People v Kisoon </em>(8 NY3d 129, 135 [2007]). The court disclosed the note to counsel, announced its intention to take the partial verdict, and did nothing to prevent counsel from suggesting any other course of action. Accordingly, there was no mode of proceedings error exempt from preservation requirements <em>(see People v Starling, </em>85 NY2d 509, 516 [1995]). We decline to review defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we find no basis for reversal. Defense counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>evidently satisfied when the court accepted the partial verdict and immediately dismissed the remaining count, upon which the jury had failed to agree. Accordingly, counsel had no reason to provide any additional input.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\">Defendant also raises claims regarding the court\u2019s acceptance and the jury\u2019s rendition of the partial verdict. These claims do not fall into the \u201cvery narrow category\u201d of \u201cmode of proceedings\u201d errors exempt from the preservation requirement <em>(see People v Kelly, </em>5 NY3d 116, 119 [2005]). We decline to review these unpreserved arguments in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we also reject them on the merits. Concur\u2014 Gonzalez, EJ., Tom, Andrias, Renwick and Abdus-Salaam, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
