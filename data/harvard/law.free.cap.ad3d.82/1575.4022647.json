At the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>the accident, plaintiff was fixing and \u201cwinterizing\u201d a window over the front porch, which involved nailing together the wooden window frame that had fallen apart and placing plastic sheeting over the window. Supreme Court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, but on appeal plaintiffs contend in their brief only that the court erred in granting that part of defendant\u2019s motion with respect to the Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) claim, thus abandoning any issues with respect to the remainder of the complaint <em>(see Ciesinski v Town of </em>Aurora, 202 AD2d 984 [1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-3\">We conclude that the court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion with respect to the Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) claim on the ground that plaintiff was performing only routine maintenance at the time of the accident <em>(cf. Prats v Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>100 NY2d 878, 882 [2003]). We therefore modify the order accordingly. \u201c[Delineating between routine maintenance and repairs is frequently a close, fact-driven issue\u201d <em>(Pakenham v Westmere Realty, LLC, </em>58 AD3d 986, 987 [2009]), and we conclude on the record before us that there is a question of fact precluding summary judgment on that issue. \u201c[I]n order for work to constitute a \u2018repair\u2019 under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1), there must be proof that the . . . object being worked upon was inoperable or not functioning properly\u201d <em>(Goad v Southern Elec. Intl., </em>263 AD2d 654, 655 [1999]). Here, plaintiffs raised a question of fact whether plaintiff was in fact repairing the window by their submission of evidence that the window on which plaintiff was working was not \u201cfunctioning properly\u201d <em>(id.), </em>i.e., it required securing because there was a risk that the window would fall out of the frame in the event that the window was opened <em>(see generally Short v Durez Div.-Hooker Chems. &amp; Plastic Corp., </em>280 AD2d 972, 972-973 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">We further agree with plaintiffs that defendant failed to establish as a matter of law that the actions of plaintiff were the sole proximate cause of his injuries. Thus, it cannot be said at this juncture of the litigation that \u201cthere is no view of the evidence ... to support a finding that the [undisputed] absence of [any] safety devices was not a proximate cause of the injuries\u201d <em>(Zimmer v Chemung County Performing Arts, </em>65 NY2d 513, 524 [1985], <em>rearg denied </em>65 NY2d 1054 [1985]).
