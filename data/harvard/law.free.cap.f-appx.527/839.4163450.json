After Wilson completed his sentence for his drug crime, he petitioned to vacate his conviction on the basis that trial counsel was ineffective, under <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), for misadvising him that his plea of guilty would not subject him to deportation. The district court denied Wilson\u2019s petition on the ground that <em>Padilla </em>did not apply retroactively on collateral review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Wilson\u2019s petition. Wilson\u2019s argument for relief is foreclosed by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>568 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013). In <em>Chaidez, </em>the Court held that <em>Padilla </em>announced a new rule, which \u201cunder the principles set out in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288[, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334] (1989), ... does not have retroactive effect.\u201d 133 S.Ct. at 1105. Because Wilson\u2019s conviction became final before <em>Padilla, </em>he \u201ccannot benefit from its holding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1113. Wilson also argues, for the first time on appeal, that his counsel was ineffective for failing to negotiate an agreement to prevent him from being deported, but we decline to consider an argument that Wilson failed to present to the district court. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>340 F.3d 1219, 1228 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">We AFFIRM the denial of Wilson\u2019s petition for a writ of error coram nobis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
