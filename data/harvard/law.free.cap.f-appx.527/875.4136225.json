Paterek (the \u201cPetitioner\u201d) under the Vaccine Act. <em>See Doe 21 v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>88 Fed.Cl. 178 (2009) (the <em>\u201cFinal Decision\u201d). </em>Because the Special Master properly denied the Petitioner\u2019s claim, we <em>reverse </em>and <em>remand </em>with instructions to affirm the Special Master\u2019s determination that the Petitioner is not entitled to compensation and to enter judgment for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">I. Cases Under the Vaccine Act</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">Under the Vaccine Act, <em>see 42 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-1 to 300aa-34, a petitioner seeking compensation may prove causation in one of two ways, depending on whether the case involves \u201cTable injuries\u201d or \u201coff-Table injuries.\u201d <em>See Moberly v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>592 F.3d 1315, 1321 (Fed.Cir.2010). First, if the administered vaccine and injury are listed in the Vaccine Injury Table, and the injury manifests itself within the specified time period, a petitioner receives a presumption of a causal link between the vaccination and the injury. <em>See de Bazan v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>539 F.3d 1347, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(i) (not requiring a showing of causation for a Table injury); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-14(a) (initial Vaccine Injury Table); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3 (current Vaccine Injury Table). Second, for injuries not listed in the Table, or which do not occur within the specified time period, a petitioner seeking compensation must prove causation-in-fact. <em>See de Bazan, </em>539 F.3d at 1351; <em>see also 42 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(ii) (requiring a showing of causation for an off-Table injury). This appeal involves only an alleged off-Table injury. To prove that a vaccination caused an off-Table injury, a petitioner must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, the following three prongs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-15\">(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-16\"><em>Althen v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>418 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed.Cir.2005). If a petitioner establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the government to establish an alternative causation by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Walther v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number><em>Servs., </em>485 F.3d 1146, 1151 (Fed.Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1)(B) (noting that compensation will not be awarded if the injury \u201cis due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine\u201d). If the government fails to do so, the petitioner is entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">II. Facts and Prior Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"AiM\">The Petitioner seeks compensation for a diphtheriatetanus-acellular pertussis (\u201cDTaP\u201d) vaccination that allegedly caused developmental delays in his son, J.P. On July 20, 1999, J.P. received the vaccination at his two-month well-baby examination. <em>See Doe 21 v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Serves., </em>No. 02-0411V, 2009 WL 3288295, at *1 (Fed.Cl. Jan. 16, 2009) <em>(\u201cSpecial Master Decision\u201d).</em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that examination, the treating pediatrician described J.P. as \u201chealthy\u201d and noted, regarding gross motor development, that J.P. could \u201croll[ ] to side.\u201d Later that evening, J.P. was admitted to the emergency room after having what the government has conceded was an adverse reaction \u2014 more specifically, a hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (\u201cHHE\u201d) \u2014 to the DTaP vaccine. <em>See id. </em>at *2. During this episode, J.P. had crossed eyes and a fever, but was described as alert and in no acute distress. <em>See id. </em>He was discharged approximately 75 minutes later in satisfactory condition. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">At J.P.\u2019s four-month well-baby examination on September 14, 1999, the treating pediatrician described him as \u201cwell,\u201d and noted that he could sit, hold up his head, and babble. <em>See id. </em>The doctor discussed the risks and benefits of vaccinations with J.P.\u2019s mother and, based on the previous HHE, gave J.P. only the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines rather than the DTaP vaccine, which also includes a component to prevent pertussis (commonly known as whooping cough). <em>See id. </em>at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">At a visit on October 4, 1999, J.P.\u2019s primary treating pediatrician, Dr. Turow, noted the possibility of a \u201cstrabismus\u201d or \u201cpseudostrabismus\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based on reports from J.P.\u2019s parents. As a result, he recommended an ophthalmological consultation. <em>See id. </em>Dr. Rubin, a pediatric ophthalmologist, examined J.P. on November 10, 1999, finding J.P. to be a \u201chealthy 6 month old baby\u201d with no evidence of strabismus. <em>See id. </em>Dr. Rubin believed that any symptoms \u201cwould probably resolve spontaneously over the next several months.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">At his sixth-month examination on November 8, 1999, J.P. was described as a \u201cwell infant,\u201d who had good head control and could grab objects well. <em>See id. </em>The doctor did note, however, that J.P. could not roll over and could not sit up without support. <em>See id. </em>J.P. was referred to another doctor for a left eye \u201cdeviation medially.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>Like at the four-month examination, J.P. received the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines but not the pertussis component. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">On January 31, 2000, at his nine-month well-baby examination, J.P. was again de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>scribed as \u201cwell,\u201d with the doctor noting that he could sit indefinitely without support, use a \u201cpincer\u201d grasp to pick up objects, speak basic syllables, wave, and play \u201cpeek-a-boo.\u201d <em>See id. </em>J.P. could not, however, pull himself up to stand or walk with the help of nearby support (known as \u201ccruising\u201d). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">On March 8, 2000, Dr. Turow noted a potential concern about J.P.\u2019s \u201cdevelopmental progression.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at *4. J.P. was diagnosed with \u201cfine &amp; gross motor developmental delay\u201d on March 27, 2000. <em>See id. </em>The examining specialist recommended physical therapy and monitoring. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Two days later, an ophthalmologist observed and recorded a \u201cvertical nystagmus.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>The next day, after J.P.\u2019s mother told Dr. Turow that the vertical nystagmus appeared to be worsening, Dr. Turow referred J.P. to a pediatric neurologist. <em>See id. </em>During his examination of J.P., the neurologist attempted to elicit, but did not observe, any nystagmus. <em>See id. </em>On April 5, 2000, Dr. Rubin examined J.P. but also did not observe any nystagmus. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The Petitioner filed a claim under the Vaccine Act on April 30, 2002, asserting that the DTaP vaccination administered on July 20, 1999, caused J.P.\u2019s developmental delays diagnosed in March of 2000. <em>See id. </em>at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">a. The Special Master Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">After a prior decision and remand not before us in this appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Special Master concluded that the Petitioner had failed to establish the second and third prongs required under <em>Althen, </em>and was thus not entitled to compensation. <em>See id. </em>at *22-30. The Special Master found that J.P. was developing normally from July of 1999 to March of 2000, at which point, the government concedes, he was suffering from a brain disorder known as an encephalopathy, and was developmentally delayed. <em>See id. </em>at *5, *8. The Special Master rejected the opinion, held by experts for the Petitioner, that J.P. was significantly developmentally advanced at two months. <em>See id. </em>at *9. While those experts assumed J.P. was rolling <em>over </em>(ie., from front to back or vice versa), the Special Master pointed out that the pertinent notation actually reads that J.P. \u201crolls to side,\u201d an activity perhaps only slightly advanced at two months. <em>See id. </em>at *9-10. The Special Master also rejected the related view that J.P. was potentially experiencing developmental delays at four months because he was not \u201cstill\u201d advanced at that time. <em>See id. </em>at *10-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">As to JJP.\u2019s condition at his six-month well-baby examination, the Special Master found that a preponderance of the evidence established that J.P. was developing normally, and that the failure to roll over or sit up without support merely demonstrated uneven development rather than delay. <em>See id. </em>at *12-13. The Special Master noted that Dr. Turow \u201ccould not express an opinion as to whether [J.P.] was developmentally delayed at six months\u201d while Dr. Wiznitzer, the expert for the government, testified that he would have merely \u201cmonitored\u201d a child in J.P.\u2019s situation. <em>See id. </em>at *13. Moreover, the Special Master was not persuaded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s experts, Drs. Shane and Meg-son, who opined that J.P. was delayed at six months. <em>See id. </em>According to the Special Master, their opinions were based on the assumption that a six-month-old should sit without support even though \u201ca preponderance of the evidence indicates that most babies achieve this milestone at seven-months.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Regarding the condition of J.P.\u2019s eyes, the Special Master clarified the difference between strabismus and nystagmus, and stated that while \u201cno credible evidence supports a finding that [J.P.] was suffering from a nystagmus in October and November 1999,\u201d \u201ca preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that [J.P.] suffered from intermittent strabismus.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at *16, *18. Thus, the Special Master found that any eye conditions were muscular, rather than neurological, in origin. <em>See id. </em>at *18.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The Special Master also found that while \u201ca preponderance of the evidence indicates that [J.P.] was still developing normally\u2019 at the time of his nine-month well-baby examination, \u201csome evidence indicates that [J.P.] had not reached one milestone,\u201d namely, J.P. could not cruise or pull himself to standing. <em>See id. </em>at *18. According to the Special Master, the experts supported the conclusion that J.P. was developing normally at this stage: Dr. Wiznitzer agreed that J.P. was developing normally but he would monitor him; Dr. Megson did not opine on delay, but instead noted the need for additional information about muscle tone prior to making an assessment; for his part, Dr. Shane did not give an opinion about J.P.\u2019s development, believing the prior examination of J.P. was \u201climited.\u201d <em>See id. </em>For various reasons, the Special Master found Drs. Shane and Megson unpersuasive and not credible as to certain critical points. <em>See id. </em>at *19-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Based on these findings, the Special Master concluded that the Petitioner had not satisfied the second prong under <em>Al-then </em>because there \u201cis little persuasive evidence to show that the July 20,1999 DTaP vaccine caused [J.P.\u2019s] failure to develop normally.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at *23. Specifically, the Special Master reasoned that, despite slightly missing two developmental milestones, J.P.\u2019s otherwise normal development through the six-month well-baby examination \u201cis not consistent with a child who had developed an encephalopathy on July 20, 1999.\u201d <em>See id. </em>To demonstrate the lack of causation, the Special Master highlighted the testimony of Dr. Turow, who stated that \u201cit was not impossible\u201d that the DTaP vaccine caused the developmental delays, but would go no further. <em>See id. </em>at *25. According to the Special Master, neither this testimony nor the other evidence set forth by the Petitioner satisfied the second prong. <em>See id. </em>at *25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The Special Master also concluded that the Petitioner had failed to establish prong three of <em>Althen </em>\u2014 a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination and the injury. <em>See id. </em>at *26. First, the Special Master found that the Petitioner had failed to present <em>any </em>evidence about the time frame that medical science would expect an injury caused by a vaccine to be manifest. <em>See id. </em>at *26-27; <em>see also de Bazan, </em>539 F.3d at 1352 (\u201cThus, the proximate temporal relationship prong requires preponderant proof that the onset of symptoms occurred within a timeframe for which, given the medical understanding of the disorder\u2019s etiology, it is medically acceptable to infer causation-in-fact.\u201d). Second, the Special Master found that the Petitioner had failed to establish that J.P.\u2019s symptoms fell within the unidentified medically appropriate time period because, for the reasons noted above, J.P. was developing normally through March of 2000. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number><em>Special Master Decision, </em>2009 WL 3288295, at *27-30. The Special Master made no finding as to <em>Althen </em>prong one. <em>See id. </em>at *22.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">b. The Final Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">On review of the <em>Special Master Decision, </em>the Court of Federal Claims determined that the Petitioner had established all three prongs under <em>Althen, </em>and thus remanded for an award of compensation. <em>See Final Decision, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 198-202. As to the first prong, the court held that the Petitioner had established a \u201cmedical theory causally connecting the vaccination and theory\u201d because the Vaccine Injury Table indicates that DTaP vaccines can cause encephalopathy \u2014 a causal connection \u201cwell recognized by the Office of Special Masters.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Regarding the second prong, the Court of Federal Claims found sufficient evidence of a logical sequence of cause and effect for three reasons. First, the court found support in Dr. Turow\u2019s testimony because causation can be found \u201ceven where the treating physician cannot unequivocally state that the vaccination caused the injury.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 200 (citing <em>Andreu v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>569 F.3d 1367, 1375-76 (Fed.Cir.2009)). The court found that \u201c[ajlthough Dr. Turow did not testify that the July 20, 1999 vaccine definitely caused Petitioner\u2019s condition, he \u2018believed\u2019 that was the case here.\u201d <em>See Final Decision, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 200. Second, the court noted that \u201cthere was no other evidence that explained [J.P.\u2019s] injury.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Third, the court was persuaded by the fact that, after administering the pertussis component in the first vaccination, J.P.\u2019s treating physicians did not administer that component in later vaccinations, instead only administering the diphtheria and tetanus components. <em>See id. </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The court found the proximate temporal relationship required under the third prong of <em>Althen </em>satisfied because the government conceded that J.P. had suffered an HHE after receiving the DTaP vaccine. <em>See id. </em>at 199. The court also found that J.P.\u2019s medical records showed signs of developmental delay as early as November 1999. <em>See id. </em>at 202. First, the court determined that, based upon its review of the medical records, \u201cby October 4, 1999, nystagmus may have been present, but escaped Dr. Rubin\u2019s attention or simply was misdiagnosed.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Second, the court found that J.P.\u2019s failure to roll over or sit up without support was not a sign of uneven development, as the Special Master had found, but rather a \u201cdigression\u201d that represented \u201ca missed developmental milestone.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Having found causation, the court reversed and remanded to the Special Master for an award of compensation. <em>See id. </em>at 202. The Special Master awarded $2,431,153.51 for life care expenses for the first two years after judgment, $75,000 in compensation for past unreimbursable expenses, and an amount sufficient to purchase an annuity contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The government timely appealed the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims awarding compensation. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">In Vaccine Act cases, we review <em>de novo </em>a decision by the Court of Federal Claims, applying the same standard of review as that court applies in reviewing a decision of a special master. <em>See Porter v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>663 F.3d 1242, 1248-49 (Fed.Cir.2011); <em>Hazlehurst v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>604 F.3d 1343, 1348-49 (Fed.Cir.2010). Under that standard, we uphold factual findings that are not arbitrary and capricious and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>review legal conclusions to assess whether they accord with the law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Moberly, </em>592 F.3d at 1321; <em>see also Munn v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863, 870 n. 10 (Fed.Cir.1992) (clarifying the standard set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The arbitrary and capricious standard provides a fact finder the most deference possible. <em>See Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870. Under that standard, \u201c[i]f the special master has considered the relevant evidence of record, drawn plausible inferences, and articulated a rational basis for the decision, \u2018reversible error will be extremely difficult to demonstrate.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Hazlehurst, </em>604 F.3d 1343 at 1349 (quoting <em>Hines v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>940 F.2d 1518, 1528 (Fed.Cir.1991)). In other words, as long as a special master\u2019s factual finding is based on record evidence that is \u201cnot wholly implausible, we are compelled to uphold that finding as not being arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>See Lampe v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>219 F.3d 1357, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2000). A court reviewing a special master\u2019s decision should not \u201creweigh the factual evidence, assess whether the special master correctly evaluated the evidence, or examine the probative value of the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses \u2014 these are all matters within the purview of the fact finder.\u201d <em>See Porter, </em>663 F.3d at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">IV. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">On appeal, the government argues that the Court of Federal Claims legally erred by substituting its own factual findings for those already made by the Special Master. According to the government, the court should have deferred to the Special Master\u2019s findings, which were never explicitly found to be arbitrary or capricious. The Petitioner responds that the first symptoms of delay should be deemed the onset of a vaccine-related injury, even if the first symptoms predate the diagnosis of the injury. Here, according to the Petitioner, the eye movements reported by J.P.\u2019s parents in October of 1999, as well as the potential indications of motor skill delays in November of 1999, represent early evidence supporting a finding that J.P. was, in fact, suffering from an encephalopathy soon after the first vaccination.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Based on the record, we agree with the government and conclude that the Court of Federal Claims erred in rejecting the Special Master\u2019s determination that the Petitioner failed to demonstrate entitlement to compensation. To resolve this appeal, we only need address the second prong under <em>Althen </em>\u2014 a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for J.P.\u2019s developmental delays. We will first explain why the findings in the <em>Special Master Decision </em>regarding prong two were not arbitrary or capricious and why his legal conclusions accorded with the law. Then we will turn to the analysis of the Court of Federal Claims in the <em>Final Decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">a. The Special Master Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">As noted, the Special Master\u2019s determined that the Petitioner failed to establish the second prong under <em>Althen </em>\u2014 a logical sequence of cause and effect. <em>See Special Master Decision, </em>2009 WL 3288295, at *22-26. The government has conceded two of the three necessary links <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>in the causal chain: (1) that the DTaP vaccine caused the HHE on July 20, 1999, see <em>id. </em>at *2; and (2) that whatever caused the encephalopathy (which the government admits was present by March of 2000) also caused the developmental delays, i.e., the relevant injury to J.P., see <em>id. </em>at *5. The issue here is whether the vaccination (or HHE) caused the encephalopathy and developmental delays. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Special Master\u2019s determination that the Petitioner failed to show this linkage by a preponderance of the evidence was not arbitrary or capricious, or tainted by legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">In his decision, the Special Master conducted a thorough review of the relevant evidence, including the testimony of the expert witnesses, and concluded that the medical records did not support a finding that J.P. developed an encephalopathy at the time of the HHE. <em>See id. </em>at *23. In reaching that conclusion, the Special Master provided a reasoned explanation for crediting the government\u2019s expert, Dr. Wiznitzer, who testified that the failure to roll over and sit up without support at the six-month examination were not signs of an encephalopathy beginning in July of 1999. <em>See id. </em>at *12-13. The Special Master found additional support for his conclusion in a note from a pediatric neurologist, Dr. Eviatar, who wrote that \u201c[i]t is my medical opinion that [J.P.\u2019s] developmental delay and immature eye movements are the result of congenital hydrocephalus and Arnold Chiara malformation ... and are not related to [diphtheriapertusis-tetanus] encephalopathy.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at *24. Further, the Special Master highlighted the testimony of Dr. Turow, who \u201cwas quite clear that he could not say that the DTaP [vaccine] caused the developmental delay.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at *25 (citing testimony at J.A. 388-90). Under the highly deferential standard applicable here, the Special Master\u2019s reasoned conclusions regarding prong two of <em>Althen </em>were not arbitrary or capricious, and should be upheld. <em>See Hazlehurst, </em>604 F.3d at 1349; <em>Lampe, </em>219 F.3d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">b. The Final Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">We turn now to the analysis in the <em>Final Decision </em>regarding the second prong of <em>Althen. See Final Decision, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 199-201. In that regard, we conclude that the Court of Federal Claims generally failed to apply the highly deferential standard applicable to its review of the <em>Special Master Decision; </em>rather than assessing whether the Special Master\u2019s findings were arbitrary and capricious, the court instead reevaluated the evidence and came to its own findings. This constitutes legal error. <em>See Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870 (\u201cThe Claims Court owes these findings and conclusions by the special master great deference \u2014 no change may be made absent first a determination that the special master was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d); <em>see also Porter, </em>663 F.3d at 1249 (cautioning a reviewing courts not to \u201creweigh the factual evidence, assess whether the special master correctly evaluated the evidence, or examine the probative value of the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses\u201d); <em>Hazlehurst, </em>604 F.3d at 1349 (noting that a reviewing court may not \u201csecond-guess the special master\u2019s fact-intensive conclusions, particularly where the medical evidence of causation is in dispute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">One example of the court\u2019s reweighing of the evidence here is its reliance on the testimony of Dr. Turow as one of the three bases supporting a finding of a logical sequence of cause and effect between the vaccination and the injury. When discussing the potential causation between the vaccination and the developmental delays in J.P., Dr. Turow stated that it was \u201cnot impossible,\u201d but that he did not \u201chave concrete evidence to connect the two.\u201d <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number><em>Final Decision, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 200 (excerpting the relevant testimony). The Special Master relied on this same testimony to support a finding that the Petitioner did not establish causation. <em>See Special Master Decision, </em>2009 WL 3288295, at *25 (\u201cLike Dr. Turow\u2019s written statements, his testimony falls short of the standard of evidence that supports a finding of \u2018a logical sequence of cause and effect.\u2019 \u201d). The Court of Federal Claims, however, reinterpreted Dr. Turow\u2019s testimony to support causation, finding that he, in fact, \u201cbelieved\u201d that the vaccination caused J.P.\u2019s condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Final Decision, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 200. In so doing, the court erred first by failing to explain why the Special Master\u2019s contrary finding was arbitrary or capricious, <em>see Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870, and second by improperly reweighing the Tu-row testimony, <em>see Porter, </em>663 F.3d at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In its analysis, the court also erred, we think, in its application of this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Andreu v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>569 F.3d 1367 (Fed.Cir.2009), and <em>Capizzano v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>440 F.3d 1317 (Fed.Cir.2006), to support its finding regarding the second prong. <em>See Final Decision, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 199-201. The court relied on <em>Andreu </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe testimony of a treating physician can establish a logical sequence of cause and effect, even where the treating physician cannot unequivocally state that the vaccination caused the injury.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 200 (citing <em>Andreu, </em>569 F.3d at 1376). This overstates the weight of equivocal testimony, such as Dr. Turow\u2019s. In <em>Andreu, </em>one physician had already testified <em>unequivocally </em>as to causation, leaving the equivocal testimony from another physician to merely provide some additional support. <em>See Andreu, </em>569 F.3d at 1375-76. Thus, <em>Andreu </em>does not stand for the proposition that equivocal testimony <em>alone </em>can establish causation. More importantly, as reasonably concluded by the Special Master, <em>see Special Master Decision, </em>2009 WL 3288295, at *25, Dr. Turow\u2019s testimony that causation was \u201cnot impossible\u201d fails to provide support for causation at all. As this court has previously held, the statutory standard requires more than just \u201cproof of a \u2018plausible\u2019 or \u2018possible\u2019 causal link between the vaccine and the injury.\u201d <em>See Moberly, </em>592 F.3d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">We also find error in the court\u2019s application of <em>Andreu </em>and <em>Capizzano </em>to the two other bases relied on by the court to support the finding that the Petitioner established the second prong: that \u201cthere was no other evidence that explained [J.P.\u2019s] injury\u201d and that J.P.\u2019s treating physicians withheld future administration of the pertussis vaccine. <em>See Final Decision, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 200-01 (citing <em>Andreu, </em>569 F.3d at 1375-77 and <em>Capizzano, </em>440 F.3d at 1326). In both <em>Andreu </em>and <em>Capizzano, </em>unlike here, the treating physician affirmatively concluded that the vaccine did, in fact, cause the injury. <em>See Andreu, </em>569 F.3d at 1376 (noting that the relevant expert \u201cstated unequivocally\u201d that he believed that the vaccine caused seizures); <em>Capizzano, </em>440 F.3d at 1326 (holding that \u201cthe chief special master erred in not considering the opinions of the treating physicians who concluded that the vaccine was the cause of Ms. Capizzano\u2019s injury\u201d). In the absence of an affirmative conclusion as to causation, the lack of an alternative cause does not, alone, satisfy a petitioner\u2019s burden. <em>See Althen, </em>418 F.3d at 1278 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>(stating that \u201cneither a mere showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccine and injury, nor a simplistic elimination of other potential causes of the injury suffices, without more, to meet the burden of showing actual causation\u201d); <em>Hodges, </em>9 F.3d at 960.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, given Dr. Turov/s testimony, the decision to withhold future administration of the pertussis vaccine provides little probative evidence of causation. <em>See Andreu, </em>569 F.3d at 1376-77. For these reasons, we conclude that the Court of Federal Claims erred in finding the second prong under <em>Althen </em>satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Lastly, we briefly address the conclusion that the Special Master committed legal error by allegedly engaging in a \u201c[sjelective review\u201d of J.P.\u2019s medical records. <em>See Final Decision, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 201. We can discern no basis for this conclusion. Although the Special Master did state that \u201c[t]he details of most events in [J.P.\u2019s] medical history after April 2000 are generally not relevant to determining whether the July 20, 1999 DTaP vaccination caused [J.P.\u2019s] developmental delay,\u201d he also made clear that \u201c[although details of [J.P.\u2019s] medical history after April 2000 are not set forth in this decision, these details appear in the two previous opinions and <em>have been considered </em>\u201d <em>See Special Master Decision, </em>2009 WL 3288295, at *5 (emphasis added). Finding certain information not relevant does hot lead to \u2014 and likely undermines\u2014 the conclusion that it was not considered. This alleged error of law was not a proper basis to reverse the Special Master.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims and remand with the instruction that the court affirm the Special Master\u2019s determination that the Petitioner is not entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-7\">.

Strabismus is commonly referred to as \u201clazy eye,\u201d in which a person\u2019s eyes are not properly aligned, usually because of a problem with the muscles around the eye. <em>See Special Master Decision, </em>2009 WL 3288295, at *14. Pseudostrabismus is a similar lack of alignment brought about by causes other than a problem with the ocular muscles. <em>See Final Decision, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 184 n. 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AAXu\">.
