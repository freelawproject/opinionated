Our review is plenary. <em>See Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, </em>536 F.3d 244, 251 &amp; n. 5 (3d Cir.2008); <em>see also Herring v. United States, </em>424 F.3d 384, 389 (3d Cir.2005) (noting that a motion under the \u201csavings clause\u201d is an independent action subject to de novo review). For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-18\">In 2009, Gillespie filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging various violations of her constitutional, civil, and statutory rights arising from tenure charges filed against her by the School District of the City of Newark. On March 5, 2010, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and we affirmed the dismissal on appeal. <em>Gillespie v. Janey, </em>441 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Fed.Appx. 890 (3d Cir.2011). On August 27, 2012, Gillespie filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) &amp; (d) seeking to vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment. The District Court denied the motion, and this appeal ensued. Appellees have filed a motion for summary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Gillespie maintained that the judgment should be vacated pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(d) (\u201cthe savings clause\u201d) because there has been a fraud on the court. Specifically, she asserts that in dismissing the complaint, the District Court relied on certain documents submitted to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court which were fraudulent. We have set forth the demanding standard of proof required to demonstrate fraud upon the court including (1) an intentional fraud; (2) by an officer of the court; (3) which is directed at the court itself; and (4) in fact deceives the court. <em>Herring v. United States, </em>424 F.3d 384, 386 (3d Cir.2005). Gillespie clearly cannot meet this standard as the District Court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the claims were either time-barred or premature; the allegedly fraudulent documents had no bearing on the propriety of the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">A Rule 60(b)(4) motion on the grounds that a judgment is void may be brought at any time. <em>See United States v. One Toshiba Color Television, </em>213 F.3d 147, 157 (3d Cir.2000) (en banc). A judgment can be voided if the rendering court lacked personal or subject matter jurisdiction, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law. <em>United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, </em>559 U.S. 260, 270-71, 130 S.Ct. 1367, 1377, 176 L.Ed.2d 158 (2010). Gillespie asserted that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over her complaint; however, her complaint included claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and alleged violations of her constitutional rights. Accordingly, as we noted on appeal, the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 &amp; 1343, and supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gillespie also argued that the judgment had been voided by certain decisions of the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. This is, in essence, an attack on the reasoning of the judgment, not on the authority of the District Court to render it. <em>See Gschwind v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>232 F.3d 1342, 1346 (10th Cir.2000) (judgment is void if the \u201crendering court was powerless to enter it\u201d). A judgment is not void merely because it is erroneous. <em>Espinosa, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1377. Moreover, there is no merit to Gillespie\u2019s assertion that the \u201clegal and factual landscape\u201d of her case has changed; the majority of her claims remain time-barred. Furthermore, many of her contentions are the same arguments which were rejected when her complaint was dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, because we find that the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order entered October 19, 2012. Appellant\u2019s motion for recusal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Finally, in denying the Rule 60 motion, the District Court noted that Gillespie had come \u201cdangerously close ... to filing a frivolous action\u201d as her motion was a \u201cwaste of the Court\u2019s ... [and] defense counsel\u2019s time\u201d and admonished her that the \u201cnext time it is filed, fees will be imposed along with costs.\u201d Tr. at 14-15. Citing Gillespie\u2019s failure to heed that admonishment in filing this appeal, as well as her numerous related filings, Appellees have filed for damages and costs pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38. Damages are awarded based on the merits of the appeal; we do not consider whether an appellant has acted \u201cout of malice, ignorance, or deceit.\u201d <em>Beam v. Bauer, </em>383 F.3d 106,108 (3d Cir.2004). While \u201cpro se litigants are not [ ] beyond the reach of Rule 38,\u201d <em>Martin v. Comm\u2019r, </em>753 F.2d 1358, 1361 (6th Cir.1985) (citation omitted), we are reluctant to impose sanctions on Gillespie. Although we agree with Appellees that she has persisted in her misguided arguments, Appellees were able to use our summary action procedure to good effect and will not have to file a brief. We note that the District Court\u2019s admonishment, as well as Appellees\u2019 motion and its attendant possible sanctions, should serve as sufficient warning to Gillespie as to the potential consequences of similar filings in the future, including any frivolous post-decision motions in this appeal. The Rule 38 motion is, therefore, denied without prejudice. To the extent Appellees seek \u201can order temporarily suspending Appellant\u2019s access to the federal courts pending disposition of Appellees\u2019 summary action motion,\u201d the request is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\">. The \"savings clause\u201d on which Gillespie bases her motion, in part, was formerly contained within Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Although she cites to that provision, Amendments in 2007 moved the savings clause provision to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(d). Gillespie also quotes language from case law dealing with motions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5); however, that provision, which provides for relief from injunction or consent decrees, is inapplicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\">. The motion to vacate our judgment in that appeal is denied. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. We note that we had jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Gillespie, </em>441 Fed.Appx. at 893.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. Even assuming arguendo that the basis for the decision dismissing the complaint was invalidated by subsequent state decisional law, this is insufficient to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6) absent extraordinary circumstances not present here. <em>See Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Trustees of UMWA Combined Benefit Fund, </em>249 F.3d 519, 524 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
