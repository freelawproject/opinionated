Marcus argues that, under <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), his sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d a sentencing range that has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission and that he is subject to the new mandatory penalties under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>The district court correctly denied Marcus\u2019s motion. Marcus was sentenced as a career offender, and Amendment 750 did not alter his sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). And because the Fair Sentencing Act is not an amendment to the Guidelines, the Act cannot serve as a basis for a sentence reduction under section 3582(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Even if we were to assume that Marcus could base his motion on the Fair Sentencing Act, his motion would fail because he was sentenced before the effective date of the Act. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
