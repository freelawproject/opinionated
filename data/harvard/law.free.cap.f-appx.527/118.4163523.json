Thus, we review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and apply plenary review to its legal conclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-18\">Mason filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on September 7, 2011. Mason complains that her eviction from 160 East Meehan Avenue and her arrest for criminal trespass were in violation of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s automatic stay. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a). However, we agree with the Bankruptcy Court and District Court that because Mason was not a party to the lease for that property, she had no posses-sory interest, and the lease and property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>were not part of her bankruptcy estate. Thus, the automatic stay had no effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">We further find hold that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mason\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedures applies to motions for reconsideration in bankruptcy proceedings. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9023; <em>In re Grasso, </em>490 B.R. 500, 526-27 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.2013). A proper Rule 59(e) motion may be based only on one of three grounds: (1) evidence not previously available; (2) an intervening change in law; or (3) to prevent a manifest injustice. <em>Wiest v. Lynch, </em>710 F.3d 121,128 (3d Cir.2013). Mason\u2019s motion was not based on new law, nor was it based on new evidence, since the state court order she sought to introduce was in existence at the time of her previous hearing. The Bankruptcy Court had no authority to alter its previous decision on the basis of \u201cmanifest injustice,\u201d as the lease in question was not property of Mason\u2019s bankruptcy estate. As the District court similarly perceived no error in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decisions, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-13\">. Mason\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pau-peris is granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\">. Further, even if she had been a proper tenant under the lease, the automatic stay (subject to a safe harbor exception of \u00a7 362(Z)) does not preclude a landlord from continuing an eviction proceeding if the landlord had obtained a prepetition judgment for possession of the property. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(b)(22); <em>In re Plumeri, </em>434 B.R. 315, 319-20 (S.D.N.Y.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-16\">. We have carefully reviewed all of Mason's filings in our Court. To the extent she asks us to consider documents that were available to the Bankruptcy Court, we grant that request; any documents that were not part of that record are not considered. Mason\u2019s motion for transcripts of the bankruptcy hearings at Government expense is denied, as it is not necessary for us to review the transcripts in order to decide her appeal. Mason\u2019s remaining motions are denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
