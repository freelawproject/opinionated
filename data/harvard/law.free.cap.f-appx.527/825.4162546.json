According to Mr. Flynn, the negligence of several agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 including Michael Nelson and Stephen Wojcik \u2014 caused the accident. The district court, following a bench trial, found that there was no negligence on the part of Agents Nelson and Wojcik, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>that even if there was, Mr. Flynn\u2019s own contributory negligence barred recovery under Alabama law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Mr. Flynn now appeals, arguing that certain of the district court\u2019s factual findings on the issue of negligence were clearly erroneous. Following review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Findings of fact cannot be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(6). As a reviewing court, we do not reweigh the evidence, and we cannot reverse simply because we might have decided the case differently. If there are two permissible views of the evidence, the district court\u2019s choice between them does not constitute clear error. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); <em>Solomon v. Liberty County Commissioners, </em>221 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Mr. Flynn was contributorily negligent. Mr. Flynn alleged that he was forced to swerve to his left \u2014 and as a result crashed into the back of the vehicle driven by Agent Nelson \u2014 when Agent Wo-jcik tried to enter his lane from the right. Even if Agent Wojcik acted negligently in attempting to change lanes, the district court found that Mr. Flynn contributed to the accident because he was speeding and did not attempt to apply his brakes after he was forced to swerve. Both of these subsidiary factual findings are supported by the evidence. First, one of the eye witnesses testified that, in his estimation, Mr. Flynn was driving 50-55 miles per hour, or 5-10 miles above the speed limit. <em>See </em>Tr. Transcript at 212. Second, Mr. Flynn did not remember braking or reducing his speed after swerving, and there were no tire marks on the road indicating that Mr. Flynn had applied the brakes. <em>See id. </em>at 78, 82, 98. Third, the police officer who investigated the accident \u2014 an officer who was a certified in accident reconstruction \u2014 determined that Mr. Flynn was not in control of his vehicle and was at fault for the collision. See <em>id. </em>at 97, 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">In sum, there is no basis for disturbing the district court\u2019s factual findings or judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">. Alabama law, which controls in this FTCA case, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1346(b)(1), generally provides that a party cannot recover if his own negligence proximately caused the injury. <em>See generally Lafarge North America v. Nord, </em>86 So.3d 326, 336 (Ala.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-20\">. Mr. Flynn also argues that the district court erred in finding that the \"sudden emergency\u201d doctrine did not apply. Because that doctrine does not help a driver who has lost control of his car and rear-ended a stationary vehicle, <em>see Friedlander v. Hall, </em>514 So.2d 914, 915 (Ala. 1987), we reject this argument given the district court's findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
