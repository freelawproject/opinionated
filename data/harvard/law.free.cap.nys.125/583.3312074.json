He was employed in the department from that time until December 16, 1907, when he was discharged, reinstated on June 8, 1908, and on the 3d day of August, 1908, was finally discharged, for the reason that the funds of the department were exhausted. That, if true, would seem to be a complete justification for his discharge. He was appointed for\u2019 no stated term, and state officers are forbidden to contract any indebtedness on behalf of the state in excess of money appropriated or otherwise lawfully available therefor. Laws 1909, c. 58 (Consol. Laws, c. 56) art. <em>2, </em>\u00a7 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">It appears, however, that from the time of his discharge to the present there have been other laborers employed in the division engineer\u2019s office of the Western division; but when they were appointed or the precise nature of their work is not disclosed. The department for the improvement of highways, to which the relator was originally appointed, is not now under the State Engineer and Surveyor, but under the control of the State Commission of Highways. Laws 1909, c. 30 (Consol. Laws, c. 25). The funds were transferred from his control to that of the Commission on February 17, 1909, and he now has not the disposition of the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">The precise place to which the relator desires to be appointed is that of axman, but he seems willing to take a transfer to some other position at the same salary. It appears that during his last employment he worked in the highway department, in the canal department, and in the office of the division engineer, performing whatever labor he was directed to perform, which included some of the duties usually performed by axmen. It does not precisely appear what work the relator did, how much of it was in the highway department, how much in the canal department, or how much was office work, nor just how much of that kind of work is left under the control of the State Engineer and Surveyor, and what part has been transferred to the State Commission of Highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>While the relator is entitled to preference in the civil service of the state (Const, art. 5, \u00a7 9; Laws 1909, c. 15 [Consol. Laws, c. 7] art. <em>2, </em>\u00a7 21), even to the extent of being transferred to any position which he may be fitted to fill, if his former position has been abolish\u00e9d or . made unnecessary, and the duty is imposed upon the officer having the appointing power to make such transfer effective (Laws 1909, c. 15 [Consol. Laws, c. 7] art. 2, \u00a7 <em>22), </em>the record is entirely silent as to whether any such place is open. The evidence is not returned. We have only the findings of the referee and the affidavits upon which the writ was issued; and, in the absence of any showing that there is a vacancy in some position or work for which the relator is fitted, he \u25a0 is not entitled to the writ directing his reinstatement in the State Engineer and Surveyor\u2019s department. It is incumbent upon the relator to show that there is such a vacancy. Matter of Breckenridge, 160 N. Y. 103, 54 N. E. 670; People ex rel. Chappel v. Lindenthal, 173 N. Y. 525, 66 N. E. 407. The appointing officer is not required to discharge other competent employ\u00e9s to' make room for the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The order denying the peremptory writ of mandamus should be affirmed, but, under the circumstances, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
