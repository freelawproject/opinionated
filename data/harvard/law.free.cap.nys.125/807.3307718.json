Before-I stepped into this hole, I was looking straight ahead. There was nothing there to attract my attention. I did not observe anything. I looked down to see if the way was clear; that is all. There was no grating on the sidewalk that I saw. I say I went into a hole. I fell on my left side, with my left foot. * * * At the time this happened, when I went into this hole, it was dark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Under cross-examination she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-9\">\u201cI didn\u2019t notice what kind of a hole it was. * * * I never had noticed it before the accident; and I never examined it after the accident. * * * I lived about two or three doors from the place where this accident occurred. * * * when I stepped into the hole, I was walking slowly along. I was looking straight ahead. I was not looking down at the sidewalk. I do not know how near the curb I was, but I should judge about a foot or a foot and a half from the curb.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Goodman testified that he knew the plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-12\">\u201cOn the night of August 26, 1906, on Sunday, I remember when she fell. I noticed the hole in which she fell. Q. Previous to that day\u2014the drain hole?A. Yes, sir; I did, at least a month. At the time I seen it, the hole was open, and then it was filled with sand, and then it was open again. The children opened it playing around the hole. There was no covering on the hole of no kind. This hole was about five or six inches wide. It was about a foot long. It was on the sidewalk. I could not tell how deep it was. * * * It was about two feet away from the curb, and between the curb and the stoop line. It was not filled in with dirt or anything, not at the time of the accident. I haven\u2019t any idea about the depth of the hole. * * * This hole ran lengthwise, east and west. It ran in the same direction as the curb and the sidewalk, and she lay there on her side. Her whole foot was in the hole. It was wedged in there. I helped to get it out. We did not lift her up before-we took her out. We had to take her shoe off in order to get her foot out. * * * I could not judge then how deep the hole was, or whether it had any bottom\u2014whether it was an opening down into the cellar way without any pit there, or whether there was something beneath the point where her shoe was. I could not say whether there was anything beneath or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">Pincus testified that he had seen this hole previously for a month before the accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-16\">\u201cIt was an open drain; it was supposed to have a cover on like a grating. There was no. cover on it; it was open. I couldn\u2019t exactly say how deep it was. :J * * I don\u2019t know what was in there, whether it was sand, or whether the hole led down into the cellar. No sir; it was not a hole right to the cellar. There was something in there, dirt at the bottom of it. Of course, I don\u2019t know anything about the internal construction of this air pipe,, or whatever it was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-17\">The plaintiff\u2019s daughter testified!:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-18\">\u201cAs we stepped aside, my mother\u2019s foot went down into this hole. I could not see how far her foot was into the hole; I did not look.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The plaintiff offered from the ordinances of the city of New York section 41 of the Sanitary Code;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-3\">\u201cEvery owner, tenant, lessee, and occupant of any building or lot, whether vacant or occupied within or near the built up portion of said city of New York, shall keep and cause to be kept the sidewalk and flagging and curb stone in front thereof free from obstruction or nuisance of every kind, and shall not allow anything in the area or yard or on or about his premises to become a nuisance or dangerous or prejudicial to health or life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">This was admitted under objection and exception. The plaintiff having rested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s counsel moves to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the defendant, Michael Kwint, was guilty either.of negligence or of maintaining a nuisance; counsel stating that he admits that the defendant was the owner of the premises, but denies that he was in possession and control of the premises in question, admits that this drain hole was in front of the premises, but denies1 that the premises were under the use, control, or possession of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Which having been denied, defendant rested, and then renewed his motion, which being denied, he excepted. He did not ask that plaintiff be compelled to elect between negligence or nuisance, and the case was submitted to the jury upon both grounds. At the close of the court\u2019s charge, defendant excepted to the submission of the question of defendant\u2019s negligence to the jury, and also excepted to the submission of the question whether or not the defendant maintained a nuisance. He also asked the court to charge that there was no evidence-that the defendant occupied or used the premises at the time the accident occurred, or immediately prior to that time, which was declined, except as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">I have recited all of the testimony descriptive of the hole into which the plaintiff put her foot. There is a failure of proof establishing defendant\u2019s responsibility therefor, under the doctrine of negligence or nuisance. The case was evidently tried by the plaintiff and submitted by the learned court upon the theory of the coal hole cases, illustrated by Clifford v. Dam, 81 N. Y. <em>52, </em>and Jennings v. Van Schaick, 108 N. Y. 530, 15 N. E. 424, 2 Am. St. Rep. 459. But in the Clifford Case the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-9\">/ \u201cThe public are entitled to an unobstructed passage upon the streets including the sidewalks of the city, but a structure such as that proved in this case was an obstruction. It was sufficient for the plaintiff to prove that in passing along the sidewalk he was injured by this structure, which was appurtenant to defendant\u2019s premises. * * , * .It is quite clear that the plaintiff was not bound to prove in the first instance anything except the existence of a hole in the sidewalk, for which the defendants were responsible, and that in passing along the sidewalk he fell into it.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The difficulty in the case at bar is that there is no evidence to show that this hole was a structure appurtenant to the defendant\u2019s premises, or that he created it, or maintained it, or was in any way responsible for its creation or maintenance. It is not shown what its purpose was, where it led to, what its subsurface depth was, or what its connections were. For aught that appears, it may have been constructed by the municipal auhorities to give access to its water mains or sewers, or it may have been constructed by some of the public service corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>to give access to a gas or electric line, or it may have been a mere hole in the ground. It is described! as a drain hole, and this is the admission of the defendant; but how a drain hole adjacent to the curb upon the sidewalk can be appurtenant to the defendant\u2019s premises is not in any manner suggested by the record. The admission is that the defendant \\vas the owner of the premises, and that this drain hole was in front of the premises, and that is all.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Upon the record the defendant has been held liable for a defect in the sidewalk of a public street for which he was not shown to be liable. In City of Rochester v. Campbell, 123 N. Y. 405, 25 N. E. 937, 10 L. R. A. 393, 20 Am. St. Rep. 760, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">\u201cWe have thus referred at length to many of the cases holding the nonliability of the lot owners, for the reason that there seems to have been quite a common impression, in which judges and lawyers have shared, that abutting owners are in some way liable to an injured party for'damages occasioned from their neglect to keep sidewalks in repair, when that duty is in any way enjoined upon them. It seems to us that there could never have been any logical cause for such impression, and it seems it has no foundation in the reported cases. Any other conclusion than that reached by us would, we think, be most unfortunate, as it would tend to relax the vigilance of municipal corporations in the performance of their duties in respect to the repair of streets and highways, and impose that duty upon those who might be utterly unable to discharge it. It would tend directly to demoralize the public service, and lead to disorder, decay, and impassibility of the public highways.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">And in Mullins v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 183 N. Y. 129, 75 N. E. 1112; the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-8\">\u201cThe principles of law applicable to the obligation of abutting owners on .any streets to keep the sidewalk in a safe condition for pedestrians are well settled. The abutting owner is not bound to keep the sidewalk in repair unless by virtue of the requirements of the statute, and is not responsible to travelers for defects therein not caused by himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Under these authorities, the admission in evidence of the section of the Sanitary Code, cited, supra, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">As the plaintiff wholly failed to make out her case, the judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
