Garrison, an employ\u00e9 of the city of New York, to establish the priority of an execution issued in behalf of said appellant against the wages or salary of said Garrison over a similar execution issued in behalf of another judgment creditor named Crowell. In effect the motion was to vacate.the execution issued in behalf of said Crowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">Both executions must find their justification, if any, in the provisions of section 1391, Code Civ. Proc. The execution in favor of Crowell was issued March 2, 1910, while another similar execution in favor of one M. H. Vogel was outstanding and unsatisfied. For the reasons stated in Bloomingdale v. Richardson (decided herewith) 125 N. Y. Supp. 320, the execution in favor of Crowell was unwarranted and voidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">It is urged that the objection, while it would have been good if taken by the judgment debtor, cannot be availed of by a junior judgment creditor. This contention is untenable. The appellant is interested in collecting his judgment as promptly as possible, for if he be delayed his execution may become valueless. Crowell having undertaken to issue his execution contrary to the provisions of the statute, it cannot be upheld against any one having an interest in attacking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">The order appealed from must be reversed1, with $10 costs and disbursements against the respondent Crowell, and the motion granted, with $10 costs against said respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
