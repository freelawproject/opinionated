When he reached Eighth avenue a car was coming south on the westerly track. As the driver drove his horses upon the first or easterly track the car was about three-quarters of a block away and coming slowly. Plaintiff\u2019s driver proceeded slowly across the westerly track, and when his horses had cleared it with the truck still upon the track and the car about five feet away, defendants\u2019 motorman was applying his brakes for the first time. Before the plaintiff\u2019s truck had cleared the westerly track the car collided with it causing the damage, to recover which this action was- brought. The testimony' of the driver\u2019s helper was substantially corroborated by a disinterested witness. Defendants offered no proof, but rested upon their motions to dismiss the complaint. Upon this state of the evidence the case was left to the jury, and the plaintiff had a verdict, which was set aside by the learned justice presiding at the trial. There was presented to the jury a question of fact. The veracity of the witnesses, their interest, and the probabilities of plaintiff\u2019s case were for the jury to determine, and it was error to set aside the verdict unless it was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to justify the conclusion that it was arrived at through passion, prejudice, or mistake. Berkowitz v. Consolidated Gas Co., 134 App. Div. 389, 119 N. Y. Supp. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">We think under the evidence, standing as it does uncontradicted, there was proof of defendants\u2019 negligence and freedom from contributory negligence of plaintiff\u2019s driver sufficient to justify a verdict for the plaintiff, and the verdict should be reinstated. Hergert v. Union Ry. Co., <em>25 </em>App. Div. 218, 49 N. Y. Supp. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">Order reversed and verdict reinstated, with costs to appellant in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
