The action is stated to be one for- conversion, and it is claimed that such conversion occurred in the course of defendants\u2019 employment in a fiduciary capacity, entitling plaintiffs to an order to arrest and a body execution. Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580) \u00a7 56, subd. 2. The judgment entered herein contains the words, \u201cDefendant liable to execution against his person.\u201d Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-21\">Henry Pistor and! Louis Levy, named as defendants in this action, were copartners in the real estate business. Levy only was served, and the judgment runs against him alone. It- appears that during the months of December, 1909, and January, 1910, Levy and his partner were employed to collect the rents of plaintiffs\u2019 property. The greater portion of such rents, according to the evidence, was collected by Pist- or. A small portion was collected by Levy; but the evidence is undisputed that the money which Levy collected he turned over to Pistor to deliver to plaintiffs. Pistor embezzled, not only the amount which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>Levy had turned over to him, but the amount which he himself had collected, and absconded. That the defendant Levy, as a member of the firm, would be liable in an action for money had and received, is unquestioned. McFarland v. Crary, 8 Cow. 253. That action was one in assumpsit, and not in trover, as stated by counsel for respondents in his brief. That an action may be maintained for the conversion of money received in a fiduciary capacity, is also established. Britton v. Ferrin, 171 N. Y. 235, 63 N. E. 954; Jackson v. Moore, 94 App. Div. 504, 87 N. Y. Supp. 1101; People ex rel. Zotti v. Flynn, 135 App. Div. 276, 120 N. Y. Supp. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-3\">The question in this case is whether in such an action an innocent partner is liable for the tortious acts of his copartner, and must go to jail if he is unable to pay the debt. \u201cPartners are liable for the conversion by a copartner of the property of a third person, if done in the ordinary course of the firm\u2019s business. But innocent partners are not liable, when the conversion is not effected in the course of the firm\u2019s business, but as an individual transaction of the wrongdoer.\u201d 30 Cyc. 525; Battle v. Street, 85 Tenn. 282, 287, 2 S. W. 384; Stokes v. Burney, 3 Tex. Civ. App. 219, 221, 22 S. W. 126. The collection of plaintiffs\u2019 rents was within the scope of the partnership business; but the act resulting in the conversion was the individual crime of Pistor, committed without the defendant Levy\u2019s knowledge or consent, and from which he derived no benefit. It is true that, if defendants\u2019 firm had not been employed to collect plaintiffs\u2019 rents, Pistor would not have been in a position to steal them; but \u201ca fraud committed by a partner while acting on his own separate account is not imputable to the firm, although, had he not been connected with the firm, he would not have been in the position to commit the fraud.\u201d Andrews v. De Forest, 22 App. Div. 132, 138, 47 N. Y. Supp. 1011, 1015. If a tort is committed by one partner, even though it was made possible by reason of his connection with the performance of partnership business, it may, from its nature or attendant circumstances, be shown to be only a several act. Parsons on Partnership (4th Ed.) 125. The author well illustrates the distinction when he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-4\">\u201cIf two physicians were in partnership, and one intentionally maltreated a patient,\u201d the other partner would not be liable; but if one was injured by the negligent act of a firm of physicians, in the course of his business, the other member of the firm would be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
