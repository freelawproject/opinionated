No notice of sale was served on the owner. No deed has been given, or can be given, after the expiration of 10 years, and under section 4, tit. 8, Brooklyn Charter (Laws 1888, c. 583, as amended by Laws 1894, c. 580), it was the duty of the registrar of arrears \u201cto cancel on the records in his office all such sales where no deed shall have been delivered within ten years from the date of sale.\u201d Section 6 provides that the registrar of arrears shall deposit the money with the treasurer of the city of Brooklyn, and that the' surplus \u201cshall be held for the use of, and paid over to, the person legally entitled, upon his establishing his rights thereto.\u201d Who is such person in the present case? Certainly not the city. The owner of the land has it, and, as all rights to it pursuant to the tax sale- have ceased by limitation of time, his title and enjoyment is freed from disturbance. The purchaser has assigned the certificates, and, although they had ceased to be liens on the land, they carried to the assignee the purchaser\u2019s rights under the sale. Section 5 provides that, in case of redemption, payment of the sum paid on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the sale, with certain additions, shall be made. This includes the surplus. Such payment must be made to the person entitled, if redemption be not had, to take the land. Such person is the holder of the certificate. Hence the certificate carries the title to the surplus upon failure to .redeem.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">But the defendant urges that the remedy is by action to recover judgment preliminary to mandamus to compel the comptroller to pay,' and that relator has not such status as enables him to_ compel cancellation of the certificates. The intention of the statute is that at the expiration of 10 years the right of the purchaser to take the land or <em>o\u00ed </em>the owner to redeem,it shall expire; that is, that the sale shall be ineffective to convey title, that the surplus shall be returned to the purchaser or his assigns or successors in ownership, and that the record shall show that all rights under the sale are closed. The landowner has an interest in compelling cancellation of the sale, as the record is a cloud on his title to the land, and the purchaser has an interest, as the transaction leaves in apparent doubt his right to the surplus. It is true that after the 10 years the owner cannot redeem, but within that time he is entitled to the surplus, if the purchaser gives notice of the sale and the time to redeem thereupon shall have expired. The purchaser has the right to have the record show that the sale has been canceled, because no deed has been given, and no right to the surplus transferred thereby to the owner of the land. In such way the purchaser\u2019s title to the surplus is evidenced. It is considered that, as regards the cancellation of the certificate, the relator is entitled to remedy by mandamus. But the chamberlain is the custodian of the money,, inasmuch as he is the successor to the treasurer of the county of Kings Greater New York Charter (Laws 1901, c. 466) \u00a7 1587. Section 149 of the Charter requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">\u201cAll payments by or on behalf of the corporation, except as otherwise specially provided, shall be made through the' proper disbursing officer of the department of finance, on vouchers to be filed in said department, by means of warrants drawn on the chamberlain by the comptroller, and countersigned by the mayor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The petitioner is entitled to the money; but, as the mayor has not been made a party, the order must be modified, so as to deny the writ for the payment of the money, and, as so modified, the order is 'affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
