The answer is to the effect that the goods alleged to have been converted were sold for nonpayment of storage charges, after all of the provisions of the statutes relating to the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ject had been complied with. After issue had be\u00e9n joined, upon defendant\u2019s motion, an order was made directing plaintiff to serve upon it a bill of particulars which should set forth the manner in which the plaintiff claimed that the defendant converted the property referred to, and also the theory upon which the plaintiff proposed to establish conversion. In response to this order plaintiff served a bill of particulars, in which the conversion was stated to consist in a sale of the property\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">\u201cin violation of defendant\u2019s agreement with plaintiff not to sell said property, and in violation of the provisions of law pertaining to liens on personal property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">A motion was then made for a further bill of particulars, which should set forth, among other things, the nature and character of the agreement, when and where made, whether oral or in writing, and the name or names of the persons present. The motion was denied, and the appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">I think the motion should have been granted, to the extent of requiring her to give this information. If the plaintiff had an agreement with the defendant that it would not sell the property referred to, then there is no reason why she should not furnish it with the information bearing on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The order appealed from is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, to the extent of requiring the plaintiff to furnish a bill of particulars which shall set forth the facts called for in that part of the notice of motion designated \u201cI.\u201d All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
