The purpose of the action is to set off the amount of these costs, awarded by an order of the Appellate Division, against these judgments, and the order appealed from stays the defendants from collecting these costs during the pendency of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">The facts alleged show that defendant Max Brown is insolvent and unable to pay the judgments, and, if the defendants are permitted to collect the costs which have been awarded against the plaintiff, the latter will be deprived of all the benefit; of its judgment, while compelled to pay costs to the defendant Max Brown. We think the learned court at Special Term had the power to grant the stay in this action, and that the order appealed from should be affirmed. If the defendants succeed in th'e action, no substantial right will be interfered with; if they do not, the plaintiff is entitled to some measure of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">THOMAS and RICH, JJ., concur. BURR, J., concurs in result. CARR, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
