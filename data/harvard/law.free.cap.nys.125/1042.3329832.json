The complaint is wholly on information and belief, and verified by one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. The paper purporting to be an affidavit of plaintiff is a nullity. Not only is there no venue stated, but it appears to have been made out of the state, and the necessary certificate of competency of the officer taking it is not attached. Turtle v. Turtle, 31 App. Div. 49, <em>52 </em>N. Y. Supp. 857. It appears to have been verified before a person describing himself as \u201cClerk Circuit Court.\u201d We are not aware of any officer in the st\u00e1te bearing that title. The undertaking was also irregular in form, but, if that had been .the only defect, it could have been remedied by the giving of a new undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-15\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, without prejudice to its renewal upon proper papers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
