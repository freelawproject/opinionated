The plaintiff furnished some patent valves on the risers of a steam-heating plant in the property of the defendants. As to this there is no dispute. The plaintiff furnished these goods on an order of the architect employed by the defendants, and their reasonable value was $50, according to the proof. The defendants claim that, while they directed the architect to order the installation of these goods, they thought this work was covered by another contract between them and the plaintiff for the installation of a general steam heating plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">The undisputed proof is that no provision was made for the installation of these valves in the original contract between the plaintiff and the defendants. Therefore the work, if ordered by the defendants, was extra work unquestionably. At the trial the defendants gave evidence tending to show that they had reguested their architect to make provision for these valves in the original contract; but, as no such provision was made in the original contract, the defendants cannot defeat the right of the plaintiff to recover for work and materials furnished by their order, simply because their architect had omitted to follow out their wishes in the preparation of his plans and specifications for work to be done under the original contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">The judgment of the Municipal Court should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
