The names of defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s charged with and exercising superintendence referred to in paragraph second of the complaint; also a statement showing what acts of superintendence resulted in the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-19\">Thereafter a verified bill of particulars was served; but no attempt was made to comply with the requirement of paragraph fifth of the order above set forth. Thereafter a notice of motion for a verified further bill of particulars in regard to the said matters was made. In answer thereto, the attorney for the plaintiff submitted his own. affidavit, in which he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-20\">\u201cThe bill of particulars as served to the defendant gives all the information which the plaintiff is able to give so far as I know. It fully apprises the defendant of the claim of neglect made, and the plaintiff can give no further information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-21\">Thereupon an order denying the motion was made, and the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The order requiring the particular information referred to remaining unmodified, unreversed, and unappealed from, has not been complied with. The affidavit of the attorney furnishes no excuse for the-plaintiff\u2019s noncompliance with said order.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
