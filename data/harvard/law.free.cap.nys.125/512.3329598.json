Upon the trial the defendant called a fellow employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff as a witness, and endeavored by the testimony of that witness to prove admissions made by the plaintiff contrary to his testimony. Upon objection being made, the court excluded the evidence upon the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony could not be contradicted, because no foundation had been laid for the contradiction by calling the attention of the plaintiff to the time and place of the alleged admissions. The exclusion of the testimony was error prejudicial to the defendant. The rule of evidence applied by the learned court below has no application, where the admission sought to be proved is that' of a party to the action. Blossom v. Barrett, 37 N. Y. 434, 438, 97 Am.
