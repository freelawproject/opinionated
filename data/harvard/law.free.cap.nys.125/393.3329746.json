In our opinion the affidavits do not establish his nonresidence. At most they indicate that he has declared his intention to cease his residence here. The defendant, when the attachment was issued, was actually domiciled in this state, had desk room in an office here, and maintained a bank account and rented a safe deposit vault in this city, and, in so far as he transacted any business, did so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
