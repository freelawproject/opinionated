The tenant filed a verified answer to the petition setting up a general denial and three separate and distinct defenses. Upon the trial day the tenant made an application for an adjournment which was denied, and the trial judge thereupon, without hearing any testimony, gave judgment for the landlord. The court had no power to give judgment without some evidence in support of the allegations in the petition each and every allegation of which was put in issue by the tenant\u2019s answer, and the final order should therefore be reversed.
