Wolfsohn, may be treated as an affidavit. The difficulty is, however, that the complaint states no cause of action, or, if one can be spelled out, no facts are stated upon which an estimate can be made of plaintiff\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-21\">From some portions of the complaint it would appear that plaintiff sues for a breach of warranty, but the damages in that case would be the difference between the value of the article as warranted and the actual value of the goods as delivered (Isaacs v. Wanamaker, 189 N. Y. 122, 81 N. E. 763), and the latter is not stated. There are also allegations suggesting that plaintiff may have a caus\u00e9 of action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>conversion, but here again no value is stated of the converted articles. It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10' costs and disbursements and the motion granted with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
