We said in Brick v. Shaff, 128 App. Div. 264, 112 N. Y. Supp. 642:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-18\">\u201cWe have uniformly refused an examination before complaint merely to enable the plaintiff to allege the exact amount due him, and we see no reason for departing from the rule in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs.
