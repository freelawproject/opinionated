The defense is that the omnibus did not comply with the warranty upon which it was sold, and that defendant consequently refused to accept it. Each party names about a dozen witnesses who are alleged to be necessary and material. All of them appear to be in the employ of one or the other of the parties. The contract was made in Olean, Cattaraugus county; the omnibus was tested there; and it still remains there. In so far as concerns the inconvenience of procuring witnesses to attend upon the trial, the parties stand upon a substantially equal footing. Where-ever the cause is tried, one of the parties must be put to inconvenience and expense. Under such circumstances it is the general rule that the place where contract was made, and where the subject-matter of the action is to be found, will determine the place of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to change the place of trial granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
