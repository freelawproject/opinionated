It appears that the parties were married in January, 1899, and resided together until 1910, when this action was commenced. The defendant at the time of his marriage was physically incapable of meeting the obligations of the marriage, and it has never been consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-15\">We are entirely satisfied from the evidence that a fraud was perpetrated by the defendant, and that the facts warrant the interference of a court of equity. The action was not commenced within the time provided by section 1752 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the learned justice at Special Term decided that the cause- of action was barred by the statute. The statute was not pleaded, and we know of no rule which requires the court to deny to a party that which would otherwise be a legal right, because of the statute of limitations, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>it is pleaded as a defense. See section 413, Code Civ. Proc.; Kaiser v. Kaiser, 16 Hun, 602; 8 Abb. N. C. 187, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\">The judgment must be reversed, and the proceeding remitted to the Special Term, for further consideration. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
