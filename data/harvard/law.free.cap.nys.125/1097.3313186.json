The complaint does not allege that Gottlieb was a depositor with defendant, or that defendant held any funds of his, or that the check was paid out of any funds belonging to Gottlieb. Hence no cause of action was stated against the defendant. A motion to dismiss the complaint on this ground was duly made at the opening of, the trial and denied, whereupon the defendant excepted. The denial of this motion was error which was not cured by Gottlieb\u2019s testimony that he was a depositor, because that evidence was received under objection and exception, and no attempt had been made to amend the complaint. The reception of this evidence also constituted error. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>errors referred to are fundamental, it is unnecessary to consider any of the other questions discussed upon the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-3\">The judgment and order appealed from are reversed, and a n\u00e9w trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
