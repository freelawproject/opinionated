This section provides: \u201cPrincipals, branch principals,</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-9\">heads of departments, teachers, assistants and all other members of the teaching staff, shall be appointed by the board of education on the nomination of the board of superintendents. Such nominations and appointments shall be made except in the case of high schools or training schools for teachers, for the several local school board districts respectively, and when so made the principals, branch principals, heads of departments, teachers, assistants and all other members of the teaching staff shall be assigned to duty to such schools and to such positions in such schools as the board of superintendents shall determine. Where practicable, teachers shall be appointed for districts in the boroughs where they reside. Teachers and principals may be promoted or transferred from one school to any other school within the city by the board of superintendents, subject to the approval of the board of education: Provided, however, that a teacher shall not be transferred from a school in one borough to a school in another borough within his or her consent.\u201d Daws 1901, c. 466.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-10\">As I read this provision, particularly the last sentence, a clear distinction is made between principals and teachers with respect to transfers. \u201cTeachers and principals\u201d may be transferred, \u201cprovided that a teacher shall not be transferred * * * without his or her consent.\u201d The association of words importing the distinction is too close to justify the interpretation, sought by the relator, that the term \u201cteacher\u201d was used genetically to include principal. Elsewhere, in section 1091, the teachers and principals are referred to, for other purposes, as \u201csuch teacher,\u201d the context indicating that the word \u201cteacher\u201d was employed to cover both classes; but in the particular provision now considered in plain phrasing of the law excludes principals from the benefit of choice given to teachers in the matter of the place where services .are to be rendered. Any doubt upon the subject would seem to be resolved by the further provision of section 1090, that \u201cfor all purposes affecting * * * the transfer of the teachers to any school\u201d the principal of the school to which it is proposed to transfer a teacher shall have a seat in the board of superintendents. The word \u201cteacher,\" as thus used, illustrates the actual distinction intended between teachers and principals with respect to their assignment to \u2022other schools.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-11\">Motion for writ of mandamus denied.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AEb\">Arnon Li Squiers, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-13\">T.
