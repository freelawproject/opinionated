Const. art. 6; Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 340, subd. 3; Gilbert v. York, 111 N. Y. 544, 19 N. E. 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">The complaint alleges that \u201cthe defendants \u00e1re residents of the county of Kings.\u201d Criticism is made upon its sufficiency, because it does not contain the additional words, which appear in the statute (Code of Civil Procedure, supra), \u201cat the time of the commencement of the action.\u201d An action is commenced by the service of a summons, or the voluntary general appearance of the defendant therein. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 416, 424. For certain other purposes, not neces,sary here to consider, it may be deemed to be commenced even before .either act. If, as is usually the case, a complaint is verified before the actual service of the summons, or the appearance of the defendant, it would be impossible strictly and literally t\u00f3 comply with the Code provision, since it would involve a statement respecting a future condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">But allegations of time in a complaint are presumed to refer to the conditions existing when the action was begun, unless controlled by other allegations showing that a different date was intended. Barker v. Cunard Steamship Co., 91 Hun, 495, 36 N. Y. Supp. 256, afirmed 157 N. Y. 693, 51 N. E. 1089. When, subsequently to the service of the summons, an amended \"complaint was served, which contained an allegation that the defendant <em>is </em>a resident, of the city of Yonkers, it was held that it was equivalent to an allegation that at .the time of the commencement of the action he was such resident. Simmons <em>Co. </em>v. Costello, 63 App. Div. 428, 71 N. Y. Supp. 577. Ex necessitate an allegation in a complaint, verified before the service of the summons, that the defendants <em>are </em>residents of the county of Kings, must be equivalent to an allegation that at the time of the commencement of the action they are such residents. Burns v. O\u2019Neil, 10 Hun, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Further criticism is made upon the complaint because in the prayer plaintiff demands judgment against \u201ceach\u201d and \u201cboth\u201d of the defendants for the sum of $2,000. Defendant contends that this is equivalent to demanding judgment for three amounts, of $2,000 each, and that for that reason the County Court has no jurisdiction. -A fail-construction of the complaint is that plaintiff seeks to recover but one sum, and that $2,000. If we transpose the words of the prayer, so that it\u00bb reads \u201cthe plaintiff demands judgment for the sum of $2,-000 against each and both of the defendants,\u201d- this is perfectly clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">The order must be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
