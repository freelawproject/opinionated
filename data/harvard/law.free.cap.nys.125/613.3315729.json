Laws, c. 62]). Such designation is in effect expressly prohibitive against.a choice at any other election. People ex rel. Smith v. Schiellein, 95 N. Y. 124. It appears that the biennial town meeting of the town of Pelham occurs in 1911. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Even conceding, then, _for_ argument\u2019s sake, that there will be a vacancy in an office of a justice of the peace in that town on the 31st of December next, which cannot be filled by an election, so that there would be an elected justice of the peace in occupation of that office on the 1st of January next, that condition does not justify an election at any place or time other than that prescribed by existing law. People ex rel. v. Bull, 46 N. Y. 57, 7 Am. Rep. 302; Matter of Schultes, 33 App. Div. 524, 54 N. Y. Supp. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">People ex rel. Howard v. Supervisors, 42 App. Div. 510, 59 N. Y.Supp. 476, affirmed on opinion below 160 N. Y. 687, 55 N. E. 1099. does not control. That case concerned the title to the office of supervisor, after an- election had been held therefor in an even-numbered year. It was decided that an election could be held in such a year to-fill the vacancy in that office, inasmuch as that clause of the Constitution which provided that all elections of city officers, including the office in question, should be held on the first Monday in November in an odd-numbered year, expressly excepted elections to fill vacancies (article 13, \u00a7 3). This clause must be read in connection with article 10, \u00a7 5, of the Constitution, to the effect that no person appointed to fill a vacancy in an elective office \u201cshall hold his office by virtue of such appointment longer than the commencement of the political year next succeeding the .first annual election after the happening of the vacancy.\u201d The provision of the charter of the city of Buffalo which attempted to continue the term of such appointed officer to the end of an odd-numbered year was, under the circumstances then disclosed, in violation of that constitutional provision, and void. But the question of general statutory authority to hold the election in November, 1898, in the absence of this void provision of the charter, was conceded, or, if not, was neither raised nor considered. The case at bar concerns an attempt to elect a constitutional officer at a time other than that prescribed by the Legislature under constitutional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The order is reversed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
