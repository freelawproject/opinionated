After the motion had been made for an additional counsel fee, and the court had announced that the motion would be granted, the plaintiff moved for leave to discontinue, which order was denied!, with leave, however, to the plaintiff to renew said motion after the decision on the appeal from the order granting the additional counsel fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-18\">We think the order appealed from was entirely proper under the circumstances) but, as we have determined the appeal from the order granting the additional counsel fee by a decision handed down herewith (125 N. Y. Supp. 385), we think this motion for leave to discontinue should be disposed of at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">An order may be entered, therefore, reversing the order appealed from, and granting leave to discontinue upon payment of $350 additional counsel fee, heretofore allowed, and taxable costs and disbursements of the action, without costs to either party upon this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
