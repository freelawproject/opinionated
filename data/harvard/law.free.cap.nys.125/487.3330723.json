Upon the face of these papers, it appears, therefore, that the oaths were taken on the day, at any rate, on which the convention first met and was called to order. It also appeared on the minutes that at the second session of the convention, held on the 13th day of October, the nomination was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-18\">We think, in view of these facts, that the court below was justified in accepting the official certificate of the officer before whom the oath was taken as a compliance with the statute. What was said in Matter of Byrne, 128 App. Div. 334, 112 N. Y. Supp. 699, referred solely to a case in which neither temporary nor permanent chairman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>took any oath at all until after the nomination was made and the convention adjourned, and what was said therein must be confined to the facts of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The order appealed from must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
