Two defendants conceived nine grounds of demurrer to the complaint, seven of which are bad. The reference to the earlier un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>probated will is to. account for the presence of certain persons who are alleged to claim interest thereunder, perchance,' and went quite \u25a0 far enough for that purpose. The will is not probated, and Warner is not its .executor, nor has an administrator of Layton Ellis Day been \u25a0appointed. This disposes of the second, fifth, sixth, and seventh grounds of the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\">Torrey as executor, not individually, is made a party. He is a legatee, and should as such be bound by the decree, and the record should be in such technical form as to show it; but there is no occasion, to make him a party as trustee. The will imposes upon him duties as executor, and by virtue of such office he will receive the property and make disposition of it. If Torrey is a trustee, it by legal implication follows from his executorship. There is no occasion to describe him as such in the complaint. Knox v. Metropolitan El. Ry. Co., 58 Hun, 517, 519, 12 N. Y. Supp. 848, affirmed 128 N. Y. 625, 28 N. E. 485. This disposes of the fourth, eighth, and ninth grounds of demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The complaint does not show that \u201call the devisees, legatees, and heirs of the testator and other interested persons\u201d have been made parties. It is quite another thing to state that certain persons made parties \u201care the only persons entitled to any part of the estate,\u201d or that they \u201care all the persons interested in the estate.\u201d \u2019 There might be differing conclusions in that regard. It is convenient to observe the requirements of the statute, and it, should be done. Therefore . the first ground of demurrer is tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The demurrers are sustained upon the first and third grounds only, and the order appealed from should be modified to so state, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs, with leave to serve an amended complaint upon the terms of the order appealed from. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
