It was further alleged, in substance, that this agreement was in all respects consummated to the plaintiffs\u2019 damages in the amount of the money loaned.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The plaintiffs desire to show by the testimony of the defendant Campbell, who was employed by the defendants Mack, who were the brokers who purchased the stock on the sale by the plaintiffs, that the sales of the stock of the defendant company on the New York curb at and about the time in question, by which it was pretended that the price was advanced, were fictitious, manipulated, and \u201cwash\u201d sales, and that the prices were fixed by the defendants Mack, who directed most of the sales and purchases. It is manifest that these facts are material to the plaintiffs\u2019 case. It satisfactorily appears that the defendant Campbell was in a position to have knowledge of the material facts with respect to the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The memorandum of the learned justice at Special Term, filed on granting the motion to vacate the order for the examination, shows that it was vacated on the ground that the witness will be privileged from testifying. It is evident that he may be able to give material testimony which would not be privileged; and, moreover, the right of a party to an order for such an examination should not be denied upon the ground that the testimony sought to be elicited may be privileged, for the privilege, if it exists, is personal to the witness, and may not be claimed by him. Ely v. Perkins, 127 App. Div. 823, 112 N. Y. Supp. 122; Solar Baking Powder Co. v. Royal Baking Powder Co., 128 App. Div. 550, 112 N. Y. Supp. 1013; Meade v. Southern Tier Masonic Relief Association, 119 App. Div. 761, 104 N. Y. Supp. 523; Niehoff v. Star Co., 134 App. Div. 473, 119 N. Y. Supp. 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to vacate the order for the examination denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
