The difficulty with the theory is that the statute does not take the property. It simply gives a discretionary power to the commissioner of docks, with the approval of the commissioners of the sinking fund, to acquire by purchase or condemnation the property located at a given point. It took nothing from the New York Terminal Company. That corporation had just the same property rights on and after the 11th day of May, 1909, that it had before that day. The property was not depreciated because the dock commissioner was authorized to purchase the same in his discretion either at private sale or by condemnation proceedings. In fact, the very act of the Legislature complained of had a tendency to give value to the property at a price which should constitute just compensation, and in the absence of some very special circumstances, showing conclusively that the property had been depreciated, the appellant would have very little standing to raise the question. The property has always been held subject to the power of the state to-take the same under its power of eminent domain, and! its situation is not changed because the Legislature elected in a particular instance to make this power depend upon the discretion of the dock commissioner instead of the municipal legislative body or some other board or officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">It is a well-settled principle of constitutional law that the action of the Legislature is presumed to have been taken in harmony with the Constitution, and it is only when it is made to clearly appear that this presumption is not warranted that the courts interfere. The Legislature of the state has all powers of legislation which have not been taken away, and our attention is not called to any provision which dtenies to the Legislature the power to invest a dock commissioner with the discretionary power to determine whether he will purchase or take by condemnation a particular piece of property, and this is all the legislation here under consideration seeks to do. If it is taken under the power of eminent domain, the Constitution provides that just compensation shall be paid, and the appellant has full opportunity to go into the question of what that compensation is; but it can hope for but small success in questioning the power of the Legislature to enact the statute here under consideration. The act does not take property. It only provides, what is already the law, that the appellant\u2019s property may be taken for public purposes under the power of eminent domain, and merely the method of procedure is changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. THOMAS, RICH, and CARR, JJ., concur. BURR, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
