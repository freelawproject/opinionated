The cause of action stated in the complaint is to recover $156, the agreed price and reasonable value of \u201cwork, labor, and services\u201d performed and \u201cmaterials\u201d furnished to the defendant at his special instance and request \u201cin the month of March, 1906.\u201d The material allegations of the complaint are put in issue by the answer. Plaintiff resides in the county of New York and conducts the business of manufacturing and selling clothing for men.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The issues were brought to trial at Trial Term, Part 2, on the 10th day of December, 1909. After the case was openedl, counsel for plaintiff moved to amend the complaint by changing the allegation of March, 1906, the date when the work, labor, and services were alleged to have been performed and the materials were alleged to have been delivered, to March, 1907. He had given notice to counsel for defendant on the evening before that he would make such motion on the trial. No affidavit was presented or statement made to show why the correct date was not stated in the original complaint, or how the error, if it be an error, occurred, or when it was discovered. This should be required, where objection to the amendment is made; for otherwise carelessness in pleading will be encouraged. Harrington v. Slade, 22 Barb. 161; Jacobs v. Mexican Sugar Refining Co., 115 App. Div. 499, 101 N. Y. Supp. 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Counsel for the plaintiff in making the motion said to the court, \u201cI will show by the testimony that there has been but one transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant, and nothing more,\u201d and stated that he had notified the attorney of record and counsel for defendant that he would \u201cattempt\u201d to amend the complaint \u201cbecause of the typographical error,\u201d and that he had told counsel \u201cat the beginning of the week,\u201d and had written him a letter confirming the conversation. Counsel for the defendant, who practiced in New York county, thereupon stated to the court that he had been retained by the attorney for the defendant, whose affidavit he had; that the parties had had other transactions, and he held receipted bills for transaction in 1906; that in 1907 the defendant did buy some goods, consisting of men\u2019s clothing, of a traveling salesman who represented the plaintiff; that the coats were to be double-breasted; that the coats delivered on the order were single-breasted, and all of the goods were for that reason immediately returned by express; that the goods were soldi by sample in Geneva, where the witnesses to the \u2018sale and to the description of the goods received were; and that, if the action had been brought on the transaction in 1907, the defendant would have pleaded these facts as a defense, and would have moved to change the place of trial, but that on the facts as pleaded a general denial was the only pleading required by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">The court thereupon granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend on payment of $10 costs. Counsel for the defendant stated that his client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>was not prepared to meet the issue presented by the amendment, and that costs of the action to date should be allowed, and he refused to accept the costs awarded by the court, and duly excepted. The court thereupon directed that the bill, affidavits, and letters \u201cfiled on this application to amend\u201d be marked for identification. The bill was for .goods bought by the defendant from \u201cDanzig &amp; Bisenberg, Manufacturers of Clothing,\u201d under date of November 6, 1906. It does not purport to.be receipted, or to relate to a transaction in 1906. The affidavits of the defendant and of his attorney fully sustained all of the statements made by his counsel, excepting that they did not show any transactions between the parties in the year 1906, or receipted bills therefor, and show that, if the plaintiff should be allowed to amend by pleading on the transaction in 1907, it would be necessary for the \u2022defendant to serve an amended answer setting up his defense that the goods were sold by sample, and were rejected and returned, on the ground that they did not correspond therewith. The point is also taken in the affidavit that, should the motion be granted, it be on terms, and \u2022on condition that the case go over the term, in order that the defendant might move to change the place of trial for the convenience of witnesses, which in that event he desired to do, and the names of the witnesses and the materiality of their testimony are set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">One of the letters presented in opposition to the motion was from the defendant to the plaintiff, and stated that the goods received in March, 1907, had been shipped back, on the ground that the coats were to be double-breasted arid those received were single-breasted. The plaintiff was thereupon called and sworn, and he testified that in the month of November, 1906, at the defendant\u2019s store at Geneva, N. Y., he sold the defendant a bill of goods by sample, consisting of four dozen suits, embracing 24 suits of men\u2019s clothing, to' be delivered in the month of March, 1907; that the coats were to be made \u201chalf single and half double.\u201d He gave no testimony with respect to the shipment of the goods, and evidently relied on the admissions contained in the-affidavits with respect thereto. It was not shown that there were no transactions between the parties in the month of March, 1906. \u2022Counsel for the defendant does not appear to have taken part in the trial, but it is not claimed that the judgment was taken by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">We are of opinion that the court erred -in allowing the amendment of the complaint without adequate terms, and without affording the defendant an opportunity to answer it as amended, and to move for \u2022a change of the place of trial of the action. As the issues were framed, the plaintiff could not recover on the sale and delivery of the goods in March, 1907. It is quite evident that the defendant was aware that the action was brought to recover for the goods delivered in March, 1907, and that might be given due weight in prescribing the terms to be imposed on allowing the amendment; but he was not \u25a0obliged to attempt to answer a cause of action different from the one. set forth in the complaint, and a general denial of the material allegations was a sufficient defense to the issue as tendered. The allegations of the complaint are too general to identify the transaction, and \u2022plaintiff might have insisted on going to trial- without amending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>complaint, and might have attempted to establish the cause of action as alleged, by showing the performance of any work of labor or the delivery of any material in March, 1906. The defendant could not affect the rights of the plaintiff by pleading that the cause of action intended to be set forth in the complaint was one concerning the sale and delivery of goods, not. in the month of March, 1906, but in the month of March, 1907, and thereupon proceed! to set up his defense thereto. Nor could the defendant\u2019s right to have the place of trial changed for the convenience of witnesses with respect to a cause of action for goods sold and delivered in March, 1907, be enforced against a complaint for work, labor, and services performed and materials delivered in March, 190G.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-3\">It appears that the question of inadequacy of terms on allowing the amendment was emphasized more on the trial and on the appeal than the inability of the defendant to protect his rights in view of the amendment; but, as has been seen, the defendant promptly rejected the goods, for which a recovery has been had', on the ground that they did not comply with the contract. It is, in view of the affidavits, a reasonable inference that the claim of the defendant that he had just cause for rejecting the goods is made in good faith. He should, therefore, have an opportunity to litigate that question. If it had been shown that the cause of action intended to be set up in the complaint related to the sale and delivery of goods in March 1907, the trial court had authority to allow the amendment; but, where such an error is discovered in time to permit a motion for the relief to be made at Special Term, that is the better practice, and parties should ordinarily be left to that remedy. Rhodes v. Lewin, 33 App. Div. 369, 54 N. Y. Supp. 106; Cauchois v. Proctor, 1 App. Div. 16, 36 N. Y. Supp. 957; Kennedy v. South Shore Natural Gas &amp; Fuel Co., 126 App. Div. 236, 110 N. Y. Supp. 503. No formal order was entered on granting the motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">The appeal from the order should therefore be dismissed, and the judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event, but without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s right to move to amend the complaint. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
