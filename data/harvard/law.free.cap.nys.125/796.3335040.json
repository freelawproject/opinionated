The question involved in ;the appeal arises under a counterclaim interposed by defendants as assignees of the Portsmouth Cotton Oil Refining Company. The allegation of the counterclaim is that plaintiff agreed to have 31 tank cars put in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>condition before the season arrived for shipping the product of the refinery, and that it failed to do so. The allegation in the answer is generally that by reason of such failure defendants suffered damage to the extent of $4,250. By a former order the defendants were required to specify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-5\">\u201cThe various and sundry items, giving them in detail, which enter into and make up the alleged damages of $4,250, as alleged in the second counterclaim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">This order was not appealed from, and the defendant served a bill \u25a0of particulars, in which it undertook to comply with the order by the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">\u201cPaid for use of 10 tank cars, etc., $760.00. Loss occasioned by failure of plaintiff to deliver cars as agreed, thus preventing the operation of the refinery, and the procuring, refining, and delivery of oil, $3,490.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">The purpose of the present motion is to compel the defendant to \u25a0specify in greater detail the particulars of the second item of damage as above stated. In our opinion the defendant had already sufficiently complied with the requirements of the first order. He had divided his \u2022claim into two items, one consisting of the rent of the cars, and the \u25a0other consisting of what is known as general damages resulting from the enforced cessation of the operation of the refinery. It is not usually considered necessary or feasible to require a bill of particulars of such damages. Radcliffe v. N. Y. Cab Company, 134 App. Div. 451, 119 N. Y. Supp. 251; Floersheim v. Musical Courier Co., 103 App. Div. 388, 93 N. Y. Supp. 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">It is contended that it is no longer open to defendant to refuse to \u25a0give the particulars now demanded, because he did not appeal from the first order, and that that order required the specification of particulars now asked for. We do not so understand. The first order required a specification of the items going to make up the claim of $4,250. The defendant gave two items, one of particular damage, and one of general damage. This was an attempt, and, as we think, a successful one, to comply with the order, and left open the question whether or not the item of general damage should be more particularly specified. That \u25a0question had been left untouched by-the first order.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All \u2022concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
