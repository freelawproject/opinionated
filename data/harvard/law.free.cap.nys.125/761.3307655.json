The action is to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien. The answer is th'at the contractor did not perform his contract. The bill of particulars states 37 different items of departure from the contract, and failure to secure the certificate of due performance by the architect. By consent the issues were referred; but, the time of the referee to file his report having expired, pursuant to section 1019 of the x Code of Civil Procedure, the defendants terminated the reference. On March 5, 1910, Mr. Justice Garretson denied a motion to refer again the issues to the same person as referee. The case was restored to the calendar for trial, and on June <em>21, </em>1910,, upon call of the. case, Mr. Justice Marean referred the issues to the same referee, and the order therefor, entered June <em>22d, </em>recites that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201cCounsel for the defendants having answered that he was not ready for the trial, and having stated to the court that this action involved various items in dispute, and that on a previous trial'more than 500 pages of testimony were taken, and that the trial occupied a period of six days of four hours each, and the court, after hearing such statement, ordered that all the issues in the above entitled action be referred:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">On July <em>22, </em>1910, the'court, Mr. Justice Kapper presiding, denied a motion to vacate the order of reference made by Mr. Justice Marean.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Without considering the question whether compulsory reference of the issues could be ordered, it appears that the order of Mr. Justice Garretson was an adjudication of the question, and it was not within the power of the trial judge to order the reference while the earlier order denying it was in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">For this reason, the order of reference should be vacated, with $10 costs and disbursements. The order made by Mr. Justice Kapper should be affirmed, without costs, as the defendants\u2019 relief was by an appeal from the order of reference, and not by motion to vacate it. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
