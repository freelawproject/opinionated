The method he was instructed to follow was to enter a canvas scaffold, 15 to 18 feet long, which had previously been suspended! under the bridge, and which was attached- thereto, and into which the men went over the hand railings, carrying their paint pots with them. The bridge itself was some 12 to 14 feet above the street, and when the canvas was empty its lower surface was some 10 or 11 feet above the street; but, when the men were working within it, it sagged down so that it was perhaps 73/2 to 8% feet, or at the outside 10 feet, above the street. This canvas ran across a part of the highway and a short distance over the sidewalk, and was about 5 or 10 feet south of the- southerly corner of 149th street. While the men were working in this canvas, a loaded lumber truck, coming easterly out of 148th street, turned into and down Third avenue. The stanchion thereof, coming in collision with the canvas, ripped! it open in such a way that the, plaintiff was precipitated to the street and received the injuries whereof he complains. What transpired before this collision is a matter of dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The witness Hehre, who testified that he was employed by the defendant \u201cto watch out for wagons or anything that might come along, to protect the canvas and to keep them away, and tell them to go to the other side of the-street,\u201d further testified that he saw this truck in question coming through the cross-street from west to east, and that as the driver turned his horses south, and swung under the canvas, he (Hehre) grasped hold of the inside horse and shouted to the driver to stop, whereupon the driver said, \u201cThat is all right,\u201d and drove right on, while Hehre pulled the horse\u2019s head around. The witnesses Loughlin and Ostrander testified that they saw Hehre shout to the driver and seize hold of the horse\u2019s head; but the driver went ahead, regardless of the shout or the attempted stopping of the horses. In contradiction to this, the driver of the wagon, produced as a witness for the plaintiff, testified that, although a man did run out in front of the team and wave his hands and shout to him, it took place after he had struck the canvas. He said that he saw the canvas hanging, but thought that he could clear it, and denied that Hehre had ever taken hold of the horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">This action was commenced under the employer\u2019s liability act (Consol. Laws, c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 200-204), but when finally submitted to the jury it was so submitted upon the theory of a common-law liability, due to defendant\u2019s negligence in either (1) not guarding more thoroughly the place where plaintiff worked, or (2) in stationing a person to guard the place who was negligent in the performance of his duty. The question of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was expressly waived.-</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The learned trial court first charged the jury, at the request of the defendant's counsel, that if the watchman was a competent man, and neglected his duty, then plaintiff' could not recover; for'.his act was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the act of a fellow servant,\"for which the defendant would not be liable. This would appear to have reduced the defendant\u2019s liability to the first theory\u2014that it did not provide sufficient guards or watchmen for the canvas. But the court went further.. The jury were instructed that, if they found that the watchman was competent, their verdict should be for the defendant; that, if they found that Hehre was a competent man, then the company was not liable ; but they were to judge whether he was competent, or not, on all the circumstances in the case, taking into consideration, if they arrived at that question, \u201cthat he did not watch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Thereupon defendant requested a charge that there was no evidence in the case that Hehre was not a competent man. This request was refused, and we think improperly, for there was absolutely no proof in the case of any incompetency on the part of Hehre, claimed or shown, save upon the occasion in question; and not only did the court charge without objection that Hehre\u2019s own negligence upon the occasion in question would have prevented a recovery by plaintiff, but it is well established that a single act of casual negligence does not per se tend to prove a party to be careless and imprudent, and unfitted for a position requiring care and prudence. Baulec v. New York &amp; Harlem R. R. Company, 59 N. Y. 356, 17 Am. Rep. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Nor was there evidence in the case of any specific acts of incompetency upon the part of the watchman, which the master knew or ought to have known. Park v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R., 155 N. Y. 215, 49 N. E. 674, 63 Am. St. Rep. 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In conclusion, the jury were charged that, even if they found that the watchman did not discharge his duty of watching, there still would be left for their consideration the question of whether or not, on all the facts, the placing of this canvas, with only one man to guard it, was a sufficient discharge of defendant\u2019s duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The watchman was placed there to guard against the possibility of just such an event as took place. He was looking for vehicles coming south, to divert them to the other side of the street. He did see this truck coming south, and by a preponderance of evidence it is fairly established \u25a0 that he not only shouted out to the driver, but took hold of one of the horses, in an attempt to stop their progress. The driver admits that he saw the canvas, but thought that he could clear it.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">If Hehre, the watchman, did not do as he says he did, that is, shout out and endeavor to stop the progress of the horses, but did as the driver claims, that is, shouted out after the accident only, then the negligence was that of Hehre, and under the law of this case the defendant is not liable. If, on the other hand, Hehre\u2019s corroborated testimony is accepted as true, then he had done all that a prudent and reasonable man could have done to prevent the accident, which would then have been due to the recklessness or .mismanagement of the driver of the truck, and the absence of more watchmen in no way caused or contributed to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
