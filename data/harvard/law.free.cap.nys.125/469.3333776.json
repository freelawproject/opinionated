It seems to show that defendants once sold goods to plaintiff during a number of years; that plaintiff claims to have returned some of these goods to defendants, and now seeks to hold them in respect of the goods returned as for \u201cgoods sold and delivered.\u201d There is some evidence that a- man by the name of Safir had some conversation with one of the defendants about returning goods, and that this particular defendant said he might do so. Safir\u2019s authority to act for the plaintiff is probably intended to be indicated by the statement that he was one of the managers of her store. But, apart from the vagueness of this supposed arrangement, there was no consideration for defendants\u2019 promise. It is not just to predicate a - recovery upon,\" or to assume that a cause of action can be proved by, evidence of the uncertain and unintelligible character disclosed in this record. Alpern v.
