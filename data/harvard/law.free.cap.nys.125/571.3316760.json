As a corollary to this finding he has found that the state, for purposes of advantage to the use of the stream by the public, may change the course thereof without payment of damages, or liability therefor to owners of land adjacent to the river. But it seems that the statute by which the change-of the river\u2019s channel was authorized, and under which these defendants were appointed and act as commissioners in fulfilling the purposes-of the statute, giv\u00e9s to the owners of lands adjacent to the river as it flowed in the old channel a right to damages for diversion of the-waters of the stream, which they did not have at common law. Section 5 of'this statute (chapter 93, Laws 1891) among other things provides in effect that the commissioners are authorized in behalf of the people of the state of New York to agree with the riparian owners, or the owners of lands adjacent to the old river channel, as to the damages occasioned to such owners by the change of the channel, and in case of disagreement as to the amount of damages the commissioners shall acquire the title, rights, or interests of such owners by condemnation proceedings. It would seem to be clear that in this provision of the statute there is a recognition that owners of land adjacent to the old channel had an easement appurtenant to their land, which, if taken or interfered with by changing the river channel, would entitle the owners to compensation therefor in the manner provided by the statute. This right to compensation is again indirectly recognized in an amendment to the act above cited (chapter 131 of the Laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>1907), which authorized the city of Utica to borrow money for the purpose, among other things, of \u201cthe payment of damages to riparian owners upon the old channel of said river for diverting the waters thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\">The case here presented is one where the work is authorized by the statute to be done, and the right to prosecute and complete the work is not made to depend upon the satisfaction of the right of riparian \u25a0owners to damages, if any they have. Plaintiffs\u2019 right to damages being dependent upon the statute alone, they are limited in enforcing that right to the procedure provided by the statute. The statutory remedy is exclusive, and must be followed -by those seeking relief under its provisions. Matter of Melenbacker v. Village of Salamanca, 188 N. Y. 370, 377, 80 N. E. 1090; Smith v. Boston &amp; Albany R. R. Co., 181 N. Y. 132, 73 N. E. 679. For that reason, if for no other, this action to restrain the commissioners from completing the contemplated improvement will not lie. If plaintiffs have rights as owners of lands adjacent to the old river channel, and the commissioners refuse to take proceedings to condemn those rights, then performance of their statutory duty may be compelled in a proper proceeding for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">In any event this action ought not to be maintained, even if plaintiffs\u2019 right to relief therein were to be based solely upon a discretionary exercise of the court\u2019s equitable powers in refusing the injunction. This great public work should not be held up simply because plaintiffs\u2019 damages have not been paid or adjusted. Besides, plaintiffs\u2019 business in which the river waters were used, and upon deprivation of which the chief claim for damages is predicated, was conducted in violation of a city ordinance, and was itself a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
