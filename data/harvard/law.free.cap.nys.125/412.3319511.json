The defendants appeared in the action by separate attorneys, and their good faith in-so doing is not questioned. When the action first came to trial, the plaintiff's motion to withdraw a juror and to amend his complaint was-granted, upon the payment of costs only to the defendant Lordi. Subsequently the plaintiff again asked leave to amend his complaint. This-motion was granted upon the payment of costs to the defendant Cantelmo. The defendant Lordi1 now appeals from so much of the order as fails to make an award of costs to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-18\">The amended complaint made it necessary for both of the defendants to plead \u00bfnew and to prepare for- trial, so as to meet the issue ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>dered by the amended complaint, and should only have been granted upon costs being awarded to both of the defendants. Rowe v. Granger, 118 App. Div. 459, 103 N. Y. Supp. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The order is modified, by awarding a separate bill of costs to each defendant, and, as modified, is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
