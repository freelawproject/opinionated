The delivery of the goods was admitted!. The defense was that the sale in question was not a completed transaction, but simply part of a contract under which the plaintiff undertook to</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-19\">deliver five lots of anchors of varying sizes, and that he failed to per-</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-20\">form the whole contract, which is claimed to be in its nature entire and not divisible. The plaintiff received from the defendant a written order, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-21\">Please enter our order for the following goods to be shipped to our New York address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-22\">Galv. Kedge Anchors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABVx\">25 of 35 lbs. each. 20 of 45 lbs. each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjFB\">8 \u201c 50 \u201c \u201c 15 \u201c 65 \u201c \u201c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEOg\">5 \u201c 90 \u201c \u201c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADq\">All as per specifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACXY\">Wanted in two weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJmb\">All conditions must be complied with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXt\">Deliver no goods without order.

From the judgment of dismissal, the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>Under the well-settled law applicable to these circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled to every fair intendment which may arise from his proofs. The plaintiff gave proof that he delivered to the defendant all the goods contracted for, though he sued but for a part. Assuming the contract in question to be entire, and not divisible, he gave evidence of full performance. It appeared that some of the articles were returned! to him by the defendant on the claim that their customer, the United States Naval Department, would not accept them. There was no proof, however, that the articles so returned were not in accordance with the specifications. Nor was there any proof that there was any agreement that the articles were to be delivered subject to the approval of the Naval Department. There is nothing in the written \u2022order to that effect, and no testimony bearing on it. Therefore, as the case stood, whether the contract was entire or divisible, there was proof of an apparent performance by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. The dismissal of the complaint was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">The judgment of the Municipal Court should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abidle the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">BURR, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
