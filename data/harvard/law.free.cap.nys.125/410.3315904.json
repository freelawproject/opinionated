The answer further alleged that said mortgage was not consented to by vote at a special or other meeting of the stockholders of the defendant corporation; that no certificate had been delivered or made under the seal of the defendant, or subscribed or acknowledged by its officers, that such consent was given; and that no such certificate had ever been filed or recorded. It further alleged that such mortgage was executed without the consent, in writing or otherwise, of not less than two-thirds of the stockholders of the defendant; that no such consent was given; that the execution or delivery .thereof was not authorized, sanctioned, or consented to by vote at any meeting of the stockholders; that no certificate under seal of such \u2022consent was ever executed; and that no such consent or certificate was ever filed. There was a further allegation that the said paper purporting to be a chattel mortgage was and is unlawful, illegal and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">It is not disputed that the facts set forth in the separate defense, if proved, would render the mortgage invalid. Stock Corporation Law (Consol. Laws, c. 59) \u00a7 6. In order to take advantage of the invalidity of a mortgage executed without the statute requirements having been observed, it is not necessary that the objection should be raised by a stockholder or creditor; but the defense is available to the cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>poration itself. Lord, Jr., as Trustee, et al. v. Yonkers Fuel &amp; Gas Co. et al., 99 N. Y. 547, <em>2 </em>N. E. 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">It was furthermore claimed that the defendant corporation could-not set up this defense, because no man can take advantage of his own. wrong, and because defendant did not offer to return what it had received from the mortgagee upon the making of the mortgage. This-seems to proceed upon the theory of an application of some equitable-principle to the case at bar, which has absolutely no relevancy, either to the cause of action sued upon or to the defense pleaded. It does not even appear, by any averment, that the defendant, the Coleman Stable Company, received any money whatever when the mortgage in question was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and' disbursements to the appellant, and the motion for judgment, sustaining the demurrer to the separate defense, denied, with $10 costs.. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
