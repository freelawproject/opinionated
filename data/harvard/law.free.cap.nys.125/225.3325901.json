The motion was granted, and an order made directing Bernstein to appear for examination \u201cconcerning the matters set forth in the annexed affidavit and generally with reference to the pleadings herein.\u201d The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">I think the motion to vacate should have been granted. How Bernstein\u2019s testimony can be material and necessary to the defendants is not in any way disclosed. There is apparently no purpose for which defendants could use his testimony, unless it be to show that the plaintiff cannot establish a cause of action; and this is not a legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ground for ordering an examination of this character. Rogers v. Adler, 137 App. Div. 197, 121 N. Y. Supp. 941. He is not the plaintiff in this action, and is not a party to it. In order to be permitted to examine before trial a person not a party to the action, it must be made to appear that the person sought to be examined is \u201cabout to depart \"from the state, or that he is so sick and infirm as to afford reasonable ground! to believe that he will not be able to attend the trial, or that any other special circumstances exist which render it proper that he should be examined. * * * \u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 872, subd. 5. Here no attempt was made to show that Bernstein was sick or infirm, or about to leave the state, and the only special circumstances which could possibly justify an order for his examination is the fact that he is the plaintiff\u2019s assignor. While this may, perhaps, be properly considered in determining whether such an order shall be made, it is not enough in and of itself to warrant the order. Something more must be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">Nothing else was shown in the present case, and for that reason the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
