The injury occurred by reason of the boy colliding with one of defendant\u2019s trucks at the corner of Seventh avenue and Thirteenth street. The plaintiff\u2019s son, who was 13 years of age, was practicing for a running race to be held by the boys of the public schools of New York City. The boy commenced running at the corner of Fourteenth street and Seventh avenue, while another boy timed him with a stop-watch. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s son ran as fast as tie could toward Thirteenth street, at which point he left the sidewalk and collided with the defendant\u2019s truck. There is no evidence in the case to show that the driver of the truck was negligent in any way, or that the plaintiff\u2019s son exercised any care with regard! to his own safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Judgment' reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
