The defendant is her son-in-law. According to the plaintiff\u2019s proofs, she loaned the articles to her daughter, the defendant\u2019s wife. The daughter died, and the defendant assumed dominion over the articles, and refused to restore them to the plaintiff. On the trial, the complaint was dismissed on the theory that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was in the Surrogate\u2019s Court against the defendant as administrator of the deceased daughter\u2019s chattels. When the motion to dismiss was granted, there was no proof whatever that the defendant was the administrator of his wife\u2019s estate, or that he held the property in question under claim of such authority. It was error, therefore, to grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">If, however, there had been such proof, it would have been error to dismiss on the theory presented. The Municipal Court has jurisdiction of an action against \u201can administrator or executor as such, where the amount claimed does not exceed five hundred dollars, exclusive of interest and costs.\u201d Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580) \u00a7 1, subd. 18. It is true that this action was not brought against the defendant, as administrator, \u201cas such,\u201d as provided in the statute, but' against him individually, for an act which he may have done in a furtherance of his duties as administrator, if such he was. This act, however, was a personal act, and not representative. The unlawful detaining of the personal property was done, not by the decedent, but by the defendant himself. The act of the defendant created a cause of action, not against the estate of the decedent, but against himself individually. Under these circumstances, he was sued properly in his individual capacity. Matter of Van Slooten v. Dodge, 145 N. Y. 327, 39 N. E. 950; Anderson v. Thomson, 38 Hun, 394; 18 Cyc. 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The judgment of the Municipal Court should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
