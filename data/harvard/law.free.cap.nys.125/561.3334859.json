On his motion an order was subsequently made discontinuing the payment of such alimony. This last-mentioned order, on appeal to this court, was reversed, and the motion denied. Thereupon, after service of proper papers and a demand of the defendant for the unpaid alimony, amounting to $64, which was refused, a motion was made by plaintiff to punish the defendant for contempt in not complying with the order requiring the payment of such alimony. This \"motion was denied, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-20\">The motion should have been granted. No opposing affidavits were presented in the court below. There is no question of fact. This court may make the determination which should have been made at Special Term. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs; and a determination is hereby made that the defendant has committed the offense charged, and that it was calculated to and actually did defeat, impair, impede, and prejudice the rights of the plaintiff, and that for such misconduct the defendant pay a fine of $64, and in addition thereto the said costs and disbursements, and that he be imprisoned \"until such fine is paid. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
