There are three possible causes of action, each distinct from the others. Plaintiff relies upon Acardo v. New York Contracting &amp; Trucking Co., 116 App. Div. 793, 102 N. Y. Supp. 7, which does not necessarily aid him, while Uss v. Crane Co., 138 App. Div. 256, 123 N. Y. Supp. 94, and Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 178 N. Y. 147, 70 N. E. 411, support the defendant. The complaint furnishes a statement which permits the plaintiff to invoke either the common law, the federal statute, or the statute of New Jersey, which is set out. If the plaintiff may rely upon one or all of these causes of action at the time of trial, I think he should so state, to enable defendant to know what he may meet. These causes of action are entirely distinct, and there is no reason \u25a0 whatever for allowing the plaintiff to conceal his claim until the trial is under way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">I think the order should be modified, by directing the plaintiff to separate and number the causes of action, if he intends to set forth a cause of action other than under the common law, and, as so modified, the order should be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
