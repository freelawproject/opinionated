Certificates of such nomination were filed in the office of the board of elections of the city of New York and in the office of the county clerk of Rockland county. The board of elections of the city of New York refused to direct the printing of his name on the official ballot to be used at the coming election in Richmond county, which is within the city of New York. On the application of the relator, an order has been entered at Special Term directing the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus, directing the board of elections to print Shake\u2019s name on the official ballot. From this order, this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">The prqvisions of the statutes regulating the filing of certificates of nomination, in cases like this, are to be found in section 127 of the election law (Consol. Laws, c. 17). That section declares the general rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-15\">\u201cCertificates of nomination of candidates for office to be filled by the voters of the entire state, or of any division or district greater than a county, shall be filed with the Secretary of State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>It then provides several exceptions to this general rule, and among said exceptions is one as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cAnd except that certificates of nomination of candidates for offices to be filled only by the voters or a portion of the voters of the city of New York shall be filed with the board of elections of the city of New York.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Then follows this provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">\u201cCertificates of nomination of candidates for offices to be filled only by the votes of voters, part of whom are of New York City and part of whom are of a county not wholly within the city of New York, shall be filed with the clerk of such county and in the office of the board of elections of said city.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Rockland county is not only not \u201cwholly within the city of New York,\u201d but also not partly. It is situated many miles away from the boundaries of the city of New York. 'Ordinarily the words \"not wholly within\u201d refer to a situation where a part is within. \u201cNot wholly\u201d is synonymous with \u201cpartly.\u201d The present act is but a re-enactment of a previous act. Laws 1896, c. 909, as amended. A re-enactment of a previous statute is, both by the settled law of adjudged cases as well as by the provisions of General Construction Law (Consol Laws, c. <em>22) </em>\u00a7 95, deemed not a new law, but the continuation of the former law. In determining its meaning, it must be found out what was intended by the prior enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">As the election law was enacted originally, it did not contain the provision here in question. It was introduced first by an amendment made by chapter 379 of the Laws of 1897. This amendment was designed to meet a situation created by chapter 378 of the Laws of 1897, the \u201cGreater New York Charter.\u201d This last-mentioned act extended the boundaries of the city of New York so that said city embraced three entire counties and a large part of a fourth, viz., Queens County. Therefore by the amendment of the election law in 1897 provision was made to meet the situation, where there would be a county largely, but not \u201cwholly,\u201d within the city of New York. Subsequently, by chapter 588 of the Laws of 1898, that portion of Queens county which lay outside the boundaries of the city of New York was erected into the new county of Nassau. Then and thereafter there was no county partly in the city' of New York and partly outside, and the provision made by the amendment of 1897 became inoperative. No new force was given to this provision by the re-enactment in the Consolidated Laws, for the obvious reason that the situation to which it was intended originally to apply no longer exists. Therefore neither verbally nor in original intent does the statute in question authorize the filing of this certificate in any office but that of the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">If the court had a dispensing power, it might or might not exercise it in favor of the relator. But it has no dispensing power. The candidates for the same office of both the Republican and Democratic parties seem not to have been misled, for no questsion' arises as to the filing of their certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">The order granting the writ of peremptory mandamus is reversed, without costs, and the motion for the writ is denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
