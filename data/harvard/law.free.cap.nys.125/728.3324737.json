The referee found that the West Shore Railroad, of which the relator is the lessee, crosses the Erie Canal lands at other than right angles for a distance of 242.79 feet, and, continuing in the same direction, crosses a highway adjoining and parallel to the canal, for a distance of 62.64 feet; that the tracks were carried over the canal land by a lattice truss pin-connected bridge, the westerly end of which rests upon a pier built partly on the canal lands and partly within the bounds of the highway; that the tracks are carried over the highway by a through plate open-floor bridge, the easterly end of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>rests upon the pier; that the bridges were constructed in 1882 and rebuilt in-1905 ; that they do not lap; and that there is one continuous line of rails, ties, and track superstructure cross the bridge. The referee concluded that it was not lawful to assess as one special franchise the crossing of the canal lands and the crossing \u00f3f the adjoining highway, and that the assessment should be vacated. The referee also found that the assessments, general, in the town of Minden, were 80 per centum of full value, while the assessment by the State Board of Tax Commissioners was made at full value. When the matter came on for hearing at Special Term, the court adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of the referee and made the order appealed from.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b763-5\">Argued before SMITH, P.

Laws 1896, c. 908, \u00a7 2, subd. 4, as amended by Laws 1901, c. 490, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">\u201cThe terms special franchise shall not be deemed to include the crossing of a street, highway or public place, where such crossing is not at the intersection of another street or highway, unless such crossing shall be at other than-right angles for a distance of not less than two hundred and fifty feet in which case the whole of such crossing shall be deemed a special franchise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">In the endeavor to ascertain the intention of the Legislature, with respect to whether the term \u201cspecial franchise\u201d shall be deemed to include the right to construct, maintain; or operate a railroad on, across, or above two or more adjoining highways or public places at other than right angles for a distance of <em>250 </em>feet, we need to go further than the statute itself. There was a provision in the statutory construction law (Laws 1892, c. 677, \u00a7 8) which is now incorporated in the general construction law (Laws 1909, c. 27, \u00a7 35 [Consol. Laws, c. 22]) that has a direct bearing upon this question. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-12\">\u201cWords in the singular number include the plural and in the plural number include the singular.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">If this rule is applied to this case, and the words \u201chighways\u201d and \"public places\u201d are read into and made a part of the statute in question, it is plain that the term \u201cspecial franchise\u201d must be deemed to include the crossing of any number of streets, highways, or public places adjoining each other, where the crossing is at other than right angles-for a distance not less than 250 feet. There can be no manner of doubt that this rule of statutory construction' applies to the statute under consideration. Section 1 of the statutory construction law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>provides that it \u201cis applicable to every statute, unless its general object, or the context of the language construed, or other provisions of law indicate that a different meaning or application was intended from that required to be given by this chapter.\u201d No light is thrown on the question of the intent of the Legislature by the amendment of 1908 (chapter 295). The evident purpose of that amendment was to include for assessment as special franchises all crossings irrespective of distance and connections, within the boundaries of cities and villages, and to prevent the elimination of a crossing less the 250 feet which was the continuation of an occupancy of another street, highway, or public place.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">It may also be observed, in answer to the contention of the respond- \u2022 ent, that the right of the relator to construct and operate its\" railroad across or above the highway was received from the \u201chighway authorities\u201d ; that there is no power in a town, village, or city to grant such a franchise. \u201cThat proposition was laid down in the case of Milhau v. Sharp, 27 N. Y. 611 [84 Am. Dec. 314], and it has ever since been recognized as the law of the State.\u201d Beekman v. Third Avenue R. R. Co., 13 App. Div. 279, 43 N. Y. Supp. 174. It was necessary \u2022 for the relator to obtain an order of the Supreme Court, before it could exercise the' right, but that conferred no franchise. That was only a condition prescribed by the Legislature that had to be complied with before the company could proceed to construct or operate its road. This franchise was granted by the people of the state and became perfect and complete the moment the corporation came into existence. Matter of Thirty-Fourth Street R. R. Co., 102 N. Y. 343, 7 N. E. 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Our conclusion, therefore, is that the order appealed from should be reversed, and the assessment made by the State Board of Tax Commissioners modified by deducting 20 per cent, from the valuation of the special franchise to equalize the assessment with the assessment of the other real property in the town, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $50 costs and disbursements. All concur; COCHRANE, J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
