The important ones are that defendant\u2019s foreman hired plaintiff and put him to work upon a building on East Fourth street, in the borough of Brooklyn, and that while so engaged, through various specified acts-of negligence on the part of the defendant, he was injured. The physical cause of the injury is not stated, nor the nature of such injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-17\">The remedy for these omissions is a motion to make the complaint more definite and certain, not a demurrer. Counsel upon both sides have expended much energy in discussing the question whether an. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>agent of an undisclosed principal is liable for the latter\u2019s tortious acts resulting in injury. The question is not raised by the demurrer in this case, for the reason that the only negligence alleged in the complaint is the personal negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The interlocutory judgment overruling the demurrer should be affirmed, with costs, with leave to the defendant, within 30 days after the entry of the order upon this decision, to withdraw his demurrer and answer, upon payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
