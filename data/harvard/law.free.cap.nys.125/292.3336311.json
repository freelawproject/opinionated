So that, notwithstanding these irregularities, and although the official minutes do not show that the statutory requirements were performed, if as matter of fact it appears by competent evidence that they were performed, that there was an actual convention composed of a quorum or majority of the delegates duly elected, and that the convention actually met and made a nomination, then the nomination can be \u2019received. And so in all these objections raised here, as we understand, the court has found, that the preliminaries required by the statute were actually carried out, and that the statute was actually complied with; and so far as we can see there was evidence to sustain that determination of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">Under these circumstances, the board of elections was justified in overruling the protest; and the court below was right in refusing to overrule the action of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">This results in an affirmance of the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
