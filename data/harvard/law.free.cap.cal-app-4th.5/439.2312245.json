We conclude that under <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1063 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 160, 820 P.2d 262] the officer was section 872, subdivision (b) qualified but the multiple hearsay statements he testified to were inadmissible. Accordingly, we affirm the order (\u00a7 995) setting aside the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The district attorney charged respondent with committing a July 9, 1990, residential burglary (\u00a7 459; count I), and a contemporaneous grand theft (\u00a7 487, subd. 1; count II). At the October 5, 1990, preliminary hearing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district attorney called a single witness, Detective Osman, a 12-year City of Monterey Park police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Over objection,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Detective Osman testified that the day after the burglary he did \u201ca follow-up investigation,\u201d namely, he talked to the victim, read the crime report, and talked to its author, Officer Yahn. Detective Osman further testified to the victim\u2019s statements, his testimony apparently based upon his conversation with the victim rather than upon Officer Yahn\u2019s report. This part of Detective Osman\u2019s testimony established the corpus of both charged offenses but did not link respondent to either crime. To establish that link the district attorney elicited from Detective Osman the statements of a Mr. Schiro, someone Detective Osman had <em>not </em>spoken to. Mr. Schiro was the manager of the apartment complex in which the victim lived. Mr. Schiro had spoken to Officer Yahn and Officer Yahn included Mr. Schiro\u2019s statements in his crime report.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Detective Osman testified<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that <em>\u201caccording to Officer Yahn, </em>Mr. Schiro stated,\u201d in substance, that on the day of the burglary respondent asked to be let into the victim\u2019s apartment and that he, Mr. Schiro, unlocked the door for respondent because respondent was the victim\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The magistrate held respondent to answer on both counts. In superior court, respondent\u2019s section 995 motion to set aside the information was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In reviewing the superior court order granting respondent\u2019s section 995 motion, we are concerned with the correctness of, not the reasons for, the order. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laiwa </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 711, 718 [195 Cal.Rptr. 503, 669 P.2d 1278].)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">If the magistrate erred in permitting Detective Osman to testify to <em>either </em>the statements of the victim <em>or </em>the statements of Mr. Schiro, then the order setting aside the information was correct and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The magistrate relied upon section 872, subdivision (b), enacted as part of Proposition 115. This section provides: \u201cNotwithstanding Section 1200 of the Evidence Code [the hearsay rule], the finding of probable cause may be based in whole or in part upon the sworn testimony of a law enforcement officer relating the statements of declarants made out of court offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Any law enforcement officer testifying as to hearsay statements shall either have five years of law enforcement experience or have completed a training course certified by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training which includes training in the investigation and reporting of cases and testifying at preliminary hearings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">By its terms, this statute creates a special hearsay exception applicable only at preliminary hearings. To determine whether or not hearsay statements were properly admitted under section 872, subdivision (b), two questions must be addressed: first, was the testifying officer qualified; second, if qualified, were the hearsay statements admissible?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">1. <em>Was Detective Osman </em>qualified?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Because Detective Osman had been a City of Monterey Park police officer for 12 years he satisfied the threshold requirement of section 872, subdivision (b): \u201cAny law enforcement officer testifying as to hearsay statements shall. . . have five years of law enforcement experience. . . .\u201d As <em>Whitman </em>makes clear, five years\u2019 law enforcement experience is a necessary but insufficient qualification. Officer Alexander, the testifying officer in <em>Whitman, </em>had eight years\u2019 experience but was unqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">But <em>Whitman </em>makes less clear just what, in addition to five years\u2019 experience, constitutes section 872, subdivision (b) <em>officer qualification.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Officer Alexander illustrates what constitutes <em>nonqualification. </em>\u201cProposition 115 does not authorize a finding of probable cause based on the testimony of a noninvestigating officer or \u2018reader\u2019 merely reciting the police report of an investigating officer.\u201d <em>(Whitman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 1063, 1072.) Officer Alexander was unqualified, <em>Whitman </em>states, because he was merely a \u201creader,\u201d an officer who had no involvement with the case before the preliminary hearing and whose information came only from the report he \u201cread.\u201d Officer Alexander, in <em>Whitman </em>terminology, was a \u201cnoninvestigating officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><em>Whitman </em>further states: \u201cWe believe the probable intent of the framers of the measure was to allow <em>a properly qualified investigating officer </em>to relate out-of-court statements by crime victims or witnesses, including other law enforcement personnel, without requiring the victims\u2019 or witnesses\u2019 presence in court. <em>The testifying officer, </em>however, must not be a mere reader but <em>must have sufficient knowledge of the crime or the circumstances under which the out-of-court statement was made so as to meaningfully assist the magistrate in assessing the reliability of the statement.\" </em>(54 Cal.3d at pp. 1072-1073. Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Thus, to be qualified, the testifying officer must be an <em>investigating </em>officer, \u201ca properly qualified investigating officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">But what is an \u201cinvestigating officer\u201d? <em>Whitman </em>does not define the term and we are unaware of any accepted, useful definition. Certainly, to merely say it is <em>an officer who investigates </em>is circular and unhelpful. In practice, the term has almost as many meanings as there are law enforcement agencies which use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">An investigating officer may be a Colombo-like homicide detective who studies the crime scene, personally and repeatedly interrogates witnesses and possible witnesses, conducts lineups, questions suspects, requests and coordinates scientific studies, and gathers sufficient admissible evidence for a prosecution. But an investigating officer may also be little more than a bureaucratic paper shuffler, a veteran officer who collects police reports\u2014 crime report, arrest report, evidence report, perhaps a follow-up report\u2014 determines if they are sufficient for prosecution, and if so, presents them to the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Although not defining \u201cinvestigating officer\u201d <em>Whitman </em>does provide an example of one. The officer who saw the crime being committed (driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs) and arrested its perpetrator is characterized as \u201can investigating officer.\u201d (54 Cal.3d at p. 1072.) <em>Whitman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>further suggests that one may be an investigating officer by having \u201csufficient knowledge of the crime <em>or </em>the circumstances under which the out-of-court statement was made so as to meaningfully assist the magistrate in assessing the reliability of the statement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1072-1073. Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We conclude that Detective Osman satisfied the <em>Whitman </em>requirements. He was not a mere \u201creader.\u201d In a relatively simple burglary case he personally interviewed the victim, the officer who took the crime report (Officer Yahn), and the defendant\u2019s parole officer. We hold that Officer Osman was a \u201cproperly qualified investigating officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">2. <em>Was Detective Osman\u2019s testimony relating the victim\u2019s statements properly </em>admitted?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Detective Osman testified that he had personally talked to the victim the day after the burglary. The victim, Detective Osman testified, stated that on July 9, 1990, he left his locked residence at 6 a.m. and upon returning at 4:15 p.m. discovered about $3,000 worth of jewelry missing. He had not given permission to anyone to enter his house or take his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">We are satisfied that these victim-hearsay statements were properly admitted by the magistrate. Detective Osman, having personally interviewed the victim, had \u201csufficient knowledge of. . .the circumstances under which the . . . statements] [were] made so as to meaningfully assist the magistrate in assessing the reliability of the statements.\u201d (54 Cal.3d at pp. 1072-1073.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">In fact, as is common with burglary victims, the magistrate required little if any assistance to assess the reliability of the victim-statements. Defense counsel, who cross-examined Detective Osman on other aspects of his testimony, asked no questions about the victim-statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">3. <em>Was Detective Osman\u2019s testimony relating Mr. Schiro's statements properly </em>admitted?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Detective Osman testified to what Officer Yahn stated (in his report) that Mr. Schiro stated. Unlike his victim-statement testimony, this testimony was double hearsay. Detective Osman, not having spoken to Mr. Schiro, was not \u201ccapable of using his . . . experience and expertise to assess the circumstances under which the statements] [were] made and to accurately describe those circumstances to the magistrate so as to increase the reliability of the underlying evidence.\u201d (54 Cal.3d at p. 1074.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Although <em>Whitman </em>stops just short of flatly prohibiting section 872, subdivision (b) double hearsay, we believe such prohibition is unavoidable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Double hearsay, like \u201creader\u201d testimony, has <em>\u201cinherent\u201d </em>uncertainties. (54 Cal.3d at pp. 1074-1075.) The testifying officer, who has <em>not </em>interviewed the declarant, will inevitably be \u201cunable to answer potentially significant questions regarding the . . . circumstances\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1074) under which the statement was made. For example, Detective Osman would have been unable to answer questions concerning Mr. Schiro\u2019s demeanor, certainty, apparent intelligence, possible bias, suggestibility, etc. Yet these \u201cpotentially significant\u201d matters are the very ones which require the special witness qualifications specified in section 872, subdivision (b) and elaborated by <em>Whitman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Moreover, a rule which would <em>prohibit </em>an officer who heard statements from testifying to them, such as one-year Officer Yahn, but <em>permit </em>an officer who did not hear them, to testify to them, such as Detective Osman, is, at best, constitutionally suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">As <em>Whitman </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cMoreover, to allow testimony by noninvestigating officers or readers would seemingly sanction a form of double or multiple hearsay beyond the contemplation of the framers of, and voters for, Proposition 115. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1201 [multiple hearsay admissible only if each hearsay statement admissible under hearsay rule exception].) Although such multiple hearsay was not present in this case, we doubt that Proposition 115 was intended to sanction a procedure whereby a noninvestigating officer, lacking any personal knowledge of the matter, nonetheless would be permitted to relate not only what the investigating officer told him, but also what the other witnesses told the investigating officer. It is noteworthy that although Proposition 115 created an exception to the basic hearsay rule contained in Evidence Code section 1200 (see new Pen. Code, \u00a7 872, subd. (b)), the measure did not purport to create a similar exception for the multiple hearsay rule of Evidence Code section 1201.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u201cIn addition, an interpretation of Proposition 115 that would allow \u2018reader\u2019 or multiple hearsay testimony would raise constitutional questions that we can and should avoid by limiting admissible hearsay testimony to testimony by qualified investigative officers. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 251, 259 [193 Cal.Rptr. 692, 667 P.2d 149] [construing Prop. 8, \u2018The Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights\u2019 initiative measure, to avoid constitutional doubts].) As discussed below, we believe that the latter, more limited, form of hearsay evidence satisfies federal requirements of <em>reliability </em>(see <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 63-65 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, 605-607, 100 S.Ct. 2531], and thus properly may be admitted at preliminary hearings despite the defendant\u2019s inability to confront and cross-examine the declarant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>witness or victim. But substantial additional objections to the reliability of the evidence might arise if multiple hearsay were involved, and the defendant were also deprived of the opportunity to meaningfully cross-examine the testifying officer regarding the circumstances under which the out-of-court statement was made.\u201d (54 Cal.3d at p. 1074. Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We hold that because Detective Osman\u2019s testimony relating Mr. Schiro\u2019s statements was double hearsay, it was inadmissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since it was only that testimony which linked the defendant to the crimes, the error was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The order setting aside the information is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Lillie, P.
