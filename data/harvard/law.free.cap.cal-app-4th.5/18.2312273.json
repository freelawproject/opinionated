Under the claimed agreement, defendant, a shareholder of a corporation in bankruptcy, agreed to pay a sum to plaintiff, a creditor of the corporation, in consideration of plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal of objections in the pending bankruptcy action.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The case proceeded to court trial. After taking the matter under submission, the court issued a written decision in favor of defendant, stating in substantial part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">\u201cAn agreement, as here, by a shareholder of a debtor corporation to pay money to a creditor of the corporation in consideration of the creditor\u2019s withdrawal of objection to debtor\u2019s pending motions in a Chapter XI reorganization proceeding violates public policy and is unenforceable. [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">\u201cThe fact that there existed an antecedent obligation of defendant to plaintiff does not affect the result if the withdrawal of the opposition to the debtor\u2019s motion was any part of the consideration for the agreement. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cIt is not significant that the agreement was not between the debtor corporation and the creditor. The defendant was the sole shareholder of the debtor corporation and there was an identity of interest. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">\u201cJudgment should enter for defendant that plaintiff take nothing and for defendant\u2019s costs of suit. Defendant will prepare, serve and submit a form of judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">On June 13, 1990, plaintiff filed a notice of motion for new trial. That motion was denied on July 6, 1990, and an order denying the motion was filed on the same day. Plaintiff filed his notice of appeal on September 4, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">In plaintiff\u2019s opening brief, in a section entitled \u201cStatement of Appealability,\u201d plaintiff acknowledges that the court\u2019s decision filed May 24, 1990, provided that judgment should enter for defendant and that defendant was directed by the court to prepare the judgment. Plaintiff continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">\u201cFollowing denial of Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal for the within matter. [Citation], No formal judgment was entered prior thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-12\">\u201cRule 2(c) provides that \u2018a notice of appeal filed prior to the entry of judgment, but after its rendition, shall be valid and shall be deemed to have been filed immediately after entry.\u2019 The \u2018Decision\u2019 filed May 24, 1990, thus represents the final judgment appealed from pursuant to C.C.P. \u00a7 904.1(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The principal fallacy in plaintiff\u2019s threshold claim\u2014that he is appealing from a judgment that should be deemed final because he filed his notice of appeal after rendition yet before entry of judgment\u2014is the absence of even a rendition of judgment. Contrary to defendant\u2019s reliance upon the \u201cdecision\u201d as the \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d the court made it clear that the judgment was yet to be prepared and approved. The court\u2019s statement was the <em>tentative decision </em>contemplated in California Rules of Court, rule 232(a). That rule provides in part that, on the trial of an issue of fact by the court, \u201cthe court shall announce its tentative decision by an oral statement, entered in the minutes, or by a written statement filed with the clerk.\u201d That section further provides, \u201cThe tentative decision shall not constitute a judgment and shall not be binding on the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Even though defendant was the party directed to prepare, serve and submit the judgment, the apparent failure of defendant to do so does not relieve plaintiff from the requirement of appealing from an appealable order. We also note that it would have been helpful for the court to have specifically denominated its decision as a \u201ctentative decision\u201d or to have made reference to rule 232(a), and to have put some specific timeframe on the preparation of the proposed judgment to facilitate follow-up.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the ultimate responsibility rests with the appealing party; plaintiff could have requested the trial court to compel defendant to prepare the judgment or requested permission to prepare and file the judgment himself to perfect his appeal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u201cIn California the right to appeal in civil actions is wholly statutory. [Citation.] In order to exercise that right an appellant must have standing to appeal, and must take an appeal from a statutorily declared appealable judgment or order.\u201d <em>(Rao </em>v. <em>Campo </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1557, 1564 [285 Cal.Rptr. 691].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1 provides that a party is entitled to one appeal from the final judgment in an action. There are numerous exceptions to this rule in probate cases, in marital dissolution cases, and in cases where there is a final determination of a collateral matter that may be appealed while the main action is still pending. (See <em>United Pacific Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 925, 941 [266 Cal.Rptr. 231].) This was not such a case,  Here, one judgment was to be entered that would resolve all the disputes between these parties in this action. Thus this record does not contain a judgment from which an appeal can be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The trend of recent cases of the Courts of Appeal is to hold appellate counsel to strict account for ensuring that their appeal rights are perfected according to the applicable statutes and rules of court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In <em>Modica </em>v. <em>Merin </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1072, 1074 [285 Cal.Rptr. 673], the appellate court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">\u201cIt is not that we are insensitive to the plight of plaintiff\u2019s counsel but it is a plight not of our making. Nor is the problem here one that occurs only infrequently. Despite persistent efforts by the appellate courts to educate the bar, attempts to appeal from nonappealable orders of this nature continue unabated in substantial numbers. . . . This court indulged [the fiction that a nonappealable order incorporates a judgment of dismissal] in a number of cases ... in the hope that focusing attention on the problem in this way would effect a painless solution. Alas, this practice had the unintended and lamentable consequence that counsel came increasingly to rely upon the court\u2019s indulgence rather than to take the procedural steps necessary to perfect an appeal.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The <em>M\u00f3dica </em>court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">\u201cWe have long since determined the proper role of an appellate court is to adhere to and apply Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1, not to devise and employ strategies for its wholesale avoidance. As a practical matter, experience teaches that far from solving the problem, the latter approach only exacerbates it.\u201d <em>(Modica </em>v. <em>Merin, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 1075.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">As happened in <em>Modica, </em>the Court of Appeal in <em>Munoz </em>v. <em>Florentine Gardens </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1730 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 609], another case where an appeal from a nonappealable order was dismissed, gave the parties notice of the court\u2019s intent to dismiss because of the perceived shortcomings of the appellate record. In <em>Munoz, </em>the court noted, \u201cAt the request of the justices of this court, the clerk communicated with counsel to request letter briefs on the issues of whether there was a written order signed by the trial court dismissing the action and, if not, whether this appeal should be dismissed.\u201d <em>(Munoz </em>v. <em>Florentine Gardens, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1731.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">In the instant case, plaintiff has knowledge of the defect in the record so we need not direct him to this defect prior to dismissal of this appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Plaintiff candidly admits that no \u201cformal judgment\u201d was entered prior to the filing of his notice of appeal; he essentially claims that the court\u2019s tentative decision should be construed as a final judgment. We reject this threshold argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The appeal is dismissed. Defendant is awarded his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">Best, P. J., and Buckley, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\">See California Rules of Court, rule 232(e) regarding preparation and filing of written judgment when statement of decision is not requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-10\"><em>Francis </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 535 [4 Cal.Rptr. 2d 361] is an exception to this trend, and we choose not to follow that case insofar as it generally justifies allowing an appeal from a nonappealable order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
