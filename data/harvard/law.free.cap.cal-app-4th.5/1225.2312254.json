Code, \u00a7 187).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court found true a special allegation that appellant suffered a prior serious felony conviction in Oregon within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a). He was sentenced to a state prison term of 15 years to life for the murder conviction, together with a consecutive term of 5 years for the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">The murder victim was Jodi Lods (hereafter Jodi or the victim), with whom appellant had lived for nearly seven years before her death in May of 1989. Appellant and Jodi had two children together: Wade and Ashley, who were ages four and two and one-half years, respectively, at the time Jodi was killed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Appellant and Jodi had a tumultuous relationship during which, appellant admitted, he struck her on numerous occasions, inflicting physical injuries of varying seriousness. In November of 1988, Jodi complained hysterically by telephone from Point Arena to her mother that appellant had beaten and kicked her. The following day, Jodi left with the two children for Santa Rosa. When she arrived there, her mother observed that \u201c[s]he had black and blue marks all over her.\u201d She was taken to the hospital for treatment of her head injuries. Appellant also mentioned to one of the victim\u2019s sisters in early May of 1989 that \u201che had been mad at Jodi on other occasions where he was mad enough to\u2014that he could have killed her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">In December of 1988, Jodi and the children moved into a cabin at the \u201cNorthwood Cottages,\u201d located on Highway 116 near the town of Monte Rio. Appellant returned to California from Oregon in December of 1988, and therafter occupied the cabin with Jodi and the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">On May 24, 1989, Jodi\u2019s mother, Joan Lods (hereafter Mrs. Lods) drove Jodi to the cabin, depositing her there at approximately 7 p.m. Jodi appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>\u201cupset\u201d and \u201cemotional\u201d during the drive home. Mrs. Lods observed that appellant was at the cabin when she left Jodi there. Later that evening, Jodi walked into Guerneville along Highway 116. She was seen in town that evening at the River Club, a bar where she ordered beer, and the Safeway, where she purchased apple juice, milk and cereal.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The next morning, \u201ca little after nine o\u2019clock,\u201d Corinne Kaylor (hereafter Corinne), Jodi\u2019s sister, called the cabin to speak with Jodi. Appellant answered and said, \u201cshe is not here right now,\u201d but did not mention to Corinne \u201cthat he was so or . . . concerned about Jodi\u2019s whereabouts ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Appellant reported to the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Department that Jodi was missing at 10:16 that morning. About 11 a.m., appellant informed Mrs. Lods by telephone that Jodi had gone to the Safeway the night before to buy milk and juice, but had not yet returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Mrs. Lods went to the social services department, where she knew Jodi had an appointment that day. Jodi did not show up there, so Mrs. Lods returned home and eventually called appellant. He told Mrs. Lods in conversations that day and evening that Jodi had gone to the Safeway almost immediately after arriving home the night before. Appellant also advised Mrs. Lods that he had called the sheriff\u2019s department.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The following day, May 26, Jodi failed to appear at a scheduled appointment in court, whereupon Mrs. Lods visited the cabin with Corinne. Appellant and the two children were home. Ashley grabbed Corinne by the pants and brought her into the cabin. Appellant stated that he wanted to \u201ccheck along the roadside\u201d of Highway 116 to \u201csee if he could find anything.\u201d Mrs. Lods suggested that they first drive into Guerneville to determine if anyone had seen Jodi. Corinne stayed at the cabin with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Corinne testified that immediately after appellant and Mrs. Lods left, Ashley stood up and became \u201ccompletely hysterical.\u201d She \u201cwas jumpy\u201d and \u201cjust started rambling.\u201d Corinne had never seen Ashley that excited. Corinne testified: \u201cShe said that daddy and mommy had a big, big fight, and that daddy cut mommy with a knife, and she didn\u2019t like her daddy when he drank a lot of beer, and he cut mommy\u2019s feet off, she went on to say he cut mommy\u2019s shoes off. Mommy just laid there.\u201d Corinne tried to calm Ashley, but the child \u201cremained excited.\u201d Ashley added that \u201cdaddy punched mommy in the nose and mommy fell on the floor.\u201d Ashley demanded that they proceed outside to the garbage dumpster, in which Corinne discovered \u201cbrand-new\u201d women\u2019s underwear, gin bottles and beer cans. Ashley, still excited, led Corinne into the kitchen and opened a drawer containing kitchen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>knives and a meat cleaver. Ashley remained in an excited state the rest of the day and did not want to eat. Corinne further testified that while she observed dirty dishes in the sink and food scattered about the kitchen, the rest of the cabin was \u201cvery clean.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Appellant and Mrs. Lods were unable to uncover any trace of Jodi in Guemeville. They posted missing person signs around town with a description of Jodi and the clothes she had been wearing the night she disappeared: black Levi\u2019s jeans, a charcoal grey sweatshirt, a white tank-top, and a pair of dangling silver earrings.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">After they had been in Guerneville about two hours, appellant reiterated his interest in walking along the roadway back toward the cabin, with Mrs. Lods following along slowly in the car. Appellant walked only along the \u201criver side\u201d of the road. About half-way back to the cabin, Mrs. Lods lost sight of appellant. When he reappeared 10 or 15 minutes later, he was carrying Jodi\u2019s purse, which was covered with dried mud. Appellant had found the purse \u201cin some green ground cover\u201d; there was no mud in the area. Appellant appeared \u201cangry\u201d or \u201cemotional\u201d; he \u201cpunched a mailbox on the side of the road.\u201d They took the purse to the sheriff\u2019s department. From that location, Mrs. Lods called Corinne and learned of Ashley\u2019s disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">It was agreed that Ashley and Wade would stay temporarily with Mrs. Lods. When Wade was placed in Mrs. Lods\u2019 car, he \u201cjumped\u201d away from appellant and seemed \u201cfrightened.\u201d The children stayed with Mrs. Lods for five or six days. While there, Ashley awoke \u201cnight after night screaming, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy.\u201d When appellant arrived to retrieve the children, Wade screamed, \u201cdon\u2019t let me go, I don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">On May 27, trackers for the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Department discovered the victim\u2019s clothes on a river bank about 40 feet from Highway 116 and \u201cless than a quarter of a mile\u201d from the cabin. A criminalist testified that human blood stains of Jodi\u2019s blood type were found on the front shoulders, neck and upper back of the grey sweatshirt and tank-top; blood was also found on a bra. The pattern of the stains suggested that the victim\u2019s clothing had been pulled up over her head. No stains were found on the black denim pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Sheriff\u2019s deputies visited the cabin on May 26 with a \u201cblood hound handler.\u201d The dog was \u201cscented\u201d on Jodi\u2019s hair curlers and led the officers to \u201cwoman\u2019s panties\u201d located in the garbage dumpster and a red eyebrow pencil buried at the edge of a nearby cabin. One of the deputies observed stains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>which appeared to be blood on the wall above the bed and next to a light switch near the front door. The stain above the bed could not be seen during a later visit, but the stain near the light switch was removed by the sheriff\u2019s department after appellant left the cabin\u2014the stain tested positive for human blood, of a type unknown. After appellant moved out of the cabin on June 7, the owner of the cabin also observed \u201cdeep dark reddish blackish stains\u201d on the carpet in the kitchen and near the front door which looked to him \u201clike blood stains.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Jodi\u2019s body was discovered on June 24, 1989, in a heavily forested area near a small stream about 50 feet from a logging road, one-half mile south of Monte Rio and a mile and one-quarter from the cabin. Redwood logs and bark had been placed over the body to cover it up but had \u201cbeen rolled back, exposing the skull and hand.\u201d Turkey vulture feathers were scattered around the area, \u201cand it appeared that there had been some predation on the body.\u201d Portions of the victim\u2019s hair were found near a feather \u201caround eight feet from the body,\u201d and \u201centwined\u201d in the hair was a \u201ctriangular-shaped earring.\u201d A second earring was later found near the stream about 50 feet from the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The advanced state of decomposition of the body precluded identification of the cause of death. \u201c[T]here were no soft tissues remaining\u201d on the body. The lower jaw was fractured and the first cervical vertebra was missing. No other injuries to the bones were found; the hands and feet were attached to the body. The pathologist, although unable to assign a cause of death, testified: \u201cIt would be quite possible that an individual could be stabbed without ever touching any bony structures and could well die from that type of stab wound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">On June 27, 1989, without informing appellant of the prior discovery of Jodi\u2019s corpse, deputies took him to various locations ostensibly to search for the body. At the third arranged search site\u2014where the body had actually been found earlier\u2014the officers left appellant alone but under observation. He \u201cwalked into the redwood grove and stopped, stood still for a moment . . . about ten feet. . . from where the logs had been replaced, and then backed out of the redwood grove.\u201d Appellant and the officers then \u201cregrouped down by the vehicle\u201d before leaving the area and proceeding to the sheriff\u2019s department. According to a prearranged plan, after appellant and the deputies left the scene another officer contacted the patrol vehicle by radio to falsely claim that he had just found the item they had been looking for, and described a triangular-shaped metal earring. No mention was made of the location of the discovery. Appellant\u2019s reponse was \u201csomething along the lines that\u2019s Jodi.\u201d Appellant also asked: \u201cAm I under arrest?\u201d At the sheriff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>station, appellant made a telephone call to his mother during which he mentioned that the police had \u201cfound a body, sounds like Jodi\u2019s.\u201d Although he had not yet been told where the body was discovered, he also said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t more than ten feet from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Larry Moore was the occupant of a cabin at the Northwood Cottages located within 10 or 15 feet of the one in which appellant and Jodi lived.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He testified that on May 25, 1989, at 1:05 a.m., he heard a \u201cgiant thud\u201d emanating from the next door cabin. The sound was \u201cvery loud,\u201d like a \u201cbody hitting the wall\u201d; Moore thought appellant and Jodi \u201cwere having a fight.\u201d About 1:45 a.m\u201e he heard a \u201cscraping\u201d noise, so he peeked out his window. He saw appellant \u201ccarrying or dragging something off the porch down the stairs away from the cottage.\u201d He could not identify the \u201clarge object\u201d he observed, but the sound was \u201clike cardboard dragging against gravel . . . .\u201d Appellant dragged the object \u201cbetween his cottage and the next cottage, which was empty at that time.\u201d Moore momentarily lost sight of appellant, but then looked out his other window which faces the parking lot and saw a car \u201cwith the headlights on . . . .\u201d The lights were shining in his direction, so Moore was unable to see into the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The prosecution also adduced the testimony of Cheryl Bland (hereafter Cheryl) who also lived at the Northwood Cottages and often socialized with appellant. Cheryl testified that she loaned appellant her car on numerous occasions. Her car was an older model Rambler which could be started with \u201cany kind of key.\u201d Cheryl testified that if appellant needed to borrow her car, \u201call he had to do is ask.\u201d On the night of May 24, 1989, Cheryl participated in a poker game, returned home intoxicated after midnight, and went to sleep. She did not know if appellant borrowed her car that night. The next day, appellant told her that Jodi had left the night before and not yet returned. Cheryl thought Jodi \u201cjust got pissed off and left\u201d because she and appellant were \u201cconstantly fighting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Appellant testified in his own defense at trial. He admitted suffering a prior robbery conviction in Oregon. He also admitted that during his relationship with Jodi he struck her with his fist at least five times, which caused her suffering black eyes and other injuries. He had been mad enough to kill her \u201ca few times.\u201d Appellant denied that he assaulted Jodi in any way on the night of May 24, however, or had any involvement in her disappearance. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>claimed that Jodi left that night for Guemeville before dinner and never returned. Appellant insisted that he did not have access to a vehicle in May of 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Corinne in which she recounted the statements made by Ashley describing appellant\u2019s assault upon Jodi. Appellant maintains that Corinne\u2019s hearsay testimony does not fall within the spontaneous declaration exception. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1240.) He also argues that admission of such evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">To avoid violation of a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights in the admission of hearsay evidence, the prosecution must show the unavailability of the declarant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the out-of-court statement bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>(Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 805, 815 [111 L.Ed.2d 638, 652, 110 S.Ct. 3139]; <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 66 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, 608, 100 S.Ct. 2531].) \u201cReliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d (448 U.S. at p. 66 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 608]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallego </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 115, 176 [276 Cal.Rptr. 679, 802 P.2d 169].) Thus, we focus our inquiry upon the admissibility of Ashley\u2019s out-of-court statements under the hearsay exception for spontaneous declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Section 1240 of the Evidence Code (hereafter \u00a7 1240) provides: \u201cEvidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement: [$ (a) Purports to narrate, describe, or explain an act, condition, or event perceived by the declarant; and [][] (b) Was made spontaneously while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by such perception.\u201d  \u201c \u2018To render [statements] admissible [under the spontaneous declaration exception] it is required that (1) there must be some occurrence startling enough to produce this nervous excitement and render the utterance spontaneous and unreflecting; (2) the utterance must have been before there has been time to contrive and misrepresent, i.e., while the nervous excitement may be supposed still to dominate and the reflective powers to be yet in abeyance; and (3) the utterance must relate to the circumstamce of the occurrence preceding it.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poggi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 306, 318 [246 Cal.Rptr. 886, 753 P.2d 1082]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearch </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1282, 1289-1290 [280 Cal.Rptr. 584]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 24, 37 [167 Cal.Rptr. 557].)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Whether a statement satisfies the requirements of the spontaneous declaration exception is \u201clargely a question of fact\u201d and is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poggi, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 306, 318-319; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Forgason </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 356, 365 [160 Cal.Rptr. 263].) On appeal, the trial court\u2019s finding on this issue will not be disturbed unless those facts on which it relied are not supported by a preponderance of evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Provencio </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 290, 302 [258 Cal.Rptr. 330]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 653, 660 [202 Cal.Rptr. 289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Appellant insists that Ashley\u2019s statements to Corinne on May 26, 1989, uttered nearly two days after the event they purportedly described\u2014the assault on Jodi by appellant\u2014cannot be considered spontaneous or without reflection under section 1240. He claims that the level of psychological stress necessary to render a statement spontaneous cannot be maintained for a period of two days. <em>(In re Cheryl H. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1098, 1130 [200 Cal.Rptr. 789].)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">The lapse of time between the described event and the statement, although a factor in determining spontaneity, is not determinative. \u201c \u2018Neither lapse of time between the event and the declarations nor the fact that the declarations were elicited by questioning deprives the statements of spontaneity <em>if it nevertheless appears that they were made under the stress of excitement and while the reflective powers were still in abeyance.\u2019 \u201d (People </em>v. <em>Poggi, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 306, 319; quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1170, 1176 [81 Cal.Rptr. 5, 459 P.2d 259, 39 A.L.R.3d 541].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   A \u201cspontaneous\u201d utterance within the meaning of section 1240 is one which is \u201cundertaken without deliberation or reflection.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farmer </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 888, 903 [254 Cal.Rptr. 508, 765 P.2d 940]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearch, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at p. 1290.) \u201c[T]he basis for the circumstantial trustworthiness of spontaneous utterances is that in the stress of nervous excitement, the reflective faculties may be stilled and the utterance may become the instinctive and uninhibited expression of the speaker\u2019s actual impressions and belief. [][] The crucial element in determining whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>declaration is sufficiently reliable to be admissible under this exception to the hearsay rule is thus not the nature of the statement but the mental state of the speaker. The nature of the utterance\u2014how long it was made after the startling incident and whether the speaker blurted it out, for example\u2014may be important, but solely as an indicator of the mental state of the declarant.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farmer, supra, </em>at pp. 903-904.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">The record<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> shows quite convincingly that Ashley was in a mental state of extreme agitation and excitement when she told Corinne of appellant\u2019s assault upon Jodi. The startling event she had witnessed and described was undoubtedly monumentally stressful for a child of that age. The appreciable interval between the incident and the subject statements suggest that the child had some opportunity for deliberation; intervening events, however, notably the visit of Corrine and Mrs. Lods, convince us otherwise. It was the latter event which precipitated Ashley\u2019s outburst. Corrine testified that, immediately following appellant\u2019s departure from the cabin with Mrs. Lods, Ashley became hysterical and commenced her frantic description of the assault. Until then, Ashley, who had apparently been sequestered in the cabin with her brother and appellant, had had no trustworthy person in whom to confide. The appearance of Corinne and Mrs. Lods, followed by the discussion of Jodi\u2019s disappearance and the departure of appellant, was a triggering event, startling enough to provoke an immediate, unsolicited, emotional outpouring of previously withheld emotions and utterances. <em>(In re Damon H. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 471, 476 [211 Cal.Rptr. 623].) Once appellant left the premises, nothing preceded or provoked Ashley\u2019s volunteered statements; only the obviously continuing influence of the prior assault, coupled with appellant\u2019s absence and the first secure opportunity for disclosure, accounts for her spontaneous, animated description of the incident. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poggi, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 306, 319; <em>People </em>v. <em>Panky </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 772, 779-780 [147 Cal.Rptr. 341].)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">We accordingly find no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Ashley\u2019s statements to Corinne were spontaneous rather than the product of reflection. <em>(In re Damon H., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d 471, 476; <em>People </em>v. <em>Panky, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.3d 772, 780.)  We further conclude that the statements are surrounded by \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d which negate any violation of appellant\u2019s confrontation rights. The requirements of the confrontation provisions are satisfied by statements admitted under the firmly rooted hearsay exception for spontaneous declarations. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sully </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1195, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>1229 [283 Cal.Rptr. 144, 812 P.2d 163]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallego, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 115, 176; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farmer, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 888, 905; <em>In re Damon H., supra, </em>at p. 478; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d 653, 664; <em>People </em>v. <em>Orduno </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 738, 748 [145 Cal.Rptr. 806].) Ashley\u2019s statements were also made under circumstances which indicate to us a guarantee of trustworthiness sufficient to overcome any confrontation clause objection by appellant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Admission of Ashley\u2019s statements to Corinne offend neither section 1240 nor appellant\u2019s right to confront witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Strankman, P.
