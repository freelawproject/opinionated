Thus, the entire appointive property passes to the other named appointee and none is distributable to the deceased appointee\u2019s issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Earl Lester Berdrow (Earl) died testate on September 14, 1964. His surviving widow Martha Berdrow (Martha) was granted a life estate and testamentary special power of appointment over the remainder of the trust property. The power of appointment was \u201cspecial\u201d because it could only be exercised in favor of the named appointees: Martha\u2019s son, Stanton K. Berdrow (Stanton); persons who are the issue of both Stanton and Rosa Berdrow; Martha\u2019s grandson, Stephen Berdrow Koenig (Stephen); and Stephen\u2019s issue. The decree of final distribution in Earl\u2019s probate proceedings filed in Kern County Superior Court on January 6, 1967, provides that if Martha failed to exercise the special power of appointment, the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>property is to be distributed equally to Stanton and Stephen or any of their issue if either is no longer living.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Martha died testate on March 7, 1991. Martha\u2019s will dated November 1, 1985, and codicil dated April 24, 1986, were admitted to probate in Orange County Superior Court on April 18, 1991. Martha\u2019s will provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cArticle Fourth [f] I declare that I have a special power to appoint the trust estate of a trust established by the Will of my deceased husband; Earl Lester Berdrow, to or for the benefit of any or all of the following persons: Stanton K. Berdrow, the issue of both Stanton K. Berdrow and Rosa Berdrow, Stephen Paul Berdrow Koenig, and the issue of Stephen Paul Berdrow Koenig. It is my intent to exercise that power and the property subject to that power shall be apportioned into equal shares as follows: One (1) such share for Stephen Paul Berdow Koenig, if he survives me, and three (3) such shares for my son, Stanton K. berdrow, if he or any of the issue of Stanton K. Berdrow and Rosa Berdrow survives me. I give each share so apportioned for a named person who survives me to such person. If my son, Stanton K. Berdrow, fails to survive me, the shares so apportioned for him shall be further apportioned into equal shares as follows: One (1) such share for my granddaughter, Nancy Berdrow, if she or any of her issue survives me, one (1) share for my grandson, John Stanton Berdrow, if he or any of his issue survives me, and one (1) such share for my grandson, Matthew Scott Berdrow, if he or any of his issue survives me. I give each share so apportioned for a named grandchild of mine who survives me to such grandchild, and I give each share so apportioned for a named grandchild of mine who fails to survive me but who has issue who survive me to such issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Martha\u2019s will further provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201cArticle Fifth M] I give the residue of my estate, wherever situated, including all failed and lapsed gifts, to my son, Stanton K Berdrow, if he survives me. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">\u201cArticle Sixth [f] Except as otherwise specified in this Will, I have intentionally and with full knowledge omitted to provide for my heirs and descendants who may be living at the date of my death or born thereafter. Except as specifically provided in Article Fourth, I have failed to make any provision in this Will for my grandson, Stephen Paul Berdrow Koenig. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Stephen predeceased Martha, leaving appellants Jennifer Koenig, Peter Koenig, and Amy Koenig, each a minor, as his surviving issue. Stanton survived Martha.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Stanton filed his petition in Earl\u2019s probate proceeding requesting that all the trust property be distributed to him on the grounds that Stephen failed to survive Martha and thus no share of the trust property was to be apportioned to him or his issue. Appellants, through their guardian ad litem, filed objections to the petition requesting that one-eighth of the trust property be distributed to them as alternative takers under the January 6, 1967, final decree of distribution of Earl\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">After a hearing, the court denied appellants\u2019 objections and granted Stanton\u2019s petition in toto. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The respective positions of the parties rest on a determination of whether \u201cArticle Fourth\u201d of Martha\u2019s will fully exercised the power of appointment granted by Earl\u2019s will. Appellants argue that Martha\u2019s failure to provide for alternative takers should Stephen not survive her constitutes a failure to exercise the power of appointment as to one-fourth of the appointive property. They further argue that the residuary clause in Martha\u2019s will does not affect the appointive property, so the \u201cfailed\u201d one-fourth passes under the decree of distribution in Earl\u2019s estate pursuant to the provisions of Civil Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 1389.4, subdivision (b). Appellants claim they are thus entitled to one-eighth (one-half of one-fourth) of the trust estate. Respondent contends \u201cArticle Fourth\u201d of Martha\u2019s will is a complete exercise of the power of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In its initial ruling the probate court, relying on Probate Code section 6147, subdivision (c), interpreted Martha\u2019s will as indicating an intent contrary to that of the antilapse statute. The court later signed a formal order and decree stating that because Stephen predeceased Martha, \u201cno share of the trust estate was apportioned for him\u201d and ordered the entire trust estate distributed to Stanton.  When, as here, there is no conflict in extrinsic evidence, the appellate court is not bound by the construction adopted by the trial court. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839]; <em>Estate of Russell </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 200, 214-215 [70 Cal.Rptr. 561, 444 P.2d 353].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The creation and exercise of powers of appointment are governed by section 1380.1 et seq. In \u201cArticle Fourth\u201d of her will, Martha expressed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>intent to exercise the testamentary special power of appointment conferred upon her by Earl\u2019s will. Appellants concede this is Martha\u2019s intent. (See also \u00a7\u00a7 1385.2; 1386.1, subd. (b).) Martha\u2019s express reference to the power evinces a conscious exercise of her power. (See <em>Estate of Eddy </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 292, 300 [184 Cal.Rptr. 521].)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">As the donee of a special power of appointment, Martha \u201cmay appoint the whole or any part of the appointive property to any one or more of the permissible appointees and exclude others.\u201d (\u00a7 1387.3.) She may also make the appointment subject to conditions or charges. (\u00a7\u00a7 1387.1, subd. (a)(3); 1387.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The language of \u201cArticle Fourth\u201d acknowledges the permissible appointees under Earl\u2019s will, including Stephen and Stephen\u2019s issue. However, it also unambiguously conditions the apportionment of a share of the appointive property to Stephen on his surviving Martha. He did not. Therefore, no share of the appointive property is ever apportioned to him and Martha\u2019s will makes no provision for apportionment of any shares for Stephen\u2019s issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Appellants\u2019 argument assumes that on Martha\u2019s death the trust estate was to be apportioned into four equal shares, one of which was for Stephen. The argument misconstrues the will\u2019s language. The will clearly, and carefully, distinguishes between apportionment and disposition. Apportionment of a share for Stephen was expressly made contingent on his surviving Martha. Because the contingency was not met, the provision calling for apportionment of a share for Stephen never took effect. Thus, the provision by which Martha gave \u201ceach share so apportioned\u201d did not apply to Stephen, as no \u201cshare\u201d was apportioned to him. Instead, the trust estate was to be apportioned into three equal shares, all of which were then given to Stanton. The dispositive language taking effect on Martha\u2019s death affected 100 percent of the trust estate, not just 75 percent as appellants assume.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on section 1389.4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is misplaced. We do not read that section as applying when apportionment of a share of the estate is expressly contingent, whether the contingency relates to the appointee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>survival or some other fact. The section clearly would apply if Martha had unconditionally appointed a specified share of the trust estate to Stephen, but even in that event appellants would not prevail because of the provisions of section 1389.4, subdivision (b). Martha clearly manifested an intent that some disposition of the appointive property, other than to appellants, be made.  \u201cArticle Fifth\u201d of her will provides that any failed or lapsed gifts are to pass to Stanton. Since Stephen did not survive Martha, his share of the appointive property, if any, fails and passes to Stanton under the residuary clause. While appellants correctly assert that the residuary clause of a will which does not manifest an intent to exercise a power of appointment (see \u00a7 1385.2) cannot be read as an exercise of the power, Martha expresses her intent to and does exercise her power of appointment in \u201cArticle Fourth.\u201d This is sufficient. All parts of a will are to be construed in relation to each other. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 6161.) The residuary clause merely provides for distribution of any failed gifts; it is not an attempt to exercise the power of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The provision in Earl\u2019s will relied on by appellants is not applicable unless Martha fails to exercise her power of appointment. Martha\u2019s will fully exercised her power over the appointive property.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The fact that Martha expressly identified alternative takers for Stanton\u2019s share defeats appellant\u2019s argument that Martha \u201coverlooked\u201d the need to do so for Stephen\u2019s share. Martha knew how to provide for an alternative distribution of Stephen\u2019s share had she wanted to do so. The clear import of her failure to do so is that she wanted to condition Stephen\u2019s share of the appointive property on his survivorship and exclude his issue from taking in his stead. This was within her prerogative as the donee of a special power of appointment and within the limits of the power granted her under Earl\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Further evidence that Martha did not \u201coverlook\u201d Stephen\u2019s issue is found in \u201cArticle Sixth\u201d of her will in which she specifies her intent to limit any gift to Stephen under the will to those gifts \u201cspecifically provided in Article Fourth.\u201d Martha\u2019s intent was to limit Stephen\u2019s gift to the clear and unambiguous language of \u201cArticle Fourth\u201d\u2014there was no oversight. The testator\u2019s intent is paramount when interpreting a will. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 6140, subd. (a).) Earl gave Martha her power of appointment; Martha clearly wished to limit Stephen\u2019s gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The trial court properly rejected appellants\u2019 argument and ordered distribution to Stanton.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The judgment (order disallowing objections, appointing successor trustee, terminating trust, and decree of final distribution) is affirmed.
