We conclude that the challenged provisions violate the single subject rule set forth in section 9 of article IV of the California Constitution, and are therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">Petitioners brought this original proceeding for a writ of mandate compelling respondent California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board to incorporate in the California Occupational Health and Safety Act (Cal/ OSHA) plan certain health and safety provisions adopted in Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. We granted the relief requested. <em>(California Lab. Federation </em>v. <em>Occupational Safety &amp; Health </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number><em>Stds. Bd. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1547, 1559 [271 Cal.Rptr. 310], review den.) Thereafter, petitioners moved under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 (hereinafter cited as section 1021.5) for an award of some $234,373.10 in attorney fees and costs. We awarded $114,266.25 in fees and $2,820.30 in costs, and directed respondent to pay these sums \u201cforthwith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">When petitioners sought payment, a budget analyst for the Department of Industrial Relations advised counsel by letter that the state would not pay the full award: \u201cThe State of California has established a Budget Appropriation for payment of attorney\u2019s fees awarded pursuant to [section 1021.5] with a $125 cap on the hourly fee payable. The court\u2019s award of $114,226.25 [sic] was reduced to $55,422.75 in compliance with the hourly rate cap requirement for 1021.5 cases.\u201d In order to receive any payment at all, petitioners would have to execute releases discharging the state from any further liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\"> Petitioners brought this motion to enforce the award as made, seeking an order requiring respondent to pay the full amount awarded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They contend that the budget provisions on which the state relies are void because they effect an amendment of existing law in violation of the single subject rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The controversy before us is one of considerable delicacy, arising as it does in the sometimes turbulent region where the legislative and judicial spheres come into close contact. In making the present award, we did no more than carry out the legislative directive of section 1021.5 that we reward litigants in certain cases by granting a reasonable attorney fee. We are now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>called upon to consider the effect of budget provisions by which the Legislature sought to restrict the right thus granted. In addressing this question we must consider the paramount command of the California Constitution that the Legislature may not use the Budget Act to expressly or impliedly amend or repeal existing substantive statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">This case raises no question concerning the Legislature\u2019s substantive power to limit or control attorney fee awards against the state. In <em>Mandel </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 531, 550-551 [174 Cal.Rptr. 841, 629 P.2d 935], the Supreme Court pointed out several means by which the Legislature might accomplish such a result through properly enacted statutes. One of the strategies noted is similar in substance to the provisions in question here, i.e., \u201cestablishing] a fixed or maximum hourly rate of recovery for attorney services. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 551.) There is no occasion here to question the Legislature\u2019s competence to enact such a limitation. The sole issue is the lawfulness, in light of the single subject rule, of a \u201ccap\u201d on fee awards <em>enacted as part of the Budget Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">B. <em>Single Subject Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Article IV, section 9 of the California Constitution (hereafter article IV, section 9) requires that every statute \u201cembrace but one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This requirement grew out of an abhorrence of \u201clog-rolling,\u201d \u201cpork barrel politics,\u201d and legislation by \u201criders\u201d\u2014all variations on the parliamentary tactic of combining unrelated provisions in a single bill in order to secure their enactment. A \u201crider,\u201d for example, \u201c \u2018consisted in attaching to a bill dealing with one matter of legislation a clause entirely foreign to that subject matter, to the end that, hidden under the cloak of the meritorious legislation, the obnoxious measure might \u201cride through.\u201d Such \u201criders\u201d . . . not infrequently embraced ill-digested and pernicious legislation, relief bills, private appropriation measures, and the like, which would not have carried if the legislative mind had been directed to them. It was to cure this evil that the constitution made it mandatory that a bill should embrace but one subject-matter, and to meet the case of such a \u201crider\u201d actually slipping through, declared that any matter foreign to the title of the bill should be held void.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Planned Parenthood Affiliates </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1187, 1196 [219 Cal.Rptr. 664](hereinafter cited as <em>Swoap), </em>quoting <em>Ex parte Hallawell </em>(1909) 155 Cal. 112, 114 [99 P. 490].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>The Budget Act is a complex measure whose passage is essential, and as such is \u201cparticularly susceptible to abuse\u201d of the kind just described. <em>(Swoap, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d at p. 1198.) It is, therefore, fully subject to scrutiny under the single subject rule. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1198-1199.) Its \u201csubject\u201d is the appropriation of funds for government operations, and it cannot constitutionally be employed to expand a state agency\u2019s authority, or to \u201csubstantively amend[] and chang[e] existing statute law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1199, quoting <em>Association for Retarded Citizens </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Services </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 384, 394 [211 Cal.Rptr. 758, 696 P.2d 150], quoting 64 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 910, 917 (1981); internal quotation marks omitted.) Whether it effects an amendment of existing law for purposes of this prohibition \u201cis determined not by title alone, or by declarations in the new act that it purports to amend existing law. On the contrary, it is determined by an examination and comparison of its provisions with existing law. If its aim is to clarify or correct uncertainties which arose from the enforcement of the existing law, or to reach situations which were not covered by the original statute, the act is amendatory, even though in its wording it does not purport to amend the language of the prior act.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 772, 777 [145 Cal.Rptr. 819], quoting <em>Balian Ice Cream </em>v. <em>Arden Farms Co. </em>(S.D.Cal. 1950) 94 F.Supp. 796, 798-799, italics and internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">C. <em>Budget Act Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We are called upon here to apply the principles of article IV, section 9 to provisions of the Budget Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> purporting to limit the payment of fee awards under section 1021.5. Section 5 of the Budget Act provides that no award may be paid except as \u201c[s]peciflcally authorized and set forth in an item or section of this act.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Item 9810-001-001 purports to (1) place a cap of $125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>per hour on fee award payments, and (2) condition payment on acceptance of this amount \u201cin full and final satisfaction\u201d of the fee claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The question before us is whether these provisions are \u201camendatory\u201d for purposes of the rule that the Budget Act may not be utilized to amend existing statutory law. Despite the fact that some such restrictions have been included in the Budget Act for at least 10 years, no published decision has yet faced the issue whether the restrictions survive scrutiny under the single subject rule. In <em>Swoap, supra, </em>we ourselves declined to reach the issue, characterizing it as a problem of enforcement not then before us. (173 Cal.App.3d 1187, 1202, fn. 12, citing <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 852, 859 [145 Cal.Rptr. 819].) Other courts have not reached the issue because they determined that the awards before them fell outside the terms of the budget restrictions. (E.g., <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 678 [207 Cal.Rptr. 830], cert. den. (1985) 474 U.S. 819 [88 L.Ed.2d 54, 106 S.Ct. 67] [award based on federal law]; <em>Coalition for Economic Survival </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 954 [217 Cal.Rptr. 621][same]; see <em>Filipino Accountants\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Accountancy </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 1023 [204 Cal.Rptr. 913].) And one court held the restrictions ineffective as against an award made before their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>adoption, finding them to constitute an impermissible legislative readjudication of a final judgment. <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 188, 200-201 [182 Cal.Rptr. 387].)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">In <em>Estate of Cirone </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1280 [234 Cal.Rptr. 749], review denied, similar budget restrictions were upheld as against a contention that they violated the separation of powers. However, the decision nowhere acknowledged, let alone decided, the possible applicability of the single subject rule.  \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that \u2018cases are not authority for propositions not considered therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Isbell </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 61, 73 [145 Cal.Rptr. 368, 577 P.2d 188], cert. den. 439 U.S. 996 [58 L.Ed.2d 669, 99 S.Ct. 597], quoting <em>Worthley </em>v. <em>Worthley </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 465, 472 [283 P.2d 19].) Since <em>drone </em>is addressed solely to the question of separation of powers, its authority as precedent is limited to its holding on that question, and it has no bearing on the issue before us. (See <em>Worthley </em>v. <em>Worthley, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at p. 472.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">D. <em>Amendatory Enactment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">To determine whether the budget restrictions effect an impermissible amendment, we must examine existing law concerning fee awards of the kind made here.  Section 1021.5 permits a prevailing party to recover attorney fees where certain criteria are met and the action \u201chas resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is a \u201ccodification of the \u2018private attorney general\u2019 attorney fee doctrine that had been developed in numerous prior judicial decisions.\u201d <em>(Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 933 [154 Cal.Rptr. 503, 593 P.2d 200].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Its enactment \u201cin significant measure . . . was an explicit reaction\u201d to <em>Alyeska Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 240 [44 L.Ed.2d 141, 95 S.Ct. 1612], in which the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>Supreme Court held that federal courts could not award fees on a private attorney general theory without statutory authorization. <em>(Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 934.) Section 1021.5 is \u201ca legislative declaration that, in California, courts do enjoy the authority\u2014exercised in numerous <em>pre-Alyeska </em>federal decisions\u2014to award attorney fees on a private attorney general theory.\u201d (23 Cal.3d at p. 934.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Section 1021.5 contains no express limitation on the size of the award, but has been universally understood to permit a \u201creasonable\u201d award in light of factors derived from the statute\u2019s history and purpose. <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, 639 [652 P.2d 985]; see <em>Sokolow </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231, 249, 250 [261 Cal.Rptr. 520], review den.; <em>Citizens Against Rent Control </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 213, 232-233, 236 [226 Cal.Rptr. 265].) The Budget Act provisions in question here, on the other hand, impose what the state itself refers to as a \u201ccap\u201d on the hourly rate which will be paid. Coupled with the requirement that the recipient waive any amounts exceeding this \u201ccap,\u201d the provisions impose what amounts to a mandatory numerical ceiling on the fees which may be recovered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In <em>Swoap, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d 1187, we held invalid a budget provision purporting to withhold family planning funds from organizations which promoted abortion services. (173 Cal. App.3d at p. 1191, fn. 1.) We compared this restriction to existing statutes providing for family planning education, training, and services, and to regulations, promulgated under those statutes, requiring that clients be advised of all possible family planning options. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1200.) We concluded that the budget restriction was impermissibly amendatory, for even if it did not flatly contradict the family planning statutes it sought to \u201cclarify\u201d them, and to \u201cimpose[] substantive conditions that nowhere appear in existing law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">As noted, section 1021.5 contains an implicit \u201ccap\u201d of its own, i.e., a party may only recover a \u201creasonable\u201d fee, and no more. (See <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 621, 635.) The budget restrictions purport to impose a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>wholly different cap based on a flat maximum hourly rate. This appears to be a markedly different substantive measure, and one which will in many cases be irreconcilable with the grant of a \u201creasonable\u201d fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">Respondent contends, however, that the existing limitation to a reasonable fee is not \u201cstatutory\u201d but a mere judicial <em>interpretation </em>of section 1021.5; therefore, respondent asserts, the budget provisions do not affect \u201cexisting <em>statutory </em>law.\u201d We question the implicit premise that the distinction between statutory and court-made law plays the crucial role respondent would give it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, we need not thoroughly explore that premise because we find the existing limitation to a \u201creasonable\u201d award to be as much a matter of \u201cstatutory law\u201d as anything explicitly stated in section 1021.5.  \u201c \u2018[Wjhatever is necessarily implied in a statute is as much part of it as that which is expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Welfare Rights Organization </em>v. <em>Crisan </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 766, 771 [190 Cal.Rptr. 919, 661 P.2d 1073, 31 A.L.R.4th 1214], quoting <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1914) 167 Cal. 260, 264 [139 P. 86].)  The limitation to a reasonable fee is so inherent and essential to section 1021.5 that it must be considered \u201cnecessarily implied.\u201d The statute limits fee awards to a \u201creasonable\u201d sum as surely as if it said so. The budget provisions purporting to impose a different limitation seek' to effect an outright alteration of section 1021.5 as drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Furthermore, as we stated in <em>Swoap, </em>a Budget Act provision is impermissibly amendatory not only if it alters existing statutory law but also if \u201cits aim is to clarify or correct uncertainties which arose from the enforcement of the existing law.\u201d <em>(Swoap, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d 1187, 1199, citations and internal quotation marks omitted.) If section 1021.5 is viewed as ambiguous with respect to the amount of fees allowed, the provisions here are amendatory for purporting to supersede the judicial resolution of that ambiguity with a legislative \u201cclarification\u201d set forth as an appropriation. The challenged provisions are amendatory in that sense and in the sense that they impose \u201csubstantive conditions that nowhere appear in existing law.\u201d (173 Cal.App.3d at p. 1201, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We reiterate that the Legislature is presumptively free to limit attorney fee awards under section 1021.5. What the Legislature may <em>not </em>do is grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>substant\u00edve right to fees, as it has done in section 1021.5, and then retract or impair the right thus granted through amendments masquerading as Budget Act provisions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would deny the people the legislative accountability they sought to secure by adopting article IV, section 9 of the state Constitution. The provisions under scrutiny violate the single subject rule and are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">III. Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Respondent seems to contend that whether or not the budget provisions are void, this court cannot direct payment of the full award because to do so would infringe legislative prerogatives and transgress the separation of powers. While we recognize the delicacy of the problem presented, we are satisfied that we can grant the relief requested by petitioners without impermissibly invading the domain of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\u201c[Tjhe separation of powers doctrine has generally been viewed as prohibiting a court from directly ordering the Legislature to enact a specific appropriation, [but] it is equally well established that once funds have already been appropriated by legislative action, a court transgresses no constitutional principle when it orders the State Controller or other similar official to make appropriate expenditures from such funds.\u201d <em>(Mandel </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 531, 540.) Here, funds have been appropriated for the payment of attorney fee awards under section 1021.5, but payment has been made subject to certain conditions which, as we have held, are void. The funds in question \u201chave already been appropriated by legislative action\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>for the very purpose here contemplated. Accordingly, we transgress no constitutional principle by directing payment of the award without regard to the impermissible restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">In accord with petitioners\u2019 request, we \u201corder <em>respondent </em>to comply fully with this court\u2019s Order ... by paying forthwith the amount of $117,086.55.\u201d (Italics added.) We retain jurisdiction (1) to enforce this order as may be necessary, (2) to determine whether a further award of attorney fees can and should be allowed, and if so in what amount, in connection with work performed by petitioners\u2019 counsel in seeking to enforce the original award, and (3) to consider such other matters as may be necessary and proper..</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Kline, P. J., and Peterson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 21, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">In passing, respondent questions whether we have jurisdiction to determine the motion. A court issuing a writ of mandate has the inherent continuing power \u201c \u2018to make any orders necessary and proper for the complete enforcement of the writ.\u2019 \u201d <em>(King </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 571, 578 [192 Cal.Rptr. 724]; <em>Professional Engineers in Cal. Government </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 101, 109 [170 Cal.Rptr. 547]; see <em>County of Inyo </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 205 [139 Cal.Rptr. 396]; <em>County of Inyo </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 91, 95 [132 Cal.Rptr. 167].) The court has the distinct power to award \u201cdamages and costs,\u201d and the award \u201cmay be enforced in the manner provided for money judgments generally.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1095; see Cal. Civil Writ Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 1987), \u00a7 11.6, p. 455.) We have the further power \u201c[t]o compel obedience to [our] judgments . . . .\u201d (Code Civ.

With respect to actions involving public entities, this section applies to allowances against, but not in favor of, public entities, and no claim shall be required to be filed therefor.\u201d (\u00a7 1021.5)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">These \u201cprior judicial decisions\u201d were mostly federal. California case law did not confirm the availability of a private attorney general theory until scant days after section 1021.5 was signed into law (but several months before it took effect), when the Supreme Court held that courts possessed inherent equitable power to award fees on such a theory, at least where the action vindicated a public policy with a constitutional basis. <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 46-47 [569 P.2d 1303]; see <em>Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 917, 925.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Quoting from <em>Estate of Cirone, supra, </em>respondent suggests that the cap is really something less than that because the fee recipient need not accept the reduced sum: \u201cIt is up to [the recipient] to decide whether to accept the payment on the terms or conditions offered by the Legislature or whether to refuse payment in hopes of a greater appropriation in the future.\u201d (189 Cal.App.3d at p. 1292.) We fail to see how the ability to \u201chope\u201d for full payment dispels the mandatory character of the invitation. On the contrary, a person relegated to a mere \u201chope\u201d experiences the essence of legal powerlessness. Insofar as the budget provisions here may be viewed as having that effect, they conflict with section 1021.5, which grants a <em>right </em>to a reasonable fee as fixed by a court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\"> The apparent reason for striking down \u201camendatory\u201d budget provisions is that they have a <em>substantive </em>effect, whereas the sole \u201csubject\u201d of the Budget Act is the enactment of <em>fiscal </em>policy. The rationale, again, is that such proposals should be separately presented and considered, in order to attract the distinct attention of the legislative mind. For these purposes any amendment of existing law, other than fiscal law, would seem to be a \u201csubstantive\u201d enactment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b805-8\">In <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Cory, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.3d 852, the court remarked in passing that similar budget restrictions \u201ccannot be read as an amendment by implication of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.\u201d (132 Cal.App.3d at p. 859.) This statement was followed immediately by a citation to article IV, section 9\u2014the Constitution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>single subject rule. (132 Cal. App.3d 859) We do not understand the quoted remark to mean that the budget restrictions could not be understood as amendatory, but rather that they could not be <em>permitted </em>to have that effect consistent with the single subject rule. In short, the court anticipated our holding today, without actually reaching the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> Although we do not reach the issue, we note that the Budget Act restrictions may also be amendatory of existing statutes concerning cost awards against the State. For some purposes, at least, a fee award under section 1021.5 is an item of \u201ccosts.\u201d (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B) [fees awarded pursuant to statute are costs]; <em>T.E.D. Bearing Co. </em>v. <em>Walter E. Heller &amp; Co. </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 59, 62 [112 Cal.Rptr. 910][same]; <em>Plumbing etc. Employers Council </em>v. <em>Quillin </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 215, 220 [134 Cal.Rptr. 332][marshalling cases]; <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Cory, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.3d 852, 858 [petitioners were \u201centitled to recover . . . costs . . . , including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees . . . .\u201d] (fn. omitted); <em>Swoap, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d 1187, 1202 [same]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 800 [authorizing fee award in certain cases \u201cin addition to . . . other costs\u2019\u2019].) At least in general, cost awards \u201cmust be paid out of the appropriation for the support of the agency on whose behalf the State appeared.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1028; compare <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1095 [losing public entity in mandate proceedings must pay costs \u201cas other claims against the public entity are paid,\u201d and a cost award \u201cmay be enforced in the manner provided for money judgments generally\u201d]; see Gov. Code, \u00a7 965.2 [\u201cThe Controller shall draw a warrant for the payment of any final judgment or settlement against the state whenever the Director of Finance certifies that a sufficient appropriation for the payment of such judgment or settlement exists.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
