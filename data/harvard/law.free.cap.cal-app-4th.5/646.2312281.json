J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsA\">Defendant was charged with first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with special circumstance allegations that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in committing the crimes of robbery and kidnapping (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)). Defendant was also charged with robbery (\u00a7 211), kidnapping to commit robbery (\u00a7 209, subd. (b)), and burglary (\u00a7 459).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder, first degree robbery, kidnapping for robbery, and first degree burglary. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">On the evening of December 16, 1987, defendant and three companions, Clifford Knight, David Knight, and Mike Tex, were at the Hard Times Tavern. When the bar closed at midnight, the group left together, taking a six-pack of beer with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">At approximately 1 a.m. on December 17, Johnny Smith, who was staying at the South Fork Motel, was awakened by someone pounding on the door of the room next to his. Herman Cube, a Southern California Edison employee, was staying in that room. Mr. Smith heard the intruders beating and choking Mr. Cube and repeatedly asking him for his keys. Mr. Cube had a Chevy S-10 Blazer, which belonged to his employer, parked in front of his room. One of the intruders also threatened \u201cto send [Mr. Cube] back to China to his ancestors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">After about 15 minutes of a \u201ccontinuous beating,\u201d defendant and one of his companions went outside and defendant opened the driver\u2019s door of the Blazer. Meanwhile, the beating of Mr. Cube continued in the motel room. A few minutes later, defendant and his companion went back to the motel room. Someone then said \u201c \u2018Mike, lay off the guy, let\u2019s go, we got the keys.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Defendant entered the driver\u2019s side of the Blazer again. Two others immediately followed defendant, holding Mr. Cube, and shoved Mr. Cube into the back seat. Defendant then drove off up the hill. As soon as defendant left, Mr. Smith ran across the street to the Hard Times Tavern and called the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">While the sheriff\u2019s deputies were at the motel gathering information, the Blazer was seen coming back down the hill. Thereafter, a highspeed chase ensued over 13 miles of winding, narrow roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">The chase was over when the Blazer turned onto a dirt road and stopped where the road ended. Four people then jumped out of the Blazer and ran. Defendant and Clifford Knight were apprehended at that time. David Knight and Michael Tex were arrested later.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">At the time of his arrest, defendant appeared to have been drinking, but did not seem highly intoxicated. There was what appeared to be blood on defendant\u2019s shoes and pants. During the booking process, defendant threw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the keys to Mr. Cube\u2019s personal automobile and the motel room key into a garbage can.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Mr. Cube\u2019s body was found approximately three miles from South Fork. Although Mr. Cube had been severely beaten, the cause of death was blood loss from a deep, long neck wound which could have been inflicted by a saw found in the Blazer. Large amounts of blood were found in the Blazer and in the motel room. Defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found on the Blazer key and on the motel room door. Bloody shoeprints consistent with the shoes defendant was wearing were also found in the motel room. However, no prints matching defendant\u2019s shoes were found near the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">I. <em>The crime of kidnapping for robbery will support a second degree felony-murder conviction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The jury was instructed on second degree felony murder as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">\u201cThe unlawful killing of a human being whether intentional, unintentional or accidental which occurs during or as the direct causal result of the commission of the crime of kidnapping to commit robbery or kidnapping is murder of the second degree when the perpetrator had the specific intent to commit such crime.\u201d The jury found defendant guilty of kidnapping to commit robbery. Defendant argues this offense does not satisfy the \u201chigh probability of death\u201d standard required to support a second degree felony-murder conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The second degree felony-murder doctrine is not based on a statutory definition. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 615, 620 [262 Cal.Rptr. 195, 778 P.2d 549].) Rather, the doctrine was defined by the California Supreme Court as \u201c \u2018A homicide that is a direct causal result of the commission of a felony inherently dangerous to human life (other than the six felonies enumerated in Pen. Code, \u00a7 189). . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, in determining whether a felony is \u201cinherently dangerous,\u201d the court must look to the elements of the felony in the abstract, not to the particular facts of the case. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 620-621.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Burroughs </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 824 [201 Cal.Rptr. 319, 678 P.2d 894], the court described an inherently dangerous felony as one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\u201ccannot be committed without creating a substantial risk that someone will be killed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 833.) However, the court subsequently adopted a new standard in <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra. </em>Now, an inherently dangerous felony is defined as \u201can offense carrying \u2018a high probability\u2019 that death will result.\u201d (49 Cal.3d at p. 627.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The issue of whether kidnapping for robbery meets this recently adopted standard of inherent dangerousness has not yet been decided. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ordonez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1225 [277 Cal.Rptr. 382], the court stated \u201cWe have no doubt that kidnapping for ransom, extortion or reward satisfies the <em>Patterson </em>standard.\u201d Noting that throughout history kidnapping has been considered among the most heinous of crimes, the court concluded that kidnapping for ransom has features which heighten the danger to the victim, even though it does not require asportation. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1225, 1228.) \u201c\u2018In the ransom situation, \u201cforcible control is necessary to effect secret confinement; the offense requires a protracted concealment; the confinement becomes more difficult to maintain when the kidnapper\u2019s flight ultimately becomes necessary; and the victim\u2019s release grows increasingly dangerous with the passage of time.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearch </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1282 [280 Cal.Rptr. 584], Division One of the Fourth Appellate District held that simple kidnapping is an inherently dangerous felony under the <em>Patterson </em>standard. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1299.) The court noted that \u201cthe crime of kidnapping is fraught with violence\u2014 either the actual use of physical force or the threat of physical harm. \u2018 \u201c[F]orcible removal\u201d of one person by another . . . constitutes the essence of kidnapping [citations] . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1297.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In this case, the jury was instructed that either simple kidnapping or kidnapping for purposes of robbery could support a second degree murder conviction. However, the jury found defendant guilty of kidnapping for purposes of robbery. Thus, we need not decide whether the <em>Pearch </em>court correctly determined that simple kidnapping is an inherently dangerous felony. Rather, we need only be concerned with whether kidnapping for purposes of robbery is an inherently dangerous felony. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 746, 778-779 [254 Cal.Rptr. 257, 765 P.2d 419].)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Section 209, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cAny person who kidnaps or carries away any individual to commit robbery shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life with possibility of parole.\u201d In contrast, the crime of simple kidnapping is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for three, five or eight years. (\u00a7 208, subd. (a).) Further, first degree robbery is punishable by imprisonment for three, four or six years. (\u00a7 213.) Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>penalty for kidnapping for robbery is considerably more onerous than that for the lesser offenses combined.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The California Supreme Court has concluded the intent of the Legislature in adding kidnapping for robbery to the aggravated kidnap scheme was \u201cto impose harsher criminal sanctions to deter the carrying away of persons during the commission of a robbery in a manner which substantially increases the risk that someone will suffer grave bodily or psychic injury or even death.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laursen </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 192, 198 [104 Cal.Rptr. 425, 501 P.2d 1145].)  In fact, a conviction of kidnapping for purposes of robbery requires that the movements \u201c(1) are not merely incidental to the commission of the robbery <em>and </em>(2) substantially increase the risk of harm beyond that inherent in the crime of robbery.\u201d <em>(In re Earley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 122, 127 [120 Cal.Rptr. 881, 534 P.2d 721].) Thus, the offense, viewed in the abstract, cannot be committed unless the movement places the victim in a position which is dangerous to human life. Consequently, the commission of kidnapping for robbery creates a high probability that death will result. Kidnapping for robbery, therefore, is an inherently dangerous felony which can support a conviction of second degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Vartabedian, J\u201e and Buckley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 12, 1992, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 8, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-13\">Section 189 was amended by initiative measure (Prop. 115) approved June 5, 1990, after commission of the acts at issue here, to include kidnapping or attempted kidnapping as a basis for first degree felony murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 646.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
