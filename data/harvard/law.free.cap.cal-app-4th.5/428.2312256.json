We conclude the evidence was both admissible and sufficient. We affirm the order sustaining the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">A petition alleged appellant, a minor, attempted to murder four victims while personally using a shotgun (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602; Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664/187, 12022.5) and inflicted great bodily injury upon one of the victims (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">A fitness hearing was held and the court determined the minor was a \u201cproper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subds. (a), (b), (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Petitioner denied the allegations and an adjudication hearing (a trial) was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">We synopsize the evidence, and do so with a perspective favoring the appealed-from superior court order <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>303-304 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110]). We reserve elaboration of the challenged identification evidence for the discussion portion of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">On Thursday evening, January 25, 1990, 26-year-old Brenda Holquin was driving in the Lincoln Heights area of Los Angeles, an area she had lived in all her life. She knew there were three gangs in the area (Eastlake, Clover, and El Sereno) had belonged to one of them when younger, and had friends in all three.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Sometime before 8 p.m. she saw a friend\u2019s younger brother, Arthur, and stopped to pick him up because \u201c[e]arlier in the day ... he had . . . gotten shot at from another gang.\u201d Arthur and three of his friends all got in Brenda\u2019s car, Arthur in the front passenger seat, Jaime in the rear left (behind the driver), and Alejandro in the middle rear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Brenda drove to Lincoln Heights playground where she expected to find Arthur\u2019s mother. Not finding her there, Brenda continued driving, planning to drop Arthur and his friends off someplace else.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Soon, Brenda or one of the young men noticed they were being followed by a black \u201cMazda R[X]7.\u201d At first the young men thought the occupants of the black Mazda might be friends of theirs, so they told Brenda to slow down. Before long they changed their mind and told Brenda to \u201ctake off.\u201d Brenda made turns and the Mazda made the same turns. She increased her speed, tried to get away, and was scared. The Mazda continued chasing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">As Brenda testified, \u201cthe kids were screaming in the back and telling me don\u2019t let them get up on the side of you. And I just kept on driving. And I came up against a red light, and I didn\u2019t want to take the red light in lieu of <em>[sic] </em>we might have [had] an accident. And as I stopped Art [ ] yelled out, \u2018He\u2019s got a gun.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">She continued: \u201cI heard two loud noises as we took off. My tires must have spinned because I stayed like in the same position. And they hit the side window and the back window. The glass shattered on my head, and I put my hand on the horn because I knew that there [were] cops down the street\u2014 officers down the street on Eastlake because we had passed by them. . . . And when I turned around and look at Art, I panicked because he just said, \u2018I\u2019m hit, Brenda. I\u2019m hit.\u2019 And there was blood all over the place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Brenda drove two blocks and stopped at a McDonald\u2019s. A police car was right behind them. Almost immediately, Arthur, Jaime, and Alejandro each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>told the officers that the person who shot them was \u201cSharky from El Sereno,\u201d appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Brenda saw no faces and made no identification. Arthur did not testify. Jaime and Alejandro recanted their identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The defense, including appellant\u2019s testimony, was alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">1. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting Arthur\u2019s extrajudicial excited utterance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">One of the officers whom Brenda passed immediately before the shooting was Officer Haddock. He testified that he and his partner had been stopped at Thomas and North Broadway when he heard a loud blast, looked in the direction of the blast, saw Brenda\u2019s car, and pulled behind it. The right front passenger, Arthur, immediately exited. \u201cBlood was spewing from his face. I thought he suffered a major wound.\u201d From the time of the blast to Arthur exiting the car was \u201ca matter of seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">When Arthur exited, Officer Haddock testified, he stated: \u201c T just been shot. You got the wrong car. It was Sharky from El Sereno.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Officer Haddock, who had had prior contacts with appellant, knew appellant\u2019s El Sereno street-gang name was \u201cSharky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">The trial court admitted Arthur\u2019s extrajudicial statement pursuant to Evidence Code section 1240. It provides: \u201cEvidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement: [f] (a) Purports to narrate, describe, or explain an act, condition, or event perceived by the declarant; and H] (b) Was made spontaneously while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by such perception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting the statement. First, appellant argues, there was an insufficient foundation Arthur <em>perceived </em>the event described by his statement, namely, that he <em>saw </em>appellant shoot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">The foundation, or preliminary fact, required only proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 953, 966 [127 Cal.Rptr. 135, 544 P.2d 1335].) In making its factual determination the trial court exercises discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poggi </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 306, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>318-319 [246 Cal.Rptr. 886, 753 P.2d 1082].) If substantial evidence supports the exercise of that discretion we must uphold it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Orduno </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 738, 746 [145 Cal.Rptr. 806].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">We conclude there is substantial evidence Arthur perceived the event, i.e., that he saw the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Having been shot at earlier that same day by a rival gang member, Arthur had special reason to be watchful. Before the shooting, he and his friends must have been looking at the occupants of the black Mazda because they determined\u2014and told Brenda\u2014that those occupants were <em>not </em>friends. That Arthur was looking at the Mazda when Brenda stopped at the red light is evidenced by Brenda\u2019s testimony: \u201cAnd as I stopped, Art[ ] yelled out \u2018He\u2019s got a gun.\u2019 \u201d This evidence was corroborated by the location of Arthur\u2019s wounds, namely to his mouth and face, wounds he could have received only by looking at the shotgun when it was fired. Appellant\u2019s argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Appellant next contends the court erred in admitting the statement because it failed to make \u201cfactual findings.\u201d We disagree. Appellant cites no authority for the proposition, and we are aware of none, that a trial court, when making routine in-trial evidentiary rulings, has a duty to make express \u201cfactual findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Appellant further contends it was error to admit the statement because its \u201creliability\u201d was not established by a preponderance of the evidence. Appellant itemizes the following claimed deficiencies: the seriousness of Arthur\u2019s injuries was not shown; there was no evidence of Arthur\u2019s mental state and ability to observe; there was no evidence of the lighting conditions; the time lapse from shooting to \u201cexcited utterance\u201d was uncertain; and doubt was cast on Arthur\u2019s ability to observe because, after the shooting, he covered his face with his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">We find this contention unsupported by the evidence and without merit. An excited utterance declarant need not suffer <em>any </em>injury, let alone a serious one. Only an \u201cexciting,\u201d not injurious, event is necessary. Certainly two close-range shotgun blasts which caused blood to \u201cspew\u201d from the face of the declarant qualify as an \u201cexciting event.\u201d Nor was there any evidence suggesting Arthur was not a normal teenager with unimpaired ability to observe. The sufficiency of the lighting conditions was demonstrated not only by the content of Arthur\u2019s statements but also by the details Brenda observed (long-haired people leaning out the Mazda window), hostile witness Jaime observed (the black Mazda RX-7), and Alejandro observed (that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the occupants of the Mazda were <em>not </em>friends). Officer Haddock testified it was \u201ca matter of seconds\u201d after the shotgun blasts that Arthur made his excited utterance. There was no \u201cuncertain\u201d time lapse. Finally, that Arthur covered his face with his hands <em>after </em>he was shot, corroborated, rather than cast doubt upon, the reliability of his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"> Additionally, appellant contends Arthur\u2019s statement \u201cwas not independently admissible for truth\u201d and was inadmissible \u201cwithout independent corroboration.\u201d Only <em>People </em>v. <em>Farmer </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 888, 905 [254 Cal.Rptr. 508, 765 P.2d 940] is cited as supporting authority. <em>Farmer </em>does <em>not </em>support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention and assumptions, an extrajudicial statement is hearsay evidence only when it <em>\u201cis </em>offered to prove the truth of the matter stated.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200.) If not so offered, the statement is not hearsay and any exception to the hearsay rule, such as an excited utterance (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1240), is irrelevant.  Nor does admissibility require \u201ccorroboration.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Finally, appellant asserts that because Arthur was not a witness, special reliability requirements applied to his statement. <em>(Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 66 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, 608, 100 S.Ct. 2531].) We agree these requirements were applicable but disagree they were not satisfied. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 653, 662-665 [202 Cal.Rptr. 289]; <em>In re Damon H. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 471, 477-479 [211 Cal.Rptr. 623]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughey </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1383, 1388-1390 [240 Cal.Rptr. 269]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallego </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 115, 176 [276 Cal.Rptr. 679, 802 P.2d 169].)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Before considering appellant\u2019s objections to other admitted evidence, we believe it useful to clarify how the law regards an excited utterance, such as Arthur\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">As <em>Showalter </em>definitively explained: \u201cThese declarations are admissible not because they fall without the hearsay rule, as is the case with \u2018verbal acts\u2019, but because they fall within an exception to that rule. The foundation for this exception is that if the declarations are made under the immediate influence of the occurrence to which they relate, they are deemed sufficiently trustworthy to be presented to the jury. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\u201cThe basis for this circumstantial probability of trustworthiness is \u2018that in the stress of nervous excitement the reflective faculties may be stilled and the utterance may become the unreflecting and sincere expression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of one\u2019s actual impressions and belief\u2019. To render them admissible it is required that (1) there must be some occurrence startling enough to produce this nervous excitement and render the utterance spontaneous and unreflecting; (2) the utterance must have been before there has been time to contrive and misrepresent, i.e., while the nervous excitement may be supposed still to dominate and the reflective powers to be yet in abeyance; and (3) the utterance must relate to the circumstance of the occurrence preceding it.\u201d <em>(Showalter </em>v. <em>Western Pacific R.R. Co. </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 460, 468 [106 P.2d 895].)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Evidence Code section 1240 codifies this rule. (1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) \u00a7 715, p. 698.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Unlike some other hearsay exceptions (e.g., Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230, declarations against interest), admissibility does <em>not </em>depend upon declarant unavailability. A statement qualifying as an excited utterance is admissible irrespective of declarant availability. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d 653 [declarant, the murder victim, was unavailable]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughey, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 1383 [declarant, defendant\u2019s wife, who was present during the trial but did not testify, was available].) Neither contemporaneity <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>155 Cal.App.3d 653 [30-40 minute delay]) nor spontaneity <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farmer, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 888 [victim-declarant answered police dispatcher\u2019s questions]) is required. Nor need the declarant be identified. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Provencio </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 290 [258 Cal.Rptr. 330] [some unidentified kids yelled, \u201cHey, there goes Angel\u201d; defendant\u2019s first name was Angel].) And unlike an accomplice-witness, an <em>accomplice-declarant </em>requires no corroboration. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sully </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1195, 1229-1230 [283 Cal.Rptr. 144, 812 P.2d 163].) Also unlike a witness, an excited-utterance <em>declarant </em>need not satisfy witness qualifications. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 701; <em>People </em>v. <em>Orduno, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.3d 738 [three-year-old victim-declarant found not competent as preliminary hearing witness; her excited utterance admitted at trial]; <em>In re Damon H, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d 471 [excited utterance by two-year-nine-month-old victim admitted].) An excited utterance, alone, may support a conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poggi, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 306, 326; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farmer, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 888, 924; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughey, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 1383, 1394.) Finally, an excited utterance is <em>\u201cparticularly </em>likely to be truthful\u201d and \u201cbecause of its \u2018superior\u2019 trustworthiness, is <em>'better than </em>is likely to be obtained from the same person upon the stand. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hughey, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. 1392. Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>2. <em>Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting Jaime\u2019s and Alejandro\u2019s extrajudicial identifications.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">After Jaime testified he never saw the shooter and never told the police he had, Officers Haddock and Eagleson each testified to Jaime\u2019s prior inconsistent statement (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1235.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">After similar testimony by Alejandro, his prior inconsistent statement, also identifying appellant as the shooter, was testified to by both Officers Haddock and Eagleson. Officer Eagleson testified he showed six photographs to Jaime and Alejandro, each identified appellant, and each signed an identification report.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Distilled, appellant\u2019s contention is not that the prior-inconsistent-identification statements of Jaime and Alejandro were inadmissible but, rather, that they were <em>insufficient </em>for \u201cconviction.\u201d Appellant is mistaken for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">First, although a repudiated extrajudicial identification cannot, alone, sustain a conviction <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gould </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 621 [7 Cal.Rptr. 273, 354 P.2d 865]), one such identification <em>may </em>corroborate another, and together support a conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lucky </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 259, 288-289 [247 Cal.Rptr. 1, 753 P.2d 1052]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Armijo </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 271, 277-279 [270 Cal.Rptr. 496].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Second, contrary to appellant\u2019s claim, there was evidence independent of the Jaime-Alejandro extrajudicial statements which inculpated appellant. Arthur\u2019s excited utterance not only corroborated the Jaime-Alejandro statements but constituted independent and sufficient evidence of guilt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poggi, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 306, 326; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farmer, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 888, 924; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughey, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 1383, 1394.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The order sustaining the petition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">Lillie, P.
