J.</author>\n<p id=\"AH\">A jury convicted Lenzo Manning of murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187) and attempted murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187), during both of which offenses he used a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5) and a principal was armed with a shotgun (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)). As to the attempted murder, the jury additionally found that Manning inflicted serious bodily injury on the victim (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7). The jury also convicted Manning of shooting at an inhabited dwelling. Manning was sentenced to prison and appeals, claiming the trial court erroneously admitted evidence, the prosecutor committed misconduct, and the weapons findings were improper. We reject his contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Manning, a self-admitted member of the Back Street Crips, was in the company of two other men in the carport of a San Bernardino apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>building on the night of May 23, 1989, when one (the victim) of two brothers came by and asked the men who they were. The victim went on to his apartment, but, a short time later, the three men knocked at his door and said they wanted to fight, proclaiming, \u201cThis is Main Street Crip you\u2019re messing with.\u201d The victim shut his door. The victim\u2019s brother was on his way into the apartment when he encountered the three men, and arguing ensued. The victim came to his brother\u2019s aid with a golf club and a knife. The brothers went up the stairs and were just outside their apartment when Manning\u2019s codefendant handed him a shotgun, which he used to shoot both brothers, killing one and wounding the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">1, 2<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">3. <em>Weapon Enhancements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">As is common in such cases, the jury here made true findings that Manning both used a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5) and that a principal was armed with a shotgun (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)) in the commission of the murder and attempted murder. In their argument to the jury, the People stated that Manning\u2019s possession of the murder/attempted murder weapon and his use of it provided sufficient evidence to support both allegations,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> therefore, there is no possibility that more than one weapon was involved, or that the armed allegation referred to Manning\u2019s codefendant\u2019s possession of the weapon before he turned it over to Manning.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Manning now contends that because of language in Division One\u2019s opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 658 [193 Cal.Rptr. 614], the jury should not have been allowed to make true findings as to both allegations because of the prohibition against conviction of both greater and lesser offenses in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 351 [228 Cal.Rptr. 509, 721 P.2d 595], We disagree with Manning\u2019s position for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\"><em>Pearson </em>specifically prohibits multiple convictions based \u201con necessarily included offenses.\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 355.) In his opinion in <em>Turner, </em>Justice Weiner was careful not to label gun-use enhancements \u201clesser included offenses,\u201d citing Supreme Court and Court of Appeal cases in support. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>(People </em>v. Turner, <em>supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at p. 683.) <em>Turner </em>went on to hold that in cases where the more detailed allegation, i.e. Penal Code section 12022.5, is alleged, if evidence supports the less detailed allegation, i.e., section 12022, subdivision (a), the trial court has a sua sponte obligation to instruct as to the latter. In so doing, the <em>Turner </em>court cited authority holding that a section 12022.5 finding cannot be based on evidence which does not also support a section 12022, subdivision (a), finding. Be that as it may, still, not even <em>Turner </em>would go so far as to call section 12022, subdivision (a), a \u201clesser included enhancement\u201d of section 12022.5, which is precisely what is required for the prohibition stated in <em>Pearson </em>to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We note additionally, with interest, that no other decision has taken the language of <em>Turner </em>and used it in this particular context, although <em>Turner </em>has been on the books for almost nine years. We also note that a number of other Courts of Appeal recognize the fact, conceded in <em>Turner, </em>that enhancements are not convictions. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Kee </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1203, 1208 [279 Cal.Rptr. 643]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Warinner </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1352, 1355 [247 Cal.Rptr. 197].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Finally, we note with great interest the following excerpt from Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (e): \u201cWhen two or more enhancements under Sections 12022, 12022.5, and 12022.7 may be imposed for any single offense, only the greatest enhancement shall apply. . . .\u201d If, as Manning argues, true findings on Penal Code sections 12022, subdivision (a), and 12022.5 are mutually exclusive, why does Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (e), provide for their concurrence?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Manning fails to persuade us that we are legally obliged to strike the jury\u2019s finding as to the so-called \u201clesser enhancement,\u201d i.e., Penal Code section 12022, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Dabney, J., and McKinster, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 24, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 88.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Specifically, the People stated, \u201c. . . Manning personally used a shotgun. The arming in this case is the very same thing. Mr. Manning had a shotgun. Now, he got it from [his codefendant]. H] [The co-defendant] had armed Mr. Manning to do whatever he was going to do. . . . <em>[&lt;J[] </em>The principal is armed. That\u2019s Mr. Manning.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
