She further contends the court\u2019s order is unsupported by sufficient evidence as to any ground. Because we decide the case on the basis of sufficiency of the evidence to support the dependency orders under subdivision (b), we do not reach the constitutional issues in regard to subdivision (c).  The reviewing court \u201cshould not decide constitutional questions unless compelled to do so.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsh </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 134, 144 [202 Cal.Rptr. 92, 679 P.2d 1033].)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">I, II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Sherry contends the judgment cannot be affirmed unless the evidence is sufficient to support all of the grounds upon which the court relied in making its dependency orders. We disagree. The reviewing court may affirm a juvenile court judgment if the evidence supports the decision on any one of several grounds: \u201cSince the trial court had sufficient basis to terminate appellant\u2019s parental rights under [Civil Code] section 232, subdivision (a)(6), its findings under subdivision (a)(7) are moot.\u201d <em>(In re Amie M. </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 668, 676 [225 Cal.Rptr. 645].)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Sherry ignores the above case and relies instead on <em>In re Carmaleta B. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 482 [146 Cal.Rptr. 623, 579 P.2d 514], There, four minors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>were removed from their home in 1973, due to the father\u2019s sexual abuse of the girls and physical abuse of the boys and the mother\u2019s failure to protect the children. In 1974, a new baby girl was declared a dependent of the juvenile court due to the mother\u2019s inability to protect the child from the father\u2019s possible future sexual abuse. Upon the social service agency\u2019s petition, the trial court found all five children free of custody and control of their parents on grounds of both parents\u2019 cruelty and neglect and mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The mother appealed. The Supreme Court found insufficient evidence to support the mental illness ground; sufficient evidence supported the cruelty and neglect ground, but only as to four of the children, not as to the baby bom after the dependency proceedings involving the other children. The court held, \u201cSince the mental illness ground is unsupported by the evidence, and therefore cannot be used to sever the parental relationship to all of the children, and since the neglect ground is supported only as to four of the five children, we conclude that the case must be remanded to the trial court for a determination of the finding of detriment and a redetermination of whether the [Civil Code] section 232 petition should be granted.\u201d <em>(In re Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 495.) The court noted the trial court might have reached a different conclusion entirely as to the \u201cleast detrimental alternative for the children\u201d had it found no ground of mental illness. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 496.) \u201cWe cannot say that the erroneous findings were surplusage [citation] or that there is \u2018no real doubt\u2019 in the absence of the erroneous findings. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">We do not read <em>In re Carmaleta B. </em>to require reversal and remand for redetermination if one or more of several findings made by the juvenile court is unsupported by substantial evidence. Rather, we agree with the conclusion of <em>In re Steven A. </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 349, 353 [281 Cal.Rptr. 335], that the court in <em>In re Carmaleta B. </em>\u201cwas in reality engaging in a \u2018harmless error\u2019 type analysis.\u201d <em>In re Carmaleta B. </em>is not controlling here, where there is no real doubt regarding the propriety of the result.  \u201cWe uphold judgments if they are correct for any reason, \u2018regardless of the correctness of the grounds upon which the court reached its conclusion.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018It is judicial action and not judicial reasoning which is the subject of review . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(United Pacific Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 925, 933 [266 Cal.Rptr. 231].) We will not reverse for error unless it appears reasonably probable that, absent the error, the appellant would have obtained a more favorable result. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]; <em>Daly </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 725, 746 [144 Cal.Rptr. 380, 575 P.2d 1162].) Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>We conclude by noting the paramount purpose underlying dependency proceedings is the protection of the child <em>(In re Kerry O. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 326, 333 [258 Cal.Rptr. 448]), and we remind Sherry she does not represent \u201ca competing interest in this respect.\u201d <em>(In re Michael S. </em>(1981) 127 Cal.App.3d 348, 359 [179 Cal.Rptr. 546].)  The record shows the juvenile court exercised its broad discretion in determining that continued nonparental custody of Jonathan was in his best interests. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Crosby, Acting R J\u201e and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 17, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 300 provides that certain described minors may be adjudged dependents of the court.
