We conclude, on the facts presented here, that mere payment of settlement proceeds by the second insurer did not constitute that insurer\u2019s binding admission of its liability for all claims presented in the lawsuit, and hence summary judgment based on the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause was inappropriate. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">I. <em>The Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The facts, construed most strongly in favor of appellant, reflect that between 1979 and 1984, a 247-unit condominium project known as \u201cPines of La Jolla\u201d was developed. A&amp;A Construction Company, Inc., and Augusto Angelucci (hereinafter insureds) were involved in developing the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">II. <em>The Insurance Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The insureds had five different insurers during the relevant time period, only two of which are germane to our analysis. For the period of April 26, 1981, through April 26, 1982, the insureds were covered under a comprehensive general liability policy issued by respondent Industrial Indemnity (I.I.). After a one-year period of coverage by another insurer, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman\u2019s Fund) issued similar liability coverage to the insureds for the period 1983 through 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The policies issued by both I.I. and Fireman\u2019s Fund were occurrence-based policies which, in relevant part, contained identical language insuring against identical risks. Both policies (1) insured against liabilities of the insureds for \u201cproperty damage . . . caused by an occurrence\u201d; (2) defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201caccident . . . which results in . . . property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured\u201d; and (3) defined \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201cphysical injury to . . . tangible property which occurs during the policy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">III. <em>The Lawsuits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">A. <em>The Construction Defect Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">The evidence submitted in opposition to I.I.\u2019s summary judgment motion indicated the project may have begun suffering damages from defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>construction beginning in 1981 or early 1982, during I.I.\u2019s tenure as insurer. For example, demand letters from attorneys representing the project\u2019s homeowners association, Pines of La Jolla Homeowners Association (Pines), stated the project suffered from problems created by improperly installed light fixtures and lack of water. Repair records also showed that during I.I.\u2019s tenure the project suffered from problems created by water intrusion, defective plumbing, improperly sealed windows, and defective electric gates. Furthermore, depositions of three homeowners suggested that during I.I.\u2019s tenure they had discovered defects, such as crumbling concrete, cracked balconies, leaky walls, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In 1984 the homeowners association for the project, Pines, sued the insureds for a host of distinct construction defects in the project. None of the insurers conceded either coverage or a duty to defend the insureds for the claims asserted in the construction defect lawsuit. However, Fireman\u2019s Fund provided a defense to the insureds, eventually funding a settlement which extricated the insureds from the lawsuit. Although Fireman\u2019s Fund paid the costs of defense and settlement proceeds, it settled in order to \u201cstop the bleeding\u201d of the mounting defense costs spawned by this extremely complex litigation, not because it conceded the other insurers had no liability for the claims asserted in the construction defect lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Under the settlement agreement, Fireman\u2019s Fund paid $2.9 million to Pines. As additional consideration for Pines\u2019 agreement to release the insureds from the construction defect lawsuit, Fireman\u2019s Fund assigned to Pines any rights held by Fireman\u2019s Fund to seek contribution or indemnity from three of the other insurers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including I.I. Thus, the settlement contemplated that any additional recoupment by Pines for damages would have to be pursued through the \u201ccoverage litigation,\u201d i.e., Pines would have to seek recovery from the three other insurers (including I.I.) on Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s claims for contribution, indemnity or subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">B. <em>The Coverage Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In 1989, Fireman\u2019s Fund filed its lawsuit (the coverage lawsuit) for declaratory relief, equitable subrogation and contribution against West American Insurance Company, seeking reimbursement for a share of the amounts expended by Fireman\u2019s Fund to defend and settle the construction litigation. Pines later became involved in this coverage lawsuit by its cross-complaint, which alleged Pines\u2019 status as assignee of Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>rights, and which pleaded claims for declaratory relief, equitable subrogation and contribution as against I.I., seeking reimbursement of a share of the amounts Fireman\u2019s Fund paid to defend and settle the construction lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">C. <em>The Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The current appeal tests the validity of the trial court\u2019s order granting I.I.\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Pines in the coverage lawsuit. I.I.\u2019s motion depended entirely on the efficacy of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause of 1.1. \u2019s policy to insulate it from liability. I.I. argued that under the terms of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in the I.I. policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I.I. was solely an \u201cexcess carrier\u201d for any liability of its insureds because there was other \u201cavailable\u201d insurance\u2014the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy. I.I. therefore argued that, as an excess carrier, it was not required to defend or indemnify its insured unless and until all other \u201cavailable\u201d insurance had been exhausted, pointing out that, here, the policy limits of the other available insurance (Fireman\u2019s Fund) had not been exhausted by the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> pjnes opposed the summary judgment motion, arguing there were triable issues of fact as to whether some of the defects first became manifest during I.I.\u2019s policy period, and that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause does not become operative unless two policies apply to the same loss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pines pointed out that because the I.I. policy covered a time frame different from that covered by the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy, and there were manifestations of losses during I.I.\u2019s policy period, the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause did not permit 1.1. to avoid liability as an \u201cexcess carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The trial court accepted I.I.\u2019s argument, rejected Pines\u2019 argument, and granted I.I.\u2019s motion. Following entry of judgment, Pines appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We conclude the trial court erred in entering summary judgment based on the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause. The evidence created triable issues of fact as to when damages caused by different defects at the project first became manifest. The relevant policy language provided the insureds protection against liability for damages suffered during each policy period. Each insurer therefore was liable for all of the damages attributable to a defect first manifested during the period that insurer was \u201con risk.\u201d Hence, the existence of insurers in subsequent years does not render those later policies \u201cavailable\u201d to cover the previously manifested loss. Because the multiple policies here do not cover the same loss, the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause is irrelevant to assessing priorities among the competing insurers, and the fact of settlement (in the absence of a determination of coverage) does not make the settling insurer liable for losses which occurred on another insurer\u2019s watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">I. <em>The Insuring Language Contained in These Policies Provides That the Insurer on Risk at the Time the Particular Defect Was First Manifested Is Liable for All Damages Caused by the Defect, Even Though the Damages Grew During a Later Insurer\u2019s Policy Period</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">With the entry of summary judgment solely on the basis of I.I.\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, we must initially decide which policy or policies undertook the risk of insuring against liability for losses which first surfaced during I.I.\u2019s tenure. We begin by noting that Pines produced evidence showing that some of the claimed damages may have first \u201coccurred\u201d during I.I.\u2019s policy period. Both the policies of I.I. and Fireman\u2019s Fund appear to be standard liability policies indemnifying their insureds for liability based on \u201coccurrences\u201d during the policy period <em>(Chu </em>v. <em>Canadian Indemnity Co. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 86, 94-95 [274 Cal.Rptr. 20]); therefore at issue are the relative responsibilities of successive insurers for a loss which begins in one insurer\u2019s term and continues during a subsequent insurer\u2019s term.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The language of the liability policies here makes clear that the insurers only undertook the risk of injuries occurring darwg their respective policy period.  An injury does not necessarily occur when the wrongful act is committed, either for the purpose of accrual of the injured parties\u2019 cause of action <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>Sundean </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 216, 222 [186 Cal.Rptr. 863]) or for the purpose of determining whether the tortfeasor\u2019s liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>insurer must provide coverage for the injury. <em>(Remmer </em>v. <em>Glens Falls Indem. Co. </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 84, 88 [295 P.2d 19, 57 A.L.R.2d 1379].) Instead, an injury occurs when appreciable damage is suffered by the injured party. In <em>Remmer, </em>the court examined a third party liability policy containing language substantively indistinguishable from the insuring language of the instant policies. The <em>Remmer </em>court held that the \u201ctime of the occurrence of an accident within the meaning of an indemnity policy is . . .the time when the [third] party was actually damaged.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>accord, <em>Prudential-LMI Com. Insurance </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 674 [274 Cal.Rptr. 387, 798 P.2d 1230].)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Moreover, once the contingency insured against (i.e., the damage occurring during the policy period) has materialized, the courts have held that the insurer is liable for all losses connected therewith, even though the damage may continue to grow after the policy has lapsed. <em>(Snapp </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 827, 830-832 [24 Cal.Rptr. 44].) The courts have reasoned that once the loss has \u201coccurred,\u201d the insurer\u2019s contractual liability arises, the only issue then being the <em>extent </em>of its liability. It is immaterial that such liability is not fully ascertained until after the policy period. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Furthermore, since an insurer may only insure against contingent or unknown risks of loss, a policy issued after the \u201closs in progress\u201d has begun does not cover such loss. (See <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1621 [273 Cal.Rptr. 431]; accord, <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Landmark Ins. Co. </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1388, 1395-1396 [253 Cal.Rptr. 277].)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d 1621, this court was required to decide whether the \u201closs in progress\u201d rules of <em>Home Insurance </em>should be applied to third party liability insurance policies. The <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>court concluded the \u201coccurrence\u201d policies of the respective insurers (which contained insuring language similar to the instant policies) should be construed as placing the entire loss attributable to the \u201closs in progress\u201d on the insurer whose policy was in effect at the time the damage first became manifest. The <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>court reasoned, in part, that Insurance Code section 22, coupled with Insurance Code section 250, provides that an insurer can only insure against the risk of a contingent or unknown event materializing during the policy term, and hence a policy issued after the inception of a \u201closs in progress\u201d would not cover that loss because the fact of damage would not have been contingent or unknown when the policy was issued. <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>at p. 1627 and fn. 5.) <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>also noted the dispute in that case was over the relative apportionment of a loss between two insurers based on the language of their policies, and therefore the industry understanding of the intent of the language of an \u201coccurrence\u201d policy\u2014to anchor all losses in the one policy in effect at \u201cthe onset of the condition\u201d rather than to apportion them over several policies\u2014provided an additional basis to adopt the \u201closs in progress\u201d rule as to those policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The same considerations apply here. The insuring language is similar; the governing provisions of the Insurance Code apply; and this dispute involves interpreting and applying policy language to assign each of the two competing insurance policies its share of responsibility for a loss. We conclude, therefore, that the \u201closs in progress\u201d rules should be applied here, and hence any loss first manifested during I.I.\u2019s policy period would be I.I.\u2019s, and not Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s, responsibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">We conclude that to the extent damages were first manifested during I.I.\u2019s policy period, I.I.\u2019s policy language renders it liable for all damages attributable to the underlying defect manifested during such policy period. Even though the damage may have become progressively worse during Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s tenure, Fireman\u2019s Fund was not liable for the incremental damages from the loss in progress. Since there is evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude some part of the damages to the project was initially manifested during I.I.\u2019s policy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> there are triable issues of fact as to what part of Pines\u2019 damages was the responsibility of I.I. rather than Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>II. <em>Because 1.1. Is, and Fireman\u2019s Fund Is Not, Responsible for Losses Which First Manifested During 1.1. </em>'s <em>Policy Tenure, There Are Not Multiple Policies Applicable to the Same Loss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Once it is recognized that each category of damage remains the responsibility of the insurer on risk at the time such damage, was first manifested, it becomes apparent that the basis of the instant summary judgment\u2014the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause\u2014has no application in this case. This is because the policies issued by I.I. and Fireman\u2019s Fund were applicable to, and provided coverage for, occurrences during different time frames.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The determination of the effect competing \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses can have on each other\u2019s liability can present difficult and complex questions. (See, e.g., <em>Employers Reinsurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 545, 556-557 [230 Cal.Rptr. 792].)  We need not address such questions here, because the application of \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses requires, as a foundational element, that there exist multiple policies applicable to the <em>same loss. </em>A leading treatise, in the chapter which specifically addresses the right to contribution and indemnification among multiple insurers, explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201cAn insured may be covered by more than one policy. Of course, the rights and liabilities of the different insurers involved depend, at least in part, upon the specific language of the policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\"><em>\u201cOther insurance clauses do not, of course, create coverage where none exists. </em>The purpose, rather, of an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause is to limit a particular company\u2019s liability. Such a clause of an automobile policy does not provide for coverage but provides, instead, how multiple coverages should be prorated. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">\u201cWhere there are several policies which insure the same party, upon the same subject matter, and assume the same risk, this constitutes double, or overlapping, insurance. <em>This contemplates, of course, an identity of risk, so that if different risks are covered by the several policies, the question of allocation or contribution well might not arise.\u201d </em>(8A Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1981) Other Insurance\u2014Contribution and Indemnification, \u00a7 4907.65, pp. 364-368, fns. omitted, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Our review of the California authorities,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as those of other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> confirms that \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses have been found effective only in situations where multiple policies all covered the same loss or risk. Although I.I. cites numerous cases which have upheld and enforced \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in determining the rights among insurers inter se, those cases all involved factual patterns in which each of the competing policies covered the same risk.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">I.I. argues that other courts have used \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses to apportion primary versus excess responsibility even though the competing policies covered different time frames.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, the only case involving a dispute between insurers whose policies covered successive years is <em>Employers Reinsurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d 545. That case provides no support for I.I. because each of the policies there, although issued in successive years, covered the same loss.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 556.) Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>even though the policies were <em>issued </em>in different years, they all <em>covered </em>the same risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Unlike <em>Employers Reinsurance, </em>there is no contention here that the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy covers, on a \u201cclaims made\u201d or \u201csuit brought\u201d basis, liabilities for occurrences during I.I.\u2019s tenure. Instead, the policies appear to be standard \u201coccurrence\u201d policies, limited in application to risks during their tenures. Under these circumstances, we are compelled to conclude the policies of I.I. and Fireman\u2019s Fund do not apply to the same risks, and hence there is no occasion for allocating losses based on application of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">III. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s Payment of the Settlement on Behalf of the Insured Does Not Preclude Fireman\u2019s Fund From Seeking Contribution From I.I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">1.1. argues that an excess insurer, which status I.I. claims by virtue of its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, has no obligation to contribute to either the defense or the indemnification of its insured because the policy limits of the primary carrier (Fireman\u2019s Fund) were never exhausted. While this is a correct statement of abstract principles (see, e.g., <em>National American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 565, 576 [140 Cal.Rptr. 828]), it of course begs the question: Is I.I. a primary or an excess insurer for some portion of the claims satisfied by the settlement funded by Fireman\u2019s Fund?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">1.1. \u2019s principal argument supporting application of its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause is that the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy must be viewed as \u201cother insurance available to the Insured\u201d because Fireman\u2019s Fund (1) in fact provided a defense and funded the settlement and (2) never denied it was at least partly responsible for the claims raised in the construction defect litigation. Accordingly, I.I. concludes, the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy was \u201cavailable\u201d to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">In essence, I.I. argues that Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s settlement is an admission that Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s policy covered all of the claims, even those which may have been first manifested during an earlier insurer\u2019s tenure.  We reject I.I.\u2019s argument because an insurer who has <em>potential </em>liability in the underlying lawsuit is entitled to settle any claim alleged against it without prejudice to its right to seek equitable subrogation or indemnity from other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>insurers alleged to have full or partial liability for the underlying claim. <em>(State Farm &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Cooperative of American Physicians, Inc. </em>(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 199, 203-205 [209 Cal.Rptr. 251].) Where an insurer settles in good faith prior to a judicial determination of coverage, such insurer is not a mere volunteer and is entitled to pursue recovery (by way of claims for subrogation or indemnity) of amounts it paid which were in fact covered by the nonsettling insurer. <em>(United Pacific Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 925, 934-937 [266 Cal.Rptr. 231]; see also <em>Employers etc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pac. Indem. Co. </em>(1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 369, 376-378 [334 P.2d 658] [settling insurer entitled to recovery of payments on a claim for which it did not provide coverage, but for which the nonsettling insurer did.])</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">As previously discussed, the construction defect lawsuit alleged numerous distinct defects, each of which requires separate analysis as to when it first became manifest. <em>(Chu </em>v. <em>Canadian Indemnity Co., supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d 86.) While many of the problems and associated damages allegedly were first manifested during Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s policy period (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>the evidence created factual questions as to whether other problems and damages may have been first manifested during I.I.\u2019s policy period. Because Fireman\u2019s Fund paid a settlement encompassing <em>all </em>of these defects, a trier of fact could conclude it paid for damages which were at least in part the responsibility of I.I. Under such circumstances the paying insurer is entitled to seek subrogation or indemnity to the extent it paid an obligation owed by another insurer. (See, e.g., <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 694 [163 Cal.Rptr. 219] [affirmed declaratory relief judgment entitling automobile insurers to recoup settlement payments made to an injured party from homeowners insurer which provided exclusive coverage for the loss].)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Fireman\u2019s Fund settled a lawsuit involving claims for which it was potentially liable. However, there was no judicial determination of coverage, and Fireman\u2019s Fund settled without conceding coverage for the entire gamut of losses alleged in the construction defect lawsuit. The settlement was not a binding concession by Fireman\u2019s Fund that <em>all </em>of the settlement proceeds were attributable to <em>all </em>damages covered under its policy, and did not preclude the settling insurer from contending the settlement proceeds encompassed elements of loss which I.I.\u2019s policy covered. In that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause is of no application in assigning priorities to the policies under the facts of this case, the settling insurer\u2019s right to subrogation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>indemnity remains disputable. Since complex factual questions remain, we deem summary judgment to have been improper and therefore must reverse. Appellant is entitled to costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Todd, Acting P. J., and Huffman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Pines was assigned Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s right to contribution as against I.I., State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Company, and Allianz Insurance Company. However, Fireman\u2019s Fund retained its right to seek indemnity as against West American Insurance Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, contained in an endorsement to I.I.\u2019s policy, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">\u201cThe insurance afforded by this policy is excess insurance over any other insurance available to the Insured . . . and the insurance afforded by this policy shall not be collectible by the Insured or any other person until the policy limits of all other insurance . . . shall be paid and exhausted.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Pines also asserted below, and argues on appeal, that evidentiary problems also prohibit summary judgment. First, Pines objected to I.I.\u2019s failure to produce the <em>original </em>of the insurance policy in support of its summary judgment motion. Pines claimed that the \u201cbest evidence\" rule required use of the original insurance policy and precluded the rendition of a summary judgment based upon only a copy. While this holding was enunciated by <em>Central Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Del Mar Beach Club Owners Assn. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 916 [176 Cal.Rptr. 895] [copy of insurance policy violates best evidence rule and precludes summary judgment], that decision was rendered before the addition in 1985 of Evidence Code section 1511 (see Stats. 1985, ch. 100, \u00a7 2, p. 237), which carved a specific exception to the best evidence rule for copies. Since neither caveat to section 1511\u2019s exception appears even arguably applicable, the copy of the policy here does not violate the best evidence rule. Pines also complains that the copy of the endorsement, although providing a space for the insurer\u2019s signature, was not signed. However, the document itself explains such signature is <em>unnecessary </em>when the endorsement is issued as part of the original policy, and the declarations page of I.I.\u2019s policy reflects the endorsement <em>wets </em>part of the original policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Cases addressing first party insurance policies have grappled with the problems presented when an ongoing, progressive condition causes damages which span the tenures of various insurance policies. These cases have arrived at the same conclusion reached here: the insurer \u201con risk\u201d at the time the damage first becomes manifest is liable for the <em>entire </em>injury, even though the <em>extent </em>of that injury may be unknown until long after the policy of the first insurer has lapsed. <em>(Home Ins.

However, because a project suffering from multiple defects requires that each defect be analyzed separately to determine when it was first manifested, and there was evidence suggesting at least some of the defects may have been manifested earlier than 1983, it remains a factual question as to when each injury was first manifested. <em>(Chu </em>v. <em>Canadian Indemnity Co., supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at pp. 97-102.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">See, e.g., <em>Employers Reinsurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins.
