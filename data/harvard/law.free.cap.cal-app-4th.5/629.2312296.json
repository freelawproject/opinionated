J.</author>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Statement of the Case and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Plaintiff Gayle D. Nosbisch (Wife) and defendant Joel R. Nosbisch (Husband) were married in Illinois. Their two children were born in Illinois and their marriage was dissolved in Illinois in 1982. The judgment of dissolution granted Wife physical custody of the children and ordered Husband to pay $425 per month as child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">On July 22, 1985, Husband and Wife entered into a stipulation which provided, in part, \u201cThe parties mutually consent and agree that [Wife] as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>custodial parent, be allowed to remove said children from the State of Illinois to the State of Texas where the custodial parent plans to establish her residence.\u201d Wife thereafter moved to Texas with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In July 1989, Wife filed a motion in a Texas court to modify the Illinois orders regarding Husband\u2019s child support obligations. Husband, who by this time resided in Merced County, California, was served with notice of this motion but did not respond. The Texas District Court found it had jurisdiction over the parties and modified the Illinois orders, including increasing Husband\u2019s child support obligation to $724 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Wife registered this Texas order with the Merced County Superior Court under the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act of 1968 (RURESA). (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1650 et seq.) Husband moved to vacate this registration on the ground that the Texas court did not have personal jurisdiction over him. Husband\u2019s only connection with Texas is that his two children live there. The trial court denied Husband\u2019s motion, finding Texas had jurisdiction based on Texas Family Code Annoted section 11.051 (Vernon 1986). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u201cIn a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, the court may exercise status or subject matter jurisdiction over the suit as provided by Subchapter B of this chapter. The court may also exercise personal jurisdiction over a person on whom service of citation is required, . . . although the person is not a resident or domiciliary of this state, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\u201c(1) the child was conceived in this state when at least one biological parent was a resident of this state and the person on whom service is required is a parent or an alleged or probable father of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">\u201c(2) the child resides in this state as a result of the acts or directives or with the approval of the person on whom service is required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">\u201c(3) the person on whom service is required has resided with the child in this state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">\u201c(4) there is any basis consistent with the constitutions of this state and the United States for the exercise of the personal jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">\n<em>The Texas court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over Husband was not consistent with the due process clause.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">The purpose of the RURESA registration procedure is to provide a more efficient method of enforcing foreign support orders. <em>(In re Marriage of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>Aron </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1086, 1090 [274 Cal.Rptr. 357].) After receiving notice of registration of the order, the obligor, here Husband, has 20 days to petition to vacate the registration. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1699, subd. (b).) Thus, the validity of the foreign order is open for adversarial dispute at this stage. Grounds for cancellation of the registration include jurisdictional or due process defects. <em>(In re Marriage of Aron, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 1092.)  \u201c \u2018Collateral attack is proper to contest lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction or the granting of relief which the court has <em>no power </em>to grant ....\u2019\u201d <em>(McCallum </em>v. <em>McCallum </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 308, 314 [235 Cal.Rptr. 396].</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">A valid judgment imposing a personal obligation or duty on a person may be entered only by a court having jurisdiction over that person. <em>(Kulko </em>v. <em>California Superior Court </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 84, 91 [56 L.Ed.2d 132, 140, 98 S.Ct. 1690].) The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits such jurisdiction over nonresidents. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under this constitutional standard, a state may not exercise in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident, nondomiciliary obligor to modify child support obligations unless jurisdiction is established through sufficient minimum contacts within the state. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 92 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 141]; <em>Gingold </em>v. <em>Gingold </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 1177, 1182 [208 Cal.Rptr. 123].) The \u201cminimum contacts\u201d test requires \u2018that a defendant \u2018have certain minimum contacts with [the forum State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] While the interests of the forum State and of the plaintiff in proceeding with the cause in the plaintiff\u2019s forum of choice are, of course, to be considered, [citation], an essential criterion in all cases is whether the \u2018quality and nature\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s activity is such that it is \u2018reasonable\u2019 and \u2018fair\u2019 to require him to conduct his defense in that State.\u201d <em>(Kulko </em>v. <em>California Superior Court, supra, </em>436 U.S. 84, 92 [56 L.Ed.2d 132, 141], quoting <em>Internal Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316 [90 L.Ed. 95, 101-102, 66 S.Ct. 154, 161 A.L.R. 1057].)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The facts of this case are almost identical to those considered by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kulko </em>v. <em>California Superior Court, supra, </em>436 U.S. 84. In <em>Kulko, </em>both parties were domiciled in and residents of New York at the time of their marriage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 86 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 138].) The Kulkos\u2019 two children were bom in New York and the Kulkos resided together in New York as a family until they separated. Following the separation, wife moved to California. A written separation agreement was drawn up in New York and wife flew to New York to sign it. The agreement provided that the children would remain with their father during the school year but spend vacations with their-mother. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 87 [56 L.Ed.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>p. 138].) However, a year after the divorce, the daughter asked her father if she could live with her mother. Husband acquiesced and purchased a one-way plane ticket to California for his daughter. Two years later, the son also moved to California. Wife then commenced an action against husband in California to modify the divorce judgment so as to award her full custody of the children and increase husband\u2019s child support obligations. Husband contested California\u2019s jurisdiction over him with respect to the claim for increased support. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 88 [56 L.Ed.2d at pp. 138-139].)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The California courts upheld jurisdiction over husband based on husband\u2019s \u201c \u2018purposeful act\u2019 \u201d of \u201c \u2018actively and fully consenting] to [his daughter] living in California for the school year . . . and . . . sending] her to California for that purpose,\u2019 \u201d i.e., husband had \u201c \u2018purposely availed himself of the benefits and protections of the laws of California.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kulko </em>v. <em>California Superior Court, supra, </em>436 U.S. 84, 89, 94 [56 L.Ed.2d 132, 139, 142.) The United States Supreme Court rejected this reasoning. \u201cA father who agrees, in the interests of family harmony and his children\u2019s preferences, to allow them to spend more time in California than was required under a separation agreement can hardly be said to have \u2018purposefully availed himself\u2019 of the \u2018benefits and protections\u2019 of California\u2019s laws.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 94 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 143].) Concluding that husband did not purposefully derive benefit from any activities relating to California, the Supreme Court held California\u2019s assertion of personal jurisdiction was unreasonable. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 96 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 144].)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Similarly, here, by agreeing that Wife could move with the children to Texas, it cannot be said that Husband purposefully derived any benefit from any activities relating to Texas. The fact that his children live in Texas is Husband\u2019s only contact with the state. These circumstances do not meet the due process requirement of \u201cminimum contacts\u201d for personal jurisdiction in the family law context. <em>(Kulko </em>v. <em>California Superior Court, supra, </em>436 U.S. 84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Wife relies on the Texas statute which purports to confer jurisdiction over a nonresident obligor when the child resides in Texas \u201cas a result of the acts or directives or with the approval\u201d of the obligor. (Tex. Fam. Code Ann. (Vernon 1986) \u00a7 11.051(2).) Wife also points to the <em>Kulko </em>court\u2019s statement \u201cAnd California has not attempted to assert any particularized interest in trying such cases in its courts by, e.g., enacting a special jurisdictional statute.\u201d (436 U.S. at p. 98 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 145].) Both now and at the time <em>Kulko </em>was decided, California exercised personal jurisdiction \u201con any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 410.10.) However, merely by enacting a statute, Texas cannot confer jurisdiction where such jurisdiction does not meet the standard compelled by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The <em>Kulko </em>court\u2019s general statement quoted above does not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Wife states the \u201cTexas appellate courts have found that the <em>Kulko </em>decision does not apply due to this jurisdictional statute,\u201d citing <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Boutwell </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1980) 601 S.W.2d 393. However, in <em>Oliver, </em>the parties were married in Texas, their child was born in Texas, and the divorce granted in Texas. After the wife and child moved out of state, the husband filed a motion in Texas to modify his visitation rights. Thus, the Texas court was considering different subdivisions of Texas Family Code section 11.051. Further, the court did not hold that the statute in and of itself complied with due process requirements. Rather, the court concluded that the wife\u2019s contacts with Texas \u201care sufficient so that an exercise of personal jurisdiction over [wife] under \u00a7 11.051 does not offend due process.\u201d (601 S.W.2d at p. 396.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Wife also contends California must honor the Texas judgment under the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution. She argues that because Texas found it had jurisdiction over Husband, that finding must be upheld. However, the full faith and credit clause makes only the <em>valid </em>in personam judgment of one state enforceable in all states. <em>(Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 186, 210 [53 L.Ed. 2d 683, 702, 97 S.Ct. 2569].) Thus, the state court must have jurisdiction over the parties before the judgment will be enforced.  The issue of jurisdiction was not fully litigated in Texas. The Texas court\u2019s recital in its order that it had jurisdiction over Husband does not make that recited statement law. \u201c[J]ust because a court includes a jurisdictional recital in its order does not make the recited statement law. Courts have jurisdiction only to the extent provided by law. One court cannot wrest jurisdiction from another court simply by so saying.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Aron, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d 1086, 1093.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In sum, Husband did not have sufficient contacts with Texas to enable Texas to assert personal jurisdiction over him. Consequently, the Texas order is invalid and is not entitled to full faith and credit in California. Husband\u2019s objection to the Texas order on jurisdictional grounds was properly made in the Merced County Superior Court. Thus, the Merced County Superior Court should have vacated the registration of the Texas order.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The judgment is reversed and the superior court is directed to enter its order vacating the registration of the Texas child support order. Appellant to have his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Stone (W. A.), J., and Thaxter, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
