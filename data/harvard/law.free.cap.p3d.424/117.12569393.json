While he admitted to the killing, he sought to reduce the conviction from murder to manslaughter by establishing special mitigation through extreme emotional distress. At trial the jury convicted him of murder, rejecting his arguments for special mitigation. Mr. Lambdin appealed his conviction of murder to the court of appeals, arguing that the district court's jury instructions concerning extreme emotional distress were in error. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction. We granted certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision, and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 Mr. Lambdin married the victim in 2000. Throughout the marriage, the victim had a drinking and gambling problem, which caused distress to Mr. Lambdin. In June 2009, she asked Mr. Lambdin for a divorce. Later, Mr. Lambdin found romantic messages on the victim's cell phone from another man, and around the same time, the victim informed Mr. Lambdin that she was pregnant with another man's child. Mr. Lambdin told a co-worker of his wife's infidelity and his distress, and the co-worker requested that the police conduct a welfare check at Mr. Lambdin's home because she was concerned for his safety. The police visited Mr. Lambdin and found that he had a very calm demeanor despite having just discussed the pregnancy with the victim. He told police that the affair \"doesn't really matter. It's over. I'm past it now. It is time to move on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 The couple continued to discuss divorce off and on for roughly two months, with Mr. Lambdin trying to convince the victim to stay in the marriage. On the evening of August 16, 2009, Mr. Lambdin and the victim again argued over whether they should divorce. After the argument, Mr. Lambdin made the victim coffee, and she then left their home to work a night shift at her job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 Mr. Lambdin stayed up most of the night. Around midnight, Mr. Lambdin wrote two letters. The first letter, written in the past tense, explained that he had killed the victim and committed suicide. This letter also gave explanations for why he planned to do it, including the statement that, \"she deserves what she got and I won't be around to suffer anymore.\" The second letter, apparently written to a neighbor, said \"I couldn't take this shit any longer. I had to do this and I'm glad I did. It serves her right for all she has done to me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Mr. Lambdin printed a copy of these two letters and left them on his computer desk. About seven hours after the letters were written, the victim came home from work. Mr. Lambdin met her in the kitchen and began discussing divorce again. He said, \"do we really have to go through all of this stuff\" and \"lose everything that we got.\" The victim responded by telling him \"you're crazy,\" and that he needed to move out. At this point, Mr. Lambdin told police that he \"just lost it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained to the police that, \"[a]ll I wanted was some resolve with her, to get back what I've given her for the last 9 \u00bd years. The love and the affection. And she just talked to me like I was a stranger. A piece of shit. Insults me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 Mr. Lambdin punched the victim \"about four or five times,\" and then threw her to the floor. Then he grabbed the biggest kitchen knife he could find and began stabbing her. After he stabbed her the first time, the victim screamed, \"okay!\" But Mr. Lambdin responded \"it's too late,\" and you \"get what you deserve.\" He continued to stab the victim at least fifteen times in the back and neck while she was screaming. After repeatedly stabbing the victim, he noticed that she was still moving. Mr. Lambdin told police that he \"didn't want to stab her anymore\" and that he \"didn't want her to suffer.\" So, Mr. Lambdin grabbed a \"big decorated ball\" and \"smashed her in the back of the head\n   with it three times,\" until she stopped moving. The victim died in the attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 According to Mr. Lambdin's statement to the police, he went out onto his deck and smoked a cigarette after killing the victim. He then went to Home Depot to buy some rope with which to hang himself. He came home and tied the rope to an attic beam and began drinking heavily \"to get the balls to\" commit suicide. While drinking, he messaged a friend telling her what he had done. The friend called the police, who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 During the attack, Mr. Lambdin had cut his hand on the kitchen knife, and EMTs transported him to a hospital for treatment. On the way to the hospital, Mr. Lambdin informed the EMTs that \"he had stabbed his wife\" and \"that when she continued to move he grabbed a glass globe and bashed her head.\" He told the EMTs multiple times that \"the bitch got what she deserved.\" Mr. Lambdin continued to make similar comments to hospital staff. He made the comment that \"he couldn't take it anymore,\" and that he had killed his wife. When asked how he had cut his hand, he \"just laughed about it and said, 'I killed that woman. I stabbed her. She got what she deserved.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The police officer who responded to the incident testified that, immediately after he arrived on the scene, during the ambulance ride, and at the hospital, Mr. Lambdin displayed a wide spectrum of emotions, from laughing about the attack and seeming very excited to becoming very angry. The officer testified that Mr. Lambdin seemed to have an, \"oh, my gosh ... what did I just do,\" attitude, but that he did not cry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 The State charged Mr. Lambdin with murder. Mr. Lambdin sought to reduce the level of his offense to manslaughter by proving special mitigation by extreme emotional distress. The district court proposed its own jury instructions; Mr. Lambdin objected to the instructions concerning special mitigation, but the court overruled his objections. The jury convicted Mr. Lambdin of murder, unanimously finding that he had failed to establish special mitigation by extreme emotional distress. Mr. Lambdin appealed, and the court of appeals affirmed the district court's jury instructions. We granted certiorari to review the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 \"On certiorari, we review the decision of the court of appeals for correctness, without deference to its conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Special mitigation allows a defendant charged with criminal homicide to reduce the level of the offense. UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-5-205.5(5). Extreme emotional distress is one category of special mitigation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 76-5-205.5(1)(b). If a jury \"finds the elements [of murder] are proven beyond a reasonable doubt\" by the State, and the jury unanimously finds the elements of extreme emotional distress are \"established by a preponderance of the evidence\" by the defendant, the jury must reduce the verdict from murder to manslaughter.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 76-5-205.5(5)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 Extreme emotional distress is established by proving 1) the defendant \"cause[d] the death of another,\" 2) \"under the influence of extreme emotional distress,\" 3) \"for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979864\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/299/892/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-205.5(1). The statute provides further guidance on the second and third elements.

Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10399378\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/753/439/\">\n    753 P.2d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1988),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He next argues that this court's precedent, and the court of appeals in this case, was incorrect in holding that special mitigation by extreme emotional distress requires a jury to look at \"the reasonableness of the [defendant's] loss of [self-]control.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, we stated that a person suffers from extreme emotional distress:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) when he has no mental illness as defined in section 76-2-305 (insanity or diminished capacity); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) when he is\n   <em>\n    exposed\n   </em>\n   to extremely unusual and overwhelming stress; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) when the average reasonable person under that stress would have an extreme emotional reaction to it, as a result of which he would experience a loss of self-control and that person's reason would be overborne by intense feelings, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation, or other similar emotions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 471.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 Mr. Lambdin argues that Utah Code section 76-5-205.5\"sets forth all the elements jurors need to know to understand and apply the law,\" and therefore \"there is no need for a court to define [extreme emotional distress] beyond\" what is listed in the statute. He argues that we should abandon our definition of extreme emotional distress because the term has an ordinary, non-technical meaning accessible to jurors, and because our definition of that term in\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   is \"pure dicta.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17 Mr. Lambdin cites\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mr. Lambdin argues that extreme emotional distress has an ordinary, dictionary meaning, and therefore we should not have defined it in\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   because our definition could be used at some future point by a district court in its jury instructions.

Thus, the dictionary meaning of extreme emotional distress is a reaction in which the subject experiences very severe pain or suffering accompanied by strong feelings, such as anger, that is usually directed toward a specific person and typically accompanied by behavioral changes, such as a loss of self-control. This closely tracks our definition in\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, the broad language in the ordinary meaning\n   must be put into the context of the special mitigation statute that allows a criminal defendant to be convicted of the lesser crime of manslaughter.

EXTREME EMOTIONAL DISTRESS REQUIRES A SHOWING THAT A REASONABLE PERSON WOULD LOSE SELF-CONTROL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 25 Mr. Lambdin argues that even if we maintain\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   's definition of extreme emotional distress, our opinion in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   impermissibly extended\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   's definition by requiring defendants to prove that their loss of self-control was reasonable.

Mr. Lambdin argues that this framing of\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   's definition \"omits the critical step of an extreme reaction, 'as a result of which he would experience a loss of self-control.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 26\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   's formulation is not an extension of\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   at all. It merely restates what was already required under\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   requires defendants to prove that they were \"\n   <em>\n    exposed\n   </em>\n   to extremely unusual and overwhelming stress,\" and that \"the\n   <em>\n    average reasonable person\n   </em>\n   under that stress would have an extreme emotional reaction to it, as a result of which\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   would experience a loss of self-control and\n   <em>\n    that person's reason\n   </em>\n   would be overborne by intense feelings.\"\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10399378\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/753/439/\">\n    753 P.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (all but first emphasis added). When we say, \"he,\" and, \"that person[ ],\" we are discussing the average reasonable person referred to earlier. Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   , the defendant must prove that the average reasonable person \"would experience a loss of self-control,\" because the average reasonable person's \"reason would be overborne by intense feelings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 27 Additionally, while we appreciate Mr. Lambdin's detailed argument, we cannot see a difference between establishing that a reasonable person would have an extreme emotional reaction to stress that causes a loss of self-control, and establishing that the same reasonable person would lose self-control due to the overwhelming stress and the extreme emotional reaction. If a reasonable person would lose self-control because of the then-existing circumstances, it necessarily follows that the defendant's loss of self-control must be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 28 This is confirmed by the purpose behind special mitigation by extreme emotional distress. Since Utah's special mitigation by extreme emotional distress statute \"was modeled after section 210.3 of the Model Penal Code, the American Law Institute's Commentaries ... provide insight into the meaning of section 76-5-205 in 1973.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10399378\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/753/439/\">\n    753 P.2d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The comments provide that, \"[i]n the end, the question [of extreme emotional distress] is whether the actor's loss of self-control can be understood in terms that arouse sympathy in the ordinary citizen.\" MODEL PENAL CODE \u00a7 210.3 cmt. (5)(a) at 63 ( AM. LAW INST. , Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980). This implies that reasonable jurors could picture themselves, or the hypothetical reasonable person, losing self-control under the then-existing circumstances and doing something they wouldn't normally do when they are thinking and acting rationally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 29 Even defense counsel at trial acknowledged this purpose. During closing arguments, she stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   when people are highly emotional or agitated they can lose control and they can do things that they normally wouldn't do, things that they wouldn't do when they are in full possession of themselves. And, really, that's what this case is about, isn't it, ... things can happen when people are overwhelmed by emotion or agitation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defense counsel essentially argues that, under the then-existing circumstances, the average reasonable person's self-control would be overcome by feelings such as anger, distress, or excessive agitation and that once the reasonable person loses self-control, they could do something they wouldn't normally do-like kill their spouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 30 Additionally, as defense counsel's argument shows, the extreme emotional reaction and the loss of self-control are so intertwined that it is nearly impossible to separate the two. While we have held that the external triggering event and the extreme emotional reaction do not need to be contemporaneous,\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989032\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/251/820/\">\n    2011 UT 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989032\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/251/820/\">\n    251 P.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the extreme emotional reaction and the loss of self-control must be contemporaneous. Indeed, if the loss of self-control does not occur while the defendant is experiencing the extreme emotional reaction, then the loss of self-control is not caused by the extreme emotional reaction and special mitigation is not appropriate. Requiring a lay jury to untangle this will only lead to confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 31 Mr. Lambdin also argues that requiring a defendant to prove his loss of self-control was reasonable impermissibly adds another element to extreme emotional distress. He argues that courts are \"not to infer substantive terms into the text\" of a statute,\n   <em>\n    Berrett v. Purser &amp; Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10350644\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/876/367/#p370\">\n    876 P.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370 (Utah 1994), and that \"courts may not denounce and punish as crimes acts and omissions not made punishable by statute, for it is a legislative power to declare acts as crimes,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, as discussed above, this court has the authority to interpret the law and to determine what the legislature meant when it used specific terms.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b617-19. There is a difference between interpreting a statute and adding terms to a statute.

Thus, we are not adding terms to the statute; we are merely interpreting what the legislature intended, and saying what the law as enacted by the legislature is.

The defendant must have a reasonable explanation or excuse for the extreme emotional distress, and the loss of self-control is included in the definition of extreme emotional distress. Thus, the loss of self-control must be measured from an objective, reasonable-person standard.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b615.

We decline the State's invitation. While the State raises significant policy considerations, such an interpretation does not comport with the plain language of the statute. The statute requires a reasonable explanation or excuse only for the extreme emotional distress, not for any subsequent action taken by the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-5-205.5. While a loss of self-control is included in the definition of extreme emotional distress, it is too much of a stretch to include \"killing\" in that definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 35 Additionally, it is hard to imagine that the average reasonable person would ever kill someone, except in limited circumstances such as self-defense or war. Indeed, once the average reasonable person in the then-existing circumstances loses self-control, the person no longer acts reasonably. The reasonable person becomes the unreasonable or irrational person because \"that person's reason [is] overborne by intense feelings, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation, or other similar emotions.\"\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10399378\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/753/439/\">\n    753 P.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once the average reasonable person loses self-control, there could be a wide range of actions that the now unreasonable person might take, but the fact finder is not directed by the statute to evaluate the reasonableness of the action ultimately taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 36 That being said, there is no binary, on-off switch for self-control. In general, a person does not have complete self-control until he reaches a certain level of stress and emotion, and then loses it entirely. Rather, the average person's ability to exercise self-control is measured along a scale. \"The phrase 'loss of self-control'.... is misleading,\" because extreme emotional distress \"interferes with, but does not completely destroy, an actor's capacity to control conduct.\" Mitchell N.

For instance, the average reasonable person's self-control may be impaired to the point where he might be expected to scream an obscenity at another driver during rush hour, but the average reasonable person's self-control in that situation would not be so degraded as to cause him to assault or kill the other driver absent some \"extremely unusual and overwhelming\n   stress,\" that is not typically found in rush hour traffic.\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10399378\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/753/439/\">\n    753 P.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 37 The amount of self-control a person exercises is tied to a variety of factors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the legislature has allowed fact finders to consider only the amount and type of stress the defendant was faced with and the \"building emotional reaction\" that the average reasonable person would experience in light of that stress.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989032\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/251/820/\">\n    2011 UT 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989032\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/251/820/\">\n    251 P.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The statute does not mitigate assault or any other criminal activity. Additionally, the statute requires the defendant to establish that a reasonable person would suffer from\n   <em>\n    extreme\n   </em>\n   emotional distress. The fact that the defendant must establish\n   <em>\n    extreme\n   </em>\n   emotional distress in the context of murder indicates a legislative intent that it must be shown that the average reasonable person would experience an overwhelming and substantial loss of self-control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 39 The purpose behind special mitigation by extreme emotional distress confirms this holding. As we stated in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , most \"intentional homicides ... [are] the result of strong emotions and stresses. Consequently, a distinction must be drawn so that this defense will only be applicable to those homicides which appropriately qualify under the underlying purpose of this mitigating defense.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989032\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/251/820/\">\n    2011 UT 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989032\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/251/820/\">\n    251 P.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Special mitigation by extreme emotional distress is an \" 'indulgence of the frailty of human nature,' recognizing that the [stress and emotions] in some cases may be so great as to warrant a penalty less than that prescribed for murder.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8864357\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/28/279/\">\n    28 Utah 2d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8864357\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/28/279/\">\n    501 P.2d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635 (1972) (citations omitted). But this legislative indulgence goes only so far. It has not been extended to reduce murder to manslaughter simply because the average reasonable person might experience stress and anger in the circumstances, and consequently a heightened impairment to his decision making process and self-control. Rather, a reasonable person's self-control and ability to make a rational choice must be overwhelmingly and substantially undermined.

Mr. Lambdin concedes that the first half of jury instruction 19 is an accurate depiction of the law. He argues that the emphasized portion of this instruction could confuse a jury into thinking that the reaction that must be reasonable is the act of killing itself, rather than the emotional reaction or the loss of self-control. While the instruction does not explicitly state that the reaction referred to is the emotional reaction and loss of self-control, only emotional reactions and loss of self-control are referenced in the entire paragraph in question. The dissent attempts to read not merely this instruction, but rather one sentence of this instruction in isolation. The sentence referencing the defendant's \"reaction\" is clearly tied to the preceding sentence, which discusses the defendant's loss of self-control in the face of \"unusual and overwhelming stress.\" Thus, the meaning of \"reaction\" in the penultimate sentence seems quite clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 45 Additionally, the \"reaction\" meant by instruction 19 was clarified by instruction 21, which provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   In examining the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse offered by the defendant you should consider all the then-existing circumstances. \"Then-existing circumstances\" include more than just the triggering event. The phrase refers to the broader context of past experiences and emotions that give\n   <em>\n    meaning to the defendant's reaction\n   </em>\n   , that is to say, to\n   <em>\n    the defendant's loss of self control\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (Emphasis added). As the emphasized portion of this instruction clarifies, the reaction\n   that the jury must conclude was reasonable, given the then-existing circumstances, is the loss of self-control, not the killing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 46 The dissent does not agree that instruction 21 clarifies the reaction referenced in instruction 19. They reason that instruction 19 is ambiguous as to what \"reaction\" it is referencing, saying that \"it is certainly possible, and perhaps even likely, that a juror would understand\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   to mean not the loss of self-control, but the killing itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b659. While instruction 19 does not specifically mention that the reaction is the loss of self-control, it also does not specifically state that the reaction is the killing. Even if the dissent is correct and instruction 19 is ambiguous, something more than a possibility that a jury could be confused by an instruction is required to grant a new trial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

If pointing to an ambiguity in an individual instruction were enough, almost no set of instructions would survive. Individual instructions must be viewed along a spectrum. When an instruction completely misstates a legal standard, there is little chance that other instructions, read as a whole, will remedy the juror confusion that is likely to ensue. That did not happen here. Instruction 19 simply left out a specific reference to the \"reaction\" it was referencing. When an instruction is simply ambiguous, other instructions may have a greater impact on the jury's understanding. Instruction 21 more than adequately addresses any juror confusion that could have arisen under instruction 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unless the instructions, read as a whole, create a reasonable likelihood that the jurors were misled or confused as to the correct legal standard, a new trial is not appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in instruction 19, when read in conjunction with instruction 21, creates such a reasonable likelihood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 48 Additionally, defense counsel's closing argument clarified this for the jury. Defense counsel stated that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [The instructions are] instructing you [the jury] to look toward the meaning and the reasons for the defendant's loss of self-contr\n   ol, and to assess the reasonableness of that, the loss of self-control, and not the killing. [The instructions are] not asking you to find that a reasonable person would absolutely have committed this killing, but that a reasonable person would have experienced a loss of self-control. And some people would do different things when they lose self-control.... So what you are looking to is the defendant's loss of self-control and the explanation for that and the reasonableness of that, and not trying to get to the point of saying, oh, yes, a killing is reasonable, because, of course, a killing is never reasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The language of the instruction and of defense counsel's arguments make it abundantly clear that the loss of self-control is what must be reasonable, not the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 49 We note that the distinction between a reasonable loss of self-control and a reasonable murder is not easily made. In this case, the district court rejected defendant's proposed jury instruction that made it clear that the killing need not be reasonable. While the jury instructions adopted by the district court here were legally sufficient, we note that defendant's proposed instruction was also proper and the best practice would be to provide explicit instructions to juries to inform them of this nuanced distinction. We provide the following language as an example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The defendant needs to prove only that an average reasonable person would have an extreme emotional reaction to the stress and that the same average reasonable person would experience an overwhelming and substantial loss of self-control in light of the stress and the emotional reaction. The defendant does not need to prove that the killing was reasonable because once a reasonable person has lost self-control, he is no longer acting reasonably.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 50 While we provide this language as an example, we note that jury instructions cannot be viewed in isolation.

In this case, the defendant asserts that Special Mitigation exists because he caused the death of another under the influence of extreme emotional distress for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   A person acts under the influence of extreme emotional distress when he is exposed to extremely unusual and overwhelming stress that would cause the average reasonable person in similar circumstances to experience a loss of self-control and be overborne by intense feelings such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation, or other like emotions. The standard is not whether the defendant subjectively thought\n   <em>\n    his reaction\n   </em>\n   was reasonable. Rather, it is an objective standard, determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person faced with the then-existing circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The first paragraph of instruction 19 accurately depicts the law. It tracks the special mitigation statute, which provides that in order for special mitigation to apply, the actor must \"cause[ ] the death of another ... under the influence of extreme emotional distress for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 58 The second paragraph also begins with an accurate statement of the law, employing the definition of extreme emotion distress this court adopted in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bishop\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the final two sentences introduce a significant ambiguity. After setting forth our\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   definition (\"[a] person acts under the influence of extreme emotional distress when he is exposed to extremely unusual and overwhelming stress that would cause the average reasonable person in similar circumstances to experience a loss of self-control and be overborne by intense feelings\"), the instruction goes on to state that \"[t]he standard is not whether the defendant subjectively thought\n   <em>\n    his reaction was reasonable.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Rather, it is an objective standard, determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person faced with the then-existing circumstances.\" (Emphasis added). The jury is left to answer the question of what the relevant reaction was. Because this instruction did not fully and clearly define what is meant by\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   , the jury could conclude that the reaction was not the loss of self-control, but the act of killing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 59 The majority reasons that although \"the instruction does not explicitly state that the reaction referred to is the emotional reaction and loss of self-control,\" the meaning of\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   \"seems quite clear\" because \"only emotional reactions and loss of self-control are referenced in the entire paragraph in question.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the meaning of\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   is anything but clear. In fact, the \"usual and ordinary meanings\" of\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   -which the jury was instructed to employ\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   -include \"a response to some treatment, situation, or stimulus\" and a \"bodily response to or activity aroused by stimulus.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   So it is certainly possible, and perhaps even likely, that a juror would understand\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   to mean not the loss of self-control, but the killing itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 60 This ambiguity is accentuated by its placement relative to the definition of extreme emotional distress. The majority states that \"[t]he sentence referencing the defendant's 'reaction' is clearly tied to the preceding sentence,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   but there is no transition or other language that clearly ties these sentences together. There is no reference in either sentence that would indicate that\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   is the defendant's loss of self-control. The reference to\n   <em>\n    his reaction\n   </em>\n   follows the definition of extreme emotional distress. The progression of the events listed in the paragraph-from extreme emotional distress to the loss of self-control to the reaction-suggests that the\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   referred to is the culmination of that sequence of events, which was the murder. So a juror could easily interpret\n   <em>\n    his reaction\n   </em>\n   to refer to the defendant's reaction to the extreme emotional distress-specifically, the act of killing his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 61 The majority argues that instruction 19 is not ambiguous, but it still attempts to shore up the meaning of\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   by pointing to another jury instruction, instruction 21, and to defense counsel's closing argument. Neither instruction 21 nor the closing arguments was sufficient to cure instruction 19's ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 62 Jury instruction 21 explained, \"In examining the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse offered by the defendant you should consider all the then-existing circumstances. 'Then-existing circumstances' include more than just the triggering event. The phrase refers to the broader context of past experiences and emotions that give meaning to the defendant's reaction, that is to say, to the defendant's loss of self-control.\" The majority concludes that \"this instruction clarifies\" that \"the reaction that the jury must conclude was reasonable ... is the loss of self-control, not the killing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But instruction 21 is explicitly addressed to \"the reasonableness of the\n   <em>\n    explanation or excuse\n   </em>\n   ,\" not the reasonableness of the\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   . (Emphasis added). So the jurors were left on their own to connect the reaction in instruction 21 with the reaction in instruction 19. Moreover, there is nothing in either instruction that would alert the jury that the\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   referred to in instruction 21 was the same\n   <em>\n    reaction\n   </em>\n   referred to in instruction 19. As the majority states, \"[j]ury instructions explaining the 'reasonable explanation or excuse' requirement should avoid ambiguity as to what the reasonable explanation is addressing. If one instruction strongly implies the killing must be reasonable, this additional jury instruction may not be sufficient to remedy the misstatement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instruction 21 falls\n   well short of clarifying the ambiguity in instruction 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 63 Finally, the majority reasons that defense counsel's closing argument was sufficient to clarify instruction 19. It is true that defense counsel correctly stated the law, but she did so without using the ambiguous term\n   <em>\n    reaction.\n   </em>\n   And I find it troubling to conclude that defense counsel's closing argument could cure an ambiguous instruction where jurors were specifically instructed to rely on the jury instructions and not the closing arguments for statements of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 64 Moreover, even accepting the proposition that closing arguments could clarify an ambiguous jury instruction as a general matter, they did not do so in this case. Here, while the jury did hear a correct description of the law by defense counsel, it also heard an incorrect description by the prosecutor in his rebuttal. There, the prosecutor conflated the loss of control with the killing. He first referenced \"a complete loss of control that results in stabbing [one's] spouse and beating them.\" He then defined the loss of control in this case as \"the stabbing and the beating.\" So the last statement of the law the jury heard before it deliberated was a conflation of the loss of self-control and the killing, which emphasized the ambiguous use of\n   <em>\n    his reaction\n   </em>\n   in instruction 19. The majority provides no explanation for why the jury would have relied upon defense counsel's closing argument, while disregarding the prosecutor's rebuttal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 65 The majority states that \"[e]ven if ... instruction 19 is ambiguous, something more than a possibility that a jury could be confused by an instruction is required to grant a new trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority sets a dangerously high standard. While it is true that \"almost any set of jury instructions\" will contain some ambiguity, an ambiguous jury instruction that significantly distorts a legal standard is on par with a jury instruction that \"completely misstates a legal standard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And that is what we have here. Instruction 19 did not \"simply [leave] out a specific reference to the 'reaction' it was referencing,\" as the majority states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   It all but invited an incorrect application of the law by the jury-that it must find the killing itself reasonable and not simply the loss of self-control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 66 The majority correctly observes that \"the distinction between a reasonable loss of self-control and a reasonable murder is not easily made.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   While this distinction is not\n   <em>\n    easily\n   </em>\n   made, it must be\n   <em>\n    clearly\n   </em>\n   made because for a defendant to prove that a murder was reasonable is an altogether different task than proving that a loss of control was reasonable. The majority agrees with this, highlighting the important difference between the loss of self-control and murder. After rejecting the State's argument that the killing itself must be reasonable, the majority concludes that \"it is hard to imagine that the average reasonable person would ever kill someone.... Indeed, once the average reasonable person in the then existing circumstances loses self-control, the person no longer acts reasonably.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   To require proof that a murder was reasonable would effectively eliminate the defense of special mitigation by extreme emotional distress. Indeed, it seems highly unlikely that any jury would ever conclude that a murder was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 67 Yet, instruction 19's ambiguous reference to\n   <em>\n    his reaction\n   </em>\n   created a very real possibility that the jury believed its charge was to determine whether the murder was reasonable. The defendant was entitled to a clear instruction on special mitigation by extreme emotional distress-in fact, he proposed one that was rejected by the court. This instruction went to the heart of his\n   theory of the case. Even though he committed a horrific act, he is nevertheless entitled to a fair trial, which includes a clear instruction on this key element of his defense. Because a clear instruction was lacking here, I would reverse.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    <em>\n     State v.
