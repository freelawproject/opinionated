We affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In 2005 Beckman established Cybertary, a company offering virtual administrative services to businesses. At a business conference in 2010, Beckman met Faulconer, a principal of Franchise Foundry. Franchise Foundry provided marketing services for companies, and Faulconer expressed an interest in marketing for and investing in Cybertary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Beckman and Faulconer ultimately negotiated three agreements. First, Beckman, Franchise Foundry, and another entity executed an operating agreement for Cybertary. Second, Cybertary and Franchise Foundry entered into a service agreement under which Franchise Foundry agreed to perform marketing and sales services in exchange for a minority share in Cybertary. Third, Cybertary and Beckman executed an employment agreement (the Employment Agreement) under which Cybertary agreed to employ Beckman as its chief executive officer for a three-year term \"[s]ubject to earlier termination as provided in\" that agreement. The Employment Agreement set a base salary for Beckman and provided for bonuses and a monthly benefits allowance. The Employment Agreement allowed Cybertary to terminate Beckman's employment for \"cause\" and enumerated seven events that would constitute \"cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Beckman's relationship with Cybertary soured, and Cybertary failed to pay her according to the terms of the Employment Agreement. Concurrently, Beckman filed for bankruptcy on May 20, 2011. In Beckman's view, Faulconer was threatening to terminate her employment and was considering buying out her shares of Cybertary through the bankruptcy proceeding. In October 2011, Beckman's counsel sent a letter to Faulconer and a Cybertary manager threatening litigation and demanding that Cybertary pay the amounts it owed Beckman. Faulconer responded and arranged a phone call \"for settlement purposes only.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 On October 19, 2011, Beckman and Faulconer had a ninety-minute phone call, which Beckman recorded (the October conversation). At the beginning of the call, Faulconer stated, \"This whole conversation ... is really just for settlement purposes only ....\" Beckman acknowledged this preface, stating, \"Now you said this discussion is for settlement purposes only,\" and, \"If ... this entire discussion is aiming towards a settlement, what is it that you propose?\" She and Faulconer then candidly discussed Beckman's grievances but did not resolve them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 On November 2, 2011, Beckman sued Cybertary. Beckman alleged claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment based on Cybertary's failure to pay her base salary and benefits allowance. Because Beckman expected that all amounts owed to her before May 2011 would be addressed in the bankruptcy proceeding, she sought compensation only for those amounts that came due after her bankruptcy filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Two weeks later, on November 14, 2011, Cybertary formally notified Beckman that, \"effective immediately,\" it was terminating her employment for cause. The notice cited three subsections of the Employment Agreement's termination provision to support its determination of cause: subsections 6(b)(ii), (iii), and (vi).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As evidence of cause, Cybertary\n   explained that it had reason to believe that Beckman had engaged in certain conduct that discredited Cybertary or was detrimental to its reputation or its results of operation or business, pursuant to subsection 6(b)(vi). Cybertary further explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Not only does that [particular] conduct fall squarely within Section 6(b)(vi) ... and its prohibition on conduct that harms Cybertary's reputation or operations, but [it] also constitutes \"gross neglect\" or \"dereliction\" of your duties pursuant to Section 6(b)(ii) ..., as well as \"material misconduct with regard to\" Cybertary pursuant to Section 6(b)(iii) ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   As further evidence of cause, Cybertary believes that you have failed to perform certain crucial duties related to your responsibility as Cybertary's chief executive officer. Those failures constitute \"habitual neglect\" or \"dereliction\" of your duties pursuant to Section 6(b)(ii) ..., as well as \"material misconduct\" pursuant to Section 6(b)(iii).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The notice also stated that the grounds articulated as cause for Beckman's termination were \"not intended to be a comprehensive list\" and that Cybertary \"reserve[d] the right to articulate additional grounds for terminating [Beckman's] employment for cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Beckman subsequently amended her complaint, adding Franchise Foundry and Faulconer as defendants. Beckman's amended breach of contract claim stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In retaliation for filing this lawsuit, Faulconer and Franchise Foundry have attempted on behalf of Cybertary to terminate Beckman as Chief Executive Officer for Cybertary. Faulconer and Franchise Foundry have interfered with Beckman's ability to perform her duties as Chief Executive Officer .... Such retaliation and actions on behalf of Cybertary further constitute a material breach of the Employment Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Beckman also added a claim for declaratory judgment, seeking to nullify Cybertary's termination of the Employment Agreement. In her prayer for relief, Beckman indicated that at trial she would prove damages believed to be \"in excess of $300,000, plus interest, attorney's fees and costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b69 Cybertary filed counterclaims against Beckman for, among other things, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty. Cybertary alleged that Beckman had disparaged it, failed to keep its affairs confidential, and failed to perform her duties \"in an effective and careful manner.\" Cybertary also asserted that it had \"sustained significant damages\" and, without specifying an amount, sought \"general, specific, and consequential damages, in an amount to be proven at trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b610 In March 2013, Beckman sought leave to amend her complaint for a second time. Beckman sought to amend her factual allegations, expand her claim for unjust enrichment, and add four new causes of action: breach of the operating agreement; breach of fiduciary duty; fraudulent inducement; and civil conspiracy. The trial court denied the motion, finding that it \"was untimely and the product of unreasonable delay,\" and that Defendants would be prejudiced if the amendment were allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 Beckman and Defendants subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied Beckman's motion but granted Defendants' motion in part. Specifically, it granted summary judgment to Franchise Foundry and Faulconer on Beckman's claim for breach of the Employment Agreement. The court explained that it was undisputed that \"neither Franchise Foundry nor Faulconer are parties to [the] Employment Agreement\" and reasoned that Beckman could not \"enforce that contract against individuals or entities that are not parties to the contract.\" The court otherwise denied Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 In advance of trial, Defendants filed a motion in limine, requesting that the trial court exclude the recording of the October conversation. Defendants argued that the recording constituted evidence of settlement negotiations and that it therefore should be excluded at trial pursuant to rule 408 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. The court agreed and granted Defendants' motion, ruling that \"the statements captured therein constitute[d] compromise negotiations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 The case proceeded to trial. Although Cybertary had provided a supplemental disclosure quantifying its claimed damages as $373,500, the trial court found that the disclosure was untimely and refused to submit the question of Cybertary's damages to the jury. The court subsequently granted Beckman's motion for a directed verdict on Cybertary's counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Before submitting the case to the jury, the parties disagreed about the jury instruction defining \"cause\" as it related to Cybertary's termination of Beckman's employment (Instruction 12). Beckman asserted that Instruction 12 should be worded to define \"cause\" as the seven events enumerated in the Employment Agreement, and she argued that Cybertary was required to prove at least one event \"by a preponderance of the evidence.\" Defendants, on the other hand, asserted that Instruction 12 should explain that the determination of whether one of the events constituted \"cause\" \"was a matter for Cybertary's good business judgment.\" Defendants further proposed that Instruction 12 provide that \"[s]o long as Cybertary possessed a fair and honest cause or reason, in good faith, that met one of these [seven enumerated] definitions, cause existed to terminate Beckman, whether or not the facts that Cybertary believed to be true really, in fact, were true.\" (Citing\n   <em>\n    Uintah Basin Med. Center v. Hardy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8973539\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/110/168/\">\n    2005 UT App 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8973539\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/110/168/\">\n    110 P.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 The version of Instruction 12 given to the jury included Beckman's language about Cybertary having to prove at least one of the seven enumerated events by a preponderance of the evidence, while also including Defendants' language providing that whether \"cause\" existed \"was a matter for Cybertary's good business judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 The jury found in favor of Beckman, in part. On the special verdict form, the jury indicated that Cybertary breached the Employment Agreement by failing to pay Beckman's compensation and benefits, but did not breach the agreement by terminating her employment without cause. The jury further found that neither Franchise Foundry nor Faulconer acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct. Although Beckman sought an award of $235,041.05, the jury determined that Cybertary owed Beckman $84,913.83 in unpaid salary and $18,150 in unpaid benefits, totaling $103,063.83 in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 Beckman then moved for an award of prejudgment interest. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that Beckman's damages \"are not the type of damages that are susceptible to an award of prejudgment interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 Beckman and Cybertary also filed competing motions for attorney fees. Both relied on the attorney fees provision contained in the Employment Agreement. Under that provision, the \"nonprevailing party\" \"to any proceeding under [the Employment Agreement]\" pays its own and the other side's reasonable expenses, including attorney fees. The provision defined \"nonprevailing party\" as \"the party that the court of competent jurisdiction awards less than one-half (1/2) of all of the amounts in dispute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 The court construed the attorney fees provision \"as mandating an assessment of whether each party asserting a claim under the Employment Agreement is a 'nonprevailing party' under that claim.\" As to Beckman's fees request, the court determined that \"[b]ecause Cybertary was awarded less than one-half of the amounts it sought against Beckman, it [was] the nonprevailing party with respect to its counterclaims, and it [was] therefore required to pay Beckman's attorney fees and costs incurred in defending against those claims.\" Accordingly, the court awarded Beckman $75,317.24 against Cybertary. As to Cybertary's request for fees, the court determined that Beckman was the nonprevailing party with respect to her claims, \"having recovered less than one half of the amount she sought against Cybertary.\" Thus, the court found, Beckman was required to pay the attorney fees and costs Cybertary incurred in defending against her claims, which amounted to $62,181.90. The court then subtracted the amount awarded to Cybertary from the amount awarded to Beckman, resulting in a net award of attorney fees and costs of $13,135.34 to Beckman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 Franchise Foundry and Faulconer also requested attorney fees. The trial court determined that because Franchise Foundry and Faulconer prevailed on summary judgment on Beckman's claim against them under\n   the Employment Agreement, they were entitled to $27,153.33 in attorney fees from Beckman. Beckman appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 Beckman advances five main claims of error on appeal. First, Beckman contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying her motion for leave to amend her complaint. This court \"will not disturb a trial court's denial of a motion to amend pleadings absent an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Reller v.

We review the trial court's resolution of the legal questions underlying the admissibility of evidence for correctness and the trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 Fourth, Beckman contends that the trial court erroneously failed to award her prejudgment interest. \"A trial court's decision to grant or deny prejudgment interest presents a question of law which we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Cornia v.

Leave to Amend\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 First, Beckman contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying her motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to add four new claims. Beckman argues that she should have been allowed to amend her complaint because her motion was not untimely, her delay was justified by her pending bankruptcy action, and Defendants would have had adequate time to prepare to defend against the new claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 Rule 15 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure allows a party, before trial, to amend its pleading \"once as a matter of course\" within twenty-one days after serving the pleading, or, where a responsive pleading is required, the earlier of twenty-one days after service of that pleading or twenty-one days after service of a motion under rule 12(b), (e), or (f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Utah R.

The trial court here based its denial of Beckman's motion to amend on findings of untimeliness, unreasonable delay, and prejudice to Defendants. Beckman challenges all three of those findings but has not demonstrated that the trial court exceeded the bounds of its discretion in denying her motion on those grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b631 First, with respect to timeliness, Beckman argues that her motion, filed more than sixteen months after she filed her original complaint, was not untimely \"as a matter of law.\" We do not disagree. There is, after all, no \"bright line rule\" against which to judge the timeliness of a motion to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9250064\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/87/734/\">\n    2004 UT App 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9250064\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/87/734/\">\n    87 P.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, we are not persuaded that it was unreasonable for the trial court to conclude that Beckman's motion was untimely under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b632 Beckman filed her motion months after the discovery deadline had passed\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and after her lawsuit had been dormant for some time, causing the trial court judge to observe that the case had been \"dragging on and dragging on and-and nothing done.\" Where Beckman sought to significantly expand the scope of the lawsuit by adding four new claims (including claims for fraud and conspiracy) more than sixteen months into litigation that had shown little outward progress, and months after deadlines established by rule 26 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure had passed, we cannot conclude that there was no reasonable basis for the court's timeliness finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b633 Second, and closely related to her untimeliness argument, Beckman contends that she was justified in waiting to file her amended complaint because of uncertainties associated by her then-pending bankruptcy case.

The Exclusion of the October Conversation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b638 Beckman next contends that the trial court erred in excluding, pursuant to rule 408 of the Utah Rules of Evidence, the audio recording of the October conversation. She argues that the recording does not fall within the scope of rule 408 because (1) no dispute existed at the time of the call, (2) the call constituted a business communication, and (3) Faulconer did not offer during the call to settle any disputed claim. Alternatively, Beckman argues that the recording should nevertheless be admitted because the recording contains statements relevant to the parties' claims and defenses and would be \"otherwise discoverable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b639 Rule 408 provides that evidence of compromise offers and negotiations \"is not admissible either to prove or disprove liability for or the validity or amount of a disputed claim.\" Utah R.

Evid. 408(b)(1). Second, \"otherwise discoverable\" evidence need not be excluded \"merely because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/50/#p54\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 408(b)(2). In other words, rule 408\"does not immunize the information included in fact statements, but, in order to encourage free discussion, merely makes inadmissible the statements themselves when offered as admissions of a party opponent.\" Edward L. Kimball &amp; Ronald N. Boyce,\n   <em>\n    Utah Evidence Law\n   </em>\n   4-130 (2d ed. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b641 We agree with the trial court that the recording of the October conversation is evidence of \"conduct [and] statement[s] made in compromise negotiations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Evid. 408(a)(2). Both Beckman and Faulconer engaged in the October conversation with the understanding that the purpose of the colloquy was to discuss a resolution of their dispute. Faulconer suggested the parties speak after Beckman had threatened litigation, and in his email arranging the phone call, Faulconer twice stated that if Beckman agreed to participate, the discussion would be \"for settlement purposes only.\" Faulconer further reiterated the point at the beginning of the call, and he stated that he would be frank to aid in their effort to \"reach a settlement\" and \"to make this work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b642 For her part, Beckman demonstrated her assent to Faulconer's condition by proceeding with the conversation, stating that her attorney had given them the \"green light\" to have the discussion. She also twice acknowledged that the stated purpose of the call was \"for settlement ... only,\" and for ninety minutes she discussed with Faulconer the grounds of their dispute and proposals to resolve it. The record therefore supports the trial court's conclusion that the ensuing \"statements captured [in the recording] constitute[d] compromise negotiations,\" and the recording is inadmissible under rule 408\"either to prove or disprove liability for or the validity or amount of\" Beckman's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/50/#p54\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b643 Beckman nevertheless argues that because, at the time of the call, Faulconer had not disputed that Beckman's wages were owed to her and Cybertary had not terminated her employment, there were no disputes to compromise and the conversation was simply a \"business communication.\" The record does not support Beckman's claim. Midway through the phone call, Beckman expressly confirmed the parties' dispute when she stated: \"We are here to discuss the dispute related to the employment agreement.\" She also began the conversation by saying that she was recording it so that she could share it with her attorney. And, although the recording evidences Faulconer's agreement that Beckman had earned her wages, it also shows that the parties sharply disagreed over whether Beckman shared responsibility for the wages not being paid; whether Beckman, Faulconer, and Franchise Foundry could be held individually liable for the wages; and where funds would come from to pay the wages. Similarly, with regard to Beckman's employment, although she had not yet been terminated, the parties discussed their disagreement over whether Faulconer had cause and authority to terminate Beckman, and she sought, as a step toward resolution of their dispute, an assurance that Faulconer had no such intent. Thus, the recording itself amply demonstrates that the parties had an ongoing dispute and that the phone call was not a business communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b644 Beckman further argues that the trial court erred in excluding the recording under rule 408 because the recording does not constitute evidence of \"furnishing, promising, or offering-or accepting, promising to accept, or offering to accept-valuable consideration in order to compromise or attempt to compromise the claim\" under rule 408(a)(1). Beckman's argument is misplaced. The court excluded the evidence under rule 408(a)(2), as \"conduct or ... statement[s] made in compromise negotiations.\" Because the court did not rely on subsection (a)(1) of rule 408 to find the recording inadmissible, we need not consider whether Faulconer's offers of compromise constitute \"valuable consideration\" under that subsection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b645 As for rule 408 's caveats, Beckman does not claim that she offered the recording for a purpose other than to \"prove or disprove liability for or the validity or amount of a disputed claim,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Evid. 408(b)(1), but she suggests that unidentified statements in the recording are \"otherwise discoverable\" and therefore admissible,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/50/#p54\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 408(b)(2). Rule 408(b)(2) states that courts are \"not required to exclude evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/50/#p54\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We agree with Defendants that rule 408(b)(2) does not apply because Beckman seeks to admit \"a recording of the actual compromise negotiations to prove certain alleged admissions by Faulconer.\" (Emphasis omitted.) For the reasons stated above, the trial court did not err in concluding that evidence of those negotiations is inadmissible under rule 408(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   III. The Jury Instruction Regarding \"Cause\" for Termination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b646 Beckman next contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to the definition of \"cause\" in connection with her claim that Cybertary breached the Employment Agreement when it terminated her employment without cause. Under the Employment Agreement, the parties agreed that Cybertary would employ Beckman for three years subject to earlier termination as provided in the \"Termination for Cause\" provision. It stated that Beckman's term of employment \"may be terminated by [Cybertary] immediately for 'cause,' \" and enumerated seven \"events with respect to [Beckman]\" that \"shall constitute '[c]ause' \" for immediate termination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (i) Executive's commission of a felony of any kind or any other crime (whether it is a felony or not) involving securities fraud, theft, or moral turpitude;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (ii) Executive's willful breach, habitual neglect, gross neglect, or dereliction of Executive's duties under this Agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (iii) Executive's material misconduct with regard to the Company, including, but not limited to, Executive's failure to comply with [the] Company's written rules and policies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (iv) Executive's failure to follow in good faith the reasonable lawful direction of the Board or any committee thereof;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (v) Any act by Executive of sexual harassment (or Executive's creating a hostile work environment) or any other activity of Executive prohibited by state, local, and/or federal law with respect to discrimination based on age, sex, race, religion, or national origin;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (vi) Any conduct, whether dishonest, fraudulent, or otherwise, that discredits the Company or is detrimental to the reputation of the Company or the Company's results of operations or business; and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (vii) Any breach of any of Executive's obligations under the Inventions, Confidentiality, and Restrictive Covenant Agreement referred to below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b647 Instruction 12 identified these events\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and specified, \" 'Cause' has been defined in ... the Employment Agreement and requires Cybertary to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence,\" one of the events. Beckman's challenge focuses on additional language included in Instruction 12, which applies the business judgment rule to the determination of cause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   In determining whether Cybertary breached the Employment Agreement by inaccurately determining that one or more of\n   these definitions of \"cause\" existed, you must remember that the determination of whether one or more of these definitions was satisfied was a matter for Cybertary's good business judgment. So long as Cybertary possessed a fair and honest cause or reason, in good faith, that met one of these definitions, cause existed to terminate Beckman, whether or not the facts that Cybertary believed to be true really, in fact, were true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Beckman asserts that by instructing the jury regarding Cybertary's good business judgment, the trial court incorrectly \"looked beyond the plain language of [the] Employment Agreement and inserted its own definition of what constitutes 'cause' for termination.\" Cybertary responds that the Employment Agreement does not define \"what the employer must prove to establish cause for termination\" and that the jury was properly instructed as to Utah law in that regard. According to Cybertary, \"[e]mployers are not required to prove the facts giving rise to the termination so long as the employer can demonstrate a reasonable, good-faith belief that the facts existed.\" Cybertary's argument and the trial court's decision to include the challenged language in Instruction 12 rested on their interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Uintah Basin Medical Center v.

Cybertary and Beckman negotiated an employment contract with seven enumerated events that constituted cause for early termination. Thus, unlike the parties in\n   <em>\n    Uintah Basin\n   </em>\n   , Cybertary and Beckman clearly evidenced their intent that something other than the ordinary meaning of just cause would govern Beckman's termination. For example, while \"just cause\" as defined in\n   <em>\n    Uintah Basin\n   </em>\n   permits termination on the basis of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   \"good faith business reason[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19, the Employment Agreement narrowed the scope of permissible bases for termination to those specifically identified.

Based on this incorrect legal standard, the jury may well have determined that Cybertary legally terminated Beckman's employment based only on a good faith belief that cause existed even if there was no actual cause for termination. Thus, there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury may have reached a different result had it been given jury instructions that articulated the correct legal standard.

Prejudgment Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b658 Beckman contends that the trial court erred in declining to award her prejudgment interest. She asserts that she is entitled to prejudgment interest because her unpaid wages and benefits can be measured and quantified by the amounts specified in the Employment Agreement and because her damages were fixed and complete as of the date of her termination on November 14, 2011. Cybertary responds that Beckman's loss was not fixed as of a particular time, because the jury had to \"exercise its judgment and discretion to award damages\" in limiting the damages award to the wages and benefits that had accrued prior to Beckman's termination, in determining whether that award was subject to an offset, and in determining whether Beckman had waived or deferred her right to payment. Cybertary also argues that because any interest would accrue from the date of each missed payment, and because Beckman was sometimes overpaid, Beckman did not provide sufficient evidence to support an award of prejudgment interest. Cybertary further argues that prejudgment interest is unavailable because the Employment Agreement was not a contract for the loan or forbearance of money, goods, or chose in action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b659 \"[T]he purpose of awarding prejudgment interest is to compensate a party for the depreciating value of the amount owed over time and, as a corollary, to deter parties from intentionally withholding an amount that is liquidated and owing.\"\n   <em>\n    Encon Utah, LLC v.

Beckman asserted two breach of contract theories against Cybertary: one based on Cybertary's failure to pay wages and benefits Beckman earned for the time period before her termination, and another based on Cybertary's premature termination of the Employment Agreement. As damages for that second theory, Beckman sought the wages and benefits she would have earned had Cybertary not prematurely terminated her employment. Ultimately, the jury awarded Beckman only those wages and benefits she earned pre-termination because it rejected her theory that Cybertary unlawfully terminated her employment without cause. But the fact that the jury rejected Beckman's second theory, and its attendant claim for post-termination wages and benefits, does not negate the fact that Beckman's damages for unpaid wages for the period prior to her termination were fixed and measurable based on the amount she was owed under the Employment Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Encon Utah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996251\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/210/263/\">\n    2009 UT 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996251\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/210/263/\">\n    210 P.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that prejudgment interest is appropriate in cases where the amount due under the contract is \"ascertainable by calculation\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b662 Relatedly, Cybertary argues that Beckman should be denied prejudgment interest because the \"claimed prejudgment interest is not 'calculable with mathematical certainty.' \" Beckman calculated interest\n   from the date Cybertary terminated her employment (November 14, 2011) rather than from the earlier dates of each alleged breach. Cybertary argues that because Beckman did not calculate the prejudgment interest from the date of each missed payment, the court did not have sufficient evidence before it to correctly calculate the interest.

Rather, Cybertary complains that Beckman failed to provide sufficient evidence for the court to award prejudgment interest accruing incrementally from the date of each missed payment. But Beckman did not seek to recover that added interest. Beckman sought only to recover interest that accrued as of the date of her termination. Any argument that Beckman may have lacked sufficient evidence to recover prejudgment interest that accrued\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   her termination does not render her evidence insufficient as to the post-termination interest she actually sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b664 Cybertary, citing Utah Code section 15-1-1, further argues that prejudgment interest is unavailable to Beckman because the Employment Agreement was not a contract for \"the loan or forbearance of any money, goods, or chose in action.\" Section 15-1-1 states, \"Unless parties to a lawful contract specify a different rate of interest, the legal rate of interest for the loan or forbearance of any money, goods, or chose in action shall be 10% per annum.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (LexisNexis 2013).

App. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b668 The trial court awarded attorney fees based on its interpretation of the attorney fees provision in the Employment Agreement. That provision states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   The nonprevailing party in any proceeding hereunder shall be the party that the court of competent jurisdiction awards less than one-half (1/2) of all of the amounts in dispute\n   (\"Nonprevailing Party\"). The Nonprevailing Party to any proceeding under this Agreement shall pay its own expenses, the court fees, and any administrative fees arising in connection therewith, and the expenses, including without limitation, attorneys' fees, costs, and costs of investigation, reasonably incurred by the other party to the proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Under this provision, the \"nonprevailing party\" is responsible for paying its own and the other party's reasonable attorney fees and other expenses. The \"nonprevailing party\" is defined as the party who was \"award[ed] less than one-half (1/2) of all of the amounts in dispute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b669 The Employment Agreement does not explain how to calculate \"all of the amounts in dispute.\" The parties disagreed over the relevant figures before the trial court, but for purposes of this appeal, Beckman and Cybertary apparently agree on the following pertinent facts and figures: Beckman sought an award of $235,041.05 at trial for breach of the Employment Agreement, and the jury awarded her $103,063.83; Cybertary disclosed damages in the amount of $373,500 for its counterclaims, but the trial court excluded Cybertary's damages from trial for failure to timely disclose them; and the court granted a directed verdict on the counterclaims to Beckman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b670 The trial court construed the attorney fees provision's language \"as mandating an assessment of whether each party asserting a claim under the Employment Agreement is a 'nonprevailing party' under that claim.\" Consequently, the court in effect bifurcated its analysis. The court first assessed whether Cybertary recovered less than half of the amounts it sought against Beckman on its counterclaims and, second, the court assessed whether Beckman recovered less than half of the amounts she sought against Cybertary on all of her claims. Taking this approach, the court determined that Cybertary was the nonprevailing party under its counterclaims and that Beckman was the nonprevailing party under her claims against Cybertary. Because both sides were \"nonprevailing parties\" under this analysis, the trial court concluded that each side owed the other for the attorney fees incurred in defending against the respective claims. And because Beckman's attorney fees award exceeded that of Cybertary, the court offset those amounts and awarded Beckman a total of $13,135.34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b671 On appeal, Beckman challenges the trial court's decision to apply the attorney fees provision by evaluating whether each party asserting a claim under the Employment Agreement was a \"nonprevailing party\" with respect to that claim. She asserts that this approach contradicts the plain language of the Employment Agreement. By her reading, the attorney fees provision allows for \"only one prevailing party\" because the \"term 'nonprevailing party' is singular,\" and \" 'all of the amounts' \" is a plural phrase that refers to \"those amounts sought in the 'dispute,' \" a singular term. Beckman argues that the attorney fees provision \"groups 'all amounts in dispute' together and then assigns liability to the one party who is awarded less than one-half of those amounts.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b672 According to Beckman, she sought an award of $235,041.05 at trial, and Cybertary, despite having its supplemental disclosure of damages struck at trial, sought damages of $373,500 on its counterclaims. By Beckman's math, to determine \"all of the amounts in dispute,\" the trial court \"should have\n   <em>\n    subtracted\n   </em>\n   what Beckman sought ($235,041.05) from what Cybertary sought ($373,500) to arrive at $138,458.95.\" (Emphasis added.) Because Cybertary was awarded nothing at trial, Beckman argues, Cybertary recovered less than half of the amounts in dispute and therefore was the \"nonprevailing party\" as defined by the attorney fees provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b673 Cybertary offers a different interpretation of the provision and a different calculation of \"all of the amounts in dispute.\" Cybertary asserts that the \"only way to read [the attorney fees provision] with any fidelity to its language, and with any common sense, is to recognize that it assesses attorney fees for each party asserting a claim.\" This reading separates each party's total claimed damages and compares those amounts with each party's ultimate recovery. According to Cybertary, when Beckman recovered $103,063.83 at trial, she recovered \"less than half of the total $235,041.05 she sought in damages.\" On her claims, Cybertary states that Beckman\n   \"is therefore the nonprevailing party and required to pay Cybertary's attorney fees and costs associated with\" those claims. Likewise, because Cybertary \"recovered less than half of its $373,500.00 claim,\" Cybertary admits it \"is the nonprevailing party on its claims and must therefore pay Beckman's attorney fees associated with that claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b674 To illustrate why its interpretation of the attorney fees provision makes sense, Cybertary posits an alternative scenario in which \"all of the amounts in dispute\" are determined by adding the parties' claimed damages together. Cybertary asserts that this scenario would adhere to a strict reading of the provision and result in $608,541.45 as the total of Beckman's and Cybertary's claims. But even if Beckman recovered her entire amount claimed in damages, she would be deemed the nonprevailing party who is liable for Cybertary's attorney fees. As Cybertary explains, this reading would lead to \"a harsh, absurd result\" because \"a defendant could resist a legitimate claim by asserting a bogus counterclaim in an astronomical amount, and then claim that the prevailing plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees, even though the plaintiff recovered 100% of its claim.\" In other words, Cybertary claims that adding each side's claimed damages together to determine \"all of the amounts in dispute\" would give a defendant a perverse incentive to plead meritless counterclaims in high amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b675 To resolve this issue, we must look to the four corners of the Employment Agreement to determine its meaning and the parties' intentions.\n   <em>\n    Nolin v.

Applying the above principles, we examine this rather unusual attorney fees clause. The Employment Agreement requires that the \"nonprevailing party\" pay its own expenses and court fees along with the fees and costs reasonably incurred by the other party \"in any proceeding\" thereunder. The agreement specifically defines the nonprevailing party as \"the party that the court of competent jurisdiction awards less than one-half (1/2) of all of the amounts in dispute.\" By defining the nonprevailing party this way, this attorney fees provision differs considerably from the more standard, boilerplate provisions that entitle the prevailing party to an award of attorney fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b677 Contrary to Cybertary's argument and the conclusion of the trial court, we see no indication in the Employment Agreement that the parties intended to apply the attorney fees provision in a bifurcated fashion. The provision not only refers to the \"nonprevailing party\" in the singular, but it refers to that singular nonprevailing party \"in any proceeding hereunder.\" The term \"proceeding\" is commonly understood to mean a \"legal action,\" Merriam-Webster.com, http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/proceeding (last visited Mar. 21, 2018), suggesting that in a singular legal action under\n   the Employment Agreement there will be only one nonprevailing party. And that nonprevailing party is to pay all of its own fees and costs and those of the other party \"arising in connection therewith.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b678 In other words, the potential obligation to pay attorney fees and costs is expressly tied to fees incurred in connection with the proceeding; it is neither completely untethered nor tied to fees and costs incurred relative to a particular claim. By expressly tethering the definition of \"nonprevailing party\" to a proceeding, we cannot fairly read the term as tethered to a party's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b679 The agreement defines the nonprevailing party as the party in the proceeding to whom the court \"awards less than one-half (1/2) of all of the amounts in dispute.\" Beckman and Cybertary suggest two alternative ways to determine \"all of the amounts in dispute\" when counterclaims are involved: by subtracting, or offsetting, the parties' damages (the subtraction approach); or by adding both parties' damages together (the addition approach).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b680 Under the subtraction approach, \"all of the amounts in dispute\" would be calculated by offsetting the plaintiff's and the defendant's claimed damages. In other words, the actual amount in dispute would be determined by subtracting one party's claimed damages from the other party's. The actual amount of money in dispute would thus turn on the relative damages each party claimed. If one party claimed a large amount of damages and another claimed a smaller amount, it is possible that the party claiming the smaller amount could recover all of the damages it seeks and still be deemed a \"nonprevailing party\" if its recovery was less than one-half of the difference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b681 Under the addition approach, \"all of the amounts in dispute\" would be determined by adding the parties' damages together. Like the subtraction approach, the addition approach would make the total amount in dispute hinge on how much each party claimed in damages. And hypothetically, even if one party recovered entirely on its claim, that party could be deemed the nonprevailing party if the other party asserted a greater amount of damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b682 Although both approaches make the risk of paying attorney fees dependent upon the amount of damages claimed by the other party, and both have the potential to lead to arbitrary results, Beckman advocates for the subtraction approach presumably because it works in her favor in this case. Had the trial court subtracted Beckman's claimed damages from Cybertary's claimed damages, it would have determined that $138,458.95 constituted \"all of the amounts in dispute.\" And because Cybertary recovered nothing and Beckman recovered $103,063.83, more than half of the total amount, Beckman contends that Cybertary should be deemed the singular nonprevailing party. Cybertary, on the other hand, contends that neither approach should apply, reasoning that the subtraction approach is not supported by the provision's plain language while the addition approach leads to harsh results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b683 We conclude that the meaning of the phrase \"all of the amounts in dispute\" is ambiguous in this context. The parties advocate different ways to calculate \"all of the amounts in dispute,\" but the plain language does not obviously support either alternative. The phrase generally suggests that \"all of the amounts in dispute\" should be combined, but it does not include terms necessary to determine whether the parties intended that those amounts be subtracted, added, or otherwise calculated. We therefore must remand this issue to the trial court to consider extrinsic evidence to determine its meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b684 Having reached this conclusion, we return to Cybertary's argument that the provision must be interpreted to apply separately to each party's respective claims because\n   any other reading leads to harsh or arbitrary results. We acknowledge that regardless of whether \"all of the amounts in dispute\" is determined through subtraction or addition, a party could be deemed a \"nonprevailing party\" under the provision despite having been awarded the entirety of its damages claim. We also note that regardless of whether the subtraction or addition approach is used, there are scenarios under which the party deemed nonprevailing under the provision is the party all would concede is the nonprevailing party under a traditional prevailing party clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But having discerned no support for the trial court's bifurcated approach in the plain language of the Employment Agreement, we cannot \"make a better contract for the parties than they have made for themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    Bakowski v.

The Attorney Fees Awarded to Franchise Foundry and Faulconer\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b685 Beckman contends that the trial court erred in employing the reciprocal attorney fees statute, Utah Code section 78B-5-826, to award attorney fees to Franchise Foundry and Faulconer. In particular, Beckman argues that she did not assert claims against Franchise Foundry and Faulconer for breach of the Employment Agreement, and thus they could not invoke the reciprocal attorney fees statute to recover attorney fees under the Employment Agreement. Franchise Foundry and Faulconer, in contrast, assert that they are entitled to recover fees pursuant to the Employment Agreement and the reciprocal attorney fees statute because Beckman \"asserted a claim for breach of the Employment Agreement against [them].\" In their view, \"the Employment Agreement formed the premise of Beckman's claim,\" it would have allowed \"Beckman to recover fees had she prevailed,\" and the reciprocal attorney fees statute therefore \"allows Franchise Foundry and Faulconer to recover attorney fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b686 Utah's reciprocal attorney fees statute permits courts to \"award attorney fees to the prevailing party of a contract dispute so long as the contract provide[s] for the award of attorney fees to at least one of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Wing v.

The trial court reasoned that because Franchise Foundry and Faulconer \"prevailed on Beckman's claim against them under the\n   Employment Agreement\" when the court granted them summary judgment on Beckman's first claim for relief, the reciprocal attorney fees statute applied to entitle Franchise Foundry and Faulconer to attorney fees. We disagree. Although Beckman asserted in her amended complaint that Franchise Foundry and Faulconer should be held liable for damages arising out of Cybertary's breach of the Employment Agreement, Beckman did not seek to enforce the Employment Agreement against Franchise Foundry and Faulconer. Thus, the first condition of the reciprocal attorney fees statute was not satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6981948\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/285/766/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b688 This conclusion is driven by the nature of Beckman's claim. Beckman labeled her first claim for relief as one for \"Breach of Employment Agreement,\" an agreement she identified in her amended complaint as between Beckman and Cybertary. Beckman claimed that Cybertary breached the Employment Agreement by failing to pay her salary and benefits, and that Franchise Foundry and Faulconer took actions \"on behalf of Cybertary\" in further breach of the agreement. Beckman also sought a declaration that because Faulconer and Franchise Foundry \"have not acted in good faith,\" they would be \"liable for any damages suffered by Beckman as a result of their actions.\" And in her prayer for relief, Beckman sought a monetary judgment against Cybertary, Franchise Foundry, and Faulconer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b689 While Beckman did not clearly articulate the theory under which she sought to recover damages from Franchise Foundry and Faulconer, she did not assert a claim against them for breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beckman never alleged that Franchise Foundry and Faulconer were parties or assignees to the Employment Agreement, and she never alleged that they breached it. Instead, she asserted a claim for declaratory judgment in which she sought a declaration that \"Faulconer and Franchise Foundry have not acted in good faith and are therefore liable for any damages suffered by Beckman as a result of their actions.\" In other words, Beckman sought to recover damages from Franchise Foundry and Faulconer for allegedly failing to act in good faith, but she did not seek to enforce the Employment Agreement against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b690 Contrary to what Franchise Foundry and Faulconer now argue on appeal, they previously and unequivocally shared this view. When Defendants moved for summary judgment, they agreed that Beckman's \"sole claim regarding the Employment Agreement is that Cybertary-and not anyone else-breached it,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and they even asserted that Beckman \"does not,\n   <em>\n    and has never\n   </em>\n   , asserted that [breach of contract] claim against any other Defendant.\" (Emphasis added.) In response, Beckman did not oppose Defendants' motion insofar as it related to Franchise Foundry and Faulconer and the Employment Agreement, because she \"openly admit[ted] that Franchise Foundry and Faulconer are not parties [to] the Employment Agreement, and [had] never claimed otherwise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b691 On this record, we cannot agree with the trial court's conclusion that Franchise\n   Foundry and Faulconer prevailed on a claim based on the Employment Agreement. We therefore reverse the trial court's award of attorney fees to Franchise Foundry and Faulconer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   C.

Although she argues that the \"fact discovery cutoff date was September 6, 2012,\" she does not argue that the litigation was not in an advanced procedural stage; rather, she argues that \"the time period at issue must factor in the delays precipitated by [Defendants].\" It is not until her reply brief that Beckman takes the position that fact discovery did not expire until May 8, 2013, just weeks before the trial court heard argument on her motion. Even if Beckman's change of position between the filing of her opening and reply brief was excusable due to what appears to be her reliance on the wrong version of rule 26, Beckman has offered no justification for her suggestion that we should review the trial court's decision based on facts different from those she argued before that court.
