(\"Mother\") appeals the juvenile court's order severing her parental rights to her two children (\"the children\"). Mother argues the court violated her due process rights by finding she did not have good cause for failing to appear at a pretrial hearing and, on an accelerated basis, severing her rights\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   .

As more fully discussed below, minimal due process safeguards and fundamental fairness require that we vacate the severance order here and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On September 9, 2015, Mother was admitted to Banner Behavioral Health for substance abuse treatment for heroin and methamphetamine use. Mother did not complete the hospital's substance abuse treatment and left against medical advice. On September 11, 2015, the Department of Child Safety (\"DCS\") took temporary custody of the children and placed them with their maternal grandmother. Thereafter, DCS filed a petition alleging the children were dependent as to Mother due to substance abuse and/or neglect. Mother contested the dependency, but the juvenile court found the children dependent as to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On August 3, 2016, DCS filed a petition to sever Mother's parental rights based on abandonment, substance abuse, and out-of-home placement for a cumulative total period of nine months or longer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 8-533(B)(1), (3), (8)(a) (Supp. 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a part of the severance proceedings, Mother received, and signed, a \"Notice to Parent in Termination Action\" (\"Form 3\"). Form 3 advised Mother that if she failed to attend any severance-related hearing without good cause, the court may find that she waived her legal rights and admitted the alleged grounds for severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Mother attended the initial severance hearing, set pursuant to Rule 65,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the\n   initial mediation. The juvenile court excused Mother from the next pretrial hearing on September 22, 2016. At that pretrial hearing, the court set a combined report and review status hearing and pretrial conference for January 18, 2017 (\"January Hearing\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also set the severance adjudication hearing for March 28 and March 30, 2017. Mother did not appear at the January Hearing. Mother's attorney informed the court that he had told Mother about the January Hearing, but that he had not heard from her. The court found that Mother did not have good cause for failing to appear. At the request of DCS, the court then converted the report and review hearing/pretrial conference into an accelerated severance hearing, and heard evidence from DCS in support of its severance petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The DCS case manager testified that Mother had only sporadic contact with the children during the 16-month dependency and that Mother had not provided the children with reasonable support because she had not sent the children any gifts, birthday cards, or letters. Through the case manager's testimony, DCS additionally contended that Mother was unable to maintain a normal parental relationship with the children because, in addition to failing to provide parental contact or guidance, she failed to provide the children with basic necessities such as food and shelter. Moreover, the case manager opined that Mother was unable to care for the children because of her history of substance abuse, inability to demonstrate sobriety, and failure to successfully participate in substance abuse treatment. At the end of a hearing that lasted twenty-five minutes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the juvenile court found DCS established by clear and convincing evidence all three grounds for severance. The court also found by a preponderance of the evidence that severance was in the children's best interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Nine days after the January Hearing, Mother moved to set aside the severance ruling, arguing she had been physically unable to appear. In support of her motion, Mother argued the maternal grandparents, who were present at the hearing, knew but failed to inform the juvenile court that she was in an in-patient drug treatment facility (\"Lifewell\") the morning of the hearing. Mother attached to her motion a copy of a \"Behavioral Health Service Plan\" form from Lifewell dated January 18, 2017, identifying her as a patient admitted to the facility. The court granted Mother's motion before DCS had an opportunity to respond, finding Mother\n   was \"physically unable to appear in Court [ ] for the Report and Review Hearing/Pretrial Conference set to January 18, 2017.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 DCS filed an opposition to Mother's motion and moved the juvenile court to reconsider the order setting aside the severance ruling. DCS argued that Mother failed to establish good cause for her failure to appear at the January Hearing and requested a status conference to resolve the pending motions. In her response to the DCS motion, Mother agreed to the status conference \"to discuss rescheduling the Severance Trial,\" but maintained that the court properly granted her motion to set aside because she was physically unable to appear at the January Hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The juvenile court set a status conference for February 23, 2017 (\"February Hearing\") to determine whether to \"set aside the set-aside.\" Mother did not appear. At the hearing, DCS argued that documents Mother submitted with her motion showed she was admitted to Lifewell at 12:00 p.m. on January 18, more than two hours after the scheduled start of the January Hearing. From that, DCS argued Mother's admission to Lifewell did not prevent her from appearing at the hearing. DCS further argued that the court should affirm the severance because Mother did not notify either DCS or her attorney that she was going to Lifewell. In Mother's defense, her attorney argued that the Lifewell paperwork did not show what time Mother arrived at the facility, but did show she was in Lifewell on January 18, 2017, the date of the January Hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 DCS also argued that, even if the juvenile court found good cause for Mother's absence from the January Hearing, there was no good cause for Mother's absence from the February Hearing. The court, however, stated it was \"not too concerned about [Mother's] nonappearance\" at the informally set February Hearing. Ultimately, the court reinstated the severance ruling it had made at the conclusion of the January Hearing. The court based its decision on the \"additional information about the circumstances surrounding Mother's non-appearance\" and because Mother had been in \"contact [via e-mail] with her lawyer, [and] could have told\" her lawyer about her treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Mother timely appealed. At DCS' request, we stayed the appeal pending the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Brenda D. v. Dep't of Child Safety\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20437\">\n    243 Ariz. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12564752\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/410/419/\">\n    410 P.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Following issuance of the Supreme Court's decision in that case, we directed Mother and DCS to file supplemental briefs. We have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to the Arizona Constitution, Article 6, Section 9 ; A.R.S. \u00a7 8-235(A) (2014); and Rule 103(A) of the Arizona Rules of Procedure for the Juvenile Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 On appeal, Mother argues the juvenile court violated her due process rights by setting aside its good cause finding. Mother additionally argues that courts should not apply civil procedure standards for setting aside default judgments to juvenile court proceedings because that standard does not protect a parent's constitutional interests in a severance proceeding. In response, DCS argues that in deciding whether to set aside a severance order entered\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   , the juvenile court should apply a default judgment standard taken from civil procedure-requiring good cause, as demonstrated by proof of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a meritorious defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Richas v.

Rule 66(D)(2) permits a juvenile court to sever a parent's rights\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   at a scheduled\n   <em>\n    final adjudication hearing\n   </em>\n   if the court finds that the parent does not have good cause for her absence, the parent was properly served pursuant to Rule 64, and the parent was previously advised of the potential consequences of her failure to appear. Rule 64(C) permits a juvenile court that finds a parent has missed\n   <em>\n    an initial hearing, pretrial conference, or status conference\n   </em>\n   to convert that preliminary proceeding into an accelerated final adjudication hearing, and to sever a parent's rights based on the record created at the accelerated severance hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Not all juvenile court judges follow the same Rule 64(C) procedure when a parent misses a scheduled pre-adjudication hearing; some judges routinely accelerate the final severance hearing, while others do not. Although the waiver language of Rule 64(C) is similar to that of Rule 66(D)(2), the procedures and rights at stake in these rules are distinctly different. Indeed, this case highlights the opposing interests at stake in a severance hearing and the difficulty of applying a uniform procedure to balance a parent's fundamental right to parent her children with the State's interest in efficiently providing the children with permanency, stability, and safety in both the Rule 66(D)(2) and Rule 64(C) contexts. As such, we examine these provisions in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    II.

Typically, a DCS supervisor or caseworker briefly summarizes the case history, the success or failure of services offered to the parent, and opines about the parent's fitness and parenting skills.

Eldridge\n   </em>\n   inquiry-the risk that the current procedures will lead to an erroneous deprivation of a party's right. In some cases, a Rule 64(C) accelerated hearing may too often become a proceeding where efficiency can outweigh sufficiency of evidence, and convenience can outweigh nuance. At the time of such a preliminary proceeding, often months before the scheduled severance hearing, it is difficult to imagine what meaningful evidence a parent could offer in order to prove a meritorious defense. Moreover, while cost and efficiency are surely factors to consider when balancing a parent's interest versus the State's interest, they are not the primary nor the only important factors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marianne N.\n   </em>\n   , 243 Ariz. at 60, \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=401%20P.3d%201002\">\n    401 P.3d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Eckerstrom, J., dissenting) (\"[A] parent's failure to attend a pretrial conference risks no delay in the scheduled termination hearing or the child's permanency.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 27 At Rule 64(C) accelerated severance hearings, as noted above, a parent's attorney is often left scrambling to adequately counter the State's summary presentation of evidence and to present the parent's defense. Additionally, when a court severs a parent's rights at an accelerated adjudication hearing pursuant to Rule 64(C), it deprives a parent of the time over which the parent can hope to demonstrate that she is successfully complying with DCS' provided services and working in good faith to resolve the issues that led DCS to take the children into custody in the first place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In such setting, a\n   parent suffers a great risk that she will be prematurely, erroneously, and permanently deprived of her right to parent her children. Moreover, at a preliminary or status hearing, a parent's interest in the care and custody of her children, and the risk that an accelerated proceeding might forever alter her fundamental right to parent her children, is at its highest. In contrast, the State's interest in safety, permanency, and stability is certainly lower, because generally the State already has custody of the children, and the date of the final severance hearing is already set. The issue here is not whether the State will ultimately prevail on the merits, but rather ensuring that, whatever the ultimate ruling, the outcome is a result of a fundamentally fair proceeding that does not compromise a parent's due process rights. Accordingly, because at this stage of the severance proceedings (at an initial hearing, pretrial conference, or status conference), the court must afford a parent greater procedural protection than at a hearing held pursuant to Rule 66, we hold the court may not require a parent to prove a meritorious defense to set aside a severance order arising out of a Rule 64(C) (or Rule 65 ) accelerated hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 28 DCS cites\n   <em>\n    Christy A.\n   </em>\n   , in arguing a parent must provide both a reason for her failure to appear\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   present a meritorious defense to set aside an order entered pursuant to Rule 64(C).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715957\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/217/299/\">\n    217 Ariz. at 304, \u00b6 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715957\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/217/299/\">\n    173 P.3d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying the meritorious defense prong of\n   <em>\n    Christy A.\n   </em>\n   to justify denial of a parent's motion to set aside a severance order accelerated by Rule 64(C) or Rule 65 infringes a parent's right to a fundamentally fair proceeding. Additionally, because on the sliding scale a parent's interest outweighs the State's interest at a preliminary hearing or status conference, requiring a parent to provide a \"meritorious defense,\" as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Christy A.\n   </em>\n   and some of its progeny, is unnecessarily burdensome and impractical. Instead, to demonstrate good cause in moving to set aside a severance order issued after an accelerated hearing pursuant to Rule 64(C) or Rule 65, a parent need only show evidence of a legitimate reason or excuse for her failure to appear-which the court, in its discretion, may accept or reject.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 29 The application of this standard in this setting is further supported by the very nature of preliminary hearings and status conferences, where, in general, a party's presence likely does not aid the court in reaching a determination as to a procedural or evidentiary issue raised by the pending severance proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 30 If the court accepts the parent's proffered excuse or reason, finding good cause for the failure to appear, there is no waiver of rights. The court will vacate its severance order and the case either proceeds to the already regularly scheduled date for the severance hearing or the court will set an entirely new final adjudication hearing date. If the court instead finds no good cause for the failure to appear at the accelerated hearing, the severance order stands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 31 As previously noted, the juvenile court's decision to accelerate a preliminary hearing pursuant to Rule 64(C) is discretionary, and should not be a \"given,\" notwithstanding DCS' frequent requests to do so. Without second-guessing the juvenile court, it may be a better practice for the court to rule only that the parent has waived participation at the missed pretrial proceeding, and allow the severance issue to proceed to the final adjudication hearing as scheduled.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brenda D.\n   </em>\n   , 243 Ariz. at 448, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12564752\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/410/419/\">\n    410 P.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (suggesting that if a parent appears as scheduled at the final severance adjudication there is no permanent waiver due to an earlier failure to appear).
