Several years of litigation followed, culminating in a bench trial. This appeal presents the opportunity for us to review many of the calls made by the trial court leading up to and following trial. We affirm in all respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 KeyBank National Association provided Athletic Performance Institute LLC (API) financing for a twelve-month construction project to build an indoor athletic facility, which would then convert to a twenty-year, $1.9 million loan. API planned to lease the facility to Utah Baseball Academy Inc. (UBA). Robert Keyes owned both API and\n   UBA. Keyes and UBA guarantied the loan to API. Appellants hired Camco Construction Inc. as the general contractor in the construction of the facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 While the building was meant to \"accommodate multiple sports,\" \"a floor elevation problem\" resulted in the facility only being suitable for baseball. This floor elevation issue was one of many problems that arose with both the funding and construction of the facility. When API and Camco could not resolve these disputes, Camco filed a mechanic's lien and, eventually, a lawsuit against API. Camco brought KeyBank into the suit \"to assert lien priority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Throughout the construction process, API filed draw requests with KeyBank, which KeyBank would pay out of the loan. One particular draw request-Draw Request No. 6-was not immediately funded because of the mechanic's lien. This draw request became a source of conflict between API and KeyBank, and API ultimately asserted claims for damages against KeyBank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Another source of conflict between API and KeyBank arose in the context of the payment of accrued interest on the loan. While the loan documents were silent as to how such interest was to be handled, KeyBank made interest payments starting at the beginning of the loan period. At some point, KeyBank stopped making these payments. This gave rise to another claim for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The proceedings in the trial court were long and complex. API filed a third party complaint against additional entities-Sporturf and Evergreen-and the trial court eventually bifurcated the related claims. The bifurcation led the trial court, in part, to conclude that the jury waiver included in KeyBank and API's loan documents should be enforced. Thus, the trial court heard Appellants' claims against KeyBank in a bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 However, not all claims were heard at the bench trial, since the trial court had disposed of several of the claims on summary judgment. One claim peripheral to this appeal centered on a $15,000 payment from Keyes to a KeyBank employee, Roger Preston. The money came from API's construction equity account. This payment was problematic for a number of reasons, and KeyBank ultimately \"refunded the $15,000, plus interest, and unconditionally tendered additional interest to API.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Appellants now challenge the results of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 The issues raised on appeal fall into four main categories. First, Appellants argue that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment to KeyBank on several of Appellants' claims. Second, they argue that the trial court erroneously granted KeyBank's motion to strike Appellants' jury demand. Third, they argue that several of the court's trial rulings were unsupported. Fourth, they argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion for a mistrial. We address these contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I. Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 We review a trial court's grant of summary judgment for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Overstock.com, Inc. v.

Those claims were for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), lost profits, and fraud. We conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in all three respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 In Utah, a plaintiff is entitled to damages\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   where the defendant intentionally engaged in some conduct toward the plaintiff, (a) with the purpose of inflicting emotional distress, or, (b) where any reasonable person would have known that such would result; and his actions are of such a nature as to be considered outrageous and intolerable in that they offend against the generally accepted standards of decency and morality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10342420\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/904/685/#p687\">\n    904 P.2d 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687-88 (Utah 1995) (citation omitted). The trial court concluded that under relevant precedent, the IIED claim that Appellants asserted could not survive as a matter of law, where they \"fail[ed] to allege a distinct and palpable injury that isn't derivative of the harm to the companies.\" (Citing\n   <em>\n    Stone Flood &amp; Fire Restoration, Inc. v.Safeco Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984284\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/170/\">\n    2011 UT 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984284\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/170/\">\n    268 P.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The court further concluded that \"as a matter of law there is not an allegation of sufficiently outrageous conduct to give rise to a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b613 Appellants brought an IIED claim for alleged behavior connected to KeyBank's failure to pay Draw Request No. 6. Appellants argue that because there were disputed facts regarding whether KeyBank \"fail[ed] to fund Draw 6 in a timely manner\" and \"failed to cooperate with API's replacement financing,\" summary judgment was inappropriate and the IIED claim should have been decided at trial. But in granting summary judgment on this issue, the trial court did not find facts or even conclude that there were no disputed facts. Instead, its ruling implicitly determined that any disputed facts were immaterial. In other words, whether or not KeyBank failed to fund the draw request or cooperate with replacement financing had no bearing on the outcome of the case; what mattered is that Appellants asserted the claim on behalf of two corporate entities and a private individual, revealing that either the claim was made on behalf of a corporation or the claim was derivative of injury to a corporation. Both situations required the trial court to grant summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 To begin, Keyes's claim for IIED could not stand inasmuch as it rested on conduct directed at either API or UBA. In\n   <em>\n    Stone Flood\n   </em>\n   , our supreme court addressed an analogous situation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-44. The court considered whether shareholders could pursue a claim for IIED that stemmed from an injury to a corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Ultimately, the court concluded that the shareholders could not \"pursue damages for injuries that are derivative of the corporation's.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 Relying on\n   <em>\n    Stone Flood\n   </em>\n   , the trial court determined that \"all of the acts that are alleged ... should be dismissed under that decision because they fail to allege a distinct and palpable injury that isn't derivative of the harm to the companies.\" We agree. Appellants claim that summary judgment was inappropriate because \"KeyBank failed to submit or lost Draw 6 on multiple occasions,\" \"lied to Camco about Mr. Keyes not approving payment,\" \"failed to cooperate with API's replacement financing,\" and \"wrongly raised the payoff amount\" of the loan. But all of these alleged facts speak to conduct directed at corporations. Under\n   <em>\n    Stone Flood\n   </em>\n   , a private individual cannot succeed on an IIED claim for such behavior.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 Likewise, neither API nor UBA could recover for the alleged conduct. Several jurisdictions have expressly held that corporations cannot suffer emotional distress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is a logical tenet: because \"a corporation lacks the cognizant ability to experience emotions, a corporation cannot suffer emotional distress. Thus, no claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress lies.\"\n   <em>\n    FDIC v. Hulsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515635\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/22/1472/#p1489\">\n    22 F.3d 1472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1489 (10th Cir. 1994). We are persuaded by this tenet and therefore conclude that, contrary to Appellants' assertion, the trial court's ruling on this issue did not disregard any material disputes of fact. It is undisputed that both API and UBA are corporate entities; as such, they are-as a matter of law-incapable of succeeding on a claim for IIED.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bross Enters., Inc. v. Town of Chesterton\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:13 CV 217,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205724358\">\n    2016 WL 5724358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 29, 2016). (\"The parties focus their argument on whether the conduct ... is outrageous enough to establish the tort. In so doing they miss a larger problem: the only plaintiff in this action is a corporation, and a corporation cannot suffer mental anguish\n   and so cannot recover in tort for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 The parties and the trial court also addressed an issue personally experienced by Keyes, which both the parties and the court referred to as stalking. Appellants argue they presented evidence that KeyBank's stalking inflicted severe emotional distress upon Keyes and his family: \"his family going into hiding because they felt threatened, serious stress-related health issues, financial ruin.\" But this recitation of evidence presented deals only with the result of KeyBank's behavior; it does not address the behavior itself. This is problematic, given that the trial court's grant of summary judgment rested on its assessment of Key Bank's behavior and its conclusion that the behavior was \"not sufficiently outrageous to justify a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\" In forming this conclusion, the trial court recounted the behavior at issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   What we're talking about here is three visits to the API facility by Mr. Preston, which he may, or may not, have had business there and may, or may not, have ever seen Mr. Keyes, and one incident where he may, or may not, have been parked on the same street as the Keyes family. There isn't any spin that you could put on that that makes that, in and of itself, rise to the level of outrageous conduct ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court granted KeyBank's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b618 Appellants argue that the trial court should have denied the motion \"because of genuine [disputes] ... of material fact.\" But in so arguing, Appellants do nothing more than set forth the same facts the trial court relied on in concluding that the conduct did not rise to the level necessary for intentional infliction of emotional distress. What one would expect Appellants to focus on, instead, is how the trial court's conclusion-that the conduct was not sufficiently outrageous-was erroneous. But on this point, Appellants again state only that \"there were facts precluding summary judgment.\" Even if this were enough to satisfy Appellants' briefing requirements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   we would affirm because the trial court correctly determined that the conduct, as alleged, was insufficient to rise to an outrageous level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b619 In\n   <em>\n    Nguyen v.

That is essentially what we have here. The trial court concluded that, as a matter of law, the conduct at issue in the present case was not outrageous. The court was entitled to form such a conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prince v. Bear River Mutual Ins.

Lost Profits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b621 Appellants next challenge the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of KeyBank on Appellants' claim for lost profits. Essentially, Appellants had claimed that KeyBank's \"failure to timely pay draw requests resulted in a failure to correct the elevation difference between the baseball field and the basketball court, which made the facility unusable, and resulted in a loss of profits for the times when it otherwise would have been available to be used.\" KeyBank moved for summary judgment on this claim, which the trial court granted because \"the undisputed evidence\" showed \"that it was not [Camco]'s responsibility to fix this.\" Further, the court concluded that \"there is no admissible evidence in the record that [Camco] would have been willing to correct the elevation difference had they been timely paid with respect to draw request number 6, or the other draw requests.\" The court thus granted summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b622 Now, Appellants contend that in so ruling, the trial court erroneously \"ignored the evidence, interpreted and weighed evidence, and construed facts in a light most favorable to KeyBank.\" We conclude that even if Appellants are correct on this point, the issue is now moot.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hahnel v.

Appellants assert as a generally accepted proposition of law that a contractual jury waiver cannot be knowing and voluntary if there is \"gross inequality in bargaining power.\" In so asserting, Appellants rely on\n   <em>\n    National Equipment Rental, Ltd. v.

Because Appellants make no mention of these conflicting legal standards, what effect federal law should have on this state court case, or whether and how Utah courts have approached the issue, we conclude that this issue is inadequately briefed. Without adequate briefing on the question of whether we should adopt the rationale of\n   <em>\n    National Equipment Rental\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    IFC Credit Corp.\n   </em>\n   , we decline to consider this issue further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B. Overbroad and Ambiguous\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b634 We next consider Appellants' contention that the jury waiver in this case is unenforceable because it is overbroad and ambiguous. In introducing this argument, Appellants rely on a federal court case explaining that \"[c]ourts have considered a number of factors to determine whether a contractual waiver of the right to a jury was knowing and voluntary.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Cooperative Fin. Ass'n, Inc. v.

Thus, this issue is also inadequately briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b635 The right to a jury is indeed, as Appellants contend, an important one. But it is also waivable. Where Appellants have not demonstrated that the jury waiver included in the loan documents was unknowing, involuntary, overbroad, or ambiguous, they have not demonstrated that the waiver should not be enforced. We thus affirm the trial court's conclusion that Appellants had, in fact, waived their right to have a jury hear their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   III.

Obligation to Make Interest Payments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b638 Appellants' first argue that the trial court \"erred [in] finding KeyBank was\n   under no obligation to make interest payments.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this issue statement is insufficient to convey how the trial court actually ruled on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b639 Appellants had alleged that \"KeyBank agreed to set up and maintain a[n] automatic withdrawal system, whereby necessary payments were automatically withdrawn from API Parties' designated account.\" The trial court concluded that \"[n]owhere in the KeyBank files or documents relating to the Construction Loans is there any\" such agreement; \"[t]he Loan documents are silent as to precisely how interest payments on the Construction Loan would be handled.\" However, the trial court found \"that the Construction Loan was large enough to include amounts to pay ongoing interest during the construction phase\"; \"[t]here was confusion at KeyBank with respect to how interest payments were to be handled\"; and \"[f]or a period of time, KeyBank routinely made the monthly interest payments automatically by advancing sums sufficient to pay the interest from Construction Loan proceeds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b640 The trial court, in its findings of facts, went on to detail the sequence of events that led to Appellants' claim that KeyBank had acted inappropriately with regard to interest payments. Specifically, it explained that the standard\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   process stopped and KeyBank showed the Loan as delinquent for a few months. When the delinquency was brought to Mr. Keyes' attention, he immediately brought the interest payments current. ... As a result of this technical default, KeyBank accrued late [fees] for the interest payments that had not been paid on a timely basis. Those late fees were included as part of the payoff of the Construction Loan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b641 But the trial court ultimately found that \"[w]hen KeyBank understood what had happened, it unconditionally tendered a refund of the late payments, plus interest at the rate of ten percent to API.\" Thus, the trial court avoided answering the question of obligation, instead finding that Appellants suffered no damages by KeyBank's failure to make the interest payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b642 Whether a party has been damaged is a question for the trier of fact, whose finding we disturb only if it is clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osguthorpe v.

Under this standard, we have no difficulty affirming the trial court's finding that Appellants were not damaged. Not only were late fees refunded to Appellants, but KeyBank also included interest with the amount refunded. Appellants offer no counterargument to this conclusion;\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   they focus instead on whether \"KeyBank's failure to pay interest was a breach of the loan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b643 Because Appellants do not challenge the trial court's factual finding, and because we conclude that the finding was not clearly erroneous, we affirm on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   B. Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Bad Faith, and Breach of Loan Documents\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b644 Appellants argue that the trial court's rulings on their claims of breach of fiduciary duty, bad faith, and breach of the loan documents were erroneous. These claims arose from KeyBank's alleged conduct in failing to fund Draw Request No. 6, failing to cooperate with Appellants' attempts to refinance, and demanding a larger payoff amount than what was actually due.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before addressing these claims as they relate to each of these specific allegations, we must discuss a discrepancy between the trial\n   court's rulings and Appellants' arguments on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b645 Appellants brought each of their challenges to the trial court's summary judgment rulings in the context of claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, lost profits, and fraud.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I. But the trial court also largely disposed of Appellants' breach of fiduciary duty claims on summary judgment. It concluded that \"there is no overarching fiduciary duty between a borrower and a lender.\" It therefore granted summary judgment on all claims of breach of fiduciary duty except for those premised on \"the $15,000\" payment from Keyes to a KeyBank employee. For trial, any claims resting on \"the breach of fiduciary duty\" would be \"limited to the $15,000, and only to the extent that [Appellants] can show that [they were] entitled to more interest than [they had] been actually paid on the $15,000.\" And in the trial court's written findings and conclusions, in a section partially titled \"Breach of Fiduciary Duty,\" it explained that \"[e]ach of these claims relate to the $15,000 payment to Mr. Preston.\" The court did not address breach of fiduciary duty in any other context in its trial rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b646 Nevertheless, Appellants contend that their challenges to the trial court's rulings regarding breach of fiduciary duty stem from the court's written findings of fact and conclusions of law entered after trial. This is incongruous, as their specific challenges have nothing to do with the $15,000 at issue at trial. And because Appellants fail to even clearly identify which of the trial court's rulings they challenge, they have not carried their burden of persuasion on appeal. This is further demonstrated by the only argument we are able to make out on the question of breach of fiduciary duty: Appellants complain, \"The Trial Court limited any damages relating to a breach of fiduciary duty to only damages from the failure to replace the stolen $15,000!\" From the case law cited following this exclamation, we assume Appellants implicitly challenge the trial court's summary judgment ruling that no fiduciary duty existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b647 Even assuming such an approach was sufficient to be considered adequate briefing, we would affirm. \"Ordinarily, no fiduciary relationship exists between a bank and its customer.\"\n   <em>\n    State Bank of S. Utah v. Troy Hygro Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10347060\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/894/1270/#p1275\">\n    894 P.2d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1275 (Utah Ct. App. 1995). An exception to this general rule exists in lender-borrower relationships when one party has \"superiority\" over the other; \"there must exist a certain inequality, dependence, weakness of age, of mental strength, business intelligence, knowledge of the facts involved, or other conditions, giving to one advantage over the other.\"\n   <em>\n    First Sec. Bank of Utah, N.A. v. Banberry Dev.

Appellants do not address whether or how this exception would apply in this case, and we thus consider it appropriate to apply the general rule. The trial court was therefore correct in concluding that there was no fiduciary duty to breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b648 We thus turn our attention to the remaining issues-bad faith and breach of the loan documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   1. Failure to Pay Draw Request No. 6\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b649 In failing to timely fund Draw Request No. 6, Appellants contend, KeyBank engaged in bad faith. On this point, the trial court agreed. It explained that it \"found that the Draw Process Overview was not intended to create an express contract requiring any draw requests to be processed within a fixed period of time\" but that \"the Draw Process Overview creates expectations that are protected by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\" The trial court went on to find:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Those expectations include that KeyBank will act on any draw request within a reasonable time. The time frames set forth in the Draw Process Overview create a framework against which any delay in processing can be examined. The facts [of this case] suggest an unreasonable delay in processing Draw Request No. 6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Thus, while the trial court did not use the term \"bad faith,\" it did conclude that KeyBank's behavior was contrary to the covenant of good faith-a distinction without a difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b650 Critically, however, the trial court concluded, \"Notwithstanding this finding, the claim fails because API has proven no damages that resulted from the delay.\" In\n   other words, the trial court found there was no causation between the delay in funding Draw Request No. 6 and any damages Appellants incurred. \"Assessing causation is a question of fact, and a trial court's findings of fact will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Long v.

Appellants suggest that the trial court's finding regarding causation is erroneous because it \"is irreconcilable with other findings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b651 The main damages Appellants claim they sustained were costs associated with mechanic's liens filed against the property. They argue that if KeyBank had paid Draw Request No. 6 in a timely manner, the liens \"would never have been filed.\" However, the trial court specifically \"found that nonpayment of the draw request did not cause Camco to file a mechanics lien.\" It also found that API's failure to certify Draw Request No. 8-not KeyBank's delay in funding No. 6-triggered the lawsuit with Camco, for which Appellants sought damages from KeyBank.

In connection with the refinance it requested KeyBank verify certain facts with respect to the status of the construction and the Construction Loan. KeyBank declined to provide the verifications on the basis that the facts were inconsistent with the required verification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   It also concluded that nothing in the parties' agreements \"required or obligated KeyBank to execute the Lender's Certification or otherwise to 'provide certifications to the long term lender regarding the project in question' as alleged in ... the Second Amended Counterclaim.\" And \"[w]hen API requested KeyBank's Certifications in connection with its proposed refinance, KeyBank could not make those Certifications because they were inaccurate.\" The inaccuracies referenced by the trial court included that there was no default on the loan, that construction had been completed according to final plans and specifications, and that there were no mechanic's liens on the property. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that KeyBank had breached no obligation in its behavior during API's attempts to refinance. This conclusion amounts to an implicit finding that KeyBank did not act in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b654 Appellants do not address these findings or conclusions. Instead, they focus the relevant section of their brief-a meager two paragraphs-on reasserting evidence they seem to believe weighed in favor of finding for Appellants on this issue. Recasting the evidence that was in front of the trial court is insufficient to demonstrate that a court's factual finding was clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ProMax Dev.

Demanding More than Was Due\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b655 Included in the section of their brief dealing with supposed bad faith and breaches of loan documents, Appellants argue that \"KeyBank demanded more than was due to payoff the Construction Loan.\" They do not explain whether this behavior amounted to bad faith or a breach of the parties' agreements. We thus assume that this issue is meant to challenge the trial court's factual findings regarding the payoff amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b656 The trial court found that KeyBank provided proper payoff amounts, was not required to provide the payoff amount within a certain period of time, and assessed contractual amounts in good faith and in accordance with relevant contractual terms. Based on these findings, the trial court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   [t]he only amounts that were improperly included in the payoff were a few late fees based upon interest payments that were not paid timely during the Construction Loan phase. Ultimately, KeyBank returned those late fees, plus interest at the rate of ten percent. There was no evidence of any ongoing damage to the relationship between API and its takeout lender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b657 Nowhere in the relevant section of their brief do Appellants address the trial court's findings or related conclusions. Furthermore, they provide no citation to case law or other legal authority. Instead, they address only the evidence presented that would have supported a finding that \"KeyBank failed to give\" \"a good faith and prompt payoff information when[ ] requested,\" thus breaching \"the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b658 When challenging factual findings on appeal, appellants are expected to carry a heavy burden. Appellants here \"appear[ ] to have misapprehended this burden because [they have] presented no legal arguments as to the sufficiency of the evidence. Rather, [they have] used the appeal as an opportunity to re-argue the factual case presented in the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    ASC Utah, Inc. v.

Denial of Mistrial Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b659 Finally, Appellants argue that the trial court erred by not granting them a new trial. Appellants' position is that the court should have granted them a new trial because of \"[i]rregularity in the [proceedings] of the court, jury or [opposing] party, or any order of the court, or abuse of discretion by which [a] party was prevented from having a fair trial.\" (Quoting Utah R. Civ. P. 59(a)(1).)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   This rule is only in force subject to the provisions of Rule 61, which states: \"No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence, and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties, is ground for granting a new trial or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\" The question before us, then, is whether the admitted evidence affected the substantial rights of the parties. If so, it was grounds for a new trial. If not, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Barrientos ex rel. Nelson v.

Second, Appellants do not identify what irregularities occurred during the trial that would justify a new trial. Third, Appellants make no mention of how \"the substantial rights of the parties\" were affected, thus warranting a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b661 Following trial, Appellants filed a Motion for Mistrial. The motion and its supporting memorandum made no mention of rules 59 or 61, nor did they use the term new\n   trial. The trial court ruled that Appellants had \"not provided the Court with any binding or persuasive legal authority which supports the proposition that a party can move for a mistrial over six months after the trial ha[d] concluded. Therefore, the Court reject[ed] [Appellants'] Motion on those grounds alone.\" Appellants make no mention of this rationale for the trial court denying their motion. \"This court will not reverse a ruling of the trial court that rests on independent alternative grounds where the appellant challenges only one of those grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake County v.

Appellants do not explain how rules 59 and 61 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure should operate to support their position. Thus, we have no occasion to reverse the trial court on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b663 In short, we affirm.

KeyBank breached that duty by allowing $15,000 to go to a bank Vice-President. KeyBank failed to disclose and worked to conceal these facts from API.

In the argument section of Appellants' brief, they assert the general law regarding the constitutional right to a jury, then re-argue the reasons the waiver should not be enforced. Finally, at the end of their argument, Appellants mention the trial court's Order Denying Motion to Reinstate.
