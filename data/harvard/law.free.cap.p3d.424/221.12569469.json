LAWS OF 2007, ch. 72, \u00a7 2. RCW 51.32.099 is a pilot program designed \"to create improved vocational outcomes for Washington state injured workers and employers.\" RCW 51.32.099(1)(a). The purpose of the pilot program is to permit injured workers to return to work.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   This pilot vocational system is intended to allow opportunities for eligible workers to participate in meaningful retraining in high-demand occupations, improve successful return to work and achieve positive outcomes for workers, reduce the incidence of repeat vocational services, increase accountability and responsibility, and improve cost predictability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   RCW 51.32.099(1)(a).

RCW 51.32.099(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 When an injured worker files a claim, the Department must determine whether \"vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to make the worker employable at gainful employment.\" RCW 51.32.099(2)(b). If the Department makes that determination, the worker is referred to a vocational professional to develop a vocational rehabilitation plan. RCW 51.32.099(1)(b)(i). The Department must \"review and approve the vocational plan.\" RCW 51.32.099(4)(a). If approved, the worker must elect either to participate in the plan, \"Option 1,\" or not participate, \"Option 2.\" RCW 51.32.099(4)(a), (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 The decision to elect Option 2 means \"[t]he worker declines further vocational services under the claim and receives an amount equal to six months of temporary total disability compensation under RCW 51.32.090.\" RCW 51.32.099(4)(b). The vocational funds set aside under RCW 51.32.099(3)(d) remain available to the worker for five years. RCW 51.32.099(4)(b). The Department \"must issue an order as provided in RCW 51.52.050 confirming the option 2 election, setting a payment schedule, and terminating temporary total disability benefits effective the date of the order confirming that election.\" RCW 51.32.099(4)(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 After issuing the order confirming the election of Option 2, the Department \"must thereafter close the claim.\" RCW 51.32.099(4)(b). The worker \"is not entitled to further temporary total, or to permanent total, disability benefits except upon a showing of a worsening in the condition or conditions accepted under the claim such that claim closure is not appropriate.\" RCW 51.32.099(4)(b).

McCaulley returned to work as a boat hoist operator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 In November 2007, McCaulley filed an application to reopen his claim. The Department reopened McCaulley's claim effective November 28, 2007. On July 23, 2008, McCaulley underwent a second hemilaminectomy. The Department then referred McCaulley to a vocational professional to develop a vocational rehabilitation plan. McCaulley participated in vocational testing. On February 27, 2014, McCaulley's attending physician, Dr. Dianna Chamblin, approved an analysis for the job of \"office helper\" if McCaulley could use an ergonomic chair and voice-activated software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 On May 19, 2014, the Department notified McCaulley that it approved the vocational\n   rehabilitation plan for the job of office helper. The Department informed McCaulley, \"You have a choice to participate in your training plan (Option 1) or receive a vocational award with retraining benefits (Option 2).\" The Department stated that if McCaulley elects Option 2, his \"time-loss benefits will end,\" he \"will receive an award equal to six months of time-loss benefits,\" and he would have five years or up to $17,599.11 available to attend a licensed, accredited, or Department-approved school or training program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 On May 20, McCaulley filed a protest of the May 19 approval of the vocational rehabilitation plan. McCaulley asserted he lacked the basic literacy and computer skills to succeed in the retraining program and, instead, the Department should consider awarding permanent total disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 On June 11, Department Director Joel Sacks rejected the protest. \"After reviewing the facts of this case, I have decided that vocational rehabilitation plan services are needed to help Mr. McCaulley return to work.\" Sacks said McCaulley \"may now choose to proceed with the approved plan or select Vocational Option 2.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   McCaulley did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Option 2 Election\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 On June 24, 2014, McCaulley submitted the \"Retraining Plan Option Form.\" McCaulley selected Option 2.

The Department determined that he was entitled to a vocational award equivalent to six months of time-loss benefits of $10,099.80. McCaulley received biweekly payments from July 21, 2014 through January 5, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 15 The Department closed McCaulley's claim on August 6, 2014.

McCaulley asserted he was entitled to permanent total disability benefits without showing worsening of his condition under the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Department filed a motion for summary judgment. The Department argued that under RCW 51.32.099(4)(b), McCaulley could seek permanent total disability benefits only if he showed \"worsening\" of the accepted condition such that the decision to close the claim was inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 18 An industrial appeals judge (IAJ) held a hearing on the motion for summary judgment. On July 16, 2015, the IAJ issued a \"Proposed Decision and Order\" affirming the July 7 order confirming McCaulley's Option 2 election and the August 6 order closing his claim. The IAJ concluded, as a matter of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Because Mr. McCaulley elected \"Option 2\" benefits, he is not entitled to time-loss [ (temporary total disability) ] compensation or pension [ (permanent total disability) ] benefits, because he did not show or even contend that the conditions accepted under the claim have worsened, such that claim closure is inappropriate. RCW 51.32.099(4)(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 19 McCaulley appealed to the Board. The Board adopted the Proposed Decision and Order as its final order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 20 McCaulley filed an appeal of the Board's decision in superior court. The court affirmed the Board's Decision and Order. The superior court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and judgment in favor of the Department. The court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Under RCW 51.32.099(4)(b), a worker who selects option 2 benefits may not receive additional temporary total disability benefits or permanent total disability benefits after having made that selection, unless the worker demonstrates that there has been a \"worsening\" such that \"claim closure is not appropriate.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 21 McCaulley appeals the decision of the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 22 In an appeal from the Board, the superior court acts in an appellate capacity and reviews the decision de novo \"based solely on the evidence and testimony presented to the Board.\"\n   <em>\n    Leuluaialii v.
