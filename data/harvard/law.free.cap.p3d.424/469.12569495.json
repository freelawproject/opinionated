BLNR subsequently addressed the University's request for its consent to the Sublease at two separate public meetings. At both meetings, Appellant-Appellee E. Kalani Flores (Flores) orally requested that BLNR hold a contested case hearing prior to making a decision on the matter. Following the second meeting, Flores filed a written petition for a contested case hearing. BLNR denied Flores's request and consented to the Sublease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Flores appealed BLNR's denial of his request for a contested case hearing to the Environmental Court of the Third Circuit (environmental court). The environmental court ruled that based upon this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Board of Land and Natural Resources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n    136 Hawai'i 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n    363 P.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), BLNR infringed upon Flores's constitutional rights by rejecting his request for a contested case hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On secondary appeal, BLNR and the University argue that the environmental court erred in ruling that Flores was entitled to a contested case hearing because: (1) BLNR's consent to the Sublease did not fall within the purview of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 91, as BLNR was acting as a landlord engaged in the custodial management of public property; and (2) a contested case hearing was not required by law because\n   it was not mandated by statute, administrative rule, or due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons stated below, we reject BLNR's and the University's argument that HRS Chapter 91 does not apply in this case. However, we agree with BLNR and the University that BLNR was not required to hold a contested case hearing prior to consenting to the Sublease because such a hearing was not required by statute, administrative rule, or due process under the circumstances of this case. Consequently, we hold that the environmental court erred in ruling that BLNR violated Flores's constitutional rights when it denied his request for a contested case hearing in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the environmental court's January 6, 2017 Final Judgment and \"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Appellees State of Hawai'i, Board of Land and Natural Resources, Department of Land and Natural Resources, and Chairperson Suzanne D. Case's Motion for Stay of Proceedings, or in the Alternative for the Court to Issue its Decision on Appeal, Filed October 25, 2016; Vacating Consent to Sublease and Non-Exclusive Easement Agreement Between TMT International Observatory LLC and the University of Hawaii Under General Lease No. S-4191; and Remanding Matter to the Board of Land and Natural Resources\" (Order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 21, 1968, BLNR leased the land within the Mauna Kea Science Reserve to the University for a term of sixty-five years (Master Lease). The Master Lease is set to expire on December 31, 2033, and permits the University to use the leased premises \"as a scientific complex, including without limitation thereof an observatory, and as a scientific reserve being more specifically a buffer zone to prevent the intrusion of activities inimical to said scientific complex.\" Pursuant to paragraph five of the Master Lease, the University \"shall not sublease ... any rights thereunder without the prior written approval of [BLNR].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 22, 2014, Donald O. Straney (Straney), the Chancellor of the University of Hawai'i at Hilo, sent BLNR a written request for BLNR's approval and consent to the Sublease. Straney stated that the University intended to sublease an 8.7-acre portion of the Mauna Kea Science Reserve, which was covered by the Master Lease, to TIO for the construction and operation of the TMT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Sublease is set to expire on December 31, 2033, the same date that the Master Lease is set to terminate. With respect to the use of the subleased premises, the Sublease provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Sublessee shall use the Subleased Premises solely to construct and operate the TMT Facilities in accordance with this Sublease and the Scientific Cooperation Agreement. The construction and operation of the Subleased Premises shall be conducted in strict compliance with the terms and conditions of Conservation District Use Permit HA-3568 approved by the Lessor on April 12, 2013 (the \"TMT CDUP\"), including performance of all mitigation conditions set forth therein, and any amended or subsequent Conservation District Use Permit. Sublessee shall not at any time during the term of this Sublease construct, place, maintain, or install on the Subleased Premises any other building, structure, or improvement without the prior written approval of Sublessor and Lessor and upon such conditions as Sublessor or Lessor may impose. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, any other \"improvement\" means improvements that are not specified in or contemplated by the TMT CDUP and not contained within the building envelop of TMT observatory plans approved in accordance with Section 37 below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Concerning the rights of Native Hawaiians with respect to the subleased premises, the Sublease provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Constitution of the State of Hawaii mandates the protection of recognized customary and traditional native Hawaiian rights subject to State regulation. This Sublease shall be subject to the right of Native Hawaiians to exercise protected traditional and customary practices as provided in the [Comprehensive Management Plan] and consistent with the laws of the State of Hawaii.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. BLNR Administrative Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 13, 2014, BLNR held a public meeting addressing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the University's\n   request for BLNR's consent to the Sublease (first public meeting). At the first public meeting, Flores provided oral and written testimony on the numerous reasons underlying his position that BLNR should not consent to the Sublease, and orally requested that BLNR hold a contested case hearing before rendering a decision on the University's request. No action was taken on Flores's request for a contested case hearing at the first public meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ultimately, BLNR did not rule on the University's request for BLNR's consent to the Sublease at the first public meeting. Instead, BLNR deferred the issue for consideration at a later date to allow the University to address the questions and issues raised during the public testimony on the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   BLNR revisited the University's request for BLNR's consent to the Sublease at a public meeting held on June 27, 2014 (second public meeting). At the second public meeting, Flores provided further oral testimony and submitted additional written testimony explaining the reasons why, in his view, BLNR should not consent to the Sublease. Flores also orally renewed his request for a contested case hearing and submitted a written petition for a contested case hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the completion of public testimony at the second public meeting, BLNR approved the University's request for its consent to the Sublease. However, BLNR provided that the effect of its consent was \"stayed ... until administrative proceedings on any contested case requests are concluded.\" No action was taken regarding Flores's request for a contested case hearing at the second public meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 3, 2014, Flores filed his written petition for a contested case hearing. Flores stated that his interest in BLNR's consent to the Sublease, which entitled him to a contested case hearing, stemmed from,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , his interest in participating in \"traditional and customary practices\" on the subleased premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the receipt of Flores's request, the Acting Administrator of BLNR completed a staff report recommending that Flores's request be denied. According to the staff report, no statute or administrative rule required BLNR to hold a contested case hearing prior to consenting to a sublease of public lands. The staff report also concluded that the due process clause of the Hawai'i Constitution did not mandate BLNR to hold a contested case hearing, as Flores did not demonstrate that he had a property interest in BLNR's consent to the Sublease. Lastly, the staff report stated that BLNR was not required to hold a contested case hearing before consenting to the Sublease because such action \"is a matter of internal land management, and not subject to a contested case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   BLNR addressed Flores's request for a contested case hearing at a public meeting held on July 25, 2014 (third public meeting). At the third public meeting, Flores orally testified that BLNR's approval of the Sublease at the second public meeting was invalid, and submitted further written testimony on the matter. After hearing all of the public testimony on the matter, BLNR approved the staff report's recommendation, and denied Flores's request for a contested case hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   BLNR issued its formal written consent to the Sublease on April, 9, 2015 (Consent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Appellate Proceedings at the Environmental Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On August 25, 2014, Flores appealed the denial of his request for a contested case hearing to the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit. The case was transferred to the environmental court on October 2, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   opening brief, Flores argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that BLNR erred in denying his\n   request for a contested case hearing because, among other reasons, Flores \"is a traditional and customary practitioner whose rights this Court should acknowledge by allowing his participation in the requested contested case hearing.\" Additionally, Flores argued that BLNR infringed upon his constitutional right to due process by consenting to the Sublease before resolving his request for a contested case hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In their answering briefs, BLNR and the University countered that BLNR properly denied Flores's request for a contested case hearing because his request was not supported by statute or any administrative rules, and because Flores did not have a due process right to a contested case hearing insofar as he did not demonstrate that he had a constitutionally cognizable property interest in the Sublease. Further, BLNR and the University argued that Flores was not entitled to a contested case hearing because BLNR's consent to the Sublease was a matter of internal agency management, and fell outside the purview of HRS Chapter 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After the answering briefs were filed, this court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   . At issue in\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   was whether BLNR violated the appellants' due process rights by issuing a Conservation District Use Permit (CDUP) authorizing the TMT's construction before holding a contested case hearing on the matter.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n    136 Hawai'i at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n    363 P.3d at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court first held that the appellants were entitled to a contested case hearing, reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Given the substantial interests of Native Hawaiians in pursuing their cultural practices on Mauna Kea, the risk of an erroneous deprivation absent the protections provided by a contested case hearing, and the lack of undue burden on the government in affording Appellants a contested case hearing, a contested case hearing was \"required by law\"\n   <em>\n    regardless\n   </em>\n   of whether BLNR had voted to approve one on its own motion at the February 25, 2011 meeting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n    at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n    363 P.3d at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sandy Beach Def.

The\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   court then concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In sum, BLNR put the cart before the horse when it approved the permit before the contested case hearing was held. Once the permit was granted, Appellants were denied the most basic element of procedural due process-an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Our constitution demands more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20P.2d%20250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=773%20P.2d%20250\">\n    at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n    363 P.3d at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, this court vacated the circuit court's decision affirming BLNR's order granting a CDUP for the TMT project.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n    at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n    363 P.3d at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case was remanded to the circuit court to further remand the case to BLNR, so that another contested case hearing could be conducted before BLNR or a new hearing officer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12311407\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/136/376/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 13, 2016, Flores filed his reply brief. Flores requested that the environmental court take judicial notice of this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   , which, he argued, further supported that BLNR should have held a contested case hearing before consenting to the Sublease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the oral argument regarding Flores's appeal, the environmental court took judicial notice of this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   and the order of remand that was filed in that case. Subsequently, the environmental court orally ordered that the case be remanded to BLNR so that BLNR may consider the opinion and the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On April 5, 2016, the environmental court filed an order remanding the case to BLNR pursuant to HRS \u00a7 91-14(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The environmental court ruled that the fact that the CDUP had been vacated was \"material because the Sublease and Consent are premised\n   upon the existence of the TMT CDUP,\" and noted that \"[t]his fact could not have been presented to [BLNR] when it considered the application for the consent to the Sublease because the fact did not exist at that time.\" Therefore, the environmental court remanded the case to BLNR to reconsider its decision to consent to the Sublease in light of\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On October 25, 2016, BLNR filed a motion to stay the proceedings in Flores's appeal until, pursuant to this court's mandate in\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   , BLNR determined whether to issue the CDUP after holding another contested case hearing on the matter. Alternatively, BLNR requested that the environmental court \"issue its decision on appeal at this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Flores, now represented by counsel, objected to BLNR's request for a stay, but joined in BLNR's request for an immediate decision. Flores argued that \"[a]s there is no just reason to delay a decision at this time, this Court should go ahead and rule\" on whether Flores \"has a right to a contested case hearing\" and \"whether [BLNR's] Consent to [the] sublease entered into between [the University] and [TIO] is valid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In reply, BLNR asserted that if the environmental court issued a ruling on the appeal, the ruling should be limited to whether Flores was entitled to a contested case hearing because \"[t]he sole issue in this administrative appeal is whether a contested case should have been held. The merits of the consent are not at issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On January 6, 2017, the environmental court filed the Order. The Order denied BLNR's request for a stay of proceedings, but granted BLNR's alternative request for a decision on appeal. In rendering its decision, the environmental court took judicial notice of\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   , and concluded that \"Flores was denied the right to a contested case hearing on the subject Consent to Sublease in violation of his constitutional right to a hearing under Article 12, Section 7 of the Hawai'i Constitution and\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   , and specifically section IV of the concurring opinion therein.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, the Order vacated the environmental court's April 5, 2016 order remanding the case to BLNR, vacated the Consent, and remanded the case to BLNR for further proceedings consistent with the Order. Final judgment was entered on January 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Secondary Appeal and Transfer to this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On February 3, 2017, BLNR timely appealed the environmental court's final judgment and Order. The University filed its cross-appeal from the environmental court's final judgment and Order on February 21, 2017. The case was transferred to this court on June 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Subsequent Administrative Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   While Flores's case on secondary appeal was pending, a second contested case hearing was held on whether BLNR should issue the CDUP that would authorize the construction of the TMT project. The parties do not appear to dispute that Flores participated in this contested case hearing by presenting evidence, including a copy of the Sublease,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and arguments regarding how the TMT's construction would affect Flores's interest in participating in traditional Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

First, this court reaffirmed that HRS Chapter 91 procedures are not universally required in all circumstances where an individual is negatively impacted by an agency action.\n   <em>\n    Sharma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1429373\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/66/632/\">\n    66 Haw. at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20P.2d%201030\">\n    673 P.2d at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Sharma\n   </em>\n   court referred to previous decisions demonstrating that this principle has been recognized and applied in the past, in cases where this court held that an agency is not required to follow\n   HRS Chapter 91's rulemaking procedures when engaged in internal management matters by way of the custodial management of public property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 637-38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20P.2d%201030\">\n    673 P.2d at 1033-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, this court determined that BLNR was not required to hold a contested case hearing before terminating Sharma's lease because HRS \u00a7 171-39 did not require BLNR to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 639-640,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20P.2d%201030\">\n    673 P.2d at 1035-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lastly, the\n   <em>\n    Sharma\n   </em>\n   court held that a contested case hearing was not required by due process because the lease was valid and enforceable, and because Sharma had received sufficient notice and was afforded an adequate opportunity to be heard on whether he had complied with the lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 641,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20P.2d%201030\">\n    673 P.2d at 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The foregoing illustrates that BLNR and the University's arguments premised upon\n   <em>\n    Sharma\n   </em>\n   are without merit for two reasons. First, this court did not, as BLNR and the University contend, announce a general rule providing that whenever BLNR acts in relation to a lease as a landlord, such actions fall outside the purview of HRS Chapter 91 because they constitute the custodial management of public property and relate to matters of internal agency management. Second, the University and BLNR incorrectly assert that this court held that Sharma was not entitled to a contested case hearing because BLNR engaged in the custodial management of public property by terminating his lease. Rather, the\n   <em>\n    Sharma\n   </em>\n   court held that BLNR did not have to hold a contested case before terminating Sharma's lease because such a hearing was not required by statute or due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Likewise,\n   <em>\n    Big Island Small Ranchers\n   </em>\n   does not support BLNR's and the University's contention that HRS Chapter 91 does not apply in this case. In that case, BLNR decided to auction leases of certain parcels and lots of public land to qualified bidders.\n   <em>\n    Big Island Small Ranchers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436408\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/60/228/\">\n    60 Haw. at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20P.2d%20430\">\n    588 P.2d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before the auction was held, the appellants filed a lawsuit against BLNR, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that BLNR's authorization of the public auction was null and void because BLNR engaged in \"rulemaking\" when it took such action, but failed to comply with the formal rulemaking procedures prescribed in HRS Chapter 91.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 230,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20P.2d%20430\">\n    588 P.2d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On appeal, this court affirmed, holding that BLNR was not required to comply with the rulemaking requirements in HRS Chapter 91 because \"the conduct of the State in this case comes within the 'custodial management of ... property' exception to Chapter 91.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 239,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20P.2d%20430\">\n    588 P.2d at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting HRS \u00a7 91-1(4) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   BLNR and the University's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Big Island Small Ranchers\n   </em>\n   is misplaced for two reasons. First,\n   <em>\n    Big Island Small Ranchers\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case insofar as there, the appellants specifically argued that BLNR, in deciding to auction the leases for the parcels of public land, had improperly engaged in rulemaking without complying with the requisite procedures under HRS Chapter 91. By contrast, here, Flores does not argue that BLNR engaged in rulemaking when it consented to the Sublease, such that BLNR was required to comply with the procedures related to rulemaking in HRS Chapter 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, BLNR and the University construe the holding in\n   <em>\n    Big Island Small Ranchers\n   </em>\n   too broadly. In that case, this court did not hold that whenever BLNR acts as a landlord in matters relating to leases of public lands, such actions categorically qualify as the custodial management of public property, and therefore, constitute matters of internal agency management, which fall outside the scope of HRS Chapter 91. Rather, this court rejected the appellants' argument that BLNR had engaged in rulemaking and was thus required to comply with HRS Chapter 91's rulemaking procedures, based on its conclusion that BLNR's auctioning of leases for public lands amounted to the custodial management of public property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Therefore, we conclude BLNR and the University's arguments based upon\n   <em>\n    Sharma\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Big Island Small Ranchers\n   </em>\n   are unavailing. These cases do not establish that BLNR's actions in this case fall outside the scope of HRS Chapter 91. Accordingly, we consider whether BLNR was required to\n   hold a contested case hearing under HRS Chapter 91 before consenting to the Sublease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

HRS \u00a7 171-36(a)(6) (2011) establishes the restrictions that apply to subleases of public lands, and states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (6) The lessee shall not sublet the whole or any part of the demised premises except with the approval of the board; provided that prior to the approval, the board shall have the right to review and approve the rent to be charged to the sublessee; provided further that in the case where the lessee is required to pay rent based on a percentage of its gross receipts, the receipts of the sublessee shall be included as part of the lessee's gross receipts; provided further that the board shall have the right to review and, if necessary, revise the rent of the demised premises based upon the rental rate charged to the sublessee including the percentage rent, if applicable, and provided that the rent may not be revised downward[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In other words, HRS \u00a7 171-36(a)(6) provides that a sublease of public lands is not valid unless BLNR approves of it. In deciding whether to consent to a sublease, BLNR may review and approve the rent that will be charged under the sublease, and may review and raise the rent on the primary lease based upon the rent to be charged under the sublease. HRS \u00a7 171-36(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   However, HRS \u00a7 171-36(a)(6) does not contain any language that states or otherwise suggests that BLNR must hold a contested case hearing before consenting to a sublease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 171-36(a)(6).

A contested case hearing was not required by administrative rule.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Although BLNR does not advance any arguments on this point, the University argues that a contested case hearing was not required by administrative rule. The University asserts that \"there is nothing in the [Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) ] Rules, [Hawai'i Administrative Rules (HAR) ] Title 13, that requires a public hearing for a consent to a sublease.\" The University also notes that while several provisions of HAR Title 13 require BLNR to hold a hearing before taking other actions, \"[t]here is no similar requirement for a hearing in relation to the BLNR's consent to a sublease.\" Thus, the University concludes that there was no rule-based mandate requiring BLNR to hold a contested case hearing before consenting to the Sublease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   HAR Title 13 \"governs practice and procedure before the board of land and natural resources of the State of Hawaii under chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), the public land laws of the State and such other related acts as may now or hereafter be administered by the board.\" HAR \u00a7 13-1-1 (2009). The University correctly observes that a few subsections in HAR Title 13 expressly require BLNR to hold a contested case hearing in specific circumstances. For\n   example, HAR \u00a7 13-184-11(1) requires BLNR to conduct a contested case hearing in matters concerning geothermal developmental activities within a geothermal resource subzone. HAR \u00a7 13-184-11(1) (2009) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (1) The use of an area for geothermal development activities within a geothermal resource subzone shall be governed by the board, if such activities lie within a conservation use district.\n   <em>\n    If geothermal development activities are proposed within a conservation district, then, after receipt of a properly filed and completed application, the board shall conduct a public hearing and, upon appropriate request, a contested case hearing pursuant to chapter 91, Hawaii Revised Statutes, to determine whether, pursuant to board regulations, a conservation district use permit shall be granted to authorize the geothermal development activities described in the application\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Similarly, HAR \u00a7 13-300-38, which governs determinations regarding the appropriate treatment of a previously identified Native Hawaiian burial site, provides that when a determination is made, BLNR must notify the applicant in writing \"[t]hat an applicant who disagrees with the determination has the option to request reconsideration or appeal the decision as a contested case[.]\" HAR \u00a7 13-300-38(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Thus, HAR \u00a7\u00a7 13-184-11(1) and 13-300-38 illustrate that some subsections of HAR Title 13 contain language that explicitly requires BLNR to hold a contested case in certain circumstances, or entitles an aggrieved individual to a contested case hearing upon appropriate request. However, HAR Title 13 does not contain any provisions relating to BLNR's authority to consent to a sublease of public lands, or the matter of whether BLNR is required to conduct a contested case hearing prior to consenting to a sublease. Therefore, we conclude \"there is no rule-based requirement to hold a [contested case] hearing\" in the case at bar.\n   <em>\n    In re 'Iao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312399\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/128/228/#p239\">\n    128 Hawai'i at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312399\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/128/228/#p239\">\n    287 P.3d at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

However, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the Sublease and the Consent had an impact on Flores's interest under the specific circumstances of this case, we believe that there is no risk of erroneous deprivation, because Flores has already been afforded a full opportunity to participate in a contested case hearing and express his views and concerns on the matter, and he has not persuaded us that the provision of an additional contested case hearing is necessary to adequately safeguard against erroneous deprivation in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The parties do not dispute that Flores participated extensively in the separate contested case hearing on the issuance of the CDUP that would authorize the TMT's construction by presenting evidence, including a copy of the Sublease,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and arguments concerning the effect that the TMT's construction will have on his right to participate in traditional Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea. In this case, it appears that Flores seeks a distinct contested case hearing on the Consent in order to express the same concerns, and to vindicate the same interests, that he previously raised in the contested case hearing on the CDUP. Moreover, Flores does not clarify the extent to which, if BLNR held a contested case hearing on the Consent, he would put forth evidence and arguments materially different from that which he already proffered at the CDUP contested case hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On this particular record, we are not convinced that an\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   contested case hearing would offer any probable value in protecting against the erroneous deprivation of his interest in engaging in traditional Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Considering the third\n   <em>\n    Sandy Beach\n   </em>\n   factor in light of the foregoing, it appears that BLNR has a strong interest in not having to hold a separate contested case hearing in this case. Put simply, to mandate BLNR to hold a full contested case hearing on whether it should consent to the Sublease would require BLNR to bear the duplicative administrative burden of providing procedural protections that would be of no additional value in safeguarding Flores's interest in engaging in traditional Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briggs v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518979\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/954/534/#p539\">\n    954 F.2d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 539-40 (9th Cir. 1992) (determining that, in applying the federal equivalent of the\n   <em>\n    Sandy Beach Defense Fund\n   </em>\n   balancing test, plaintiffs were not entitled to more detailed, thorough procedures because the government had a significant interest in not having to bear the substantial fiscal and administrative burdens of administering the enhanced procedures when such procedures would not substantially improve the risk of erroneous deprivation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In sum, Flores seeks to protect an interest that this court has previously recognized as substantial-his interest in participating in traditional Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea. Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguen\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   that the Sublease and Consent would impact this interest under the specific circumstances of this case, we believe that there is no risk of its erroneous deprivation absent an additional contested case hearing, because the record demonstrates that Flores has already participated in the separate contested case hearing on the CDUP, and was thereby afforded a full and fair opportunity to express his views and concerns as to the effect that the Sublease, the Consent, and the TMT's construction would have on his interest in engaging in traditional Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea. To require BLNR to hold another contested case hearing in such circumstances would require BLNR to shoulder duplicative administrative burdens and comply with additional procedural requirements that would offer no further protective value. Based upon the foregoing consideration of the three\n   <em>\n    Sandy Beach Defense Fund\n   </em>\n   factors and the record currently before us, we hold that BLNR did not violate Flores's constitutional right to due process by denying his request for a contested case hearing in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   To conclude, we hold that Flores was not entitled to a contested case hearing regarding whether BLNR should consent to the Sublease because, on the record in this case, such a hearing was not required by statute, administrative rule, or due process. Accordingly, the environmental court erred in ruling that \"Flores was denied the right to a contested case hearing on the subject Consent to Sublease in violation of his constitutional right to a hearing under Article 12, Section 7 of the Hawai'i State Constitution and\n   <em>\n    Mauna Kea Anaina Hou\n   </em>\n   , and specifically section IV of the concurring opinion therein.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
