Following Worker's death, her widower, Michael Lewis (Claimant), sought and the Workers' Compensation Judge (WCJ) awarded workers' compensation death benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act (the Act), NMSA 1978, 52-1-1 to 52-1-70 (1929, as amended through 2017). On appeal, Employer makes four arguments: (1) the WCJ erred in concluding that Worker's death occurred within two years of her compensable work injury, and thus that the death benefits claim was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations; (2) the WCJ erred in excluding medical records and testimony that supported Employer's position that Worker died as a result of cancer unrelated to the ABPA; (3) related to the second issue, the WCJ erred in finding that Claimant's medical evidence regarding the cause of Worker's death was uncontradicted; and (4) even if Claimant was entitled to death benefits, the amount of benefits that the WCJ awarded was erroneous. Claimant cross appeals, arguing that the WCJ erred by not awarding death benefits at 100% of Worker's compensation rate. We affirm on Employer's first argument, reverse on the second and third arguments, and affirm on the fourth\n   argument. We reverse on Claimant's cross-appeal argument. We remand for a new trial on whether Worker's ABPA caused Worker's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} Worker was employed by Employer from 1999 until 2013 and taught at Manzano High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico for a number of years. At the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year, she was assigned to teach classes in a new classroom, Room J-13. Worker complained to Employer about the presence of mold in Room J-13. Her primary care physician, Dr. John Liljestrand, began treating her for difficulty breathing on October 3, 2011. Dr. Liljestrand wrote to Employer in December 2011 advising that Worker's respiratory problems were attributable to her classroom. Thereafter, Dr. Liljestrand referred Worker to Dr. Steven Tolber, an allergist and immunologist who was already treating Worker, to be treated for her respiratory issues. Dr. Tolber began treating her for respiratory issues related to exposure to mold in Room J-13 on April 18, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} Dr. Tolber wrote a letter to Employer at the end of the 2011-2012 school year that stated Worker could not return to Room J-13. On October 22, 2012, Dr. Tolber diagnosed Worker with ABPA and stated that the ABPA was caused by Worker's exposure to aspergillus mold in her classroom. Worker regularly continued to work and earn her regular salary until December 21, 2012. From December 22, 2012 to March 31, 2013, Worker drew upon available sick leave time and thus did not lose any pay. Worker terminated her employment with Employer by retiring effective March 31, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {4} During this same general time period, Worker faced another medical condition. She had been treated for breast cancer in 1997, but the disease had been in remission until late 2012 when it was discovered to be metastatic. Worker began chemotherapy in 2013 that continued into 2014. Worker's oncologist was Dr. Richard Giudice of the New Mexico Cancer Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {5} Worker filed a claim for workers' compensation disability benefits on March 6, 2013. She alleged that her continued exposure to aspergillus mold after she started working in Room J-13 caused her disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {6} Worker's claim for disability benefits was tried over the course of two days in June 2014. The parties stipulated that Worker's employment with Employer ended on March 31, 2013, and that she had not earned her weekly wage since then. During the trial, the WCJ admitted into evidence the depositions and medical records of Dr. Liljestrand and Dr. Tolber. The WCJ also admitted Dr. Giudice's February 21, 2014 deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {7} The WCJ issued his compensation order on December 16, 2014. He made the following findings, among others: (1) Worker was exposed to aspergillus spores while teaching in her classroom at Manzano High School; (2) On October 22, 2012, Dr. Tolber diagnosed Worker with ABPA; and (3) Worker's ABPA was caused by her exposure to aspergillus in Room J-13. The WCJ specifically found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [t]here is a causal connection between Worker's accidental injury (ABPA) and her resulting disability and the injury is reasonably incident to Worker's exposure to aspergillus in [Room] J-13 ... Worker's accidental exposure to aspergillus arose out of, and occurred within the course and scope of, Worker's employment with Employer ... Worker's ABPA and resulting disability [were] a natural and direct result of her exposure to aspergillus while working for Employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {8} Additionally, the WCJ found that \"[d]ue to ABPA, Worker [was] unable to perform the duties of high school teacher since April 1, 2013.\" The WCJ awarded Worker Temporary Total Disability (TTD) benefits from April 1, 2013 to January 15, 2014. The WCJ also found that Worker suffered a compensable injury with permanent impairment and that Worker was entitled to Permanent Partial Disability (PPD) benefits of 99% from January 16, 2014 and continuing for 700 weeks. Employer did not appeal the December 16, 2014 compensation order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {9} Dr. Liljestrand last saw Worker in March 2014. Dr. Tolber last saw Worker in September 2014. Worker continued, however, to be seen by Dr. Giudice and receive treatment for her cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {10} Dr. Tolber's notes of Worker's appointments with him on May 14, 2014 and\n   May 29, 2014 reflect concern about \"fluid overload\" and shortness of breath, and whether those issues were attributable to the chemotherapy. On September 23, 2014, Worker was advised by the New Mexico Cancer Center that her white blood cell count was low due to the chemotherapy. Worker had additional appointments at the New Mexico Cancer Center on October on the 4, 7, and 21, 2014 and November 11, 2014. Worker was seen by Dr. Giudice on October 21 and November 11, 2014. On November 11, 2014, Worker complained of shortness of breath, but a chest x-ray taken that day did not reveal pneumonia. Worker was to return to Dr. Giudice the next day for further examination and treatment. While leaving her home to go to the hospital the morning of November 12, 2014, Worker collapsed and died. No autopsy was performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {11} Worker's disability benefits terminated upon her death. Section 52-1-47(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claimant filed a claim for workers' compensation death benefits on January 22, 2015 alleging that Worker's ABPA was the cause of her death. In its answer to the death benefits complaint, Employer admitted all of the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the first compensation order. Employer further admitted that the findings and conclusions in the first compensation order were binding on the death benefits proceeding. However, Employer disputed the timeliness of the death benefits claim and the cause of death. The WCJ issued a pre-trial order on October 30, 2015 indicating that prior WCA orders entered during the disability benefits proceeding on May 18, 2014 and December 16, 2014 established the law of the case as to the death benefits trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {12} The death benefits claim was tried on November 12, 2015. Claimant testified. In addition, the WCJ admitted Claimant's exhibits, which included the additional depositions of Dr. Tolber and Dr. Liljestrand that were taken on October 14 and August 20, 2015, respectively, and Worker's certificate of death, which was prepared by Dr. Liljestrand. The death certificate listed \"pneumonia\" and \"chronic pneumonitis\" as the causes of death. Dr. Liljestrand testified that Worker's ABPA was either a direct or a contributing cause of these conditions. Dr. Tolber testified that Worker \"most likely died of ABPA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {13} At the death benefits trial, Employer offered into evidence, among other exhibits, the February 21, 2014 deposition of Dr. Giudice-which had been admitted without objection during the first disability benefits trial. Employer also offered into evidence a second deposition of Dr. Giudice taken after Worker had passed away dated September 14, 2015. Claimant, however, objected to admission of the Giudice depositions and records, arguing that, under Section 52-1-51(C), only a health care provider (HCP) who has provided care for a worker's work-related injury pursuant to Section 52-1-49, or an independent medical examiner identified pursuant to Section 52-1-51(A), could testify as to the cause of death in connection with a claim for death benefits under Section 52-1-46. Because Dr. Giudice was neither an authorized HCP under Section 52-1-49 nor an independent medical examiner under 52-1-51(A), Claimant urged, he could not testify about Worker's cause of death. The WCJ agreed with Claimant and denied admission of the Giudice depositions and the New Mexico Cancer Center records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {14} In his 2015 deposition, when asked to identify the documentation that he reviewed to determine Worker's cause of death, Dr. Liljestrand could not verify that he reviewed any documentation. Instead, his cause of death determination was based on a discussion with Claimant. Dr. Liljestrand had not reviewed any information from the New Mexico Cancer Center regarding the treatment Worker had received in the fall of 2014, including on November 11. Similarly, in his 2015 deposition, Dr. Tolber acknowledged that he had not reviewed any of the records of Worker's care and treatment at the New Mexico Cancer Center from March 2014 to November 2014. All of the information that Dr. Tolber had concerning how Worker died was provided by Claimant. When asked what he knew about the circumstances of her death, Dr. Tolber testified only to what he\n   had been told about Worker's shortness of breath and that he had \"not seen the [results] on the autopsy, so I don't know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {15} On April 21, 2016, the WCJ issued his compensation order concerning the death benefits claim. The order makes the following findings: (1) \"Worker established a causal connection between the ABPA and her place of employment\"; (2) \"As a result of a compensable injury, Worker was awarded compensation benefits\"; (3) Dr. Liljestrand found that Worker's ABPA was either a direct cause or a contributing cause of what he listed on Worker's death certificate for causes of death; (4) Dr. Tolber testified that Worker \"most likely died of ABPA\"; (5) \"There is a causal connection between Worker's ABPA and her resulting death\"; (6) \"The medical evidence and testimony establishing causation is uncontradicted\"; (7) \"Compensation benefits for death are payable to eligible dependents if an accidental injury sustained by a worker proximately results in the worker's death within the period of two years following the worker's accidental injury\"; (8) \"The two year time limit for bringing a claim for death benefits begins to accrue from the date the compensable injury manifests itself or from when the worker knows or should know [s]he has suffered a compensable injury\"; (9) \"Due to ABPA, Worker was unable to perform the duties of high school teacher beginning on April 1, 2013\"; (10) \"Worker's injury manifested itself on April 1, 2013\"; and (11) \"Worker's death on November 12, 2014, occurred within two years of April 1, 2014.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Claimant argues that the WCJ's finding that Worker's death was within two years of her compensable injury is supported by the evidence presented during the death benefits trial.

We noted that the legislative purpose underlying the provision of disability and death benefits-providing for the financial security of a worker and his family-was the same for both types of benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gambrel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991-NMCA-100\">\n    1991-NMCA-100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"720217\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/112/668/\">\n    112 N.M. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"720217\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/112/668/\">\n    818 P.2d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e believe the broad policy contours underlying the Act are identical whether worker is disabled or dies as a result of the accidental injury.\"). Given that common purpose, we determined that the trigger event for the limitation period for death benefits would be given the same construction as the trigger event for disability benefits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   We, therefore, apply the meaning \"date when the compensable injury manifests itself\" or \"date when the work[er] knows or should know he has suffered a compensable injury\" to all of the portions of [the Act] where the terms \"time of accident,\" \"time of injury,\" \"date of disability,\" \"date of accidental injury,\" or words of similar import, are used[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 (citation omitted).

Thus, if Worker knew or should have known that she had a compensable injury\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   November 12, 2012, Section 52-1-46 bars Claimant's claim for death benefits. On the basis of the WCJ's findings of fact regarding the statute of limitations issue, which Employer does not challenge on appeal, we determine that Worker knew or should have known she had a compensable injury on April 1, 2013, which is within two years of Worker's death on November 12, 2014. Based on the analysis that follows, we affirm the WCJ with respect to the statute of limitations issue raised by Employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {22} When Worker's injury became\n   <em>\n    compensable\n   </em>\n   is crucial to the determination of when she knew or should have known she had a compensable injury.

Claimant argued that Section 52-1-51(C) limits testimony at any workers' compensation hearing about the particular work-related injury in question, whether it results in an injury or death, to authorized health care providers and providers who perform an IME. Employer argued that the statute was concerned with the injury and resulting disability, and that death and its proximate cause was a separate question not covered by it. The WCJ agreed with Claimant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   I'm going to rule that the deposition testimony [and] records of Dr. Giudice will be excluded from this hearing as a result of [Section] 52-1-51(C) which indicates that only [a] health care provider [that] has treated Worker or provided an IME may offer testimony at a worker's comp hearing concerning particular injury in question.

The answer turns on the meaning of the phrase, \"hearing concerning the particular injury in question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"717000\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/110/135/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {38} It is not clear from the plain meaning of the words of Section 52-1-51(C) whether it applies to a Section 52-1-46 hearing. On the one hand, the subject of a Section 52-1-46 death benefits hearing can be characterized as the work-related injury, specifically, whether the death proximately resulted from it. This would suggest that Section 52-1-51(C)'s limitation on health care provider testimony extends to a death benefits hearing. On the other hand, the foregoing phrase can be read to imply negatively that there can be a workers' compensation hearing at which medical testimony is given where the subject is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the particular injury in question. The Legislature did not, for example, broadly provide that Section 52-1-51(C) is applicable to any workers' compensation hearing concerning a\n   <em>\n    medical issue\n   </em>\n   . Further, one can characterize the subject of a death benefits hearing as not \"the particular injury in question,\" i.e., the work-related injury itself, but rather the cause of the death. This would suggest that Section 52-1-51(C)'s limitation on health care provider testimony does not extend to a death benefits hearing. Because the applicability of the language of 52-1-51(C) to a Section 52-1-46 hearing is not clear, we turn to other bases of statutory construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Construction with other statutes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {39} Section 52-1-51(C) should be read in conjunction with Section 52-1-49, to which it refers, and the remainder of Section 52-1-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {40} First, Section 52-1-49(A) imposes on a worker's employer the general obligation to provide reasonably necessary medical care to treat a work-related injury. The balance of Section 52-1-49 addresses the manner in which the health care provider who delivers that care is selected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {41} Section 52-1-49 suggests that Section 52-1-51(C) does not apply to a WCJ's cause of death determination pursuant to Section 52-1-46. The focus of Section 52-1-49 is solely on the delivery of care necessary to treat the work-related injury. One would not expect a health care provider who is selected to treat the work-related injury to necessarily also treat or even be aware of other medical conditions the worker may be experiencing. Thus, we cannot assume that Section 52-1-49 would be intended to identify health care providers who would be able to address in any knowledgeable and comprehensive manner contributing causes of a worker's subsequent death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {42} APS could not possibly have selected Dr. Giudice as Worker's health care provider under Section 52-1-49 prior to her death, because he would not have been treating her work-related injury. And no health care provider could have been selected under Section 52-1-49 after Worker's death, because at that point the provider could no longer treat her.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grine v.

This illustrates that under Claimant's construction, Section 52-1-49 is simply not available as a means of permitting an HCP who is treating a worker for a non-work-related medical condition to qualify\n   to testify about causation at a death benefits hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {43} Second, Section 52-1-51 articulates the method by which disagreements between the worker and the employer over medical issues are to be resolved. Section 52-1-51(A) allows the parties to either agree on a healthcare provider who will conduct an IME or petition the WCJ for appointment of a healthcare provider and have the worker undergo an IME. Section 52-1-51(B) describes how the workers' compensation judge shall choose the health care provider to conduct an IME. Section 52-1-51(E) provides that the worker \"shall travel\" to the place at which the IME shall be conducted and receive compensation for his or her travel expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {44} Under Section 52-1-51 independent medical examiners can be appointed only to address concerns relating to the provision of medical care or disability benefits-that is, matters arising while the worker is alive. Section 52-1-51(A) contemplates that the worker will \"undergo\" an IME, and Section 52-1-51(E) requires that the worker \"shall travel\" to the IME location. Further, all of the examples of disputed medical issues set forth in Section 52-1-51(A) concern the provision of care or benefits to living workers.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We note as well for the same reasons that, under Claimant's construction of Section 52-1-51(C), a physician who performs an autopsy could not testify about the cause of death at a death benefits hearing: Section 52-1-51(C) specifically states that only a health care provider who performs an IME \"pursuant to this section\" may testify at a hearing. Indeed, in contrast to NMSA 1978, \u00a7 52-3-40 (1989), which authorizes autopsies to determine the cause of death in the context of a claim for compensation filed under the New Mexico Occupational Disease Disablement Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 52-3-1 to -60 (1945, as amended through 2015), nowhere in the Act is a provision made for an autopsy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {46} The particular facts of this case highlight the evidentiary shortcomings that result from limiting testimony about the cause of death to those HCPs who have treated or otherwise addressed only a worker's work-related injury in accordance with Sections 52-1-49 and -51. It is undisputed that Worker was suffering from a recurrence of metastatic breast cancer starting in February 2012, which was within six months of when Worker was exposed to the aspergillus mold in her classroom that ultimately led to the diagnosis of ABPA. Dr. Giudice stated that individuals such as Worker who have metastatic breast cancer have an average life expectancy of two to five years from the time of their diagnosis. Dr. Liljestrand admitted that although he listed the causes of death on Worker's death certificate as pneumonia and chronic pneumonitis, he could not verify that he looked at a single medical record in making that determination. Dr. Liljestrand also could not verify that he relied on sources of information in determining Worker's cause of death other than a verbal recitation from Claimant. Similarly, Dr. Tolber's information about Worker's medical condition after September 2015 and the circumstances of her death was limited to his conversation with Claimant. Dr. Liljestrand last saw Worker eight months before she died, and Dr. Tolber last saw Worker a month and a half before she died. In contrast, Dr. Giudice saw Worker the day before she died. Dr. Giudice's testimony and records concerning Worker's metastatic breast cancer thus would appear to be not only relevant but crucial in determining Worker's cause of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Avoiding an absurd construction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {47} Construing Section 52-1-51(C) to apply to a Section 52-1-46 death benefits hearing can lead to a practical absurdity. Assume a worker dies from a heart attack while at work. Because of the lack of any previous work-related injuries, there are no HCPs who had been selected under Section 52-1-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Assume as well that the employer contests worker's survivor's death benefits claim that the death proximately resulted from an on-the-job accidental injury. In this situation, neither the worker nor the employer would be permitted to call any HCPs to testify about the cause of death. But because the worker's survivor would bear the burden of proving causation by expert medical testimony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grine v.

Such a scenario, even if not common, is hardly unique. We do not believe that the Legislature intended to limit the WCJ in any resulting Section 52-1-46 death benefits claim that the work-related condition caused the worker's death from hearing only the testimony of health care providers selected under Section 52-1-49 or 52-1-51, who by reason of their limited assignment may have only a partial and incomplete understanding of the entirety of the worker's medical circumstances. Conversely, we do not believe that the Legislature intended to bar the testimony of health care providers who were treating the worker immediately before her death and, as a result, could be expected to have the best understanding of the worker's overall condition and the cause or causes of death simply because they were treating a non-work-related condition.

It is precisely because Section 52-1-49's and Section 52-1-51's provisions for selection of HCPs and IME examiners, respectively, are confined to the treatment and assessment of work-related injuries that it is absurd to identify them as the exclusive universe of witnesses who can testify about the cause or causes of a worker's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

We observe as well that Employer's proffer of Dr. Giudice as a causation witness in any event can hardly be criticized as testimony-shopping: at the time of Worker's death he had been her treating doctor (albeit for her cancer as opposed to her ABPA) since 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {54} For these reasons, we conclude that Section 52-1-51(C) does not limit expert testimony regarding the circumstances and cause of a worker's death in connection with a claim for death benefits under Section 52-1-46 to that given by an HCP who has provided care for a worker's work-related injury pursuant to Section 52-1-49, or an independent medical examiner identified pursuant to Section 52-1-51(A). We therefore reverse the WCJ's rulings based on Section 52-1-51(C) that Dr. Giudice's depositions and the records of the New Mexico Cancer Center were inadmissible and the\n   medical evidence of cause of death was uncontradicted, and the WCJ's determination regarding the cause of Worker's death. We also remand this case for retrial of the issue of whether, in the words of Section 52-1-46, Worker's ABPA \"proximately result[ed]\" in her death. This Court's ruling is made solely on the basis of the WCJ's erroneous statutory analysis. We have not considered, and do not presume to suggest, whether Worker would have a basis for objecting to the admission of this evidence on other grounds or what causation decision the WCJ ultimately might make following consideration of all admitted evidence. On the contrary, resolution of those issues remain for retrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The WCJ Erred in Determining the Amount of Death Benefits Awarded to Claimant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {55} In addition to compensation for medical expenses prior to death, funeral expenses, and attorney's fees, Section 52-1-46 provides for a basic weekly death benefit that tracks a worker's disability benefit. In particular, where the worker is survived by a widow or widower but no minor children, Section 52-1-46(C)(2) provides the widow or widower with a weekly death benefit of \"sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average weekly wage of the deceased[.]\" This benefit is to be paid for 700 weeks, Section 52-1-41(D), or until remarriage, Section 52-1-46(C)(2), whichever comes first. Section 52-1-47(A) establishes a cap of 700 weeks of benefits \"for any combination of disabilities ... or any combination of disability [or] death[,]\" which means that if an employer has paid disability benefits to a worker prior to the worker's death, the 700 weeks of death benefits will be reduced by the number of weeks of disability benefits that previously had been paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {56} In addition to awarding Claimant compensation for Worker's last medical expenses, funeral expenses, and attorney's fees, the WCJ awarded death benefits in the amount of 99% of two-thirds of Worker's average weekly wage for 700 weeks, subject to a credit for the number of weeks of PPD that Employer had paid to Worker prior to her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {57} Employer contends that, if Claimant were entitled to any weekly death benefits at all, the benefits were limited to those that had accrued prior to Worker's death. As we understand it, Employer's argument is based on a joint reading of Sections 52-1-46(G) and 52-1-47(C). Section 52-1-46(G) provides that \"no compensation benefits payable by reason of a worker's death shall exceed the maximum weekly compensation benefits as provided in Section[ ] ... 52-1-47.\" Section 52-1-47(C) provides that \"in no case shall compensation benefits for disability continue after the disability ends or after the death of the injured worker[.]\" Employer urges that, because disability benefits end upon the death of the worker, Section 52-1-46(G) must mean that death benefits, which Employer characterizes as \"unaccrued,\" also must end upon death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holliday v. Talk of the Town, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1985-NMCA-024\">\n    1985-NMCA-024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1580038\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/102/540/\">\n    102 N.M. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1580038\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/102/540/\">\n    697 P.2d 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"awarded but unaccrued benefits for disability terminate upon death\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {58} If accepted, Employer's argument would nullify Section 52-1-46's provision of weekly death benefits. The relevant statutory language does not support Employer's argument. Employer is conflating the maximum weekly amount of the\n   <em>\n    death\n   </em>\n   benefit (Section 52-1-46(G) ) with the provision that the death of the worker ends\n   <em>\n    disability\n   </em>\n   benefits (Section 52-1-47(C) ). That is, Section 52-1-46(G) limits the maximum weekly death benefit amounts to those payable pursuant to Sections 52-1-41 to -43, and -47, which generally is two-thirds of the worker's average weekly wage. While Section 52-1-47(C) provides that disability benefits end upon death, Sections 52-1-41(D), -43(B), and -47(B) make clear that death benefits are payable upon death even if disability benefits previously had been paid, up to a maximum of 700 weeks of combined disability and death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {59} In his cross-appeal, Claimant argues that the WCJ erred in awarding weekly death benefits in the amount of 99%, as opposed to 100%, of two-thirds of Worker's average weekly wage. We agree with Claimant. It appears that the WCJ determined that the death benefit should equal the amount of Workers' PPD benefit. In doing so, the WCJ erred. Section 52-1-46(C)(2) provides without qualification for a weekly death\n   benefit to a widow or widower in the amount of sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the worker's average weekly wage. The amount of the benefit does not vary based upon whether the worker, prior to death, was totally or partially permanently disabled. This is logical, given that death can be viewed as entirely terminating a worker's wage-earning capacity, and therefore a death benefit should be the same as a total disability benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {60} We affirm the WCJ's conclusion that Worker's death occurred within two years of her compensable injury. We reverse the WCJ's exclusion of Dr. Giudice's deposition testimony and the medical records of the New Mexico Cancer Center from the death benefits trial. We also reverse the WCJ's resulting conclusion that the medical evidence concerning Worker's cause of death was uncontradicted. We emphasize that we are remanding to the WCJ for retrial on the causation element of Claimant's death benefit claim. Last, we reverse the WCJ's calculation of weekly death benefits to which Claimant would be entitled assuming Claimant prevails on the causation issue. Only if the WCJ determines that Worker's ABPA \"proximately resulted\" in her death will it be necessary for the WCJ to recalculate the amount of the weekly death benefit. We vacate the April 21, 2016 compensation order and remand the case for retrial and for further findings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {61}\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   M.
