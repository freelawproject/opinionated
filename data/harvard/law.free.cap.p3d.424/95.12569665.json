They claim that the city violated statutes requiring it to spend the fees on specified categories of expenditures within six years. The developers' first claim for relief in the operative complaint is for a declaratory judgment. The district court dismissed only the last portion of that claim, which sought a declaratory judgment that West Jordan must refund all or part of the impact fees to them. Neither party addresses this claim on appeal, so we make no ruling as to the declaratory judgment action. Nor does either party argue against the district court's dismissal of the developers' sixth claim, the request for attorney fees as a separate claim for relief. The developers' second through fifth claims for relief seek a refund of the allegedly misspent or unspent impact fees either because of an unconstitutional taking or as a claim in equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Our threshold concern is whether the developers have standing to bring their claims. Standing is a question of subject matter jurisdiction that \"raise[s] fundamental\n   questions regarding a court's basic authority over the dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Div. of Water Rights of Dep't of Nat. Res.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994503\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/747/\">\n    2010 UT 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994503\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/747/\">\n    228 P.3d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Only if the developers have standing do we turn to whether any of their claims survive a motion to dismiss based on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The developers have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the impact fees they were assessed. But the time to challenge the relationship between the government's demand for property and the anticipated social costs of a proposed land use is at the time the impact fees are exacted and is limited by statute to \"one year after the day on which the person or entity pays the impact fee.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 11-36a-702(1)(c). The developers' argument that their claims against West Jordan for either allegedly failing to spend impact fees within six years or spending the fees on impermissible expenditures were not ripe until the six-year period elapsed is inadequate to support a constitutional takings claim. The manner in which a city spends impact fees does not affect the constitutionality of the initial demand for fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698478\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/595/\">\n    570 U.S. 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698478\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/595/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698478\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/595/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). We hold that the developers have failed to state a takings claim for which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 To the extent that the developers are seeking a remedy of a refund of fees in equity for the asserted injury of illegally misspent or unspent fees, they do not have standing. The city was authorized by the Impact Fees Act to assess impact fees to offset the expected costs of development in certain areas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 11-36a-101 to -705. There is no injury to the developers by the authorized assessment of impact fees that survive a takings challenge. We hold that where the developers cannot establish an unconstitutional demand for authorized impact fees at the time they were exacted, they do not have standing to bring claims against West Jordan. As a result, the courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear a claim in equity about whether the fees were misspent or unspent in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Because the developers have failed to state a takings claim for which relief can be granted, and because they do not have standing to bring a claim in equity, we reverse the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 West Jordan, like many municipalities, requires developers to pay impact fees before the city approves a development project. These impact fees are designed to defray the anticipated increase in city expenditures caused by the proposed development. The impact fees collected by West Jordan include fees associated with the increased need for park services, roads, police protection, water services, storm water infrastructure, and sewer services. The legislature has enacted the Impact Fees Act, which regulates the manner in which cities and other political subdivisions may assess and spend impact fees. UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 11-36a-101 to -705.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 In 2012, thirteen developers that had paid impact fees to West Jordan between 2003 and 2006 filed this action. The operative complaint claimed that the developers were entitled to a refund of all or some of these fees under two broad theories. The developers claimed that West Jordan violated the Impact Fees Act by failing to spend or encumber all of the impact fees within six years,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698478\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/595/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-36a-602(2)(a), and by spending portions of the impact fees on impermissible uses,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698478\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/595/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-36a-602(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The developers argued that these violations constituted \"a taking of private property for public use without just compensation in violation\n   of Article 1 Section 22 of the Utah Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\" The developers also asserted an \"equitable\" right to reimbursement because West Jordan had failed to comply with two provisions of the Impact Fees Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 West Jordan filed a motion to dismiss these claims. It argued that any failure to spend the impact fees in the manner prescribed by the Act was not an unconstitutional taking of the developer's private property. West Jordan also argued that the Impact Fees Act did not give the developers a private refund remedy for any failure to comply with provisions regulating its use of the impact fees, and that the developers had no equitable right to a refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 The district court denied West Jordan's motion to dismiss the developers' constitutional and equitable claims. This court subsequently granted West Jordan's petition to file an interlocutory appeal from the district court's order denying dismissal of these claims. After hearing initial oral arguments on this case in October 2015, we remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of determining if any of the developers owned any of the property at issue in this action. The district court found that they had no remaining ownership interest in the properties in question. We then requested supplemental briefing on the question of the developers' standing to bring this claim, and provided each party the opportunity to present their cases at oral arguments in November 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 Our standard of review for standing is \"generally ... considered a 'mixed question' because it involves the application of a legal standard to a particularized set of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Utah Chapter of the Sierra Club v.

We address separately the standing for the takings claims and the claims for equitable relief. As to the takings claims, we conclude that the developers do have constitutional and statutory standing to bring claims for a taking, and therefore we assess this claim on its merits. We ultimately conclude that the takings claims were not filed timely and are no longer available as a remedy. We thus reverse the ruling of the district court and direct dismissal of the takings claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 Regarding the claims for relief based in equity, we conclude that there is no statutorily granted standing, so the developers must establish standing according to Utah case law. Because a refund of the impact fees the developers incurred will not redress the parties that would actually be injured by the city's alleged misspent or unspent impact fees, the developers fail to establish standing for these claims. We therefore will not address this issue on the merits. Again, we reverse the district court and direct dismissal of the claims in equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I. THE TAKINGS CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 14 The developers had a statutorily granted \"standing to file a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of an impact fee.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 11-36a-701(1). However, this right is \"[s]ubject to the time limitations described in Section 11-36a-702 and procedures set forth in Section 11-36a-703.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982204\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/284/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-36a-701(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 11-36a-702(1)(c) limits actions brought challenging the validity of an impact fee to \"one year after the day on which the person or entity pays the impact fee.\" Had the developers brought a challenge to the impact fee within this time frame, they would be able to seek \"a refund of the difference between what the [developers] paid as an impact fee and the amount the impact fee should have been if it had been correctly calculated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982204\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/284/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-36a-701(3)(c).

They make two basic arguments under the federal takings clause. First, they assert that any violation of the Impact Fees Act on the part of West Jordan also constitutes a per se violation of the takings clause. Second, they argue that the city's failure to spend all of the impact fees on statutorily mandated expenditures within six years violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine applied in\n   <em>\n    Koontz v.

But this attempt to constitutionalize all the provisions of the Impact Fees Act fails. Even if we were to accept the developers' dubious assertion that the only purpose of each of the provisions of the Act is to codify the essential protections guaranteed by the takings clause, the Utah Legislature does not establish the bounds of the protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution. It is the duty of the judicial branch of government to interpret the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marbury v.

It does not matter that these claims would not be ripe until the six-year period for spending them elapsed. The manner in which a city spends impact fees does not affect the constitutionality of the initial demand for fees, which is the focus of the\n   <em>\n    Koontz\n   </em>\n   monetary exactions analysis. That the fees were not spent within six years does not affect the analysis of whether there was a nexus or whether the impact fees were roughly proportional at the time they were exacted. The developers may not expect to be the beneficiaries of any unspent funds after six years, just as the city cannot retroactively demand payment from the developers for expenditures that exceed the impact fees revenue for necessary improvements. The developers have not cited any cases that have applied a\n   <em>\n    Nollan\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   analysis to a municipality's expenditure of impact fees.

Accordingly, the developers' standing will be considered as though all allegations in their complaint, and all reasonable inferences drawn from those allegations, are taken as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 33 In this case, even assuming all allegations in the developers' complaint and reasonable inferences drawn from them are true, there is still an insufficient factual basis in the record to show that the developers have standing for a claim in equity. There is no showing that the developers have sustained an injury that has a direct effect on them or that is suitably resolved by the courts. They have failed to establish standing through the traditional standing test. As the developers have not argued alternative standing, we do not address it in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   1. Traditional Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 34 The traditional test, sometimes called the \"distinct and palpable injury\" requirement, assesses whether a \"party has 'a real and personal interest in the dispute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Utah Chapter of the Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8443392\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/148/960/\">\n    2006 UT 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 19-20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8443392\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/148/960/\">\n    148 P.3d 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). To show standing, a \"party must allege that it has suffered or will 'suffer[ ] some distinct and palpable injury that gives [it] a personal stake in the outcome of the legal dispute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19 (alterations in original) (citation omitted). This test involves a three-step inquiry to determine whether a distinct and palpable injury exists:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (1) \"the party must assert that it has been or will be 'adversely affected by the [challenged] actions' \";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (2) \"the party must allege a causal relationship 'between the injury to the party, the [challenged] actions and the relief requested' \"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (3) \"the relief requested must be 'substantially likely to redress the injury claimed.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (citations omitted). This inquiry is conjunctive. In other words, each step must be demonstrated in order to confirm standing. A party must \"satisf[y] all three ... criteria\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 to establish that it \"ha[s] the incentive to 'fully develop[ ] all the material factual and legal issues in an effort to convince the court that the relief requested will redress the claimed injury.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 (second alteration in original) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 35 The developers have identified two theories under which they might have suffered a legal injury: (1) they could have retained contractual rights with the home purchasers to a refund of the impact fees if found excessive or (2) the purchase prices of the homes they sold did not compensate them for the impact fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 36 The developers have suggested that they could have entered into a contractual agreement with the lot purchasers wherein they retained the rights to a refund of impact fees should there be such a refund. Even assuming that a refund of the impact fees to any party was a possibility, there is no factual evidence in the record or the briefs to support the theory that the developers retained these rights through a contract. Counsel for the developers conceded during oral argument that it would be highly improbable for such contracts to exist, and their existence would obviously be known to the developers as contractual parties. As this theory leads only to a mere possibility and not a reasonable probability that such a contract exists, this court will not consider it a sufficient allegation to establish standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994503\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/747/\">\n    2010 UT 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994503\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/747/\">\n    228 P.3d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 37 Nor can the developers establish standing under the compensation theory. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Bradshaw v. Wilkinson Water Co.\n   </em>\n   , \"[r]eal estate development is a speculative enterprise.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9194367\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/94/242/\">\n    2004 UT 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9194367\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/94/242/\">\n    94 P.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The real estate market is subject to the fluctuations of the economy, and the profit margin will largely be determined on the market conditions at the time of sale. Whether the impact fees were recouped in the sale of the lots is immaterial to establishing standing. The impact fees, if constitutional at the time of exaction, are part of the price of doing business in real estate development, and developers assume the risk that they might not be recouped when individual lots are sold. To suffer a legal injury, there must be a violation of a legal right, and the developers have no legal right to recoup impact fees from lot or home purchasers. Here, West Jordan lawfully exercised its police powers to impose an impact fee on the developers. \"[I]f the owner [of a property] through a lawful exercise of [police] power suffers inconvenience, injury, or a loss, it is regarded as damnum absque injuria.\"\n   <em>\n    Colman v. Utah State Land Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299493\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/795/622/#p628\">\n    795 P.2d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 628 (Utah 1990) (citation omitted). The developers do not argue that there was a constitutional violation in the assessment of the impact fees, and without a violation of a legal right when the fees were collected, there is no compensable loss to the developers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   2. Traditional Standing Not Established\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 38 The developers have failed to establish standing under the traditional standing test. The only expectation the developers could reasonably have for paying the constitutionally levied impact fees was approval for their development, which they received. After the payment of the impact fees, the residents of West Jordan retain the interest in having those fees used as designed, not the developers. Any injury from misuse of impact fees would be to the residents, either from being underserviced or from increased taxes to cover costs of additional development that should be paid from the impact fees. We express no opinion here on the nature of any such injury or on what, if any, remedies for it might exist. But the relief requested by the developers-the refund of any unspent or misspent impact\n   fees-would not redress the true parties in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    B. Separation of Powers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 39 Our standing requirement helps to ensure that the judiciary does not exceed the constitutional limits on judicial power. \"[J]udicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action\" can be invoked only when a \"claimant [can] show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of that action.\"\n   <em>\n    Baird v.

These roles are the primary domain of the legislative and executive branches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 40 As the developers noted in arguments before the district court, the issue at hand can be addressed in the legislature. \"[T]he airing of generalized grievances and the vindication of public rights are properly addressed to the legislature, a forum where freewheeling debate on broad issues of public policy is in order.\"\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10430240\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/675/1145/\">\n    675 P.2d at 1149-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the developers want the right to a refund of unspent impact fees, or if they want an enforcement provision, or if they do not like the ways that impact fees are calculated or may be expended, they can seek legislative modification of the statute. The appropriate remedy for the developers is not an action brought before the judiciary, but an appeal to the legislature. Moreover, execution and enforcement of the law is primarily under the purview of the executive branch. The Impact Fees Act allows developers to object to impact fees within certain parameters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 11-36a-701 to -705.
