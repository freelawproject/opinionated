The State rescinded its offer before Francis entered his plea because Francis's alleged victim objected to the agreement. Francis's counsel then represented to the district court that she was not ready for trial because she had ceased trial preparation once she believed the parties had reached a plea agreement. The district court continued trial. Francis later filed a motion to enforce the plea agreement. The district court denied Francis's motion. Francis petitioned for interlocutory appeal asking the court of appeals to remand with orders to enforce his agreement with the State. The court of appeals granted the petition, then certified the appeal to us. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 After Samuel Aaron Francis allegedly beat up his girlfriend, the State leveled a host of charges against him: three third degree felony counts of aggravated assault, a third degree felony count of obstruction of justice, and a misdemeanor count of interruption of a communication device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The district court scheduled a jury trial to begin on Monday, June 15, 2015. On the Friday before trial, the State agreed that if Francis would plead to one of his four third degree felony charges, it would offer him a \"402 reduction after successful completion of probation, 24 months supervised probation, [and] no agreement for recommendation of no jail at sentencing.\" Francis accepted the plea offer on Saturday and emailed a copy of the agreement to the State for review on Sunday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The State returned the agreement with substantive edits the morning of trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   An hour later-before the judge took the bench and before Francis entered his plea-the State rescinded its offer because the alleged victim disapproved of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 At Francis's request, the court granted a continuance and rescheduled the jury trial for August 2015. Francis then filed a motion to enforce the plea agreement, arguing that he had detrimentally relied on the State's offer. The court rejected the motion. Francis timely sought interlocutory review in the court of appeals. We now review this case on certification from the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Francis argues that he was prejudiced because, having relied on the recently rescinded plea offer, he was unprepared to go forward with trial. Next, he alleges that the withdrawn plea agreement caused him to forego \"the investigation and assertion of claims regarding alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Tiedemann\n   </em>\n   violations.\" He also argues that he was prejudiced because one of his witnesses had expressed hesitancy to return and testify. The State counters that it could rescind an offer at any time before the court accepts a plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 We affirm the district court's order denying enforcement of the plea agreement, but we do so for slightly different reasons than the district court articulated. We have jurisdiction under Utah Code section 78A-4-103(2)(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Francis argues that the district court erred in rejecting his motion to enforce the State's plea offer because plea agreements create a contractual right for defendants and because he relied to his detriment upon the State's offer. The enforceability of a plea agreement presents a question of law we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    State v.

He relies on language in\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, he asks us to apply contract law provisions \"more broadly in the plea agreement context in order to ensure that a defendant's constitutional rights are protected.\" Relying on contract principles, he argues that his \"clear acceptance\" of the State's \"clear, unconditional, specific, and complete\" offer created an enforceable plea agreement.

A court of appeals pronouncement does not, of course, bind this court to a course of action. Further, the statement Francis quotes was dicta. The court of appeals ruled that the parties \"never reached a 'meeting of the minds,' \" so \"there [was] no 'agreement' to be fulfilled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10381260\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/791/213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10431140\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/645/44/\">\n    645 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   46 ). The court did not, therefore, need to examine the question of what defendant needed to demonstrate to enforce the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17 In\n   <em>\n    Bero\n   </em>\n   , we noted that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had \"held that a constitutional right to\n   enforcement of plea agreements may arise before a contract is reached because of reasonably formed expectations of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Bero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10431140\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/645/44/\">\n    645 P.2d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this statement was dicta as the\n   <em>\n    Bero\n   </em>\n   court, like the court of appeals in\n   <em>\n    Nine Thousand One Hundred and Ninety-Nine Dollars\n   </em>\n   , found that there was never any agreement to be enforced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10431140\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/645/44/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 Francis also argues that the district court should have enforced the plea agreement because he relied on it to his detriment. Francis lists four ways in which withdrawal of the agreement prejudiced him: (1) he \"forwent the investigation and assertion of claims regarding alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Tiedemann\n   </em>\n   violations;\" (2) he \"presented himself on the day of trial without the benefit of counsel who could provide effective assistance\" because, Francis claims, the State had \"induced\" him to forego trial preparation; (3) \"at least one witness who appeared at the trial on June 15 is likely to fail to appear at any subsequent hearing in this matter;\" and (4) he \"is required to pay the expert he retained in this case additional monies.\" We are unpersuaded by his arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 First, Francis's assertion that he forewent his\n   <em>\n    Brady/Tiedemann\n   </em>\n   claims appears to be inaccurate. Francis briefed and argued those claims. The district court rejected them. If the withdrawn plea agreement somehow interfered with his ability to investigate, brief, or argue his\n   <em>\n    Brady/Tiedemann\n   </em>\n   claims, Francis does not explain how that is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 Second, Francis was not forced to go to trial unprepared. The district court granted his motion for a continuance after the State withdrew the plea agreement. Francis may have had an argument if the court had required trial to go forward that morning and he could demonstrate that his counsel was reasonably unprepared. But the district court mitigated any potential prejudice by continuing the trial. Any reliance ceased to be detrimental once the court eliminated the prejudice flowing from that reliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Moss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10335052\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/921/1021/#p1027\">\n    921 P.2d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1027 (Utah Ct. App. 1996) (holding that \"[w]here the defendant is simply placed in the same position as he or she was prior to the guilty plea, there is no undue prejudice to the defendant\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Francis's third assertion, that a witness \"is likely to fail to appear at any subsequent trial\" likewise fails to move the needle. Courts are routinely faced with reluctant and unwilling witnesses. Such witnesses can be subpoenaed and made to appear in court or face contempt proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R. CRIM. P. 14(a)(7) (\"Failure to obey a subpoena without reasonable excuse may be deemed a contempt of the court responsible for its issuance.\"). Moreover, even if Francis could show that the witness was no longer available, to meet his burden of persuasion, Francis would need to do more than point to that witness's absence. Francis would have to explain who the witness is, what the testimony would have been, why the testimony cannot be obtained from another source, and how the lack of that testimony adversely affected his defense before we could conclude that he had been prejudiced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 Finally, we are unsure how Francis would have incurred additional expenses for his expert witness \"because of the State's actions.\" Francis simply argues that \"[the expert witness] was called off when the plea agreement was reached.\" Although we can imagine that there may be potential for costs associated with the expert having to prepare twice, Francis does not argue that this is what occurred. Nor are we convinced that this increase in cost is the sort of reliance that would compel the enforcement of a plea agreement. As explained above, courts have found detrimental reliance when defendants have provided testimony, assisted with investigations, returned stolen property, and taken polygraph tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. We are not prepared to hold, on the record before us, that a potential and unquantified increase in the cost of defense gives rise to the same sort of prejudice. Simply stated,\n   Francis did not demonstrate that he relied upon the plea agreement to his detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 The State may withdraw from a plea bargain agreement at any time prior to, but not after, the actual entry of defendant's guilty plea or other action by defendant constituting detrimental reliance on the agreement. Francis did not enter a guilty plea or otherwise perform under the terms of his plea agreement with the State before the State rescinded its offer. And Francis has failed to show that he detrimentally relied on the State's offer. We, therefore, affirm the order of the district court denying Francis's motion to enforce his plea agreement and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The State argues that it was still engaged in plea agreement negotiations at the time of rescission and, thus, it rescinded the plea offer before an agreement had been reached. For purposes of this opinion, we assume without deciding that Francis had accepted a valid plea offer at the time the State rescinded.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Francis also quotes the following language from\n    <em>\n     State v. Patience\n    </em>\n    : \"in interpreting plea agreements or determining their validity, courts may in certain circumstances hold the government to a higher standard than the defendant.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11902253\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/944/381/#p386\">\n     944 P.2d 381\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 387 (Utah Ct. App. 1997).\n    <em>\n     Patience\n    </em>\n    does not describe what it means to hold the State to a higher standard, but it borrows that concept from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Ringling,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513098\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/504/#p506\">\n     988 F.2d 504\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 506 (4th Cir. 1993). The\n    <em>\n     Ringling\n    </em>\n    court stated that when interpreting a plea agreement \"both constitutional and supervisory concerns require holding the government to a greater degree of responsibility than the defendant (or possibly than would be either of the parties to a commercial contract) for imprecisions or ambiguities in plea agreements.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513098\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/504/#p506\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citation omitted). We do not understand the\n    <em>\n     Patience\n    </em>\n    court to have introduced the \"higher standard\" language as an attempt to impose a code of conduct on the State with respect to plea agreements. We note, however, that playing games with plea agreements would violate Utah Standard of Professionalism and Civility 9-\"Lawyers shall not hold out the potential of settlement for the purpose of foreclosing discovery, delaying trial, or obtaining other unfair advantage....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Francis also argues that he was prejudiced by \"the State's objection to [his] request to continue trial\" and \"[t]hat the court did not grant the State's request does not alleviate the prejudice suffered by Francis.\" Francis does not elaborate on this point, and from the record it would appear that by continuing the trial date, the district court entirely alleviated any prejudice Francis might have suffered if he had been forced to go to trial that morning.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
