Jones asserts the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss after determining he was not immune from prosecution under the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA), Ariz. Rev. Stat. (A.R.S.) \u00a7\u00a7 36-2801 to -2819 (2014). We hold that AMMA does not immunize Jones from prosecution for the use and possession of cannabis under the circumstances presented here, and affirm Jones's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 The relevant facts are undisputed. In March 2013, Jones was found in possession of a jar containing 0.050 ounces of hashish. At the time, Jones was a registered qualifying patient using marijuana for medicinal purposes. Jones was later indicted on one count each of possession of the narcotic drug cannabis and possession of drug paraphernalia-the jar containing the cannabis. He moved to dismiss the charges, arguing the indictment was deficient as a matter of law because his valid AMMA card provided an absolute defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The motion was denied following an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Jones waived his right to a jury trial and, in September 2016, was convicted as charged. The following month, Jones was sentenced as a non-dangerous, non-repetitive offender to concurrent presumptive terms of 2.5 years' imprisonment for possession of a narcotic drug and one year for possession of drug paraphernalia and given credit for 366 days' presentence incarceration. Jones timely appealed, and this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) (2018), 13-4031 (2010), and 13-4033(A)(1) (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Jones appeals the trial court's order denying his motion to dismiss.

Although cannabis is understood to be more potent than the unadulterated leaves of the marijuana plant, and a patient could potentially obtain \"more\" medicinal value by choosing 2.5 ounces of a product containing cannabis than from choosing 2.5 ounces of one containing leaves from the marijuana plant, this result is not impossible or absurd. Nor does the increased potency of cannabis preclude appropriate medical use. Distinctions among forms of marijuana may make sense within the context of punishing illegal recreational drug use but serve no legitimate purpose where substances are used for therapeutic reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed-Kaliher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329356\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/119/#p122\">\n    237 Ariz. at 123, \u00b6 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329356\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/119/#p122\">\n    347 P.3d at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting a legislative intent \"to distinguish between illicit use and lawful medicinal use of such drugs\" as marijuana, narcotic, or prescription drugs while placed on probation) (citing A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3408(G) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3412(A)(7)-(8) (exempting from criminal prosecution persons possessing or using narcotics pursuant to a doctor's prescription).

When considered in the context of medicinal use, there is no logical reason to limit how the therapeutic compounds found in marijuana are introduced into the body. Thus, I cannot agree that permitting a registered qualifying patient to use a particular form of marijuana for medical purposes is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   dangerous or, more importantly, contravenes the spirit and purpose of the AMMA. Indeed, a person not engaged in the medical use of marijuana remains subject to penalty and prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 Finally, the regulations promulgated by the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) to effectuate the AMMA further support my conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hahn v.

An applicant for a dispensary registration certificate from ADHS is required to provide a copy of its bylaws specifying whether the dispensary plans to \"[p]repare, sell, or dispense marijuana-infused non-edible products.\" Ariz. Admin. Code R9-17-304(C)(8)(b)(vi). According to ADHS's dispensary handbook, non-edible products include \"any non-edible items, such as\n   <em>\n    concentrates\n   </em>\n   , sold that contain medical marijuana\" and must be labeled with the amount of marijuana they contain.

A dispensary may sell these products as long as the patient does not exceed his \"allowable amount of marijuana\" within a fourteen-day period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285118\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/58/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The regulations and handbook confirm ADHS's understanding that all forms of marijuana, including the resin of and concentrates derived from the marijuana plant-cannabis-are subject to the protections of the AMMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 It is not speculation, but rather, adherence to the basic canons of statutory construction, which controls resolution of the present appeal. In my view, the inquiry ends\n   at the plain language of A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801(8) : \"Any and all parts of any plant of the genus cannabis, whether growing or not, and the seeds of such plant\" includes both the leaves of the marijuana plant and the resin extracted therefrom. Additionally, application of the definition as written is consistent with the spirit and purpose of the AMMA and neither impossible nor absurd. To hold otherwise supplants the statutory language approved by the voters of this State in favor of an arguably more palatable but unfounded interpretation, and that is simply not within the purview of the appellate court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Ed. of Pearce Union High Sch.

Notably, the AMMA does not exclude the \"nonusable\" parts-the seeds, stalks, roots, or the marijuana \"incidental to medical use\"-from the scope of its immunity. Accordingly, the classification of specific parts of the marijuana plant as usable or nonusable is relevant only to determine whether a person exceeds the allowable amount of marijuana permitted under the AMMA, and the \"mixture or preparation\" language does not alter the definition of \"marijuana.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
