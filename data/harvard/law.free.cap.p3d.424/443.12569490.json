Following a successful appeal, Martin was retried and convicted of first-degree murder. Martin appeals that conviction and resulting sentence,\n   arguing double jeopardy barred his second trial for first-degree murder because the first jury's inability to agree on first-degree murder constituted an implied acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that double jeopardy did not bar Martin's second trial for first-degree murder. The first jury clearly and formally stated it was unable to agree on the greater charge of first-degree murder after it was instructed that it could proceed to consider the lesser charge if after reasonable efforts it was unable to unanimously agree on first-degree murder. This constituted a genuine deadlock permitting retrial on first-degree murder, rather than an implied acquittal barring retrial. Accordingly, we affirm Martin's conviction and sentence for first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On appeal after the first trial, we held that the superior court had erred in refusing to give a crime prevention instruction, reversed Martin's conviction for second-degree murder, and remanded for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. Dec. 23, 2014) (mem. decision). Before the second trial, the superior court granted the State's motion to retry Martin for first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to supporting the conviction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   showed that Martin and the victim were neighbors on a dirt road in Golden Valley. Martin routinely placed railroad ties and other debris on the road in front of his driveway to cover ruts that developed after rainstorms. On the day of the incident, the victim and a friend came upon these impediments in the road. After removing a railroad tie, the victim told his friend he was \"gonna go ask why he keeps throwing stuff across the road.\" As the victim walked toward Martin's house, the friend saw a muzzle blast from the front window of Martin's house and saw the victim fall to the ground. The victim died of shotgun wounds to his abdomen from a single shotgun blast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Martin admitted to the first deputy sheriff to arrive that he shot the victim. He told a detective and later testified that he did so because the victim ignored his demands to get off his property and he believed the victim was armed and was coming toward him to harm him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The jury convicted Martin of first-degree murder, and the court sentenced him to natural life. Martin filed a timely notice of appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and Arizona Revised Statutes sections 12-120.21(A)(1), 13-4031, and -4033(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Martin argues double jeopardy barred the State from trying him for first-degree murder after he had been convicted in the first trial of second-degree murder. Specifically, Martin argues the jury's inability to agree on first-degree murder was an implied acquittal and not a genuine deadlock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Before the second trial, the superior court ruled that Martin could be retried on first-degree murder because the jury had checked the box on the verdict form, \"Unable to agree\" on the offense of first-degree murder after it was instructed that it could find him guilty of the lesser crime \"if all of you agree that the state has failed to prove the defendant guilty of the more serious crime beyond a reasonable doubt, or if\n   <em>\n    after reasonable efforts you are unable to unanimously agree on the more serious crime, ....\n   </em>\n   \" The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the jury instruction and based on the verdict form, the jury clearly indicated that they were deadlocked on the greater charge because they were unable to agree unanimously. Accordingly, there was not an implied acquittal of the greater charge and the court finds there was a genuine deadlock. Therefore, the Court finds that the State has demonstrated a manifest necessity\n   for continuing the defendant's jeopardy for First Degree Murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The Double Jeopardy Clauses in the United States and Arizona Constitutions, which are coextensive, prohibit: \"(1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Lemke v.

The case does not suggest a double jeopardy bar when the verdict form specifies that the jurors were unable to reach a verdict on a greater offense while convicting on a lesser-included offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15\n   <em>\n    Gusler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Espinoza\n   </em>\n   are similarly distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Gusler\n   </em>\n   , the Arizona Supreme Court held that the superior court erred by prematurely granting a mistrial without having provided defense counsel information (questions submitted by the jurors) that might have provided a basis to object to the proposed mistrial or to have\n   requested more specific inquiry to the jurors.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186787\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/391/\">\n    199 Ariz. at 395, \u00b6 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186787\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/391/\">\n    18 P.3d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under those circumstances, the State had not established that there was manifest necessity for the mistrial, meaning double jeopardy barred retrial on the greater offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186787\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/391/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Espinoza\n   </em>\n   , the jury submitted a pre-verdict question indicating it \"may be hung on the first offense,\" and the trial court responded by indicating it could leave the verdict form blank and consider the lesser offense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855794\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/176/\">\n    233 Ariz. at 178, \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855794\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/176/\">\n    310 P.3d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury then convicted the defendant of the lesser offense, but left the verdict form blank as to the greater offense.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . After vacating the conviction on the lesser offense, we held that retrial was barred on the greater offense, thus treating the silent verdict on the greater offense as an acquittal.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 178, \u00b6 4, 179-180, \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855794\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/176/\">\n    310 P.3d at 54-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We noted that the jury's pre-verdict note demonstrated at most that the jury could not reach an agreement on the greater charge after \"reasonable efforts\" at deliberation, which was not equivalent to the \"genuine deadlock\" necessary to permit retrial on the greater offense.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 180, \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855794\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/176/\">\n    310 P.3d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 The cases Martin cites are distinguishable. They do not change the law that when the jury formally states on the verdict form that it has been unable to unanimously agree on the greater offense, this constitutes the equivalent of the \"genuine deadlock\" such that retrial is permitted on the greater offense. Double jeopardy accordingly did not bar retrial on the greater offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Martin's conviction and sentence for first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     State v.
