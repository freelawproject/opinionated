In April 2016, Ms. Oakland, who resided in Sheridan, Wyoming, spent a couple of weeks with Mr. Buszkiewic at his house in Laramie, Wyoming. On April 29, 2016, the couple visited several bars, with their final stop of the night being Bud's Bar in West Laramie. They stayed at the bar after it closed and played cards with the bartender until approximately 5:00 a.m. on April 30, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] When Mr. Buszkiewic and Ms. Oakland returned to Mr. Buszkiewic's house, he accused her of flirting with the bartender. He forced her into the bedroom where he placed her on the bed and slapped her several times. Mr. Buszkiewic then let her up, and she tried to reason with him. The same thing happened a few more times, with Mr. Buszkiewic taking Ms. Oakland into the bedroom, placing her on the bed, slapping her and then letting her up. During two of the slapping incidents, he also put his hands around her throat and squeezed, cutting off her airway and causing pressure in her eyes, nose and head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] Ms. Oakland eventually ran out the front door and flagged down a neighbor who was pulling his car out of his driveway. She told the neighbor that someone was after her and she needed to get away. Mr. Buszkiewic left the house when Ms. Oakland did, so she asked the neighbor to take her back to the house to get her things. Mr. Buszkiewic returned to the house about the same time as Ms. Oakland. The neighbor initially parked in the driveway of Mr. Buszkiewic's house to wait for Ms. Oakland, but then decided it was not safe to remain there, so he drove away and called 911. In the meantime, Mr. Buszkiewic took Ms. Oakland to the bedroom one more time and slapped her. She was able to gather her belongings and leave after the\n   last incident. Ms. Oakland stopped at a convenience store for gas, and the attendant noticed that she looked frightened and watchful as she pumped the gas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] Laramie police officers responded to the 911 call. They asked Mr. Buszkiewic what happened, and he said that he and his girlfriend had an argument but denied it had turned physical. The officers learned that Ms. Oakland had contacts in Sheridan, so they asked the authorities there for assistance in locating her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] Ms. Oakland drove to Sheridan and went to an urgent care facility. A physician's assistant took her history and examined her. Ms. Oakland had injuries to her face, eardrum and head, and bruising on her arms. Her voice was hoarse and she had petechiae in one eye, which the physician assistant found consistent with Ms. Oakland's report that she had been strangled. The medical staff contacted law enforcement, and Sheridan police officers interviewed Ms. Oakland and took photographs of her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b69] The Sheridan authorities reported the results of their investigation to the Laramie police, and Mr. Buszkiewic was arrested. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Buszkiewic admitted that his altercation with Ms. Oakland had turned physical, but claimed she struck him first and he had merely retaliated. The Albany County prosecutor charged Mr. Buszkiewic with two counts of strangulation of a household member in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-509\">\n    Wyo.

The prosecutor's comments were not designed to encourage the jury to decide the case based upon their sympathy for the victim, but to \"remind the jurors that they must review the evidence objectively and from the perspective of a reasonable person[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489904\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20198\">\n    931 A.2d at 212-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Connecticut Supreme Court stated that the prosecutor's request that the jurors put themselves in the place of a witness when evaluating her credibility was not an appeal to the jurors' emotions or sympathies. Instead, the prosecutor was properly asking the jury to \"draw inferences from the evidence that had been presented at trial ... based on the jurors' judgment of how a reasonable person would act under the specified circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20198\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20198\">\n    at 214-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b616] In this case, the prosecutor was not making an appeal for the jury to decide the case based upon sympathy or bias rather than the evidence. Instead, she requested that the jury consider the evidence using their life experiences and common sense. When she asked the jurors whether they would remember the number of times they had been slapped, she was requesting that they look at the evidence through the lens of their ordinary affairs. In other words, the prosecutor was simply making the point that it is human nature not to remember all of the\n   details of a violent encounter, such as the number of slaps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b617] Furthermore, part of the defense strategy was to question Ms. Oakland's credibility and the reasonableness of her actions. Defense counsel repeatedly questioned her about inconsistencies in her statements about the details of the assaults (including the number of times Mr. Buszkiewic had slapped her), why she did not try to escape sooner, why she came back to the house after she had escaped the first time, why she did not immediately seek medical treatment, and why she did not contact law enforcement in Laramie. The prosecutor's argument about the victim's inability to remember the precise number of times she was slapped was not an improper golden rule argument but, rather, a response to defense counsel's strategy. Mr. Buszkiewic has, therefore, failed to establish plain error in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b618] Although he does not raise a separate issue, Mr. Buszkiewic also asserts that the prosecutor wrongfully included herself with the jury by using personal pronouns when describing how the fact finder should determine credibility. For example, the prosecutor made statements like: \"I ask of you, if I'm in a verbal fight, why would I run after someone down the street to go after them?\"; \"[i]n this particular case, you and I-and you will be the judge of the character.\"; and \"[i]f I was trying to break down and determine who's telling the truth, you've got to lead through this as to who is believable and who is credible in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b619] Obviously, the prosecutor's statements included personal pronouns and incorrect grammar.

Rather, she was emphasizing that the jury should consider what a reasonable person would do under the same circumstances. The prosecutor made sure to emphasize to the jurors that they were the judges of the credibility of the witnesses. In one instance, she said \"you and I\" are judges of the witnesses' character, but she quickly corrected that statement, telling the jury that it was the judge of the witnesses' character. Furthermore, the jury instructions clearly informed the jurors that they were \"the exclusive judges of the facts and of the effect and value of the evidence\" and they must not regard any statement by counsel as evidence. When viewed in context, the prosecutor's statement did not violate the rule against inserting her personal beliefs into the trial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Reference to Ms. Oakland as \"the victim\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b621] Mr. Buszkiewic asserts that, by referring to Ms. Oakland as the victim, the prosecutor violated his right to be presumed innocent. The record clearly shows that the prosecutor, at times, referred to Ms. Oakland as the victim. Because we are reviewing this claim for plain error, we must determine whether the prosecutor's references to the \"victim\" violated a clear and unequivocal rule of law. This requirement recognizes that the trial judge should interject himself into the argument to stop or prevent a certain violation of a clear rule even when no attorney objects at trial. Given there was no objection to the prosecutor's use of the term victim, reversal is required only if there was a clear and unequivocal rule of law prohibiting use of that term in the manner it was used here. Although there is a clear and unequivocal rule of law that a defendant is presumed to be innocent,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802381\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/104/\">\n    370 P.3d at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it does not follow that any trial judge or attorney would or should know that a prosecutor's reference to the complaining witness as the \"victim\" constitutes a violation of the presumption of innocence. It is incumbent on Mr. Buszkiewic to demonstrate that a clear rule prohibiting use of the term \"victim\" exists or that use of the term clearly and unequivocally violates the principle that the defendant is presumed to be innocent.

The prosecutor was simply referring to Ms. Oakland's role in the criminal proceedings-she was alleged to be the victim of two strangulations by Mr. Buszkiewic. The district court and the prosecutor made it very clear through the jury instructions and argument that it was the jury's role to determine whether Mr. Buszkiewic had committed the alleged crimes against Ms. Oakland. The jury was also informed that Mr. Buszkiewic was presumed to be innocent, the State had the burden of proving all the elements of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, and statements of counsel were not evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b624] Mr. Buszkiewic cites an article from the National Crime Victim Law Institute-M. Garvin and S. LeClair, NCVLI NEWS,\n   <em>\n    Use of the Term \"Victim\" in Criminal Proceedings\n   </em>\n   (11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ed. 2009, updated 2014), https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/21940-use-of-the-term-victim-in-crim-proc11th-edpdf as support for his contention that it was error for the prosecution to use the term victim. A careful reading of that article shows that the authors actually agree with using the term \"victim\" to describe the complaining witness in a criminal case. Their review of the caselaw also confirms that courts do not routinely find error based upon the prosecution's use of the term \"victim,\" even when there is a question as to whether a crime was committed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   2. Prosecution's use of the term \"victim.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Generally, a prosecutor may not express his or her personal opinion on a defendant's guilt. Defendants often object to a prosecutor's use of the term \"victim\", arguing that it reflects the government's belief that the defendant is guilty. Specifically, they argue that the jury will give special weight to this opinion based on the prestige of the prosecutor and the fact-finding facilities available to the office. However, courts have rejected this argument based on jurors' knowledge of the criminal justice system and the role of prosecutors in the criminal trial. Any reference by the prosecutor to a victim will be viewed as merely part of the state's contention that, based on the state's evidence, the complainant was a victim of the alleged crimes. For these reasons, courts have concluded that it is not reasonably likely that a jury would interpret the prosecutor's use of the term to reflect a personal belief in a defendant's guilt. Even courts that have found that the prosecutor's use of the term \"victim\" was in error have concluded that a standard jury instruction-that the comments of prosecutor are not evidence and should be disregarded-will remove any prejudice that may arise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (footnotes and citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Weatherly v.

The prosecutor stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   We sat here and we heard Sarah, the victim, testify time after time a question asked of her: Why didn't you leave? Why did you keep talking to the Defendant? Why didn't you return to the Pierce [Street]? Why did you walk into the house and grab your clothes? What option did you leave? Why not go to the cops? Why didn't you tell [the neighbor] what he [Mr. Buszkiewic] had done and strangled you? Why didn't you tell the people what happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    This is called victim blaming. Think about it.

The prosecutor stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Where you have the photographs, the photographs of the Defendant which were taken that same day after the incident and you have the injuries of Sarah. Look at those photographs. Look at those injuries. Go back to the primary aggressor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   As you heard testimony from Officer McAlmond, that's what you determined as to who was the primary aggressor. You look to offensive wounds and defensive wounds. This is somebody who's being struck and somebody who is being-that-you're defending and the wounds that you're trying to defend someone off of you. You heard what Officer McAlmond said and your best memory of what he said.\n   <strong>\n    Those are the Defendant's actions, not the victim, and how we've turned this to the victim in blaming the victim.\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Mr. Buszkiewic claims that, in these statements, the prosecutor tried to inflame the jury against him by improperly inserting her personal opinion that Ms. Oakland was a victim and the defense was unfairly blaming her. He asserts the phrase \"victim blaming\" has negative connotations and is commonly used by news media.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b626] Often, \"victim blaming\" is a phrase used when \"people blame someone for getting themselves hurt or into a bad situation.\" www.urbandictionary.com.

As we explained in \u00b6 17 above, the record amply demonstrates that one of defense counsel's strategies was to undermine Ms. Oakland's credibility by portraying her actions as unreasonable or her testimony as unbelievable. The prosecutor, while perhaps ill-advised in using a term that often has inflammatory connotation, simply tried to persuade the jurors that their focus should be on Mr. Buszkiewic's actions. In doing so, she related her argument to the charged offenses and the evidence produced at trial. When viewed in its entirety, the prosecutor's argument was not designed to inflame the passions or prejudice of the jury or to encourage it to decide the case on anything other than the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore, when viewed in context, the prosecutor's \"victim blaming\" terminology focused specifically on evidence, and directed the jury to consider that evidence. Even if the term often has an inflammatory connotation, in this case the jury was not misdirected away from the evidence, and was not encouraged to decide the case based on passion.

During his first encounter with the police on the morning of April 30, 2016, Mr. Buszkiewic said his argument with Ms. Oakland was only verbal. He specifically denied the argument had \"turned physical.\" In Mr. Buszkiewic's second statement to police, which he made when he was arrested, he admitted he had \"retaliated\" physically after she hit him. The full context of the prosecutor's discussion during closing argument of Mr. Buszkiewic's inconsistent statements was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Why didn't the Defendant leave? Why didn't he walk out? Did anybody ask that? Why didn't he tell that officer-you'll hear the tape. Why didn't he tell the officer what happened? Why did he say he just had a verbal-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [Objection of \"beyond the scope\" sustained]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Why didn't he-why did he tell the officer that she was from North Dakota. Listen to the tape. Why didn't all this come out? So then he gets interviewed again and this time we hear on the tape ... the second time when he came back after learning of the injuries and that [Ms. Oakland] had went [sic] to Sheridan, as I said in opening and as the tape said. Listen to that tape again, what the Defendant said. The Defendant, again, he indicated in the second tape-and I-don't take my words; listen to the tapes of what he said. And he said in his own words, yeah, we had a physical [sic]. She hit me-okay-and I retaliated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b638] When considered in context, the prosecutor's rhetorical question to the jury about why Mr. Buszkiewic did not tell the officers what happened was meant to emphasize Mr. Buszkiewic's inconsistent statements to the police about whether his fight with Ms. Oakland had involved physical violence. The prosecutor was simply arguing the facts that were in evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carothers,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8219031\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/185/1/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   .

In fact, the prosecutor said in\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   that the State had the burden of proof, and the district court instructed the jury that \"[t]he law never imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence on the question of ... guilt or innocence.\" Mr. Buszkiewic, therefore, has not demonstrated that the district court violated a clear and unequivocal rule of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b640] Although not set out as a separate issue, Mr. Buszkiewic also maintains that the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing that Ms. Oakland \"stood up to what was being asked of her.\" He claims this statement inferred Ms. Oakland should be believed and it \"presupposes that the questioning of the witness by the defense [was] improper.\" We could refuse to consider this issue because Mr. Buszkiewic does not cite any pertinent authority to support his argument.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blevins,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22, 393 P.3d at 1254 (Wyo. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Willey v.

It was similar to the prosecutor's statement we approved of in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   In that case, the prosecutor stated that one of the witnesses \"felt threatened for her family.

The appellant claimed the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for the credibility of the witness when he made that statement in closing argument.

She properly commented on the evidence and asked the jurors to weigh the witnesses' testimony using their common sense and life experiences. In addition, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct in closing argument by referring to Ms. Oakland as the \"victim,\" characterizing the defense strategy as \"victim blaming,\" or calling attention to Mr. Buszkiewic's inconsistent statements to law enforcement. Because the district court did not commit any errors, there is no cumulative error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   [\u00b645] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Mr. Buszkiewic also equates a golden rule argument with a \"reptilian brain\" argument. The two arguments are similar, but are not equivalent. Like the golden rule argument, the reptilian brain argument plays on the jurors' emotions, especially their response to fear. L. Sirico, Jr.,\n    <em>\n     The Trial Lawyer and the Reptilian Brain: A Critique,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Clev.%20St.%20L.%20Rev.%20411\">\n     65 Clev. St. L. Rev. 411\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 412 (2017) explains the reptilian brain argument:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n    When humans feel threatened, the reptilian brain takes charge and controls human conduct. Therefore, if a lawyer can make a juror feel threatened, the lawyer appeals to the juror's primitive reptilian brain and virtually assures a victory. Thus, a lawyer's argument ... intensif[ies] the juror's fear that his or her physical survival is at stake as well as that of the juror's family and community. If the lawyer uses this strategy successfully[,] ... the jurors will punish [the] opponent by convicting him or her[.]\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Obviously, an argument designed to appeal to the jury's fears is improper.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Hopkinson v.
