The Labor Commission denied Mr. Oliver's application based on his failure to prove two elements of a permanent total disability claim: (1) that he was limited in his ability to do basic work activities, UTAH CODE \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(ii), and (2) that he was not prevented from performing the essential functions of work for which he had been qualified until the time of his accident,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(iii). Mr. Oliver appealed, and the Utah Court of Appeals reversed the Labor Commission's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 We now hold that the Labor Commission properly denied Mr. Oliver's application and accordingly reverse the court of appeals. For the reasons explained in this opinion, the court of appeals' interpretation of Utah Code section 34A-2-413(1)(c)(ii) -the \"basic work activities\" provision of the permanent total disability statute-is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute and our decision in\n   <em>\n    Provo City v.

Tyree Bulloch Construction (Bulloch Construction) when he fell from a suspended porch, injuring himself. For several years following his injury, Mr. Oliver worked a variety of jobs, including as a construction worker, landscape designer, and,\n   most recently, as a delivery truck driver. He stopped working altogether in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 On June 20, 2012, Mr. Oliver applied to the Utah Labor Commission for permanent total disability benefits under Utah Code section 34A-2-413, the permanent total disability statute. The parties submitted conflicting medical evidence and vocational evidence. One medical expert, Dr. Mark Passey, opined that Mr. Oliver was able to \"perform just about any activities he wishes to do,\" while another, Dr. Jacob Corry, believed that Mr. Oliver would suffer from constant attention difficulties due to his pain and a severe restriction in his ability to walk, balance, and crouch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 The parties also submitted conflicting vocational evidence. Relying on Dr. Corry's medical opinion, Mr. Oliver's vocational expert opined that Mr. Oliver likely could not perform basic work activities because he was unable to concentrate due to pain. By contrast, Bulloch Construction's vocational expert testified that Mr. Oliver was able to perform medium-duty work, and that he was not limited in his ability to do basic work activities. Bulloch Construction's expert acknowledged that, if Dr. Corry's medical opinion was correct, Mr. Oliver likely could not perform basic work activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Because of the differences in medical opinion, an administrative law judge (ALJ) appointed an independent medical panel to conduct an impartial review of the medical evidence. This panel concluded that Mr. Oliver could perform medium-duty work as long as he was able to be absent from work occasionally, elevate his legs for five to ten minutes out of every hour, and take occasional unscheduled breaks during the day. The panel also opined that, as a general matter, Mr. Oliver was able to perform basic work activities; among other things, it found that he could \"concentrate, ... commute, communicate, work, remain at work for the scheduled time, and cope with ... the work setting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 After reviewing this evidence, the ALJ found that Mr. Oliver was permanently totally disabled and tentatively awarded him permanent total disability benefits. Bulloch Construction then appealed this award to the Labor Commission, which reversed it on two grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 First, the Labor Commission concluded that Mr. Oliver had not proven that he was limited in his ability to perform basic work activities. Giving great weight to the medical panel report, the Labor Commission found that Mr. Oliver was able to work, remain at work, and cope with changes at work. It acknowledged the medical panel's conclusion that Mr. Oliver may require unscheduled breaks and may be absent from work occasionally, but found that these \"indefinite circumstances do not present a reasonable limitation on Mr. Oliver's ability to do basic work activities in light of the panel's description that he may work, remain at work, and cope with changes at work.\" Similarly, the Labor Commission found that Mr. Oliver's need to \"elevate his legs for 5-10 minutes for every hour he is required to stand is not enough to show [that he] is reasonably limited in his flexibility or endurance....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 The Labor Commission also disagreed with the ALJ's conclusion that Mr. Oliver could not perform the essential functions of his previous work as a delivery truck driver. The Labor Commission found that Mr. Oliver had been qualified to be a delivery truck driver at the time of the accident. Based on testimony about his medical and vocational ability, it also found that he had failed to prove that he was unable to perform the essential functions of that job. Accordingly, the Labor Commission concluded that Mr. Oliver had not established that he was entitled to permanent total disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 After filing an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, Mr. Oliver appealed the Labor Commission's denial of benefits to the Utah Court of Appeals. The court of appeals reversed the Labor Commission's order on two points. First, it held that the Labor Commission misinterpreted the basic work activities provision of the permanent total disability statute. Second, after consulting the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Outlook Handbook-a handbook that the parties agree was not in the record-it concluded that the Labor Commission's determination that Mr. Oliver had been qualified to\n   work as a delivery truck driver was not supported by substantial evidence. The court of appeals accordingly reinstated the ALJ's award of permanent total disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Bulloch Construction subsequently petitioned this court for certiorari, which we granted. We reverse the court of appeals and uphold the Labor Commission's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 \"On certiorari, we give the court of appeals' decision no deference and review its decision under a correctness standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Nichols v.

First, we provide an overview of the elements of a permanent disability claim and explain the work each element does and how the elements relate to each other. We then hold that the court of appeals erred in its interpretation of the basic work activities provision, explain why we reject the concurring opinion's interpretation of this provision, and uphold the Labor Commission's determination that Mr. Oliver did not prove that he was limited in his ability to do basic work activities. Third and finally, we explain the errors in the court of appeals' analysis of whether Mr. Oliver established that his impairments prevented him from performing the \"essential functions\" of the work for which he had been qualified until his accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I. THE ELEMENTS OF A PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 Under Utah Code section 34A-2-413, an employee is required to prove six elements to establish a claim for permanent total disability benefits: (1) \"the employee sustained a significant impairment\" as a result of the work-related injury, (2) \"the employee is not gainfully employed,\" (3) \"the employee has an impairment or combination of impairments that limit the employee's ability to do basic work activities,\" (4) the impairment or impairments \"prevent the employee from performing the essential functions of the work for which the employee has been qualified\" until the time of the accident, (5) \"the employee cannot perform other work reasonably available,\" and (6) \"the industrial accident or occupational disease is the direct cause of the employee's permanent total disability.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(b)-(c) ;\n   <em>\n    Provo City v. Utah Labor Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    2015 UT 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    345 P.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Utah Code section 34A-2-413(1)(b)-(c) lays out the factual elements of a permanent total disability claim, and the employee bears the burden of proving each of these factual elements by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez v. Media-Paymaster Plus/Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8349474\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/164/384/\">\n    2007 UT 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8349474\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/164/384/\">\n    164 P.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 Other than the significant impairment and causation provisions, the elements of a permanent total disability claim are all specific inquiries into an employee's ability to work. The core question at which these elements are directed is whether, notwithstanding his or her impairments, the employee can participate in the workforce. Thus, the gainful employment element asks if the employee is currently in the workforce. UTAH CODE \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(i). The essential functions element asks if the employee can still do the work he or she has been qualified for.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8349474\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/164/384/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(iii). The other work element asks if, given his or her limitations, there is any other reasonably available work for the employee to do.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8349474\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/164/384/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(iv). And, as we explain in greater detail below, the basic work activities element asks whether, irrespective of specific\n   employment prospects, the employee retains the core functionality necessary to meaningfully participate in the workforce.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8349474\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/164/384/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17 We also note that, in contrast to the federal Social Security Act, the permanent total disability statute does not require the Labor Commission to analyze these six elements in any particular sequence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, if the Labor Commission finds that an employee has failed to prove any one of these elements by a preponderance of the evidence, it must deny permanent total disability benefits; otherwise, it must award them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II. THE BASIC WORK ACTIVITIES PROVISION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 This case calls upon us to interpret Utah Code section 34A-2-413(1)(c)(ii), which requires employees seeking permanent total disability benefits to prove that they have \"an impairment or combination of impairments that limit [their] ability to do basic work activities.\" At issue in this appeal is the meaning of the word \"limit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 Our courts use a \"plain meaning\" approach to statutory interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Nichols v. Jacobsen Constr. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794776\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/3/\">\n    2016 UT 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794776\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/3/\">\n    374 P.3d 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this approach, we need not look beyond the statute's text to secondary considerations-such as legislative history or the canon that we interpret statutes to avoid absurd results-unless there is ambiguity in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramsay v. Kane Cty. Human Res. Special Serv.

To the extent that a limitation does not significantly hinder an employee in his ability to meaningfully participate in the workforce, it may be a limit on\n   <em>\n    typical\n   </em>\n   workplace activities, but it is not a limit on\n   <em>\n    basic\n   </em>\n   work activities as\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   defines them.

But, if the court of appeals' interpretation were correct, this would mean that virtually any time an employee established either the \"essential functions\" element or the \"other work reasonably available\" element, that employee would automatically establish that he or she had a limit on the ability to do basic work activities. It undermines the statutory scheme to interpret the basic work activities provision such that it adds nothing to the permanent total disability analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Finally-although we have no need to recur to secondary canons of construction when the meaning of a statute is plain and unambiguous-we note that even if the basic work activities provision were ambiguous, the \"absurd consequences\" canon would still argue in favor of the interpretation we adopt today. The absurd consequences canon instructs that when a statute is ambiguous, we \"resolve[ ] [that] ambiguity by choosing the reading that avoids\" absurd consequences.\n   <em>\n    Bagley v.

If proof of any limit, no matter how slight, were enough for employees to establish that they are limited in their ability to do basic work activities, then it is conceivable that a person could prove a permanent total disability based on a slight limp, the occasional headache, or some other minimal physical or mental limitation. While other elements of the permanent total disability statute might weed these claims out, as the concurrence speculates, this would ultimately depend on the details of the case before the Labor Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b696-98.

Indeed, we understand the interpretation of the basic work activities provision that we articulate here to be in keeping with the Labor Commission's long-standing test for whether an applicant for permanent total disability benefits has proven that he or she is limited in the ability to do basic work activities. This test looks to whether the impairment meaningfully\n   inhibits the employee from exercising a common core of capabilities \"generally required in a wide variety of employment settings\" that include the ability \"to report for work on a regular basis and remain at work throughout the day, as well as a reasonable degree of flexibility, strength, endurance, mental capacity and ability to communicate.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Dee Warner Constr.\n   </em>\n   , 2007 UT Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 41 at *9. Nothing in this opinion should be taken as a repudiation of this doctrinal implementation of the basic work activities provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29 The Labor Commission denied Mr. Oliver's application after concluding that his work restrictions-especially the requirements that he take occasional unscheduled breaks and that he may be absent from work occasionally-did not \"present a reasonable limitation on Mr. Oliver's ability to do basic work activities.\" The requirement that a limitation be \"reasonable\"-in the sense that the limitation would make it unreasonable for an employer to ask an employee to perform the tasks that are basic prerequisites of successfully working a broad swath of jobs-follows from the meaning of \"basic work activities.\" If a limit does not make it unreasonable to ask an employee to do the core tasks that are essential to a broad swath of different jobs, it is not a limit on\n   <em>\n    basic\n   </em>\n   work activities at all. In our view, the Labor Commission's conclusion that Mr. Oliver was not \"reasonably limit[ed]\" in his ability to do basic work activities amounted to a determination that he was not rendered practically incapable of performing the core tasks that are essential to a broad swath of different jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30 In sum, we hold that only those impairments that strike at the heart of the abilities and aptitudes that are necessary to most jobs-i.e., only those impairments that meaningfully inhibit an employee from performing the core tasks of a wide swath of jobs to such an extent that it would be unreasonable for an employer to ask the employee to perform those tasks-can be said to limit an employee's ability to do basic work activities. We believe that the Labor Commission was applying this interpretation when it focused on the question whether Mr. Oliver suffered from \"reasonable limitations\" in concluding that he had failed to prove that his impairments limited his ability to do basic work activities, and accordingly we find no error in the Labor Commission's construction of the permanent total disability statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Permanent Total Disability Statute Should Not Be Interpreted in Lockstep with Federal Disability Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 31 In contrast to the analysis above, the concurring opinion argues that we should read the basic work activities provision in lockstep with an element for establishing disability that has been promulgated in a federal regulation under the Social Security Act. As the concurrence puts it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Under Utah law the worker is required to show that he 'has an impairment or combination of impairments that limit the employee's ability to do basic work activities.' UTAH CODE \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(ii). This provision has an obvious counterpart in federal disability law. The parallel element under the Social Security Act requires proof of an impairment that 'significantly limit[s]' the worker's 'physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1522\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75. Thus, in the concurrence's view, the term \"limit\" in the permanent total disability statute is a \"legal term[ ] of art that [has been] transplanted from federal disability law in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b688.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 32 On the other hand, the concurrence acknowledges that federal law \"requires a finding of a 'significant limit' on basic work activities, while our Utah workers' compensation standard speaks only of a 'limit.' \"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b691 (quoting\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b627 n.6). But it says that this distinction cannot support our test for whether an impairment limits a worker's ability to perform basic work activities. Instead, keying into the fact that federal courts have largely read the term \"significant\" out of federal disability law, the concurrence concludes that \"the inference to be drawn\" from the fact that \"[f]ederal law speaks in terms of a 'significant limit' and our statute is phrased in terms of only a 'limit' \" is that \"the Utah legislature deliberately omitted the term 'significant' in order to align its standard more closely with the standard employed in federal\n   cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b692. We cannot bring ourselves to interpret the legislature's decision to depart from the wording of a federal standard as a mandate to employ that very standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 33 To begin, we have a great deal of respect for the canon that \"[w]hen the legislature borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken.\"\n   <em>\n    Maxfield v.

But this is an unusual case in which to invoke that presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 34 Before 1995, the permanent total disability statute operated in lockstep with federal disability law, providing that permanent total disability was to be evaluated using the \"sequential decision-making process of the Social Security Administration.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 35-1-67(1)(b) (1994). In 1995, however, the legislature caused the permanent total disability statute to deviate from federal disability law, enacting a set of Utah-specific elements for establishing permanent total disability. While the gist of our permanent total disability statute is similar to federal disability law-they both aim at figuring out whether a worker is disabled-\n   <em>\n    every single element\n   </em>\n   in the permanent total disability statute is worded differently from federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 35 Thus, because the legislature replaced the statute expressly incorporating federal disability law with a statute that articulates its own standards in a manner that deviates from the federal language, a threshold condition for invoking the presumption set forth in\n   <em>\n    Maxfield\n   </em>\n   -that the legislature has \"borrowed\" terms of art from another sovereign's law-is not present here. To be sure, the legislature\n   <em>\n    had borrowed\n   </em>\n   from federal disability law. But then, in 1995, it gave it back. Thus, in the absence of a reason to invoke the\n   <em>\n    Maxfield\n   </em>\n   presumption, we interpret our permanent total disability statute according to the default assumption that our sovereign legislature enacts its own sovereign laws that this court then interprets using its plain meaning approach to statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 36 The concurrence's best argument to the contrary is that there are numerous structural similarities between the permanent total disability statute and federal disability law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is what the concurrence is getting at when it states that the permanent total disability statute \"incorporat[es] numerous elements that are obviously imported from disability standards embedded in social security law\"-supporting this contention with a footnote illustrating that \"[f]our of\n   [the] elements [of a federal disability claim] are mirrored in the Utah Workers' Compensation Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b674 &amp; n.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 37 This argument trades on an equivocation. Because while it is true that several elements of a permanent total disability claim are\n   <em>\n    conceptually similar\n   </em>\n   to several elements of a federal disability claim, those conceptually similar elements are all expressed in\n   <em>\n    different language\n   </em>\n   from their federal \"mirror[s].\" Of course if\n   <em>\n    language\n   </em>\n   in a state statute mirrors\n   <em>\n    language\n   </em>\n   in a federal statute, then that is a strong argument that the state statute is borrowing terms of art from the federal statute.

And it is true that federal courts have interpreted the phrase \"significant limit\" to incorporate a \"de minimis standard\"-under which an impairment \"significantly limits\" a person's ability to work unless it establishes only \"a slight abnormality or a combination of slight abnormalities which would have\n   <em>\n    no more than a minimal effect\n   </em>\n   on an individual's ability to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

Instead, as we have explained, the plain meaning of the phrase \"limit on an employee's basic work activities\" connotes something that impairs an employee's ability to perform the basic tasks that are essential prerequisites of employment-something that makes it unreasonable for an employer to demand work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b629-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 42 Thus, as\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   recognized,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b624 &amp; n.5, baked into the basic work activities provision is a definition of \"limit\" on which any limit must be meaningful or significant. We, of course, acknowledge the irony that, on our interpretation, \"limit\" means \"significant limit\" whereas on the federal interpretation \"significant limit\" means \"de minimis limit.\" But this irony is the consequence of two different court systems employing two different modes of interpretation in two different statutory contexts. It is not an indictment of our plain meaning approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 43 Two final comments on the concurrence. First, the concurrence believes that its interpretation of the basic work activities provision would not render that provision superfluous. It acknowledges that, on its interpretation, any permanent total disability claimant who can establish the \"essential functions\" element or the \"other work reasonably available\" element will also automatically be able to establish the basic work activities element-so, in this sense, the provision does no work. But it suggests that this provision can nonetheless \"fulfill[ ] a threshold function\" by \"weed[ing] out baseless claims that should proceed no further because the claimant cannot identify any effect on an activity that is 'basic' to most jobs.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b699. And we agree with the concurrence that one valuable function of the basic work activities provision is to function as a threshold condition that weeds out meritless claims. Ironically, however, by holding that any limit on a basic work activity allows an employee to get past the threshold, the concurrence would gut this function of the basic work activities provision, making it so that whenever a claim would be weeded out by the basic work activities provision it would also clearly be weeded out by other elements of a permanent total disability claim. So we do not see how the concurrence's commitment to this threshold function of the basic work activities provision provides much support to its interpretation, and, concomitantly, we still believe that our interpretation helps avoid surplussage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 44 Finally, the concurrence worries that the interpretation of the basic work activities provision that we articulate today is \"a fuzzy one\" that \"seems destined to bring disarray and unpredictability to a field that is designed for efficiency and ease of decision-making.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b678. As a practical matter, this criticism cannot be right. Our standard is the very same standard that the administrators\n   of the workers compensation system have been using for years-a standard that looks to whether an employee's limitations are consistent with that employee's maintaining \"a reasonable degree of flexibility, strength, endurance, mental capacity and ability to communicate.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b628 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Dee Warner Constr.\n   </em>\n   , 2007 UT Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 41 at *9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We think a surer path to \"disarray and unpredictability\" lies in upending settled agency law in the absence of any evidence or argument that it has been misadministered. In any event, whether disarray and unpredictability is, indeed, our destiny will be tested one way or another, as we note that the legislature recently amended the statute to inject this putative fuzziness-or something very close to it-into the basic work activities provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Utah%20Laws%20168\">\n    2016 Utah Laws 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring employees seeking permanent total disability benefits to show that they suffer from an impairment that \"\n   <em>\n    reasonably\n   </em>\n   limit[s] the employee's ability to do basic work activities\" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 45 But perhaps the concurrence's criticism is meant theoretically:\n   <em>\n    in theory\n   </em>\n   , bright-line rules are more efficient and predictable than standards. Fair enough as a general rule, but, in the context of this statute, we do not think the concurrence's bright-line rule will deliver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 46 This is because the bright-line rule that the concurrence proposes fails to map to the natural way of thinking about the basic work activities provision and ultimately buries a \"fuzzy\" standard in another clause of that law. To see this, it is necessary only to examine the concurrence's own attempt to explain our decision in\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   in a way that permits it to coexist with the concurrence's test. The concurrence tells us that\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   \"simply holds that full range of motion in a worker's head and neck is not a matter that goes to 'basic work activities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b683. Unlike on our reading-according to which\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that without a showing of a significant limit on an employee's range of motion the employee cannot satisfy the basic work activities element of a permanent total disability claim,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b624-the concurrence reads\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   to stand for the proposition that \"full range of motion in a worker's head and neck\" is not a basic work activity,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b683. True, says the concurrence, the employee in\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   was\n   <em>\n    limited\n   </em>\n   in his ability to move his head or neck. But this is not a basic work activity. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   , there was no need to inquire into the \"\n   <em>\n    extent\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    degree\n   </em>\n   \" of the limitation.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b684.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 47 But of course, there was a need to inquire into the extent or degree of the employee's limitation in\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   -even by the concurrence's lights. For, even on the concurrence's reading,\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   \"holds that\n   <em>\n    full\n   </em>\n   range of motion in a worker's head and neck is not a matter that goes to 'basic work activities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b683 (emphasis added). How limited, then, must the range of motion in a worker's head and neck be before it impacts his ability to do basic work activities? At times, the concurrence appears to read\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   to stand for the proposition that \"neck flexibility\" can never be a \"basic work activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b683. But this is an absurd reading of\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   : consider a claimant who cannot move his head at all coupled with expert testimony that he therefore cannot perform any category of work, including sedentary office work. So the Labor Commission must assess the degree of an employee's limitation-just as our opinion holds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 48 Because the Labor Commission cannot help but wade into questions of the extent to which an employee is limited in his or her ability to do basic work activities, the concurrence does not reduce \"fuzziness\" or otherwise simplify or clarify the Labor Commission's task. To the contrary, it complicates that task by forbidding the Labor Commission\n   from wrestling with these problems in the most intuitive way-by thinking about how significant a limit must be before it counts as a limit on basic work activities. And it does so for the sake of a bright line: so that it can say that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   limit on basic work activities satisfies the provision. So instead of thinking naturally about the problem, the concurrence requires the Labor Commission to bury its analysis of the degree of limitation in its assessment of whether it is dealing with a \"basic work activity.\" This is unnecessary formalism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 49 We are unpersuaded by the concurrence and therefore adhere to the interpretation set out above: only those impairments that strike at the heart of the abilities and aptitudes that are necessary to most jobs-i.e., only those impairments that meaningfully inhibit an employee from performing the core tasks of a wide swath of jobs to such an extent that it would be unreasonable for an employer to ask the employee to perform those tasks-can be said to limit an employee's ability to do basic work activities.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b630.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Labor Commission's Determination that Mr. Oliver Failed to Satisfy the Basic Work Activities Element Is Supported by Substantial Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 50 The remaining question with respect to the Labor Commission's determination that Mr. Oliver failed to prove that he was limited in his ability to do basic work activities is whether substantial evidence supports that conclusion. Based in large part on the interpretive mistake we have already described, the court of appeals concluded that it does not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 51 In his brief to this court, Mr. Oliver points to evidence in the record that he suffers from pain, a \"42% whole body impairment rating,\" and limitations on standing and lifting. He further points to the conclusion of the impartial medical panel that he may be absent from work occasionally due to left-leg swelling and that he may have to take occasional unscheduled breaks during the work day. But Mr. Oliver also acknowledges, without challenging, the Labor Commission's determination that he was capable of performing medium-duty work. This determination reflects the impartial medical panel's conclusion-which it reached after a comprehensive review of the medical evidence in this case-that \"Mr. Oliver may function at a medium duty classification\" and that he is able to \"understand, concentrate, interact, commute, communicate, work, remain at work for the scheduled time, and cope with the changes of the work setting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 52 There is conflicting evidence in this case. Mr. Oliver presented medical and vocational evidence suggesting that he was in too much pain to be able to do basic work activities; Bulloch Construction, by contrast, presented Dr. Passey's medical opinion that Mr. Oliver could \"perform just about any activities he wishes to do.\" It also called a vocational\n   expert who testified that, based on Dr. Passey's medical opinion and a recent surveillance video showing Mr. Oliver performing manual labor, he believed that Mr. Oliver was able to do all activities that are required to obtain and maintain consistent, regular, full-time employment and could perform medium-duty work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The medical panel's opinion confirmed Mr. Lancaster's vocational assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 53 There may have been a reasonable chain of inferences from the evidence before the Labor Commission to the conclusion that Mr. Oliver was limited in his ability to do basic work activities. Certainly an employee's level of pain, ability to stand and lift, and ability to keep a regular employment schedule are all relevant to whether he or she is limited in the ability to do basic work activities.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    2015 UT 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 29-30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    345 P.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that substantial evidence supported the Labor Commission's finding that an employee was limited in his ability to do basic work activities where the employee testified that certain basic activities would incapacitate him for hours or days with nausea and pain).

THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS PROVISION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 54 In its order denying Mr. Oliver's application for permanent total disability benefits, the Labor Commission found that Mr. Oliver had failed to prove that his impairments prevent him from performing the \"essential functions\" of a delivery truck driver-a job that the Labor Commission found Mr. Oliver to have been qualified for at the time of his work-related accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(iii) (to establish a claim for permanent total disability benefits, an employee must prove that his or her impairments \"prevent the employee from performing the essential functions of the work activities for which the employee has been qualified until the time of the industrial accident....\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 55 The court of appeals held that this determination was not supported by substantial evidence based on its conclusion that the record was \"not clear\" on whether Mr. Oliver had been qualified to be a delivery truck driver at the time of his accident. But as we have already explained, the employee bears the burden of proving each element of a permanent total disability claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b615. This means that the absence of record evidence in this case cuts against Mr. Oliver, not Bulloch Construction. It was up to Mr. Oliver to prove that he lacked the qualifications of a delivery truck driver; it was not Bulloch Construction's burden to introduce evidence of Mr. Oliver's employment qualifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 56 We recognize that the burden of proof on this element requires an employee to prove a negative. Bearing this in mind, we emphasize that the employee's burden of production is not high. In the first instance, all the employee need adduce is competent testimony (by the employee or others) that the only job he or she was qualified to perform was the job he or she was working at the time of the injury. If the employer does not then challenge this testimony or otherwise\n   introduce contrary evidence, this production-even if it comes in as minimal a form as a blanket statement by the employee about his or her qualifications-will ordinarily suffice to meet the employee's burden of proof on the essential functions element. But when, as here, an employer has fairly put at issue an employee's qualifications to do a particular job, the employee fails to address the issue with specific testimony or evidence at his peril. Certainly, on appellate review for substantial evidence, any lack of clarity in the record regarding whether the employee is qualified can only weigh against the employee (who bears the burden of proof), not the employer (who does not).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 57 Finally, we note that the court of appeals erred when it informed its substantial evidence review by consulting extra-record information about the qualifications of delivery truck drivers compiled by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In appeals from formal administrative adjudications, reviewing courts are limited to the administrative record before them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-4-403(4) (\"The appellate court shall grant relief only if,\n   <em>\n    on the basis of the agency's record\n   </em>\n   , it determines that a person seeking judicial review has been substantially prejudiced....\" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 58 The court of appeals misinterpreted the basic work activities provision of the permanent total disability statute. It also misallocated the burden of proof and improperly considered information that was not contained in the administrative record. We reverse the court of appeals and uphold the Labor Commission's decision to deny Mr. Oliver's application for permanent total disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Associate Chief Justice Lee, concurring in the judgment:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 59 The Utah Workers' Compensation Act prescribes a list of elements necessary to sustain a claim for \"permanent total disability\" benefits. One of those elements is at issue here. It requires a showing that \"an impairment or combination of impairments ... limit[s]\" the claimant's \"ability to do basic work activities.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 60 We interpreted one clause of this element in our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Provo City v. Utah Labor Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    2015 UT 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    345 P.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   we interpreted the \"basic work activities\" clause. In so doing we noted that the permanent total disability standard incorporates \"identical language\" to that used in \"federal social security law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. With that in mind, we construed the Workers' Compensation Act to incorporate an established term of art in disability law. We noted that federal law \"defines 'basic work activities' as 'the abilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1521\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (2012) ). And we applied that standard in concluding that a workers' compensation claimant's \"ability to perform basic work activities\" was supported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   noted the claimant's testimony that \"certain basic activities, like walking, could cause his condition to worsen such that he could do nothing but rest for two or three days.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 30. And in light of that testimony we upheld the labor commission's determination that the worker's \"basic work activities\" were \"limited.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 61 This case is the logical successor to\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   . Here we are asked to interpret the \"limit\" clause of the same provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   . We are asked to determine the nature or extent of the \"limit\" on basic work activities that must be proven to fulfill this element of the Workers' Compensation Act. The majority answers that question by reference to our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   . It says that\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   supports its determination that the \"limit\" clause requires proof of a\n   <em>\n    significant\n   </em>\n   \"limit\" on those activities.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b624. Thus, the majority holds that a worker must show that his impairment \"\n   <em>\n    significantly\n   </em>\n   hinder[s]\" his \"ability to\n   <em>\n    meaningfully participate\n   </em>\n   in the workforce\" in order to establish this element of a permanent\n   total disability under the Workers' Compensation Act.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b624 (emphasis added). Alternatively, the court says that the limitation required by statute must be \" 'reasonable'-in the sense that the limitation would make it unreasonable for an employer to ask an employee to perform the tasks that are basic prerequisites of successfully working a broad swath of jobs.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b629.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 62 Applying this standard, the majority affirms the labor commission's determination that Mark Oliver was not \"limited\" in his ability to do \"basic work activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b629. It holds, in other words, that Oliver \"was not rendered practically incapable of performing the core tasks that are essential to a broad swath of different jobs.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b629. And in so doing the majority reverses the court of appeals' contrary conclusion-its holding that \"the Commission's determinations were based on incorrect legal standards and were not supported by the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Oliver v.

In that case we interpreted the\n   <em>\n    basic work activities\n   </em>\n   clause of the permanent total disability statute. In so doing we looked to federal disability law as a sort of \"specialized dictionary\" informing our interpretation of the parallel language in Utah's permanent total disability statute. A similar approach sustains the interpretation that I would adopt here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 73 Historically, the \"permanent total disability\" standard under the Workers' Compensation Act was tied expressly to federal disability law. Prior to amendments made in 1995, the Act stated that \"[p]ermanent total disability for purposes of this chapter requires a finding by the commission of total disability, as measured by the substance of the sequential decision-making process of the Social Security Administration under Title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations as revised.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 35-1-67(1)(b) (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 74 In 1995, the legislature eliminated the express incorporation of the \"sequential decision-making process of the Social Security Administration.\" S.B. 123, 51st Leg., Gen. Sess. (Utah 1995). Thus, the Workers' Compensation Act now prescribes its own standard of \"permanent total disability.\" Yet the Utah standard, while no longer verbatim the federal standard, still borrows substantially from federal law-incorporating numerous elements that are obviously imported from disability standards embedded in social security law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 75 The provision at issue here is no exception. Under Utah law the worker is required to show that he \"has an impairment or combination of impairments that limit the employee's ability to do basic work activities.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(ii). This provision has an obvious counterpart in federal disability law. The parallel element under the Social Security Act requires proof of an impairment that \"significantly limit[s]\" the worker's \"physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1522\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 76 We connected the dots between the state and federal provisions in our decision in\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   . In that case, as noted, we considered the meaning of the \"basic work activities clause.\" And in interpreting that clause our\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   opinion noted the parallel terms and structure of the state and federal schemes and thus interpreted the Workers' Compensation Act to have incorporated a legal term of art from federal disability law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    2015 UT 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 28-29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    345 P.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, we gave content to \"basic work activities\" by incorporating the federal definition of that clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 28 (quoting federal disability law in concluding that our workers' compensation standard \"defines 'basic work activities' as 'the abilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 77 I would follow a similar path here. I would interpret the \"limit\" clause as incorporating a term of art from federal (social security) disability law. And because the federal standard sets a low bar for \"limit\"-giving literal application to the full scope of this term (encompassing any non-\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   impairment that may\n   <em>\n    bind\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    restrain\n   </em>\n   , or confine)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   -I would interpret the Workers' Compensation Act to incorporate the same standard. I would hold that a worker can show that an impairment \"limit[s]\" her basic work activities if she can show that it has some non-\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   effect of restraining or confining her from performing those activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 78 The above also further undermines the majority's contrary conclusion-its requirement of proof of a \"significant\" limitation that prevents the worker from \"meaningfully\" participating in the workforce, or in other words that would make it \"unreasonable\" for an employer to ask an employee to perform the basic functions of most jobs.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b624-29. That standard is a fuzzy one. It seems destined to bring disarray and unpredictability to a field that is designed for efficiency and ease of decision-making. A limitation deemed \"significant\" by one ALJ may justifiably be treated as insignificant by another. That is troubling, and another reason to disagree with the standard embraced by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 79 The majority identifies three principal grounds for the standard it articulates: (a)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   the analysis in our\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   opinion, (b) wording differences between the state and federal standards, and (c) canons of construction.

And in my view the inference is unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 81 The majority is right to say that the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   had alleged an impairment that \"limited\" his \"full range of motion with his head and neck.\"\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    2015 UT 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882274\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1242/\">\n    345 P.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The majority overrides the established, term-of-art understanding of \"limit\" in its opinion. And in my view it identifies no persuasive ground for so doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 91 The court's proffered reason for finding the federal standard \"unhelpful\" is its identification of a difference in the wording of the two provisions. Specifically, the court notes that the social security standard \"requires a finding of a 'significant limit' \" on basic work activities, while our Utah workers' compensation standard speaks only of a \"limit.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b627 n.6. And in light of that\n   difference the majority rejects the federal standard and adopts its own preferred standard instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 92 The court's premise is correct. This is an instance in which the wording of our law is not quite identical to the federal source from which it was initially drawn. And I have no quarrel with the general idea that such a difference could be a ground for deciding that our legislature has departed from the usual paradigm of borrowing legal terms of art from federal disability law. The problem, however, is that the wording difference identified by the court cuts directly against the standard that it adopts in its decision. Federal law speaks in terms of a \"significant limit\" and our statute is phrased in terms of only a \"limit.\" So, if anything, the inference to be drawn is that the Utah Legislature deliberately omitted the term \"significant\" in order to align its standard more closely with the standard employed in federal cases. Yet the majority allows the difference in wording to cut precisely in the opposite direction. It interprets the\n   <em>\n    elimination\n   </em>\n   of the word \"significant\" in our state statute as an indication that the legislature meant to\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   proof of a \"significant\" limit on basic work activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b624 (requiring proof that the limit on work activities be \"significant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 93 That makes no sense to me. I see nothing in the Workers' Compensation Act that undercuts the premise of our\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   opinion-which is that our permanent total disability standard incorporates legal terms of art imported from federal disability law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 94 The majority also seeks to sustain its standard on the basis of canons of construction. It says that its construction of the \"limit\" clause is supported by the presumption against surplusage and the \" 'absurd consequences' canon.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b625, 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 95 In support of the first point the court cites other elements of the standard for establishing a permanent total disability-inability to perform \"essential functions\" of work for which the worker has been qualified and inability to perform \"other work reasonably available.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b626. The court also notes that \"[e]ach of these provisions can be met only if an employee suffers from some limitation on the ability to do some common workplace activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b626. And for that reason the court concludes that the \"limit\" clause must require proof of a \"significant\" degree of limitation. Otherwise, the court says, \"any time an employee established either the 'essential functions' element or the 'other work reasonably available' element, that employee would automatically establish that he or she had a limit on the ability to do basic work activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b626. And in the majority's view that would rob the \"limit\" clause of independent meaning-a view that would run counter to the presumption against surplusage.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b626.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 96 The majority's \"absurd consequences\" point is a corollary to this one. Invoking this canon, the court says that \"[i]f proof of any limit, no matter how slight, were enough for employees to establish that they are limited in their ability to do basic work activities, then it is conceivable that a person could prove a permanent total disability based on a slight limp, the occasional headache, or some other minimal physical or mental limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b627.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 97 The consequence imagined by the majority would indeed be absurd. And if the federal disability standard would sustain a right to \"permanent total disability\" upon mere proof of any slight limit on basic work activities (like walking or carrying out simple instructions), then I would agree that the \"limit\" required by statute must be a significant or material one. But that is not what the federal standard entails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 98 The flaw in the majority's analysis is its failure to credit the role of the \"limit\" clause in the greater statutory scheme. Proof of a \"limit\" on basic work activities does not by itself sustain a right to permanent total disability benefits. Several other elements must be established to sustain a showing of a permanent total disability-including the worker's inability to perform \"essential functions\" of jobs he has been qualified to do and the inability to perform \"other work reasonably available.\" And a worker with only a \"slight limp\" or an \"occasional headache\" would be unable to satisfy these elements,\n   and thus would not qualify for permanent total disability benefits on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 99 The federal standard, moreover, does not render the \"limit\" clause meaningless. In federal law the \"limit\" clause fulfills a threshold function. It weeds out baseless claims that should proceed no further because the claimant cannot identify any effect on an activity that is \"basic\" to most jobs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Analysis of this question is relatively simple and straightforward because it is limited to review of the medical evidence submitted by the claimant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Higgs v.

But the \"limit\" clause can still fulfill the function that it performs in federal law-of weeding out meritless claims at a threshold level. And the prospect of that application preserves independent meaning for the \"limit\" clause, and thus defeats the majority's reliance on the presumption against surplusage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 101 For the above reasons, the majority's standard finds no support in precedent, in statutory text, or in canons of construction. That should take us back to the plain language of the statute-to the requirement of proof that an impairment \"limit[s]\" a claimant's \"ability to do basic work activities.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 34A-2-413(1)(c)(ii). And in my view we should read the reference to \"limit\" as an incorporation of the federal (social security) standard for this term-a standard that gives literal application to the full scope of this term, encompassing\n   <em>\n    any degree\n   </em>\n   to which an impairment may\n   <em>\n    bind\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    restrain\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    confine\n   </em>\n   a worker's \"basic work activities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 102 The majority adds a range of modifiers that do not appear on the face of the statute. Instead of crediting\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   \"limit,\" the court says that only \"significant\" limits should count.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b624. Elsewhere the court frames the standard a bit differently. It says that a claimant must show that the \"limit\" on basic work activities is one that \"significantly hinder[s]\" his \"ability to\n   <em>\n    meaningfully participate\n   </em>\n   in the workforce\" in order to establish this element of a permanent total disability under the Workers' Compensation Act.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b624. Alternatively, the court says that the limitation required by statute must be \" 'reasonable'-in the sense that the limitation would make it unreasonable for an employer to ask an employee to perform the tasks that are basic prerequisites of successfully working a broad swath of jobs.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b629.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 103 I am unsure what these standards will mean in practice. At this stage I do not think we are in any position to say that our approach is \"in keeping with the Labor Commission's long-standing test\" on this element.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b628, 45. The majority quotes\n   only a pre-\n   <em>\n    Provo City\n   </em>\n   case that invokes the \"basic work activities\" standard, not the limit clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b628, (quoting\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Dee Warner Constr.\n   </em>\n   , 2007 UT Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 41, at *9). With respect to the term \"limit,\" the commission in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   determined that \"this provision only requires that all Mr. Anderson's impairments 'limit' his ability to do basic work activities-the provision does not require that the impairments totally preclude or prevent such work activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 2007 UT Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 41, at *9. Unlike the present case, the commission in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   did not apply the \"reasonable limit\" standard adopted by the majority. Ultimately, moreover, we owe no deference to the labor commission's interpretation of the governing statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellis-Hall Consultants v. Pub. Serv.

Yet I would nonetheless affirm the labor commission's determination that Oliver failed to establish a permanent total disability. I would do so under the \"essential functions\" element of the statutory standard. I find the majority's analysis of this issue persuasive. And I would affirm the labor commission on the ground that Oliver failed to establish that he was unable to perform the \"essential functions\" of a job for which he was qualified at the time of his accident (that of a delivery truck driver).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b654-57.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    In 2016, the legislature amended this provision to provide that employees needed to prove that they had \"an impairment or combination of impairments that\n    <em>\n     reasonably\n    </em>\n    limit [their] ability to do basic work activities.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Utah%20Laws%20168\">\n     2016 Utah Laws 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
