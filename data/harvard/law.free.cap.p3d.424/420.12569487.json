In each case, the insureds assigned to EcoDry their \"rights, benefits, proceeds and causes of action\" under the policies. After Farmers refused to pay EcoDry's repair bills in full, EcoDry sued the insurer, alleging breach of the insurance policies. Farmers petitions this court for special action relief from a superior court order denying Farmers' Motion to Dismiss the complaint. We accept jurisdiction but deny relief, holding Farmers' insureds validly assigned to EcoDry their rights to sue to collect post-loss benefits under the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 Farmers issued homeowners' insurance policies to four homeowners who later required water damage mitigation and restoration services. Each policy contained an anti-assignment provision stating that the insured's \"interest in this policy may not be transferred to another person without [Farmers'] written consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 In August and September 2016, each insured signed a \"Work Order Agreement to Perform Emergency Services, Direct Pay Authorization &amp; Assignment of Benefits\" (\"Work Order\") authorizing EcoDry to perform emergency water mitigation services. Each Work Order included an assignment of benefits clause (\"the assignments\"). Each assignment read, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [The insured] hereby assigns any and all insurance rights, benefits, proceeds and causes of action under any applicable insurance policies to [EcoDry]. This assignment is made in consideration of [EcoDry] performing the services and in consideration of [EcoDry] not requiring a down payment from [the insured] prior to starting work....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [The insured] further authorizes and instructs [the insured's] insurance company to pay directly to [EcoDry] the amount shown on the final billing for the work done by [EcoDry] in connection with this claim. [The insured] also understands that the insurance company is billed as a courtesy and convenience to [the insured]. Should [the insured's] insurance company fail to honor the assignment and direction to pay, [the insured] agrees to pay [EcoDry] any balances due from [the insured's] personal funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [The insured] understands and agrees that [EcoDry] is working for [the insured] and not for [the insured's] insurance company. Therefore, it is understood that [the insured] is ultimately responsible for payment of said services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 4 Farmers did not consent to any of the assignments. After finishing its work for the insureds, EcoDry submitted invoices directly to Farmers. In each case, Farmers directly paid EcoDry an amount less than the invoice total. EcoDry then filed a complaint against Farmers, alleging the insureds had assigned to EcoDry their \"post-loss rights\" under the policies, and that Farmers breached the policies by \"refus[ing] to pay the reasonable, usual, and customary charges to restore the insured property to pre-loss condition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 5 Farmers moved to dismiss EcoDry's complaint for failure to state a claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), arguing EcoDry did not have a contractual relationship with Farmers nor a valid assignment of the insureds' rights under the insurance policies. After receiving EcoDry's response and Farmers' reply, the superior court denied the Motion to Dismiss. Farmers then petitioned this court for special action review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    SPECIAL ACTION JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 6 Special action jurisdiction is discretionary but appropriate when the petitioner has no \"equally plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal.\" Ariz.

Farmers and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   argue that such assignments will cause more expense and higher payouts by insurers, suggesting that over time, insureds will suffer higher premiums as a result. But the assignments do not grant EcoDry any rights greater than those held by the insureds-assignors. The policies obligate Farmers to pay the reasonable\n   costs of repair, regardless of whether the claim for coverage is pressed by an insured or by EcoDry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 We hold the insureds made valid post-loss assignments of \"rights, benefits, proceeds, and causes of action\" under their insurance policies. Although the language of the assignments appears broad, EcoDry's pending complaint only seeks amounts payable under the policies, and at oral argument EcoDry acknowledged that the only claims it raises under the assignments are for post-loss damages suffered by the insureds. We therefore only address the validity of the assignments insofar as they apply to post-loss rights and benefits, and hold EcoDry has standing to enforce those claims under the policies. Accordingly, the superior court did not err by denying Farmers' Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fid. Sec. Life Ins. Co. v.

We do not address whether the assignments at issue purport to assign such a claim, which the parties have not briefed, because EcoDry's second amended complaint presents just one claim-breach of contract, for which it seeks \"actual damages, including interest, as a result of [Farmers'] failure to pay the full amount for services rendered pursuant to the contract.\" Nor do we accept Farmers' related contention that the assignments allow EcoDry to pursue its claims \"unhampered by the policy's obligations.\" EcoDry conceded at oral argument it is subject to the same obligations under the policies as the insureds. Further, in responding to EcoDry's demands for payment, Farmers retains every defense to the claims it would have had against the insureds prior to the assignments, and may assert such defenses against EcoDry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Waters &amp; Rogers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1216777\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/14/414/#p417\">\n    14 Ariz.
