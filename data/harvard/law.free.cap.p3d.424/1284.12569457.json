A law enforcement officer responded to the call and found Appellant in a van in the parking lot. When Appellant rolled down the window, the officer smelled a strong odor of marijuana. During a search of the vehicle, the officer discovered marijuana, various drug paraphernalia, and a plastic baggie containing suspected methamphetamine. The officer arrested Appellant and subsequent testing of the substance found in the plastic baggie revealed it to be methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] The State charged Appellant with felony possession of marijuana, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-7-1031\">\n    Wyo.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 35-7-1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(i)(C) (LexisNexis 2015). Appellant did not appear for his preliminary hearing and the circuit court issued a bench warrant for his arrest. Appellant was returned to the custody of the State after being apprehended in Colorado, and the court appointed him new representation\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by the public defender. Appellant was arraigned on August 5, and the district court set trial for January 25, 2016. The following day, Appellant filed a demand for a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] Appellant's court-appointed attorney requested a status hearing due to Appellant's complaints about his representation. At the hearing, Appellant fired his court-appointed counsel, claiming a lack of communication between them. The district court assigned new counsel to represent Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] Based on information obtained from Appellant's phone, the State charged Appellant in a separate docket with conspiracy to deliver marijuana, and that action was joined with the three existing charges. In January 2016, Appellant's third trial counsel filed a motion to continue the trial, asserting that he did not have enough time to review discovery provided by the State prior to the scheduled trial date and that he would not be able to provide effective assistance of counsel absent a continuance. The court granted the request for a continuance and reset the trial for March 21, 2016. Appellant proceeded to file hundreds of pages of\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   notes relating to his life in jail and his communications with his family and his attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] In January 2016, the State charged Appellant in a separate docket with two counts of interference with a peace officer stemming from an incident in which the State alleged he assaulted two detention officers in the Sheridan County Detention Center. At his arraignment, Appellant explained that he suffered from severe anxiety, depression, and sleeplessness. Due to his inability to listen to the district court or communicate adequately with his counsel, the district court ordered Appellant to undergo a competency evaluation. The court vacated Appellant's trial pending the results of the evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b68] The Wyoming State Hospital submitted a report of its evaluation on July 19, 2016, finding Appellant competent to proceed in the case. Immediately prior to the scheduled competency hearing, however, Appellant's counsel moved to withdraw due to a breakdown in communications with Appellant. The district court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b69] On August 22, 2016, Appellant's fourth trial counsel entered her appearance in the case. Shortly thereafter, Appellant's new counsel filed a motion to suppress evidence, a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial, and a motion to dismiss based on alleged violations of Appellant's right to freedom of religion. Immediately prior to the hearing on those motions, however, Appellant and the State entered into a plea agreement. In exchange for Appellant's pleas of no contest to the charges of felony possession of marijuana and possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, the State agreed to dismiss the remaining charges and recommend a sentence of three to eight years for the possession\n   charge and a concurrent sentence of three to five years for the charge of intent to deliver marijuana. The district court accepted Appellant's pleas, dismissed the remaining charges, and sentenced him in accordance with the State's recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b610] In December 2016, Appellant filed a notice of appeal from the judgment and sentence. Eight months later, Appellant filed a \" W.R.A.P., Rule 21 Motion [to] Withdraw Pleas Based on Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\" in the district court, and the court set the matter for hearing. Appellant claimed his counsel had incorrectly advised him he could pursue claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and violation of his right to a speedy trial in an appeal if he entered a no contest plea, and that this fact rendered his pleas involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b611] At the Rule 21 hearing, Appellant's trial counsel testified that Appellant stated he would agree to a three to eight-year term of incarceration and a three to five-year concurrent term, if he could plead no contest, be sentenced that same day, and leave the Sheridan County Detention Center. She told Appellant she believed that he could still appeal the issues of speedy trial and ineffective assistance of counsel. We will examine her testimony about the advice she gave Appellant more closely in our discussion. Appellant did not testify at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b612] Following the hearing, the district court issued an order denying Appellant's motion. The court found Appellant did not meet his burden of showing that, but for his counsel's erroneous advice, he would have insisted on going to trial. Appellant appealed the denial of his motion, and the appeals were consolidated in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b613] When reviewing a district court's decision regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, we employ this standard of review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Review of a trial court's ruling on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim involves mixed questions of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    Osborne\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

The second, or \"prejudice,\" requirement focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. \"[W]hen a guilty plea is challenged based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant, to establish prejudice, must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, a plea of guilty would not have been entered and the defendant would have insisted on going to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Palmer v.

I came up the night before because it was snowing. And so I was able to go to the jail at 7:30, 8:00 o'clock that morning. I spent several hours with [Appellant] discussing how the motion hearing was going to go and what was going to happen. During this time, the guardian or the caretaker of his children had passed away, the grandmother. And so we were having a discussion about him wanting to find a way to be there for his daughters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The State had made an offer and I think the deadline was the motion hearing itself. The plea offer at that time, if I remember correctly, was a four to eight and a three to five concurrent. So I was talking about those circumstances with him, especially as he was expressing a desire to want to be a father, and I was explaining to him that under the facts of his case, I didn't think that he was going to be successful at trial, that it likely was going to result in lengthy incarceration, and that if he truly wanted to be available for his children, that his best option might be entering a plea. He didn't indicate that that was what he wanted to do when I was sitting in the jail with him and I was preparing to go forward with those motions. I left the jail maybe at 11:00, somewhere in there, and had been preparing to do the motion hearing that the Court had set.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   When I came to the hearing, I came 15 or 20 minutes early. ... It was at that point [Appellant] indicated to me that if the State of Wyoming would agree to a three to eight, and a three to five concurrent, if he could plead no contest, be sentenced that same day, get him out of the jail here in Sheridan County, that he wanted to enter a plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   He asked me about speedy trial.

I told him he could raise it on counsel, he could raise it on me, which he has. And so I believe[d] that that - I didn't need a conditional plea and I didn't talk to him about that. I believed that he could raise those issues, as it related specifically to the speedy trial, because that's the major complaint of his counsel. So those to me went hand in hand with one another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Appellant's counsel stated that she did not know if the ability to pursue the ineffectiveness or speedy trial claims made Appellant willing to plead.

The Court also indicated that, to a certain extent, courts should evaluate the likelihood of an acquittal if the defendant proceeded to trial. The appropriate inquiry focuses on the defendant's \"decision making,\" which it noted \"may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605079\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1958/#p1963\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605079\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1958/#p1963\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A defendant without any viable defense will be highly likely to lose at trial. And a defendant facing such long odds will rarely be able to show prejudice from accepting a guilty plea that offers him a better resolution than would be likely after trial. But that is not because the prejudice inquiry in this context looks to the probability of a conviction for its own sake. It is instead because defendants obviously weigh their prospects at trial in deciding whether to accept a plea. See\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197970\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/52/#p58\">\n    474 U.S., at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197970\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/52/#p58\">\n    106 S.Ct. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Where a defendant has no plausible chance of an acquittal at trial, it is highly likely that he will accept a plea if the Government offers one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   But common sense (not to mention our precedent) recognizes that there is more to consider than simply the likelihood of success at trial. The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea. See\n   <em>\n    INS v. St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p322\">\n    533 U.S. 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322-323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p322\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p322\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). When those consequences are, from the defendant's perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive. For example, a defendant with no realistic defense to a charge carrying a 20-year sentence may nevertheless choose trial, if the prosecution's plea offer is 18 years. Here Lee alleges that avoiding deportation was\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   determinative factor for him; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time.
