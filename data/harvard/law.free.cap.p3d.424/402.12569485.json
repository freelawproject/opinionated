We hold that, based on the limited record before us, the expert testimony proffered does not constitute permissible observation evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Early one morning in November 2013, two sisters, ages twelve and thirteen, escaped out the window of their bedroom and fled to their neighbors' house, shouting that their stepfather had broken down their bedroom door and threatened them with a knife. The neighbors, who did not know the two girls lived in the neighborhood, let them in and called 911. The neighbors described the girls as disheveled, with matted hair and body odor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Police went to the girls' house, where they found the parents, Sophia and Fernando Richter. Inside the house, police found Sophia's seventeen-year-old daughter locked inside a separate bedroom. They confirmed that the younger sisters' bedroom door was kicked in and the doorknob damaged. During their search, they found video cameras and covered air-conditioning vents in the girls' rooms, an internal alarm system, a knife near the master bedroom, and a five-gallon bucket containing pasta mixed with meat and food scraps in the refrigerator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The three girls described horrible living conditions. They were always confined to their rooms and were monitored by video camera. They had to ask permission to use the bathroom and occasionally were not let out in time. They ate their meals, which mostly consisted of the pasta mix, in their rooms. They had piles of soiled clothing and bedding in their closets. They rarely brushed their teeth or bathed, and they described being spanked and hit with various objects. Recorded music was continually played in their rooms to mask any noise they made. After being removed from school years earlier, they never returned. The younger sisters had not seen their older sister in over a year despite living in the same house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 A grand jury indicted Sophia and Fernando on separate counts of kidnapping and child abuse for each of the three girls (six counts total) alleged to have occurred between September 1, 2013, and November 26, 2013, the dates they lived in Pima County. Fernando was also charged with two counts of aggravated assault for his attacks on the younger sisters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Before trial, Sophia gave notice that she intended to raise a duress defense. She and Fernando filed separate motions to sever their trials. The State opposed the motions and characterized Sophia's proposed duress defense and supporting expert testimony from psychologist Dr. Perrin as \"diminished capacity\" evidence that is prohibited by\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/\">\n    187 Ariz. at 540-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/\">\n    931 P.2d at 1050-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the State argued that Sophia's proposed evidence failed to demonstrate a threat of immediate physical force as required by A.R.S. \u00a7 13-412(A). Agreeing with the State, the trial court ruled that Dr. Perrin's proposed testimony \"was essentially that Sophia was a battered woman\" and was prohibited by\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   . The court also found that Sophia failed to offer evidence in support of a duress defense and denied the request to sever her trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 During trial, the State moved in limine to preclude Sophia from presenting evidence that Fernando physically or emotionally abused her. The State repeated its arguments that Sophia could not establish immediacy of threat as required by \u00a7 13-412(A) and that \"battered woman\" evidence was impermissible under\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   . The court granted the State's motion and again precluded the duress defense, finding no immediacy of threat when the dates for the alleged offenses spanned eighty-six days from September through November 2013. Sophia objected to the court's ruling and, near the close of trial, again sought to testify about Fernando's abuse, making an offer of proof through counsel's avowal of proposed testimony and photographs showing numerous scars from knife wounds inflicted by Fernando. The trial court found her proffer insufficient and again precluded her from testifying about Fernando's abuse and introducing the photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Fernando and Sophia were ultimately convicted as charged. Fernando's convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal in\n   <em>\n    State v.Richter\n   </em>\n   , 2 CA-CR 2016-0112,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20491137\">\n    2017 WL 491137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 \u00b6 3 (Ariz. App. Jan. 24, 2017) (mem. decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Sophia appealed, arguing that the trial court erred by restricting her trial testimony, precluding her duress defense, and preventing her expert from testifying. The court of appeals agreed, determining that the proposed testimony of Sophia and her expert was \"admissible to show that she committed the charged offenses under duress.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Richter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20131\">\n    243 Ariz. 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137 \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20P.3d%201016\">\n    402 P.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (App. 2017). Furthermore, the court concluded that \"to the extent that Perrin's proposed testimony addressed mens rea, ... it would be properly characterized as 'observation evidence,' which is not precluded by\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.

This Court barred the expert testimony, holding that \"Arizona does not allow evidence of a defendant's mental disorder short of insanity either as an affirmative defense or to negate the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/\">\n    at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/\">\n    931 P.2d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the legislature has not provided an affirmative defense of diminished capacity, courts in our state are barred from considering diminished capacity evidence as an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea element of a crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-502(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, she sought to argue that her intentional illegal conduct was justified because she was compelled to abuse her children by the threat or use of immediate physical force against her or her children. The Arizona Legislature has codified duress as a justification defense in \u00a7 13-412(A) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justified if a reasonable person would believe that he was compelled to engage in the proscribed conduct by the threat or use of immediate physical force against his person or the person of another which resulted or could result in serious physical injury which a reasonable person in the situation would not have resisted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The legislature has clarified the nature of justification defenses: \"Justification defenses under chapter 4 of [title 13] are not affirmative defenses. Justification defenses describe conduct that, if not justified, would constitute\n   an offense but, if justified, does not constitute criminal or wrongful conduct.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-205(A). Once a defendant produces evidence supporting a justification defense, the state has the burden to \"prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act with justification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329566\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/516/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (We note that the trial court here erroneously held Sophia to a higher standard inconsistent with \u00a7 13-205 when it concluded that she \"carrie[d] the burden of proving that she acted under duress by a preponderance of evidence.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 Because Sophia sought to assert a justification defense, the evidence of duress she would have introduced in support of that defense did not constitute \"diminished capacity\" evidence and was not prohibited by\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   .

Here, Sophia supported her claim that she and her children were under the threat of immediate physical harm with proffered evidence of specific injuries and abuse. In so doing, she provided the slightest evidence of duress, and her proffer was therefore sufficient to support a duress defense.

Just as the jury in\n   <em>\n    Esquibel\n   </em>\n   should have considered the prolonged history of beatings and threats the defendant suffered, so too the jury here should have been permitted to consider the specific instances and pattern of abuse that Fernando inflicted on Sophia.

These limitations on the duress defense exist because, unlike other justification defenses, it excuses crimes against innocent victims.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7 13-404(A) (explaining that a person is justified in using or threatening force in defense of\n   <em>\n    himself\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 41 The rationale for the duress defense is that \"even though [the defendant] has done the act the crime requires and has the mental state which the crime requires, his conduct which violates the literal language of the criminal law is justified because he has thereby avoided a harm of greater magnitude.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    Substantive Criminal Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.3, at 614 (2d ed. 1986) ). For this reason, the use of the duress defense to justify infliction of physical harm against an innocent person is circumscribed. For example, the duress defense is unavailable\n   for offenses involving \"homicide or serious physical injury.\" \u00a7 13-412(C). The paramount interest in protecting innocent third parties even precludes self-defense in certain circumstances involving harm to innocent victims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7 13-401(A) (barring applicability of self-defense theory in prosecution for reckless injury of an innocent third party). Consequently, even if a person's life is immediately threatened, he is not entitled to kill or seriously physically injure another innocent person as an act of self-preservation. If a person's only recourse for self-preservation is to inflict such harm, his options are to retreat, to seek assistance from law enforcement, to engage in self-defense, or to do nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 42 Here, \u00a7 13-412(C) does not preclude Sophia's duress defense because she was not charged with inflicting serious physical injury on her children, but her conduct skews precariously close to the line. After Sophia's arrest, medical professionals determined that her children suffered from severe neglect, had scars consistent with strikes from \"belts or wires,\" \"lacked muscle development,\" suffered \"skin irritation caused by poor hygiene\" and dental problems, and one child suffered from a speech impediment resulting from forced isolation. All the children suffered psychological trauma. This case, where the defendant's conduct harmed innocent victims directly or through acquiescence, perfectly illustrates the reason for narrow application of the duress defense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Arizona did not adopt the Model Penal Code's (\"MPC\") duress language wholesale, but instead included the requirement of a \"threat or use of\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   physical force.\" \u00a7 13-412(A) (emphasis added). By adding this immediacy requirement in \u00a7 13-412(A), an intentional deviation from the MPC on which the statute was otherwise based, the legislature intended to narrow its application. The Court must give meaning to every word in the statute, including \"immediate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   174 (2012) (discussing the \"surplusage canon,\" which provides that \"[i]f possible, every word and every provision is to be given effect ... None should be ignored. None should needlessly be given an interpretation that causes it to duplicate another provision or to have no consequence\"). But under the majority's view, in which immediacy is stretched beyond its plain meaning without clear parameters, it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which a proffered duress defense would qualify under the MPC but not under Arizona's more restrictive statute, effectively rendering superfluous our statute's immediacy requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 44 The majority acknowledges that we have previously characterized an immediate threat warranting a duress instruction as \"present, imminent and impending.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b616 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

But Sophia failed in her skeletal offer of proof or otherwise to present any evidence of specific threats during the relevant period, and her subjective, generalized fear of Fernando, without specific facts indicating immediacy, does not justify a duress defense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Sophia presented only two incidents in which Fernando physically assaulted her. First, she proffered evidence that on the night of her arrest, Fernando burned and scratched her chest and arm, although she initially told police that her injuries were self-inflicted. Second, Sophia alleged that during a family vacation some time before the charged child abuse, Fernando threw her out of a hotel room by her hair when she attempted to protect her children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 48 Sophia's limited proffered evidence of abuse fails to establish immediacy for two reasons. First, she offered no evidence that either incident resulted from her refusal to follow Fernando's command that she abuse her children. Second, although deplorable, neither incident constitutes a continuous threat of immediate harm sufficient to justify Sophia's three-month systematic abuse of her children; the first incident occurred before the charged offenses, and the incident on the night of her arrest occurred after the child abuse for which she was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 49 Even if we were to consider the hotel incident (which allegedly occurred before the relevant period of the charged offenses resulting in Sophia's convictions) as evidence of Fernando's pattern of abuse, evidence also showed that Sophia had opportunities to summon assistance or to escape with her children from Fernando during that same period. For example, Sophia went grocery shopping alone with a neighbor before her family moved to Tucson and, during the move, she drove her car with her daughters while Fernando separately drove a moving truck. Thus, the attenuated hotel incident, undermined by countervailing evidence of reasonable alternatives to abusing her children, does not satisfy the immediacy requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 50 The majority, recognizing Sophia's failure to satisfy the statute's strict immediacy requirement, relies upon distinguishable New Mexico and federal cases to stretch our previous description of immediate threats to include perceived generalized ongoing threats.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b617-20.

For example, Sophia had contact with her mother and, as she concedes, occasionally went to the grocery store with her mother-in-law. Despite Fernando's alleged omnipresence, those situations afforded Sophia an opportunity to summon help or contact the police. Although Sophia claimed that she believed Fernando's mother acted as his agent in the abuse, his mother was not charged with abusing Sophia's children and testified that she was unaware of the abuse. In short, the record shows that Sophia had a reasonable, legal alternative to harming her children during the three-month period of abuse.

This argument is unconvincing.

Second, as discussed, the out-of-state cases the majority cites to expand this Court's existing definition of immediacy rely, in part, on the absence of a reasonable alternative to committing the crime.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b617-20. Third, this Court in\n   <em>\n    Kinslow\n   </em>\n   affirmed a trial court's denial of a duress defense based upon our conclusion that the defendant's belief \"that he had no reasonable alternative to escape the threatened harm without committing his subsequent crimes\" was \"implausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Kinslow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542717\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/503/#p505\">\n    165 Ariz. at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1542717\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/165/503/#p505\">\n    799 P.2d at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority's approach represents a further departure from\n   <em>\n    Kinslow\n   </em>\n   as it would entitle a defendant to raise a duress defense, as justification for harming an innocent victim, even when the evidence shows that the defendant had a reasonable alternative to inflicting such harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 57 The majority also posits that denying Sophia's requested duress instruction shifts \"to Sophia the burden of proving her defense before trial, in direct contradiction of [A.R.S.] \u00a7 13-205.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b625. But the majority's view conflates two issues: a defendant's entitlement to raise a duress defense, which is resolved by the trial court based on the specific evidence proffered to support the defense, and the allocation of the burden of proof at trial once the defense is raised with sufficient supporting evidence. Contrary to the majority's position, as\n   <em>\n    Kinslow\n   </em>\n   and every case denying a defendant's requested duress instruction illustrates, a defendant first must proffer sufficient evidence to warrant a justification instruction. Only after clearing this initial hurdle does \u00a7 13-205 's burden allocation become relevant. For this reason, the statute does not diminish\n   <em>\n    Kinslow's\n   </em>\n   relevance and application here. That the state bears the burden of disproving justification after a defendant properly raises the defense sheds no light on the core issue in this case-whether Sophia presented the slightest evidence to support a duress defense and related jury instruction. The majority's invocation of \u00a7 13-205 to circumvent the limitations imposed by \u00a7 13-412(A) on the duress defense is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 58 Given Sophia's generalized, inadequate offer of proof, the trial court correctly precluded her from presenting a duress defense and introducing evidence thereon because she failed to satisfy the statute's immediacy requirement and had a reasonable legal alternative to committing the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 59 Having held that Sophia was entitled to raise a duress defense because she satisfied the immediacy requirement, the majority next addresses the scope of the evidence of abuse suffered by Sophia admissible to support the defense.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b628-29. The majority reasons that \"[k]nowledge of the circumstances under which the defendant committed the alleged crimes is essential to the jury's determination of whether the defendant's actions were reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b629. This is precisely what the statute requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-412(A) (determining the actions of \"a reasonable person in the situation\"). But, as the majority notes, the duress defense uses an objective standard that applies the beliefs of \"a 'reasonable person' in the defendant's circumstances rather than the defendant's subjective beliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b628 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

As such, the majority properly clarifies that \"the introduction of evidence of past incidents of abuse should not transform the duress defense into a subjective inquiry of whether a specific defendant was unusually susceptible to succumbing to otherwise implausible threats.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b630.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 60 The majority rejects the State's argument that A.R.S. \u00a7 13-415, which provides for the admission of past acts of domestic abuse and modifies the reasonableness standard for certain justification defenses such as self-defense, use of deadly physical force, or defense of a third person, evinces legislative\n   intent, by omission, to preclude such evidence from the duress defense.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b631. The statute provides that the state of mind of a reasonable person invoking those other justification defenses \"shall be determined from the perspective of a reasonable person who has been a victim of ... past acts of domestic violence.\" \u00a7 13-415. The majority dismisses the statute as a limited statutory codification of Arizona \"case law holding that prior acts of violence by the deceased are generally admissible as evidence of a defendant's state of mind.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b631 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

But\n   <em>\n    Vogel\n   </em>\n   did not address whether prior acts of domestic violence are admissible in duress cases, and the legislature's failure to include the duress defense in \u00a7 13-415 or to provide in \u00a7 13-412 (or otherwise) language similar to \u00a7 13-415 should not be so casually dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11512866\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/999/649/#p659\">\n    999 P.2d at 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a statute permitting evidence of battered woman syndrome does not apply to a defense of coercion and duress where its plain language \"expressly limits its reach to the affirmative defense of self-defense\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 61 Because \u00a7 13-415 serves as the statutory vehicle to introduce evidence of domestic abuse for self-defense cases and modifies the reasonableness standard, we can infer that the absence of a statutory counterpart demonstrates a lack of legislative intent to admit such evidence in duress cases. To extend \u00a7 13-415 's modified reasonableness standard to the duress defense not only rewrites that statute, but also overrides \u00a7 13-412(A) 's express objective reasonableness standard. If the legislature intended to modify the reasonableness standard for defendants in duress cases, it could have done so.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Champlin v.

But \u00a7 13-415 does more than place a juror in the defendant's situation; it places a juror in the defendant's mind by commanding the juror to assess a defendant's reasonableness from the perspective of a domestic violence victim. In other words, \u00a7 13-415 designates a defendant as a domestic violence victim and instructs the jury to assess the case from that perspective. This is a significant departure from \u00a7 13-412(A) 's objective reasonableness standard. The more permissive standard under \u00a7 13-415 is understandable because it involves justification for violence against an alleged aggressor, whereas \u00a7 13-412(A) excuses crimes against an innocent person. The duress defense's limiting reasonableness standard was the legislature's choice and we are duty-bound to respect it.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
