The car's driver, Garcia's cousin Keith, was the intended target. Keith's step-daughter Kanesha was also aboard when Garcia took aim.

The district court decided-and the State conceded-that sufficient evidence of imperfect self-defense existed to present the defense to a jury. The jury was also instructed on the lesser-included offense of attempted manslaughter. But the jury instruction explaining how imperfect self-defense interacted with attempted manslaughter misstated the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury convicted Garcia on the attempted murder and possession of a firearm by a restricted person charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Garcia argued to the Utah Court of Appeals that his counsel provided ineffective assistance when he failed to object to the attempted manslaughter jury instruction. Garcia also argued that the district court erred by not granting a directed verdict on the possession of a firearm charge because there was insufficient evidence to convict him. Garcia claimed that to the extent his insufficiency claim was unpreserved, his counsel provided ineffective assistance with respect to that claim. The court of appeals found that the defective jury instruction prejudiced Garcia's trial and vacated his attempted murder conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Garcia cross-petitions and argues that the court of appeals erred when it found that his counsel had not preserved his argument concerning the constitutionality of the unlawful user in possession statute. Garcia also claims that the court of appeals erred when it found that his counsel had not provided ineffective assistance when he neglected to argue that the term \"unlawful user\" was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 We reverse the court of appeals with respect to the jury instruction argument, but we uphold the denial of Garcia's motion for directed verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Yesha Anthony Garcia sold drugs professionally. Garcia believed his cousin Keith had stolen a portion of his cocaine stash that\n   Garcia kept at his cousin Tish's apartment. This enraged Garcia. He beat up both Keith's wife and step-daughter, Kanesha. Garcia then called Keith's mom on the phone, telling her he was going to kill Keith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 That same evening, Garcia sent his live-in girlfriend to her family's home, and-loaded gun in hand-waited for Keith to appear. Eventually, Garcia saw Keith and Kanesha-who claim they were looking for Garcia's address to give to the police-drive past his house, turn around, and drive past again. Garcia ran out his front door and unloaded his revolver in the car's direction. Garcia failed to hit the car. Kanesha called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 A little while later, a police officer found Garcia walking in his neighborhood. At trial, the officer who made first contact with Garcia on the street testified about their encounter. The officer testified that he called over to Garcia, who walked toward the officer and-unprompted-put his hands on the hood of the police car. Garcia told the officer that his name was Chancey Garcia. When asked to spell Chancey, Garcia couldn't. When the officer asked him \"how that was possible that a grown man didn't know how to spell his name,\" Garcia became defensive. The officer told Garcia that he was looking for someone who had committed a crime and that, if it wasn't him, he could be on his way. According to the officer, at that point, Garcia began looking from side to side in a way that, in the officer's opinion, seemed like Garcia was \"looking for an escape route.\" After that, the officer ordered Garcia to sit down on the ground. Garcia complied. Another officer approached with \"the complainant,\" who identified Garcia as the shooter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 After Garcia was identified, he was cuffed and placed in a police car. A detective who interviewed Garcia testified that Garcia told him where the gun Garcia had fired could be found. The detective also reported that Garcia insisted he \"hadn't done anything wrong. He was just protecting himself and his family, that sort of thing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Garcia spoke with a sergeant at the police station later that morning. In the interview, Garcia explained his frame of mind when Keith and Kanesha drove past his house:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A: I don't know what the f*** [Keith]'s gonna do. I thought he was gonna throw a cocktail in my house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q: A Molotov cocktail?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A: Yeah. That's why I was there. If it wasn't for that I would've been in Wendover or something. I would try and let this shit die down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: Tish had said, yeah, he [Keith] came and got his gun, he's gonna light you up? Or what'd she say?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A: Nah, I wasn't ... thinking about him like hurting me, burning me like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q: But if Tish told you he had his gun ... you knew that he was coming for you, possibly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A: Not really. Not in that kind of way because he's scary you know, I mean, I know his character.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q: So you didn't think he was gonna come? You just thought maybe?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A: Yeah, I was like mainly worried about my property really.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 11 Garcia also spoke about his motive for firing at Keith:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [Keith] just pulled up in the Explorer, just like looking, like-mad dogging and shit. And I looked, and I was like no he didn't, no he didn't. And I just grabbed my shit like\n   <em>\n    boom boom boom boom\n   </em>\n   , and I emptied out the whole clip.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I'm just glad I didn't hurt nobody, though. It was just like when I saw him I just like, because I wanted to kill him bad, I want him dead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I just lost it, man. Because I'm already done. Like, I was so antsy yesterday. I wanted to just kill him. I wanted to go just kill him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 12 At the station, Garcia also spoke about his drug dealing and his drug use:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   When I'm off cocaine, too, I get like real paranoid. I always think the cops gonna run in my shit. So, uh, yeah cuz I do a lot of cocaine like sometimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q: [I]t's odd that you use, because lots of people who really got skills don't use at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A: Yeah, no, it's just my heart and soul is into this shit man, you know what I mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A: I started using in 2006. I was twenty-five about to turn twenty-six.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 13 At trial, Garcia told a somewhat different story. He testified that he believed Keith had stolen drugs from him and that he had merely taken \"precautions to protect [his] home from an attack from Keith.\" He also testified that he expected Keith to come over to his house \"with a gun\"-but never mentioned a Molotov cocktail. He said he sent his girlfriend away because he \"didn't feel safe.\" When his counsel asked why he didn't feel safe, he stated, \"I just know my cousin.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q: What does that mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A: He just blows stuff out of proportion. Just like one minute he is cool with us, and then he just snaps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q: Okay. Does Keith have a history of violence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q: Okay. And you believed him to possess a firearm?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q: Okay. And ... what was your understanding of what he was going to do with that gun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A: He was coming for me. Like he was coming to look for me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q: Okay. And so you felt there was a danger?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q: And you told [the detectives] Keith was coming for [you], and you did what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A: I defended myself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 14 After Garcia was questioned by his counsel, the prosecutor cross-examined him.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q: [Y]ou just testified that you were afraid Keith was coming at you with a gun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q: And you just testified that Keith-you had been told Keith was going to come get you with a gun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q: All right. Now, you, um, talked to this detective, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q: You watched the videotape of that interview?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q: [T]he detective asked you, um, says, Hey, you thought that Keith was coming for you with a gun? And you said, Not in that way. I know his character. Um, I was more worried about my property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 15 The sergeant later testified that in his interview with Garcia, Garcia never mentioned that he was afraid Keith was coming at him with a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 16 After the close of evidence, Garcia argued that there was an evidentiary basis to instruct the jury on attempted manslaughter \"if you look at his actions as reckless.\" The State countered that there was no evidence that Garcia shot at Keith recklessly. But it suggested that \"there is some evidence upon which ... [Garcia] could argue that it was imperfect self-defense,\" because Garcia could have believed, even though \"[Keith] wasn't armed, ... [that] he thought [Keith] was coming at him with a gun.\" The State explained that even though it thought the theory was \"wrong,\" there was enough evidence that \"the instruction should come in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 17 In response to the State's comments, Garcia offered to modify the attempted manslaughter jury instruction to reflect imperfect self-defense. The district court agreed to let Garcia put the imperfect self-defense attempted manslaughter instruction before the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 18 Garcia also moved the district court to direct a verdict on the State's charge of\n   possession of a firearm by a restricted person-in Garcia's case, an \"unlawful user.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-10-503(1)(b)(iii). Garcia took issue with the phrase \"unlawful user,\" asking the court to narrowly define the phrase because the statute offered no definition. He argued that the phrase must describe \"a current user, not someone who's used drugs in the past, but they are actually currently using drugs.\" Garcia also argued that under this narrow definition, there was insufficient evidence to convict and that a directed verdict was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 19 The State responded that there was sufficient evidence to defeat Garcia's directed verdict motion because Garcia \"describes himself as a drug dealer and a drug user.\" Garcia reasoned that the evidence of being a drug dealer was insufficient because the statute employs the term \"user\" not \"dealer\" and because a \"user\" is defined as someone who currently has drugs \"in your system.\" Under that definition, Garcia maintained, there was insufficient evidence to prove that he was a user of drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 20 The court denied the directed verdict motion and allowed the question of whether Garcia was an unlawful user in possession of a firearm to go to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   I don't see anything in the statute that would require proof that he had some measurable amount of substance in his system .... It's at least a jury question as to whether he is a user or not a user, and the jury will just have to apply their own definition of the word \"user.\" If they have a question about it, we will use a dictionary and we will let them go from there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 21 When the jury began deliberations, it had before it five charges to consider: two charges of attempted murder-one charge each for Keith and Kanesha; possession of a firearm as an unlawful user of a controlled substance; and two counts of discharge of a firearm. The jury was instructed as to the elements of each alleged crime. Relevant to this case, the jury was also instructed on the lesser-included offense of attempted manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 22 The attempted murder jury instruction explained that, in order to convict Garcia of attempted murder as charged in count I, \"which is alleged to have occurred on or about the 30th day of June, 2010, in Salt Lake County, State of Utah,\" the jury \"must find from all of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   1. That the defendant, Yesha Anthony Garcia,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   2. Intentionally,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   3. Attempted to cause the death of Keith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   A similar instruction replaced Keith with Kanesha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 23 The attempted manslaughter instruction explained that, in order to convict Garcia of attempted manslaughter, the jury \"must find beyond a reasonable doubt\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   1. That on or about June 30, 2010;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   2. In Salt Lake County, State of Utah;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   3. The Defendant, Yesha Anthony Garcia;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   4. Attempted to cause the death of Keith ... ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   5. The affirmative defense of imperfect self-defense does not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   A similar instruction replaced the name of Keith with Kanesha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 24 Another jury instruction explained that in order to convict Garcia of possession of a firearm by a restricted person, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Garcia had \"possessed, used, or had under his custody or control a firearm; and ... [w]as at the time a category II restricted person.\" Subsequent jury instructions defined a category II restricted person as \"a person who ... [i]s an unlawful user of a controlled substance\" and defined cocaine as a controlled substance. Garcia never asked for a jury instruction containing the narrower reading of the statutory language that he advocated for when seeking a directed verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 25 The jury found Garcia guilty of one count of attempted murder, one count of\n   possession of a firearm by a restricted person, and two counts of felony discharge of a firearm. The jury acquitted him of the second count of attempted murder as to Kanesha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 26 Garcia appealed his convictions to the Utah Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Even when we are trying to save a statute from constitutional concerns, we are not at liberty to rewrite the statute or to inject the statute with our policy judgments. Our job is to interpret the statute as the legislature wrote it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 60 As with the federal statute, the Utah Code \"does not forbid possession of a firearm\n   <em>\n    while unlawfully using\n   </em>\n   a controlled substance. Rather, the statute prohibits\n   <em>\n    unlawful users\n   </em>\n   of controlled substances ... from possessing firearms.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The reading Garcia prefers would require us to rewrite the statute to include a concept of contemporaneous use that the plain text does not require and is not necessary to preserve the statute's constitutionality-as explained below. And while not dispositive, we cannot find any other jurisdiction that has accepted a reading like the one Garcia advocates. In fact, many jurisdictions have rejected that interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Clanton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20826\">\n    515 Fed.Appx. 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (11th Cir. 2013) (rejecting contention that an \"unlawful user\" requires proof that defendant was under influence at time of possession);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that in order to give a defendant fair notice of what would make him an \"unlawful user\" of a controlled substance, the State must forward evidence to show \"some regularity of drug use in addition to contemporaneousness\" to the possession of a firearm.\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618182\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/431/832/#p838\">\n    431 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   838-39 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This reading solves the problem that Garcia highlights in his brief, that the phrase \"unlawful user\" might criminalize possession of a firearm by someone who used a controlled substance decades ago. And, more to the point, it solves the vagueness problem that the statute does not provide adequate notice to someone that they could be breaking the law if they used drugs in 1967 and carry a firearm in 2017. But it preserves the legislative intent that those who could reasonably be considered to be \"unlawful users\"-those who use with regularity and in a time period reasonably contemporaneous with the possession of a firearm-be subject to criminal sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6 62 Because Garcia's counsel did not ask for a jury instruction reflecting the narrowed interpretation-and Garcia does not claim ineffective assistance based upon that-we review to see whether the district court properly denied the directed verdict motion. \"A trial court is justified in granting\n   a directed verdict only if, examining all evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no competent evidence that would support a verdict in the non-moving party's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Merino v.

Garcia moved for a directed verdict arguing that if the court would properly interpret the statute, the State had introduced insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction. We hold that any error the district court committed in failing to interpret the statute in a manner that avoided constitutional concerns was harmless because evidence existed to permit the jury to convict Garcia under a proper interpretation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   \u00b6 63 Garcia admitted that he had used cocaine since 2006 when he \"was twenty-five about to turn twenty-six.\" He also told the police,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   When I'm off cocaine, too, I get like real paranoid. I just think the cops gonna run in my shit. So, uh, yeah cuz I do a lot of cocaine like sometimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Q: [I]t's odd that you use, because lots of people who really got skills don't use at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   A: Yeah, no, it's just my heart and soul is into this shit man, you know what I mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6 64 Garcia's statements demonstrate that there was an evidentiary basis for the jury to conclude that Garcia was a user of cocaine. He stated, \"I do a lot of cocaine like sometimes.\" And his statement \"when I'm off cocaine, too, I get real paranoid\" gives rise to a reasonable inference that there are times when he is\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   cocaine. In response to a police sergeant's incredulity that he would both use and deal, Garcia did not assert that he had stopped using; rather he responded that his \"heart and soul is into this shit.\" When Garcia talked about his drug use, he did so in the present tense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6 65 Garcia responds that this evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that his cocaine use shared any temporal nexus with his firearm possession. Garcia raises a logical, albeit ultimately unavailing, point. Perhaps the easiest way for the State to meet its burden would have been to introduce evidence of the last time Garcia had ingested cocaine prior to the date he possessed the firearm that gave rise to the charge. But the fact that the evidence did not identify the date of Garcia's last cocaine use does not dictate the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence of Garcia's on-going drug use to survive a motion for a directed verdict. The evidence was sufficient to permit a jury to reasonably conclude that Garcia's confessed drug use-he does a lot of cocaine sometimes, gets paranoid when he goes off, has his heart and soul into drugs-meant that he was a user of controlled substances on the night he fired his weapon, even if the jury could not conclude that he was using drugs on the day of the charged conduct. Other courts have reached a similar conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We therefore find that any error the district court committed in failing to narrow the meaning of \"unlawful user\" in connection with the motion for a directed verdict was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b6 66 The court of appeals erred when it failed to perform fully the prejudice analysis\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). But Garcia was not prejudiced by his\n   counsel's complicity in the jury receiving a flawed instruction. The evidence that Garcia committed attempted murder is sufficiently strong that our confidence in the jury's verdict is not undermined. Therefore, we reverse the court of appeals' conclusion that Garcia was prejudiced by his counsel's performance. We reaffirm that a party may invoke previously unargued canons of statutory interpretation on appeal if the issue of the statute's proper interpretation was preserved. Although the district court should have interpreted the \"unlawful user\" statute differently to avoid constitutional vagueness problems, that error was harmless. The State introduced sufficient evidence to permit a jury to convict Garcia even under a narrowed interpretation of that statute. We affirm Garcia's conviction for possession of a firearm by a restricted person. In short, we reverse in part and affirm in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    The pleadings spell Mr. Garcia's first name as Yesha, but it appears that the correct spelling is Yshiah.

The canon of constitutional avoidance \"comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction; and the canon functions as\n    <em>\n     a means\n    </em>\n    of\n    <em>\n     choosing between them\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Clark v.
