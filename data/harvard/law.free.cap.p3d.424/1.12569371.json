Each panel dismissed its case for lack of jurisdiction, and we consolidated the cases for appeal. We hold that an order of complete restitution is a final order for purposes of appeal and therefore reverse the decisions of the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 The first case involves a restitution order for Ryan Mooers. On April 15, 2013, Mr. Mooers entered a plea in abeyance to third-degree felony theft, a condition of which was the payment of restitution. Thereafter,\n   the State requested that Mr. Mooers pay $5,760.50 in restitution, of which $4,660.50 represented the cost of the items stolen, window repair, and carpet replacement. The victims of the theft stated that their daughter had trouble feeling safe in her room, which had been broken into, so the restitution amount included $1,100 for bars to place over her basement window. Mr. Mooers objected to the inclusion of the cost of the window bars, but the district court found that the cost was part of the pecuniary damages stemming from the theft and, in a ruling dated February 12, 2014, ordered the $1,100 to be included in the restitution order. Thirteen days later, Mr. Mooers filed a notice of appeal. After briefing and argument, the court of appeals held that because the restitution order was part of a plea in abeyance, it was not a final order and the court therefore had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Mooers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6832265\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/362/282/\">\n    2015 UT App 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 1, 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6832265\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/362/282/\">\n    362 P.3d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 The second case involves Darron Laven Becker's plea in abeyance for attempted aggravated assault after he attempted to hit his neighbor with a shovel. Following the entry of Mr. Becker's plea, the State requested $663.01 in restitution for medical costs that the Utah Office for Victims of Crime paid the neighbor. Mr. Becker objected to the basis for the amount, noting that the only documentation for the amount was a handwritten note from the neighbor requesting $624 for replacement glasses, $39 for an eye exam, and $480 for lost wages. The district court determined that a sufficient nexus between Mr. Becker's actions and the neighbor's requested restitution existed and, on December 9, 2013, ordered Mr. Becker to pay $663.01. Mr. Becker appealed the district court's order on December 17, 2013. The court of appeals dismissed Mr. Becker's appeal for lack of jurisdiction upon determining that it was bound by the\n   <em>\n    Mooers\n   </em>\n   panel's decision.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In taking this view, the State argues that a district court's order of restitution is not final for a plea in abeyance because the defendant has been neither convicted nor sentenced, and it is the sentence that triggers the time for appeal. The defendants argue that because conviction and restitution have separate timeframes and purposes, an order of restitution should be considered final regardless of whether or when a conviction occurs. Both arguments disregard Utah's distinctive statutory framework for restitution, which (1) requires our district courts to assess both complete and court-ordered restitution and (2) makes orders of complete restitution, as opposed to court-ordered restitution, separately appealable from a criminal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 Restitution orders are a unique animal, existing at the convergence of the civil and criminal worlds, and understanding the\n   <em>\n    sui generis\n   </em>\n   nature of our Crime Victims Restitution Act, UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 77-38a-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , helps us in our task of statutory interpretation.

This is because orders of complete restitution, though technically entered on the civil docket, flow entirely from the criminal cases that give rise to them; they are not separate civil cases with a life outside of the criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 Court-ordered restitution, in contrast, is not separately appealable because it is a condition of the plea in abeyance, which is not a final order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is therefore not appealable unless the sentence is entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We therefore treat court-ordered restitution in the plea in abeyance context as a condition of the plea rather than part of the sentence, which may or may not ever be entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9307305\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1065/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 77-2a-3(5)(b) (listing restitution as one of the possible terms of a plea in abeyance). Like other conditions of a plea in abeyance, then, court-ordered restitution is not appealable as a final order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 20 The result of this split in the kinds of restitution is that a district court's order that uses the factors laid out in Utah Code section 77-38a-302(5)(b) is appealable as a final order. But in the plea in abeyance context, a district court's order that applies the factors in section 302(5)(c) is not a final order over which appellate jurisdiction is proper. Therefore, it is possible that a constitutional problem does not arise if a defendant is unable to appeal the court-ordered restitution component of his plea in abeyance because pleas in abeyance are not final orders or judgments and there is therefore no constitutional \"case\" to which the right to appeal guaranteed by article VIII, section 5 of the Utah Constitution might attach. But our conclusion today is based on the statutory question before us, and we need not and do not reach the question of whether a defendant may have a constitutional right to appeal an order of court-ordered restitution in a plea in abeyance context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 In today's cases, Mr. Mooers and Mr. Becker both challenged orders of complete restitution. In both cases, the district court did not specify whether it was determining complete or court-ordered restitution, instead focusing on whether the disputed cost was\n   part of the \"pecuniary damages\" resulting from the criminal activity under Utah Code section 76-3-201(4)(a), which states that \"[w]hen a person is convicted of criminal activity that has resulted in pecuniary damages, ... the court shall order that the defendant make restitution to the victims.\" But because determining pecuniary damages is part of calculating the victim's losses-as required for complete restitution-and because the district court did not apply any of the factors for court-ordered restitution, we treat each district court's order as one for complete restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 The district court's order of restitution for Mr. Mooers determined that the addition of $1,100 for window bars was proper because it was a \"pecuniary damage[ ]\" under Utah Code section 76-3-201(4)(a). Nowhere in the order does the district court address the court-ordered restitution factors, and we conclude that the court's order was for complete restitution only. Jurisdiction over Mr. Mooers's appeal was therefore proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 Similarly, the restitution order for Mr. Becker addressed only whether the neighbor's claim for pecuniary damages was properly considered for restitution, but the district court never addressed any factors for court-ordered restitution. Instead, the district court described its order as \"the full and complete order of restitution,\" which it also deemed \"part of the defendant's sentence.\" Thus, the district court's order for Mr. Becker to pay for the medical expenses was a final order from which he may appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 Because the district court's restitution orders for both Mr. Mooers and Mr. Becker were orders of complete restitution rather than court-ordered restitution, we conclude that the court of appeals had jurisdiction over the defendants' appeals. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the court of appeals to consider the merits of Mr. Mooers's and Mr. Becker's appeals.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    We cite to the version of the Restitution Act in effect at the time of Mr. Mooers's and Mr. Becker's hearings.

Because defendants can appeal orders of complete restitution as of right, they may always challenge the calculation of damages resulting from the crime. And because court-ordered restitution may never be more than complete restitution, a defendant will never be ordered to pay more than the amount that he or she is able to appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
