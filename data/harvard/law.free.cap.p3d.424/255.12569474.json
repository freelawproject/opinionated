On October 24, 2016, at 4:51 p.m., Wyoming Highway Patrol Trooper Gabriel Walz was on patrol, driving north on I-25 near Glenrock, Wyoming. He observed a silver Pontiac Grand Prix with Iowa plates (which turned out to be driven by Mr. Kite) pass a semi-truck without signaling and drift over the fog line close to the median. He followed the vehicle for a short distance and then initiated a traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] Trooper Walz approached the vehicle on the passenger side, introduced himself, and requested Mr. Kite's driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance. Mr. Kite responded, \"Nope,\" peeled out, and headed north at a high rate of speed. Trooper Walz returned to his vehicle, radioed dispatch concerning the situation, and then pursued Mr. Kite, driving at speeds of up to 140 m.p.h. to catch up to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] About a mile and a half from where Trooper Walz had stopped him, Mr. Kite crossed the median, entered the southbound lanes of I-25, and proceeded to drive north against the southbound traffic. He initially entered the southbound passing lane, but then moved into the driving lane, forcing a white passenger car and three semi-trucks to the shoulder. Mr. Kite then moved from the driving lane to the passing lane, forcing a black passenger car from the passing lane into the median. Approximately fifty-four seconds after entering the southbound lane, Mr. Kite again crossed the median and continued northbound in the northbound lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] The chase continued at high rates of speed northbound on I-25, and then onto a secondary road known as Deer Creek Road. At about milepost 2 on Deer Creek Road, Mr. Kite left the road and drove into a field. He stopped when his vehicle hit a center pivot rut and was disabled. The two passengers, Mr. Kite's wife and a hitchhiker they had picked up, stayed with the vehicle. Mr. Kite fled on foot and was eventually intercepted by two Converse County sheriff's deputies, who arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] The State charged Mr. Kite with one count of aggravated assault and battery on two alternative bases:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-502\">\n    Wyo.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-2-502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(ii) (\"[a]ttempts to cause ... bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon\"). The State also charged Mr. Kite with one count of misdemeanor driving under the influence, one count of misdemeanor possession of marijuana, one count of misdemeanor fleeing or attempting to elude police officers, and one count of misdemeanor reckless endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] Before trial, Mr. Kite moved to strike the words \"knowingly, or recklessly\" and the phrase \"under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life\" from the aggravated assault and battery charge, arguing that such mental states were not consistent with the specific intent required to support a charge of attempt to cause serious bodily injury. The district court denied the motion, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The State does not have to prove the Defendant had the specific intent to cause serious bodily injury in order to prove their case under Count I. According to the statute, the State must show the Defendant attempted to cause serious bodily injury to another either (1) intentionally, (2)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   knowingly, or (3) recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b69] The State dismissed the possession of marijuana charge before trial, and a two-day jury trial was held on the remaining four charges on May 9-10, 2017. After the State rested, Mr. Kite moved for a directed verdict on the aggravated assault and battery and DUI counts. The district court denied the motion, and all four counts were submitted to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b610] The jury found Mr. Kite guilty of aggravated assault and battery, fleeing or attempting to elude police officers, and reckless endangerment, and acquitted him on the DUI charge. With respect to the aggravated assault and battery charge, the jury completed the relevant portions of the verdict form as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     COUNT 1:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1.

On May 31, 2017, the district court denied the motion. It again ruled that specific intent to cause injury was not required by the governing statute, but it also found that even if such intent were required, the jury found that intent and the evidence supported the finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b612] On September 28, 2017, the district court sentenced Mr. Kite to a prison term of\n   six to eight years on the aggravated assault and battery charge, to be served concurrently with the misdemeanor sentences. Mr. Kite timely appealed the judgment and sentence to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b613] Mr. Kite claims the district court erred in instructing the jury and in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. Before turning to those claims, however, we must first address a discrepancy between the district court's judgment and the jury's verdict, which we found during our review. We will then address Mr. Kite's claims of error as he presented them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Remand for Correction of Judgment and Sentence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b614] The jury returned a verdict against Mr. Kite finding him guilty of aggravated assault in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-502\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 6-2-502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(i) and (a)(ii), and the district court entered a post-trial order declaring Mr. Kite guilty under both subsections. The court deviated from that verdict, however, both in its oral ruling on sentencing and in its written judgment and sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During sentencing, the court orally cited to only subsection (a)(i) as the basis for Mr. Kite's conviction, and in its written judgment and sentence, it cited to only subsection (a)(ii). Although Mr. Kite did not claim error related to these discrepancies, we conclude they must be corrected so the record is clear as to the basis for the court's judgment and sentence, as required by W.R.Cr.P. 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b615] Generally, a sentencing court's unambiguous oral pronouncements will prevail over a contrary provision in a written order.\n   <em>\n    McEwan v.

Rule 32 requires, however, that a judgment of conviction after trial contain \"[a]n adjudication as to each offense including the name and statute number for each convicted offense and whether such offense is a felony or misdemeanor.\" W.R.Cr.P. 32(b)(2)(C). Neither of the sentencing court's rulings, oral or written, fully complied with this requirement because neither cited to both statutory provisions under which Mr. Kite was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b616] We addressed a similar circumstance in\n   <em>\n    Kearns v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9412053\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/1090/\">\n    2002 WY 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9412053\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/1090/\">\n    48 P.3d 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1098 (Wyo. 2002), in which the judge misspoke during sentencing and called the defendant's conviction one for attempted aggravated robbery rather than aggravated robbery. The court's error carried over to its written order, and on that basis, the defendant claimed he could not be sentenced as a habitual criminal because attempted aggravated robbery was not a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9412053\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/1090/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We concluded that because 1) the information charged the defendant with aggravated robbery, 2) the jury was instructed on and convicted defendant of aggravated robbery, and 3) the court's mislabeling was not a deliberate result of judicial reasoning and determination, the error was merely clerical and subject to correction under W.R.Cr.P. 36.\n   <em>\n    Kearns,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9412053\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/1090/\">\n    48 P.3d at 1098-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We thus find the discrepancies between the judgment and verdict to be clerical errors and, although we affirm Mr. Kite's conviction for reasons discussed below, we remand for entry of a judgment corrected to reflect that he was convicted of aggravated assault under both subsections (a)(i) and (ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Jury Instructions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b618] The district court ruled that the crime of attempted battery under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-502\">\n    Wyo.

He claims only that the evidence was insufficient to show that he intended to cause bodily harm to another person when he drove against the southbound traffic. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   [\u00b637] We have explained the showing that must be made to prove specific intent to cause bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   [A]lthough the law presumes an individual to generally intend the natural consequences of his actions, it will not presume that he specifically intended any particular consequence. That is, a mere showing that certain conduct occurred which produced a particular result is legally sufficient to establish the actor's general intent. ... [T]he bare fact of assaultive behavior will not give rise to a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     presumption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that an assailant had the specific intent to cause any particular harm. ... [S]pecific intent may be properly proved by reasonable\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     inferences\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   from the character of such acts and their surrounding circumstances.

He drove north in the southbound passing lane for about five to six seconds and then moved into the driving lane where oncoming headlights were visible. Trooper Walz described the lane change:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   I could see headlights coming from a white passenger car in the driving lane. And then Mr. Kite's vehicle-He didn't drift over into what would be the driving lane, the same lane of the oncoming traffic; it was an intentional movement ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   [\u00b639] Mr. Kite was accelerating as he entered the driving lane, and his lane change forced the white passenger car and three semi-trucks to the shoulder. After those vehicles cleared the driving lane, he moved to the passing lane. He again accelerated after he changed lanes, and his action forced a black passenger car from the passing lane into the median.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   [\u00b640] The jury also heard testimony from Converse County Investigator Eric Koss, who interviewed Mr. Kite the day after his arrest. During Mr. Koss's testimony, portions of his recorded interview were played for the jury, and Mr. Koss testified concerning the portions the jury heard. He testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Q. So from the statements then that he's making to you, what's your understanding then of why he went into the other lane?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   A. Basically, that if he would put somebody else's life in danger that the Highway Patrol would have to stop chasing you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   [\u00b641] Mr. Kite argued to the jury, and he argues on appeal, that he clearly did not intend to cause bodily harm because if he intended to cause bodily injury, he could have and would have hit the other vehicles. He asserts his sole purpose in driving against the traffic was to cause Trooper Walz to stop his pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   [\u00b642] These are certainly inferences that could be made from the evidence the jury heard, but they are the inferences favorable to Mr. Kite. Our standard of review requires that we look instead to the inferences favorable to the State. When we consider the evidence from that perspective, we must conclude the jury reasonably reached its verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   [\u00b643] The evidence showed that while driving north in the southbound lane, Mr. Kite twice changed lanes, first from the passing lane to the driving lane and then back. Both lane changes put him on a head-on course toward oncoming, high-speed traffic. We believe a reasonable jury could conclude that Mr. Kite intentionally aimed his vehicle at the oncoming cars for the sole purpose of causing an accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sam\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 73, 401 P.3d at 858 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Walter v.

We are not swayed from this inference by Mr. Kite's insistence that had he intended to cause bodily injury, he would have struck the other vehicles. Striking the vehicles himself was not the only way to cause bodily injury. Bodily injury would have resulted had one or more of the oncoming vehicles lost control while trying to avoid a collision with Mr. Kite. A reasonable jury could infer that that was in fact Mr. Kite's plan-to cause an accident to create a break in Trooper Walz's pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   [\u00b644] Sufficient evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence support the jury's verdict. The district court therefore did not err in denying Mr. Kite's motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   [\u00b645] Under the circumstances of this case, we are satisfied that the elements instruction gave the jury a correct and legally sufficient basis on which to convict Mr. Kite of attempted battery under subsection (a)(i) and were therefore adequate. Additionally, the jury's verdict finding Mr. Kite guilty of aggravated assault and battery was supported by sufficient evidence. We therefore affirm but remand for correction of clerical errors in the judgment and sentence, consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Judge John C. Brooks presided over Mr. Kite's trial and through entry of the order on the jury's verdict and denial of Mr. Kite's motion for judgment of acquittal. Following his retirement, Judge F. Scott Peasley presided over sentencing and entry of the judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    While we find the term \"recklessly\" incompatible with the crime of attempt under the aggravated assault and battery statute, we do not agree with Mr. Kite that the term's statutory definition logically makes an attempted battery categorically impossible. Whether it will be can depend on the purpose and wording of the statute involved. Despite the wording of its definition, we have held that \"recklessly\" does not, as Mr. Kite argues, require an actual bodily injury when the crime charged is reckless endangerment.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n    [W]e believe the definition of \"recklessly\" does not require \"death or serious bodily injury.\" Rather, the term \"harm\" in the definition of \"recklessly\" refers to engaging \"in conduct which places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.\" It logically follows that the harm which must result is actually placing another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    <em>\n     Orona-Rangal v.
