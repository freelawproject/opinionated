The district court decided that it did. We agree that it does and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 The only facts relevant to this appeal are those that speak to the chronology. Erik Jensen received surgical treatment for abdominal pain and cramping on March 26, 2010. On April 1, 2010, Jensen suffered cardiac arrest. Jensen claims that medical staff failed to properly resuscitate him and provided negligent post-surgical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 On March 21, 2014, Jensen filed a notice of intent to sue and a request for prelitigation review. Jensen received a certificate of compliance on December 26, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and filed suit on February 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 Intermountain Healthcare, Inc., IHC Health Services, Inc. dba LDS Hospital, and IHC Health Services, Inc. dba Intermountain Medical Group (collectively \"IHC\") moved for summary judgment arguing that UHMA's four-year limitation period for medical malpractice actions barred Jensen's suit. The district court concluded that Jensen's request for prelitigation proceedings tolled the time to file during the period he spent waiting for the prelitigation review to conclude. IHC appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 5 The single question before us asks whether the district court erred when it denied IHC's summary judgment motion. This requires us to examine whether filing a request for prelitigation review tolls the four-year period for filing suit. This presents a statutory construction question that we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bishop v.

This notice must be sent to the prospective defendant and must include \"(a) a general statement of the nature of the claim; (b) the persons involved; (c) the date, time, and place of the occurrence; (d) the circumstances surrounding the claim; (e) specific allegations of misconduct on the part of the prospective defendant; and (f) the nature of the alleged injuries and other damages sustained.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408656\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-412(1)(a), (2), (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 8 Second, a plaintiff must present the claim to a prelitigation panel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408656\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-416(2)(a). UHMA requires that the plaintiff file the request for prelitigation panel review within sixty days of filing the notice of intent to commence action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408656\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The prelitigation panel proceedings are, in the statute's words, \"informal [and] nonbinding\" but also \"\n   <em>\n    compulsory as a condition precedent\n   </em>\n   to commencing litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408656\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-416(1)(c) (emphasis added). The division has 180 days after the request is filed to \"complete a prelitigation hearing,\" or longer if all parties agree.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408656\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(b). After it completes its review, the hearing panel issues an opinion and a certificate acknowledging that the plaintiff has complied with UHMA's prelitigation requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408656\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-418(1)(a). After receipt of the certificate, a plaintiff can properly file the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9 UHMA provides multiple limitations on when a plaintiff can file suit. Utah Code section 78B-3-404 reads, including the title:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Statute of limitations-Exceptions-Application\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) A malpractice action against a health care provider shall be commenced within two years after the plaintiff or patient discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury, whichever first occurs, but not to exceed four years after the date of the alleged act, omission, neglect, or occurrence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During the prelitigation review detailed above, UHMA \"tolls the\n   <em>\n    applicable statute of limitations\n   </em>\n   until the later of: (i) 60 days following the division's issuance of ... a certificate of compliance ... or (ii) the expiration of the time for holding a hearing ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408656\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/48/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 10 Tolling of the four-year period matters in this case because Jensen's four years to file expired while he was waiting for his certificate from the prelitigation review panel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court concluded that Jensen's request for prelitigation review tolled UHMA's four-year limitation on filing a malpractice action while the panel reviewed his case. The district court concluded: (1) that IHC's argument is not supported by the statutory language; (2) that our prior decisions, albeit in different contexts, suggested that both provisions should be tolled; and (3) that IHC's interpretation would not square with the policies underlying the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11 We can take a swifter path through the statute than the district court did. To decide whether the district court correctly concluded that Jensen's suit was timely, we must answer two questions: (1) is the four-year period a statute of limitations or a statute of repose; and (2) if it is a statute of repose, did the Legislature intend that period to be an \"applicable statute of limitations\" as UHMA uses that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I. The Four-Year Period Is a Statute of Repose\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 12 As noted above, the Legislature provided that \"[t]he filing of a request for prelitigation panel review under this section tolls the\n   <em>\n    applicable statute of limitations\n   </em>\n   until the later of: (i) 60 days following the division's issuance of ... a certificate of compliance ... or (ii) the expiration of the time for\n   holding a hearing ....\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 13 That raises the question of what the Legislature intended the reference to the \"applicable statute of limitations\" to mean. And, more specifically, does \"applicable statute of limitations,\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(a), include the period \"not to exceed four years after the date of the alleged act, omission, neglect, or occurrence,\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-3-404(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 14 For obvious reasons, the parties disagree about how to label section 78B-3-404 's limitation periods. If the latter half of that section describes a statute of limitations, it falls squarely within section 78B-3-416 's reference to \"applicable statute of limitations.\" If the four-year period is a statute of repose, we are presented with a trickier statutory interpretation question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15 We are presented with a trickier statutory interpretation question. Although the district court pointedly did not decide whether the latter half of section 78B-3-404(1) 's limitation is better described as a statute of limitations or a statute of repose, we have repeatedly said that the limitation functions as a statute of repose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arnold v. Grigsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980351\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/289/449/\">\n    2012 UT 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980351\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/289/449/\">\n    289 P.3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Utah Health Care Malpractice Act provides ... a four-year statute of repose for the filing of medical malpractice actions.\");\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Jensen urges us to reconsider what we said in these cases because, he claims, we have not had any reason \"to consider how a 'statute of repose' would operate in conjunction with other provisions of [UHMA], as compared with a statute of limitations.\" But Jensen does nothing more than invite us to reconsider those conclusions; that is, he provides us with no argument that the language in question constitutes a statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 In\n   <em>\n    Berry ex rel. Berry v. Beech Aircraft Corp.\n   </em>\n   , we limned the distinction between statutes of limitations and those of repose:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A statute of limitations requires a lawsuit to be filed within a specified period of time after a legal right has been violated or the remedy for the wrong committed is deemed waived. A statute of repose bars all actions after a specified period of time has run from the occurrence of some event other than the occurrence of an injury that gives rise to a cause of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10413233\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/717/670/#p672\">\n    717 P.2d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672 (Utah 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   involved a fatal plane crash. Plaintiffs alleged that the plane suffered from a manufacturing defect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10413233\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/717/670/#p672\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10413233\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/717/670/#p672\">\n    at 671-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case concerned a statutory limitation on the commencement of an action that barred \"all legal actions for death, personal injury, or damage to property caused by a defective product, if the action is filed more than six years after the date of first sale for 'use or consumption,' or ten years after the date of manufacture.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10413233\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/717/670/#p672\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10413233\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/717/670/#p672\">\n    at 672-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). We concluded that this operated as a statute of repose that began to run from \"the date of first sale, or the date of manufacture, of a product alleged to be defective.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10413233\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/717/670/#p672\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10413233\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/717/670/#p672\">\n    at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 18 UHMA operates in a similar way. Take, for example, a medical malpractice action based on a surgical error that does not manifest itself until years later. This resembles the manufacturing defect at issue in\n   <em>\n    Berry.\n   </em>\n   In both examples, the action that will eventually result in injury has occurred; it has just yet to be discovered. The defect was there from the date of surgery/manufacture, but will not come to light until later. Thus, without the benefit of any meaningful argument to the contrary, we continue to believe that the four-year period in UHMA functions as a statute of repose and this case hinges on whether the Legislature intended section 78B-3-404(1) 's four-year limitation period to be one of the \"applicable statutes of limitations\" that section 78B-3-416 references.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II. \"Statute of Limitations,\" as Used in the Utah Healthcare Malpractice Act, Is an Ambiguous Term\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 19 IHC argues that this is the simplest of cases because the statute only tolls \"the applicable statute of limitations\" and the relevant time period is a statute of repose, not a statute of limitations. IHC's argument prevails if we agree that, by using the term \"applicable statute of limitations\" in\n   Utah Code section 78B-3-416, the Legislature intended to draw a distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 20 We are not convinced that the Legislature uses the term statute of limitations as precisely as IHC's argument assumes. \"It is the duty of this court, according to its best knowledge and understanding, to declare the law as it finds it, and determine the intent and purpose thereof from the language used by the Legislature in expressing such purpose and intention.\"\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

And we can observe that the Legislature sometimes uses the term \"statute of limitations\" to mean limitation periods generally and does not always employ it to draw a distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 21 For example, the Legislature labeled chapter 2 of title 78B of the Utah Code \"Statutes of Limitations.\" Yet the Legislature acknowledged, later in that same chapter, that chapter 2 contains both statutes of limitations and repose by referring to the \"periods of limitation and repose provided in this chapter ....\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-2-225(2)(e).

In\n   <em>\n    Forbes v.

Filing a Request for Prelitigation Review Tolls the Statute of Repose\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 28 Once we determine the statute is ambiguous, the question simplifies because the section in which the statute of repose is found bears the title, \"Statute of Limitations.\" This strongly suggests that the Legislature was either using the term statute of limitations to mean limitation periods generally, or that it believed that the statute of repose in section 78B-3-404 was actually a statute of limitations subject to section 78B-3-416 and not the statute of repose we later found it to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29 We have stated that \"[t]he title of a statute is not part of the text of a statute, and absent ambiguity, it is generally not used to determine a statute's intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Blaisdell v.

The statute of repose is found in a section entitled \"Statute of limitations-Exceptions-Application.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-3-404. Reading the title in tandem with the statute, \"the applicable statute of limitations\" logically refers to both periods that Utah Code section 78B-3-404(1) labels statutes of limitations, and does not exclude the one that we later interpreted as a statute of repose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(a). In other words, because the Legislature placed the four-year period under the heading \"Statute of limitations-Exceptions-Application[,]\" it follows that the Legislature intended it to be one of the \"applicable statute of limitations\" that is tolled by the filing of a prelitigation panel request. UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 78B-3-404, 78B-3-416(3)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 31 This reading also has the advantage of creating a system that works harmoniously. Under Jensen's interpretation, the potential plaintiff files notice, tolling the statute of repose and statute of limitations. Then, within sixty days, the plaintiff files a request for prelitigation review. While that review is pending, the statute of limitations and statute of repose are tolled until the panel issues a certificate of compliance. Once the panel is finished with its review, the plaintiff has sixty days to file suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 32 Under the reading that IHC advocates, a plaintiff might have to file a placeholder suit\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -a suit UHMA forbids until the prelitigation review process is completed-if the statute of repose will expire while the panel is reviewing the case. Instead of requiring such a placeholder suit, tolling both the statute of limitations and repose harmonizes the notice and request for prelitigation review such that plaintiffs can proceed in a logical fashion with their medical malpractice suits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 33 The statute's ambiguous language, together with the relative clarity of its title, causes us to conclude that filing a request for\n   prelitigation review tolls the \"applicable statute of limitations.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(a). Therefore, the statute of repose does not bar Jensen's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 34 We conclude that the phrase \"statute of limitations\" as used in Utah Code section 78B-3-416(3)(a) is ambiguous. Looking at the title of Utah Code section 78B-3-404 -which includes the phrase \"[s]tatute of limitations\" in reference to the four-year time period-we resolve that ambiguity by concluding that the four-year time period is an \"applicable statute of limitations\" and is therefore tolled by filing a request for prelitigation review. UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 78B-3-404, 78B-3-416(3)(a). Because the statute of repose was tolled during the period Jensen sought prelitigation panel review, it does not bar his claim.

It does not inform whether the Legislature envisioned that a plaintiff would file a placeholder suit, knowing it would be dismissed as having been improperly filed, in order to toll the statute of repose while the plaintiff participates in the prelitigation panel process.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
