(AMS) and Daniel R. Ruff and Ruff Software, Inc. (collectively Ruff) litigated numerous claims and counterclaims in the Montana Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, over the parties' relative rights regarding the web-based payroll processing software, TimeTracker, developed by Ruff and licensed to AMS. Ultimately, the District Court granted summary judgment to Ruff, declaring the parties' 2008 licensing agreement valid and enforceable and effectively ruling that AMS had no right to TimeTracker other than as provided under the terms of the licensing agreement. Conversely, the court granted summary judgment to AMS on Ruff's counterclaims (breach of the licensing agreement, tortious interference with third-party relations, conversion, misappropriation of intellectual property, violation of the Montana Uniform Trade Secrets Act (MUTSA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and unjust enrichment). Ruff appeals the District Court's judgments denying its second motion to compel discovery related to its counterclaims, granting summary judgment to AMS on those counterclaims, and denying Ruff's motion for attorney fees as the prevailing party on AMS's claims. AMS cross-appeals the court's judgments adjudicating the validity of the 2008 licensing agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We address the following restated issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did the District Court erroneously grant summary judgment in favor of Ruff that the 2008 TimeTracker licensing agreement was valid and enforceable and that AMS had no right to TimeTracker other than as provided by the agreement?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court erroneously grant summary judgment in favor of AMS on Ruff's counterclaims?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Ruff's second motion to compel discovery?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Ruff's motion for attorney fees as the prevailing party on AMS's claims?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 AMS is a Montana business corporation engaged in the business of providing payroll and related business services to the members and affiliates of Associated Employers (AE). AE is a non-profit association of large regional employers and the parent company of AMS. From 1993-2011, Diane Ruff was the managing executive of AMS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During Diane's tenure, AMS employed her son, Daniel R. Ruff, as a Support Services Specialist under one-year employment contracts. In pertinent part, Daniel's successive employment contracts expressly provided that all \"materials prepared by Ruff as part of his employment with AMS,\" including all \"files concerning Ruff's activities as Support Services Specialist,\" would \"belong to and remain property of AMS.\"\n   <em>\n    Inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Daniel's contract-specified duties included \"[m]anag[ing] or facilitat[ing] the information technology function for the AMS server and clients\"; maintaining AMS's client-based payroll system; \"understand[ing] and review[ing] payroll software and processes to determine and implement efficiencies\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   and \"other responsibilities as assigned and required.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b64 In 2006, in response to a client's interest, AMS offered to develop an Internet-based payroll time-tracking program with financial support from the interested client. When the client declined, Daniel proposed to Diane that AMS unilaterally develop the proposed software but Diane declined due to cost. Daniel then informally offered to develop the software at his own expense on the understanding that he would own the end product. Diane authorized him to proceed. At his own expense, Daniel retained the help of a former AMS consultant and proceeded with the project. Ultimately named TimeTracker, the finished product was a web-based program that allowed AMS clients to collect, maintain, and process payroll-related information and to integrate the client payroll information with other AMS-owned payroll software. Daniel installed and hosted TimeTracker on a Ruff-owned server located at AMS. Daniel spent over $20,000 of his own money in the development of TimeTracker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 In early 2007, as the development of TimeTracker progressed, Diane, acting in her capacity as the chief executive officer of AMS, e-mailed AMS counsel, Tim Filz, and instructed that \"Dan needs to have an LLC set up for a web-based program he is developing.\" In accordance with Diane's instruction, Filz subsequently chartered Ruff\n   Software, Inc., with Daniel as the sole principal. Aside from this initial informal agreement between Diane and Daniel, no other agreement existed between Ruff and AMS during the development of TimeTracker from 2007 into 2008. However, on June 1, 2008, in advance of AMS's online deployment of TimeTracker for client use, AMS (through Diane) and Ruff Software, Inc. (through Daniel) executed a written software licensing agreement, which was drafted by Filz pursuant to Diane's prior instruction and which:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) described TimeTracker as \"certain software developed by Ruff\" including \"updates and future revisions ... regardless of the form ... or trade name under which the software is marketed\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (2) provided that \"[a]ll such proprietary software programs and related material, with a proprietary notice in human- or machine-readable form, are proprietary and confidential\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (3) authorized \"AMS to use and ... sublicense the TimeTracker Software\" exclusively to AE members;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (4) provided that \"Ruff shall retain all rights\" in TimeTracker \"not granted herein\" including the right to license TimeTracker to other parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (5) required AMS to pay Ruff 90% \"of all fees collected from\" AE members \"for [the] use of\" TimeTracker;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (6) provided that \"[t]he term of this license shall be perpetual and shall survive the termination of Dan Ruff's employment with AMS,\" and that Ruff had the right to market TimeTracker directly to AE members in the event that AMS \"quit promoting\" it or \"terminated its arrangements with\" AE members; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (7) included an express integration clause and provision for the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorney fees, costs, and other related expenses in the event of a breach of the agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pursuant to the agreement, AMS made TimeTracker available to its clients from the Ruff-owned server at AMS over Internet access provided by AMS. AMS maintained the Ruff server as required by the agreement but, at its discretion, did so through Daniel as part of his employment duties during his continuing tenure at AMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b66 In simplified terms, TimeTracker, as installed on the Ruff server for use by AMS sublicensees, consisted of a functional component and\n   a database component. Essentially the brain of the TimeTracker program, the functional component performed and produced desired end-user processing and output of end-user data, as inputted and stored in the database component. Daniel created the functional component through the use of Visual Basic Script (VBS), a standard alpha-numeric\n   computer programming language,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   resulting in a complex set of coded alpha-numeric instructions constituting the source code for the functional component. Software developers generally do not include the alpha-numeric source code in or with an end-user program. Distinct from the alpha-numeric source code, the functional component of an\n   <em>\n    installed\n   </em>\n   end-user program generally consists of executable machine code. Machine code is a binary code set produced by processing the original alpha-numeric source code through a special computer program (compiler) which converts the source code into a binary code directly executable by computer processors (hardware).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b67 Distinct from the functional component, the TimeTracker database component consisted of a relational database, which was composed of data structures (i.e. a table or sets of linked tables, with each table subdivided in matrix form into vertical columns (fields) and horizontal lines (records)) for structured storage of related information and, as referenced in this case, \"stored procedures and triggers\" that stored, retrieved, and processed data in and from the database as directed by the functional component. The \"stored procedures and triggers\" were essentially the programming interface between the functional component and the database data. Daniel created the TimeTracker data structures and associated \"stored procedures and triggers\" through the use of a Structured Query Language (SQL), a special alpha-numeric programming language used to create relational databases and provide the necessary interface operations between the functional component of a computer program and the database on which it operates. As installed on the Ruff server, the TimeTracker software consisted of the pre-compiled binary machine code constituting the functional component of the program and the uncompiled SQL source code (alpha-numeric code) constituting the TimeTracker database structures and associated database \"procedures\n   and triggers.\" Consequently, access to the installed and executable TimeTracker program on the Ruff server afforded access to the uncompiled alpha-numeric source code constituting the TimeTracker database component but not to the original source code for the functional component of the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b68 Following execution of the 2008 license agreement, AMS began sublicensing TimeTracker for remote Internet use by its AE clients. Over the period of June 30, 2008, through December 15, 2015, AMS regularly paid Ruff 90% of the revenue generated on TimeTracker, totaling $83,641.73, in accordance with the licensing agreement. While the AMS board of directors apparently did not have formal notice of the licensing agreement until early 2013 when first referenced in management financial reports to the board after Diane left the company, AMS board meeting minutes manifest that its new executive director, Greg Roadifer, specifically raised concerns about the agreement to the board on April 23, 2013. The meeting minutes further indicate that the board directed Roadifer to \"talk to Dan about AMS purchasing the TimeTracker system for a fair price and then Dan's wage could also be adjusted upward to reflect this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b69 After unfruitful discussions regarding the sale of TimeTracker in 2013, the issue returned to the fore in 2014 when Roadifer issued a memo criticizing Daniel for maintaining exclusive knowledge and control of the TimeTracker system, not acting professionally, and not being a \"team player.\" The memo ultimately encouraged Daniel to leave the company to avoid \"this awkward place you are in.\" In response, Daniel gave immediate notice of intent to leave AMS, which he did in September of 2014. In advance of leaving, Daniel provided AMS (through Roadifer) the credentials (user name and password) for administrative access to the Ruff server and TimeTracker. After leaving AMS, Daniel continued to provide consulting services to AMS to facilitate AMS's continued use and sublicensing of TimeTracker to AMS clients under the 2008 licensing agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b610 On March 26, 2015, six months after Daniel left the company, AMS (through Roadifer) e-mailed Ruff and again inquired if Ruff would \"consider selling\" TimeTracker to\n   AMS. Referencing AMS's intent to \"develop a new small business [Human Resource Information System] for [its] Members,\" Roadifer explained that \"we need to be able to modify, change, and adapt the TimeTracker program and system to work with our new HRIS web-based software.\" In conjunction with the anticipated purchase of AMS's own server and new router to host its current and future web-based software, Roadifer further advised that \"[w]e would like to consider moving [the Ruff] server\" to the new AMS\n   router for \"more flexibility and fail-safe protection.\" By e-mail response dated March 30, 2015, Daniel stated his plan to market TimeTracker \"outside of AMS\" unless AMS accepted his offer to buy \"the website, source code, hardware, and everything that is TimeTracker\" for $120,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b611 On April 19, 2015, upon authorization of the AMS board, Roadifer e-mailed Daniel and, in reference to AMS's plan to \"build\" its own \"HRIS system\" and AMS's stated need to revise \"the current TimeTracker ... to work with the new HRIS,\" counteroffered to buy TimeTracker and the Ruff server for $60,000. Roadifer explained that \"[w]e would originally use the source code but would eventually transition away to a newer web technology with our new HRIS.\" On April 23, 2015, Ruff responded with its own counteroffer setting forth three different options under which AMS could either: (1) buy TimeTracker for $120,000 (as originally offered by Ruff); (2) buy TimeTracker for $60,000 (as originally counteroffered by AMS) plus $3,000 per month until AMS developed its own software with similar function; or (3) pay nothing, terminate the 2008 licensing agreement, and Ruff would then provide TimeTracker directly to AMS's clients. Ruff's April 23, 2015 e-mail further advised AMS that, \"[r]egardless of the option chosen,\" Ruff would \"no longer offer consulting services for the AMS payroll system effective June 1, 2015.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b612 Without response to the Ruff counteroffer, and unknown to Ruff, AMS immediately made several unsuccessful attempts to access the Ruff server at AMS to copy the installed TimeTracker program for installation on an AMS-owned server for uninterrupted use by AMS's AE clients under the 2008 licensing agreement. With the assistance of a third-party computer consultant, AMS was ultimately able to access the Ruff server without Daniel's knowledge and copy the installed TimeTracker program for installation on the AMS server. On April 24, 2015, Roadifer e-mailed AMS's lead software developer, James Collins, and requested a meeting to discuss AMS's contemplated development of an AMS-owned replacement for TimeTracker. AMS separately e-mailed Collins the credentials (user name and password) for administrative access to TimeTracker as previously installed on the Ruff server.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b613 In consultation with Roadifer and other AMS personnel, Collins subsequently developed AMS's own payroll software system known as SlatePay. Like TimeTracker, SlatePay consisted of a functional component, initially coded in a standard alpha-numeric computer programming language, and a database component, consisting of a database and related programming interface controlled by the\n   functional component. However, unlike TimeTracker, AMS created the SlatePay database component (database and programming interface) through the use of NoSQL, a special alpha-numeric programming language used to create and interface with non-relational databases. Unlike the relational database used in TimeTracker, a NoSQL database stores data in a less-structured, non-tabular form. To the end-user, programs based on SQL and NoSQL databases can have similar appearance and function based on entirely different internal database architecture and structure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   With access to the uncompiled source code for TimeTracker's database component (TimeTracker's SQL-based database and \"stored procedures and triggers\"), Collins extracted AMS's client data from the TimeTracker database and converted it for input into SlatePay's NoSQL database.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b614 Upon obtaining an installation copy of TimeTracker (functional and database components) from the Ruff server, re-installing TimeTracker on the AMS server, and embarking on development of the competing SlatePay program, AMS preemptively filed suit against Ruff in the Montana Thirteenth Judicial District Court. Based on its interpretation of Ruff's three-option counteroffer, AMS's original complaint alleged anticipatory breach of the 2008 licensing agreement by Ruff and sought declaratory judgment to preserve AMS's rights under the agreement. AMS alleged that Ruff planned to deny AMS access to TimeTracker and then market it directly to AMS's clients unless AMS paid a \"stated sum.\" Consequently, AMS further requested preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining Ruff from interfering with AMS's right to use TimeTracker under the 2008 agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b615 Following a record stipulation for dissolution of an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary restraining order and unsuccessful mediation, Ruff filed an answer denying all of AMS's original complaint allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses and counterclaims, including breach of the 2008 licensing agreement, tortious interference with third-party relations, conversion, misappropriation of intellectual\n   property, MUTSA violation, and unjust enrichment. Ruff's answer described TimeTracker as a \"website [that] consists of several components,\" including compiled machine code (functional component) residing on the Ruff server at AMS together with SQL-based source code constituting the database component of the program. Ruff further sought declaratory judgment adjudicating the validity and enforceability of the 2008 licensing agreement and an injunction enjoining AMS from sharing or modifying the TimeTracker software, using TimeTracker in the development of AMS's own payroll-processing software, and requiring AMS to grant Ruff access to the Ruff server at the AMS facility. AMS subsequently filed an amended complaint asserting for the first time that AMS \"owned\" TimeTracker and that the 2008 licensing agreement was invalid as an unauthorized corporate act. In response, Ruff asserted additional counterclaims that AMS materially breached the licensing agreement and violated MUTSA by allowing unauthorized third-party access to the Ruff server to copy the installed TimeTracker software for use by AMS in developing its SlatePay software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b616 A central basis for Ruff's theft-based counterclaims (i.e. conversion, misappropriation of intellectual property, and MUTSA violation) and related discovery requests were two e-mails Daniel unexpectedly received in June 2015 from \"slatepayroll.com\" and addressed to him at \"AE Widgets.\" Recognizing the name \"AE Widgets\" as part of a fictitious data set he created in 2007 for use in the development and testing of TimeTracker, Daniel first suspected that AMS was using TimeTracker to aid in the development of what became its competing SlatePay software. Based on that suspicion, Ruff subsequently propounded various discovery requests for production of specified documents including but not limited to all internal AMS e-mail communications regarding the development of SlatePay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b617 On October 2015, Ruff moved for summary judgment on the validity of the 2008 licensing agreement and AMS's claimed ownership of TimeTracker. Following the appearance of new counsel for AMS,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the District Court granted Ruff's motion, ruling that the 2008 licensing agreement was a valid and enforceable contract executed within the actual or ostensible authority of AMS's corporate agent, Diane Ruff,\n   and in any event subsequently ratified by AMS board acknowledgment and performance. The court accordingly dismissed AMS's competing declaratory judgment claims, thereby effectively ruling that AMS had no right to TimeTracker other than as provided by the licensing agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b618 On March 22, 2016, in the wake of AMS's boilerplate responses to Ruff's requests\n   for production (e.g. not relevant, privileged, or not likely to lead to discovery of relevant evidence), Ruff filed a motion to compel more particular AMS responses related to the development of SlatePay including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , any and all internal AMS e-mails from April 2015 through June 2015 containing the words \"TimeTracker,\" \"SlatePay,\" or various iterations thereof. Ruff also moved for compelled production of SlatePay design and data-structure documentation, lists of SlatePay data field names, SlatePay source code, and any other technical information or related correspondence potentially probative of AMS's alleged use of TimeTracker code or features in the development of SlatePay. On June 1, 2016, the District Court partially granted Ruff's motion to compel, ordering production of a limited scope of internal AMS correspondence and e-mail communications, but held Ruff's request for production of the SlatePay source code in abeyance pending hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b619 At hearing on June 13, 2016, Daniel conceded that, contrary to his earlier discovery requests, he did not need access to the SlatePay source code to assess whether AMS had converted or incorporated portions of TimeTracker into SlatePay. Moreover, AMS presented testimony from in-house software developer James Collins that, though he designed SlatePay to access the SQL-based TimeTracker database component to convert the stored AMS client data from the SQL format used by TimeTracker to the NoSQL format used by SlatePay, he had not otherwise examined or considered the TimeTracker source code in the development of SlatePay. Daniel testified that he was unable to rebut Collins's testimony because AMS had failed to provide the previously requested internal e-mails and because Ruff's retained expert was unavailable for the June 13th hearing. Based on Daniel's concession and Collins's unrebutted testimony, the District Court denied the balance of Ruff's motion to compel and allowed AMS to go forward with the development and marketing of SlatePay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b620 Following the June 13th hearing and prior to responding to AMS's\n   pending motion for summary judgment on Ruff's counterclaims, Ruff moved for a continuance pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) for additional time to: (1) obtain production of the AMS correspondence and internal e-mails compelled under the District Court's June 1st order; (2) depose Collins and other AMS personnel; and (3) allow Ruff's retained software expert to analyze the information obtained. The court granted Ruff's motion and ordered AMS to file a written certification of compliance with the June 1st order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b621 On August 24, 2016, Ruff filed a response to AMS's motion for partial summary judgment on the Ruff counterclaims. Two days later, in dispute of AMS's August 22nd certification of compliance with the June 1st discovery order, Ruff filed a second motion to compel additional production from AMS on the assertion that the \"central issue at the heart of the litigation remains in dispute\" due to AMS's failure to respond to previously propounded discovery requests, thereby preventing Ruff's expert from evaluating \"whether and to what extent AMS leveraged TimeTracker in the creation of SlatePay.\" Ruff characterized AMS's response to the District Court's June 1st discovery order as a \"2,000-page document dump\" of \"purportedly responsive materials\" that \"were largely irrelevant\" and which \"clearly omitted certain\" previously requested documents such as internal AMS communications related to TimeTracker and the development of SlatePay between April and June 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b622 On September 26, 2016, the District Court conducted a hearing on Ruff's second motion to compel, the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on Ruff's counterclaims, and a new Ruff motion for leave to assert additional counterclaims (bad faith and abuse of process). On October 12, 2016, with rulings on those matters still pending following the September 26th hearing, Ruff deposed AMS's lead software designer James Collins. Two days later, Ruff filed a supplement to its second motion to compel asserting that Collins' deposition testimony disclosed for the first time the existence and substance of previously requested, but yet unproduced, e-mails from AMS executive director Roadifer to Collins in 2015 regarding AMS's intent to develop what became SlatePay,\n   as well as a separate AMS e-mail transmittal to Collins of the credentials for administrative access to TimeTracker. Collins' deposition testimony further revealed that he had also exchanged a number of other previously requested, but as yet unproduced, e-mails with AMS information technology supervisor, Tracy Roadifer, about the development of SlatePay. Ruff further informed the District Court that Collins testified that he could easily create a previously requested list of SlatePay functions and features,\n   user interfaces, and sample data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b623 On October 24, 2016, the District Court issued a written order denying Ruff's second motion to compel, denying its motion for leave to add additional counterclaims, and granting summary judgment on both parties' motions, thereby dismissing all remaining AMS claims against Ruff and all Ruff counterclaims against AMS. The District Court further ruled that neither party was entitled to attorney fees on the ground that neither had proven a breach of the 2008 licensing agreement by the other and thus neither was the prevailing party \"[i]n the event of a breach\" within the meaning of the contract attorney fees provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b624 On November 7, 2016, Ruff filed a motion for contract attorney fees as the prevailing party in the dispute over the validity and enforceability of the 2008 licensing agreement or, alternatively, pursuant to \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA (discretionary attorney fees on successful declaratory judgment). Pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b), Ruff filed a separate motion requesting that the District Court set aside its grant of summary judgment to AMS on the Ruff counterclaims and related denial of Ruff's motion to add additional counterclaims. Ruff again asserted that Collins' deposition testimony revealed that AMS failed to produce previously requested internal AMS communications vital to his counterclaims. Ruff asserted that the Collins' deposition testimony confirmed Ruff's suspicions that AMS had accessed the TimeTracker database and converted its data for use in SlatePay. The District Court denied Ruff's Rule 60(b) motion on the ground that, in light of the existing facts of record, Collins' deposition testimony revealed no new information that was either relevant or reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of relevant information. The court further denied Ruff's motion for attorney fees. Ruff appeals and AMS cross-appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b625 This Court reviews a district court's grant or denial of summary judgment and related conclusions of law de novo for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Bitterrooters for Planning, Inc. v.

The court accordingly dismissed AMS's competing declaratory judgment claims, thereby effectively ruling that AMS had no right to TimeTracker other than as provided by the licensing agreement. AMS asserts that the District Court erred because Daniel created TimeTracker within the scope of his AMS employment and that the agreement was thus void due to lack of consideration. AMS alternatively asserts that the agreement is voidable by the corporation as an unauthorized act of a corporate agent and legally not subject to subsequent ratification due to a conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

The essential elements of a contract\n   consist of identifiable and capable parties, mutual assent, a lawful object, and \"sufficient cause or consideration.\" Section 28-2-102, MCA. Legally sufficient contract consideration requires: (1) a benefit offered by a promisor to another, or a promisor's offer to suffer a detriment to the other; (2) offered by the promisor in exchange for or to induce a reciprocal benefit from or detriment suffered by the other; and (3) the offered exchange or inducement involves a benefit to which the other is not already \"lawfully entitled\" or a detriment that the promisor is not already \"lawfully bound to suffer.\" Section 28-2-801, MCA. Absent affirmative proof to the contrary upon substantial evidence, a written contract is presumed to be supported by \"good and sufficient consideration.\" Sections 26-1-602(38) and 28-2-804, MCA.

R. Civ. P. 56 that, apart from his express employment contract duties, he and AMS, through its chief executive officer, orally agreed that Daniel would develop what became TimeTracker for commercial use by AMS on the understanding that Daniel would retain ultimate ownership of\n   the software. Beyond genuine material dispute on the record presented, the rudimentary agreement benefitted AMS by allowing it to provide a beneficial service to the constituent membership of its parent organization, AE. The agreement reciprocally benefitted Daniel by allowing him to create and hold a contract interest in a commodity of value, albeit then unspecified. Though the threshold development agreement, as manifest on the evidentiary record, did not specify the parties' relative ownership and use rights, it was nonetheless a simple exchange of reciprocal promises regarding a lawful object of mutual benefit to both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b630 As development of TimeTracker neared completion, the parties built on the informal agreement to establish the more formal 2008 licensing agreement. Similar to the initial informal agreement, the licensing agreement manifestly allowed AMS to provide payroll services to members of AE. Regardless of other cost considerations not evident on the face of the agreement, the licensing agreement further expressly benefitted AMS by allowing it to retain 10% of the revenue generated from sublicensing the product for use by its clients. The licensing agreement expressly, clearly, and unequivocally identified the contract parties as AMS, acting by and through Diane Ruff in her capacity as AMS's \"Executive Director,\" and Ruff Software, Inc., by and through Daniel as its \"President/Owner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 AMS asserts that the apparent mutual consideration for the licensing agreement was nonetheless deficient or illusory because AMS already \"owned\" TimeTracker as the work-product of an employee, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-403 and -409, MCA, the express terms of Daniel's 2007 and 2008 employment contracts, and the supplemental terms of the AMS employee handbook. A \"benefit agreed to be conferred\" or detriment \"suffered or agreed to be suffered\" by a promisor to the benefit of another is not valid contract consideration if the other is already \"lawfully entitled\" to receive the benefit or the consideration involves a detriment the promisor is already lawfully obligated to suffer.

Nothing in the plain meaning of the express language of the employment contracts evinces any provision or intent to include software\n   <em>\n    development\n   </em>\n   as part of Daniel's AMS employment duties or responsibilities. Though an apparent implicit term of Daniel's employment agreement with AMS, the general prohibition in the AMS employee handbook against personal use of company resources is\n   insufficient to override an independently supported agreement between the parties specifically authorizing and providing for Daniel to develop TimeTracker to the parties' mutual benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b635 On the Rule 56 record, Ruff made a threshold factual showing that, apart from Daniel's express contract employment, he and AMS (through its chief executive officer) orally agreed that Daniel would develop what became the TimeTracker software at his own expense for use by AMS on the understanding that Ruff would retain a contract interest in the end-product. Further evidencing this threshold fact are the consistent terms of the 2008 licensing agreement, the fact of AMS's execution of the licensing agreement with a party (Ruff Software, Inc.) who was not an AMS employee, and AMS's consistent pre-dispute contract performance and payments to Ruff over a seven-year period. AMS's responsive reference to Daniel's express contract duties and the general prohibition in the AMS employment handbook of personal use of company resources are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact to the contrary or to support AMS's related assertion that the 2008 licensing agreement was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The mere facts that Diane and Daniel were mother and son and that the AMS board was not formally or specifically aware of the licensing agreement until the new AMS executive director raised \"concerns\" about it in 2013 after Diane left the company are insufficient without\n   more to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Diane was acting outside the scope of her actual or ostensible authority when she executed the licensing agreement seven years earlier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the Rule 56 record presented, we hold that Ruff was\n   entitled to judgment that Diane executed the 2008 licensing agreement within the scope of her actual and ostensible authority as the chief executive officer of AMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b640 The District Court alternatively ruled that, even if\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   Diane had executed the licensing agreement outside the scope of her actual or ostensible authority, AMS nonetheless ratified the agreement after she left the company.

AMS asserts that the conflict of interest \"deprived\" Diane Ruff of any \"actual or ostensible authority\" that she may otherwise\n   have had and that, as a matter of law, a transaction that is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   is not subject to ratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b644 Corporate directors have statutory fiduciary duties of reasonable care, good faith, and loyalty. Section 35-1-418, MCA. Corporate officers\n   have similar fiduciary duties. Sections 35-1-442 and -443, MCA. However, the compliance oversight and remedies for violation of those duties is different for directors than officers. Corporate directors serve at the discretion and oversight of the shareholders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 35-1-424, -425, and -462(1), MCA (shareholder authority to remove directors, actions for judicial removal of directors, and derivative actions against corporation or board of directors to adjudicate or enforce rights of corporation as a whole). In contrast, corporate officers serve at the discretion and oversight of the board of directors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 35-1-416(2) and -444(2), MCA (board of directors' authority to direct and remove officers). The board of directors has plenary authority over corporate officers within the scope of the corporate bylaws, as determined by the board,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 35-1-416, -441, -442, and -444, MCA. While wrongful acts of corporate officers may conceivably be subject to derivative action by the shareholders or corporation to the extent of the utility of that remedy, the Montana Business Corporations Act (MBCA) does not expressly define or address conflict of interest transactions involving corporate officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Title 35, chapter 4, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b645 In contrast, the MBCA provides a remedy for redress of director conflict of interest transactions but the remedy is limited to derivative actions involving director conflict of interest transactions, as narrowly defined by \u00a7 35-1-461(2), MCA, and which fall outside of the statutory safe-harbor for transactions that are either \"fair to the corporation\" under the \"circumstances at the time\" regardless of disclosure or those disclosed by the director with knowledge and approved by a majority vote of uninterested directors (or a majority vote of all uninterested shares).

Here, regardless of whether Diane Ruff was an AMS board member or officer at the time of execution of the 2008 licensing agreement, and despite the fact that she and Daniel were related, this action is not a derivative action as defined by \u00a7 35-1-541, MCA. Rather, this action involves claims and counterclaims by and between a corporation and a third party (Ruff) who, on this record, was neither an AMS shareholder or director. Thus, as a threshold matter of law, \u00a7\u00a7 35-1-461 and -463, MCA, have no application here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b647 Moreover, even if \u00a7\u00a7 35-1-461 and -463, MCA, were applicable here, an undisclosed director conflict of interest transaction is neither void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   per se, nor voidable at the discretion of the corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Commission Comments to \u00a7 35-1-461, MCA (discussing MBCA departure from prior statutory scheme). Rather, undisclosed director conflict of interest transactions are\n   merely subject to damages and injunctive relief, in a derivative action, upon proof that the transaction was unfair to the corporation under the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   35-1-462(2)(c), MCA. Apart from the threshold fact that this is not a derivative action, AMS has further made no claim or showing of entitlement to damages or injunctive relief against Ruff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold that the District Court correctly granted Ruff summary judgment that the 2008 licensing agreement was valid and enforceable in accordance with its express terms, thereby effectively ruling that AMS had no right to TimeTracker other than as provided under the terms of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b648\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court erroneously grant summary judgment in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    favor of AMS on Ruff's counterclaims?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b649 On the asserted ground that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment, Ruff asserts that the District Court erroneously granted summary judgment to AMS on the Ruff counterclaims for breach of contract, tortious interference with third-party relations, conversion, misappropriation of intellectual property, MUTSA violation, and unjust enrichment. On appeal, Ruff asserts that the following facts and assertions were sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment: (1) AMS \"lied to Ruff by saying it would consult the [AMS] board about\" Ruff's counteroffers in the TimeTracker purchase negotiations; (2) AMS \"immediately contacted its lead software developer\" after purchase negotiations stalled \"to begin work on a [TimeTracker] replacement\"; (3) AMS hired a third-party consultant to access the Ruff server and copy TimeTracker for installation on the AMS server; (4) AMS preemptively \"[f]iled a lawsuit against Ruff and obtained a temporary restraining order\" to \"shield its 'use' of TimeTracker from scrutiny\"; (5) AMS \"[a]ttempted to use the lawsuit, TRO, and Ruff's former lawyers to coerce the sale of TimeTracker;\" (6) AMS provided \"lead software developer instructions on how to access TimeTracker\"; (7) AMS used personnel with TimeTracker experience to assist in the development of SlatePay; and (8) \"[a]t the very least,\" AMS \"linked TimeTracker's database to SlatePay via an SQL adapter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Ruff's Breach of Contract Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b650 The primary essence of Ruff's breach of contract claim is that AMS breached the 2008 licensing agreement by copying TimeTracker from the Ruff server, reinstalling and using the software on the AMS server, excluding Ruff from administering AMS's continued use of TimeTracker, and denying Daniel access to the Ruff-owned server at AMS after negotiations broke-down. Ruff asserts that AMS further breached the agreement, and violated MUTSA, by allowing a retained third-party consultant to access the Ruff server to make a backup copy of TimeTracker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b651 The construction or interpretation of a contract is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Krajacich\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13. If the language of a written agreement is clear and unambiguous, the court must apply the language as written.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Pruyn\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47. The 2008 licensing agreement expressly authorized AMS to perpetually \"use\" and \"sublicense\" TimeTracker for use by its AE clients. In return, the agreement required AMS only to make specified contract payments, bill AMS's clients for TimeTracker use, maintain \"the web server hosting TimeTracker onsite\" at AMS, and provide \"broadband access to AMS users.\" As recognized by the\n   District Court, the agreement did not require AMS to host TimeTracker on Ruff's server-only to host it on an onsite web server maintained by AMS. The agreement similarly did not require AMS to maintain and administer TimeTracker exclusively through Daniel, whether in his employment capacity or in his capacity as Ruff's principal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement further expressly contemplated\n   that AMS's perpetual right to use TimeTracker would survive Daniel's eventual departure from AMS's employ. In the manifest absence of an express prohibition or limitation, the agreement's express authorization for perpetual onsite use and maintenance by necessity implicitly authorized AMS to copy the installed version of TimeTracker for reinstallation and use on another onsite server.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b652 Ruff made no responsive showing that AMS interfered with Ruff's ownership of the Ruff server apart from acting to protect AMS's contract right to continued use of TimeTracker. Daniel admitted that AMS, not Ruff, owned the user or customer data maintained in the TimeTracker database and that he had no authorization to access the data except as an employee or contract consultant of AMS. It is beyond genuine material dispute on the Rule 56 record that, regardless of the temporary restraining order and AMS's copying of the installed version of TimeTracker, Ruff at all times had a complete copy of the installed version of TimeTracker as well as exclusive possession and control over the uncompiled source code for the TimeTracker functional component. Nothing in the licensing agreement expressly or implicitly required AMS to provide infrastructure or support to assist Ruff in soliciting AMS clients or providing TimeTracker to new clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b653 Moreover, nothing in the language of the licensing agreement precluded AMS from employing a third-party computer consultant to assist in the administration of AMS's licensed use of TimeTracker. Ruff made no factual showing that the third-party consultant retained by AMS to copy the installed version of TimeTracker was involved in any capacity, or to any extent, other than as a limited contract agent of AMS for that purpose. Regardless of Ruff's retained contract interest in TimeTracker, Ruff made no non-speculative factual showing that the consultant did anything other than assist AMS in its licensed use of TimeTracker. Under these circumstances, Ruff's asserted factual showings and speculative arguments regarding AMS's alleged\n   unscrupulous, post-dispute conduct were insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the parties' relative rights and obligations under the clear and unequivocal terms of the licensing agreement. We hold that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment on Ruff's counterclaim for breach of the 2008 licensing agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Ruff's Conversion, Intellectual Property, and Trade Secret Counterclaims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b654 Brief examination of the essential elements of the Ruff counterclaims for conversion, misappropriation of intellectual property, and MUTSA violation similarly manifest their common insufficiency on the Rule 56 record. The essential elements of common law conversion are: (1) a claimant's right of possession or control over the subject personal property; (2) the intentional exercise of possession or control over the property by another inconsistent with the right of the owner and without right or consent; and (3) resulting damages to the claimant.\n   <em>\n    Gebhardt v.

However, as noted by the District Court, and manifest on the Rule 56 record, Ruff had no legal copyright, trademark, or patent protection for TimeTracker. Ruff's theft-based claims were grounded in the terms of the 2008 licensing agreement. However, as previously analyzed herein, AMS used and accessed the installed TimeTracker program in accordance with the terms of the licensing agreement. Moreover, Ruff made no responsive factual showing rebutting AMS's showings that AMS did not have access to the uncompiled source code for TimeTracker's functional component and that AMS lacked sufficient technical expertise to reverse-engineer it from the compiled machine code to which it did have access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b661 Further, Ruff admitted that AMS exclusively owned the customer data that it copied from TimeTracker's SQL-based database for conversion into SlatePay's NoSQL database.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   While AMS had access to the uncompiled SQL source code constituting the TimeTracker database component, Ruff made no factual showing rebutting AMS's expert showing that TimeTracker's \"stored procedures and triggers\" (i.e. TimeTracker's SQL-based programming interface) were fundamentally incompatible and unusable by design and nature with SlatePay's NoSQL-based database structure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b662 Even to the extent that AMS may or could have nonetheless modeled or adapted certain SlatePay features, functions, or processes on certain logical structures, functions, or processes evident from the SQL-based TimeTracker database component,\n   Daniel testified that TimeTracker's uncompiled SQL-based \"stored procedures and triggers\" were unencrypted and \"open.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ruff made no evidentiary showing that Daniel made any effort to maintain the asserted confidentiality or secrecy of TimeTracker's SQL-based \"stored procedures and triggers.\" In contrast, AMS made an unrebutted expert showing that TimeTracker's functionality and processes were \"very understandable\" and characteristic of \"well documented process flows\" provided \"by literally hundreds of vendors out there.\" Lastly, in contrast to the express specification in the 2008 licensing agreement that Ruff would designate any asserted proprietary information in the software, TimeTracker did not include any such proprietary notice or designation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b663 In the face of these facts and beyond cursory characterization as trade secret or proprietary information, Ruff has failed to make any particularized showing as to how or on what basis TimeTracker's \"stored procedures and triggers,\" design, functionality, or features are novel, unique, or substantially different from those available in, or derived or adapted from, other commonly available payroll time tracking software. Ruff has further failed to make any affirmative factual showing that AMS's conduct and use of TimeTracker caused damages or detriment to Ruff. Under these circumstances, Ruff's conversion claim fails as a matter of law due to lack of proof of wrongful dominion or use and lack of damages. Ruff's contract misappropriation fails due to lack of proof of breach of the 2008 licensing agreement and lack of damages. Ruff's tortious misappropriation claim fails due to lack of proof of novelty, originality, and damages. Ruff's MUTSA claim fails due to lack of proof of improper acquisition, independent economic value based on knowledge not generally known or readily ascertainable, and damages. We hold that the District Court correctly granted AMS summary judgment on Ruff's counterclaims for conversion, contract and tortious misappropriation of intellectual property, and MUTSA violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Equally disturbing, the record indicates that the District Court failed to demand a particularized showing as to why or on what basis AMS withheld records within the scope of Ruff's discovery requests as privileged or otherwise not calculated to lead to the discovery of relevant information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b674 In the face of AMS's initial non-descriptive boilerplate responses, and subsequent written and in-court assertions that it had fully produced all discoverable information requested or compelled, Ruff ultimately made a particularized showing that AMS's prior discovery responses were incomplete. However, while we are reluctant to ignore AMS's manifestly non-responsive boilerplate discovery responses and the District Court's apparent acceptance of AMS's bald representations as to the content of disputed documents, the narrow issue on appeal is whether the District Court's rationale for denying Ruff's second motion to compel constituted an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b675 Ruff filed its second motion to compel in response to AMS's potentially dispositive motion for summary judgment. The previously requested information regarding the design, data structures, and functionality of AMS's SlatePay program was again at issue, as well as suspected internal AMS e-mails and correspondence (involving AMS Executive Director Greg Roadifer, IT Supervisor Tracy Roadifer, software developer James Collins, and third-party AMS clients) regarding AMS's intent and progress in the development of SlatePay. Ruff and his retained expert continued to assert that this information was crucial to assess the manner and extent to which AMS used or \"leveraged\" TimeTracker to develop SlatePay. The District Court acknowledged that the outstanding discovery requests were not new, but determined the requests to be futile to Ruff's counterclaims in the face of the material facts then of record to which no genuine issue existed. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b676 Contrary to its prior assertion, Ruff had previously acknowledged that it did not need access to SlatePay's source code to assess whether AMS had used TimeTracker to develop SlatePay. Ruff also does not dispute on appeal the District Court's observation that Ruff's requests for information regarding SlatePay's design, data structures, and functionality sought production of documentation that, though producible anew, AMS did not possess. Ruff likewise does not contest on appeal AMS's assertion that many of the requested documents either contained SlatePay source code or personal third-party information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b677 As described by Ruff, the unproduced internal AMS communications were largely, if not exclusively, preliminary 2015 communications regarding AMS's intent and efforts to develop SlatePay, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the transmittal to Collins of the Ruff-provided credentials for administrative access to the Ruff server and the installed version of TimeTracker. As a matter of law, the requested internal AMS communications could not have altered or affected the legal interpretation of the clear and unambiguous language of the 2008 licensing agreement. Based on its narrow focus on SlatePay and AMS's conduct rather than TimeTracker, the requested discovery could not in any event have given rise to a genuine issue of material fact regarding facts that were then of record, beyond genuine material dispute, regarding the evidentiary and legal insufficiency of TimeTracker and the 2008 licensing agreement as support for Ruff's counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b678 As correctly concluded by the District Court based on the facts then of record beyond genuine material dispute, AMS was acting within the scope of its contract rights when it accessed the Ruff server and copied TimeTracker for installation on AMS's server. It was further beyond genuine material dispute that TimeTracker's SQL-based database structure and \"stored procedures and triggers\" were open, unencrypted, and without proprietary designation as contemplated by the 2008 licensing agreement. Ruff's SlatePay-focused discovery requests could not in any event rebut AMS's factual showings that: (1) TimeTracker's SQL-based \"stored procedures and triggers\" were incompatible and unusable with SlatePay's NoSQL database and programming interface; (2) AMS owned the customer data in the TimeTracker database;\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) TimeTracker's \"stored procedures and triggers\" were not novel, original, or undiscoverable by AMS upon\n   lawful use of TimeTracker under the 2008 licensing agreement. In contrast to Ruff's SlatePay-focused discovery requests, the facts and issues that were fatal to Ruff's claims had to do with what AMS was authorized to do under the 2008 licensing agreement and what TimeTracker was and was not on the then-existing Rule 56 record. Though we do not approve of AMS's discovery responses, the discovery requested under Ruff's second motion to compel was nonetheless futile on its face under the particular facts and circumstances then of record in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold that the\n   District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ruff's second motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b679\n   <em>\n    4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Ruff's motion for attorney fees as the prevailing party on AMS's claims?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b680 Ruff asserts that it is entitled to attorney fees under the attorney fees provision in the 2008 licensing agreement or, alternatively, pursuant to \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. In pertinent part, the 2008 licensing agreement expressly provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   In the event of a breach of this agreement, the party at fault shall and will pay to the other party all ... reasonable attorneys' fees ... which may be incurred by the said other party in enforcing such party's rights hereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Narrowly focusing on AMS's breach of contract claim against Ruff, the District Court ruled that the contract attorney fees provision did not apply pursuant to its express terms because there was no adjudicated breach of the 2008 licensing agreement as alleged by AMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b681 Contract attorney fees provisions are reciprocal to both parties regardless of express benefit only to one. Section 28-3-704(1), MCA. We construe the imprecise language at issue to provide that, in the event of an adjudicated breach of the agreement, the breaching party shall be liable to the non-breaching party for attorney fees incurred to enforce the contract rights of the non-breaching party. While it expressly applied only to the benefit of a party who prevailed on a claim that the other party breached the agreement, the contract provision at issue also reciprocally benefited a non-breaching party who prevailed against an adverse breach of contract claim. Section 28-3-704(1), MCA. AMS's declaratory judgment claims were contract-based and inextricably intertwined with Ruff's breach-based\n   counterclaims. Without need to sort out the parties' breach-based claims, neither party was the prevailing party on their intertwined contract claims. Ruff prevailed on AMS's contract claims but AMS prevailed on Ruff's contract counterclaims. We hold that the District Court correctly denied Ruff's claim for contract attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b682 Ruff alternatively asserts that it is entitled to attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA.
