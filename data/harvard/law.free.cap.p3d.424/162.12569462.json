Xiao-Yan Cao, L + C's president, personally guaranteed L + C's performance. In 2006, the lease was again assigned, this time to Hong G. Lin. As part of that assignment, the lease term was extended until September 30, 2013, and both Cao and Lin inked personal guaranties. In 2010, Lin fell behind making rent payments. Lin and PC Riverview, the property's landlord, agreed to a repayment schedule to permit Lin to catch up, which he did. In 2013, Lin defaulted on rent payments shortly before vacating the premises. PC Riverview sued both Lin and Cao for $5,003.50, a sum that represented the last month's rent and a small balance from the penultimate month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cao resisted paying that amount, arguing that the 2010 repayment schedule materially\n   modified the contract and discharged her guaranty. The district court agreed and ruled in Cao's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Utah Court of Appeals reversed the district court's order. Relying on the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty, the court of appeals reasoned that merely extending the period within which a tenant could pay its rent did not materially modify the contract. It concluded that Cao was therefore still on the hook for Lin's past-due rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Cao seeks our review of the court of appeals' decision. We conclude that the court of appeals correctly determined that the 2010 repayment agreement did not materially modify the contract and that Cao is not relieved of her responsibilities as guarantor. We affirm the court of appeals' decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 1993, the restaurant at the heart of this matter operated as Royal China Restaurant. Over the next decade, Royal China changed its name, its landlord, and its owner-the latter a number of times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The first change took place in 1997, when the lease was assigned to new tenants. The assignment included a provision imposing late fees and interest if rent was not paid on time. The restaurant's name also changed to Golden Isle Restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 In 2003, the lease was again assigned to a new tenant, L + C. Appellant, L + C's president, Xiao-Yan Cao, personally guaranteed to then-landlord Riverview Properties the \"performance of all covenants, conditions and obligations and duties required of Tenant under said Lease.\" That assignment also provided that, \"[e]xcept as specifically modified, altered, or changed by this Agreement,\n   <em>\n    the Lease and any amendments and/or extensions shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect\n   </em>\n   throughout the Extension Term of the Lease.\" (Emphasis added.) Those amendments and extensions included the 1997 provision detailing late fees and interest on past-due amounts owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Then in 2006, Cao assigned the lease to another tenant, Hong G. Lin. Lin took over the remaining two years of L + C's lease and extended the lease an additional five years-to September 30, 2013. Both Cao and Lin signed the 2006 Lease Extension as guarantors. The 2006 Lease Extension also adopted all terms of the original lease and \"any amendments and/or extensions\"-again including the 1997 provision detailing late fees and interest on past-due amounts owed and Cao's 2003 personal guaranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 A month later, in June 2006, Riverview Properties assigned its \"interest as landlord\" in the strip mall that housed Golden Isle to a new landlord, PC Riverview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 In 2008, Lin fell behind paying rent. This lapse continued over the course of almost two years. In 2010, PC Riverview filed suit against Lin and Cao. PC Riverview sought collection of Lin's missed rent plus late fees-a total of $23,951.28 from Lin and the enforcement of the guaranty against Cao. Cao responded by asking the district court to stanch her potential losses by evicting Lin. PC Riverview opposed Cao's efforts. As part of that opposition, PC Riverview introduced evidence that, given the economic conditions, it would be unable to find another tenant to lease the space Lin's business occupied. Cao also filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court stayed Cao's motion and ordered the parties to mediate the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Unbeknownst to Cao, PC Riverview and Lin crafted a plan that would allow Lin to operate the restaurant while paying PC Riverview what it owed in missed payments, interest, and late fees (the 2010 repayment agreement). Cao learned of that agreement when she was faxed a copy of an executed agreement. The 2010 repayment agreement provided that in addition to the regular monthly payments that the lease required, Lin would make five additional payments to repay past-due amounts. If Lin made each payment when due, PC Riverview agreed to forgive seven-eighths of the late charges that had accrued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 In light of the repayment plan, PC Riverview proposed to Cao that she stipulate to the dismissal of the action without prejudice. Cao refused. She wrote to PC Riverview explaining that she believed this \"side agreement\" entered into \"without [her] input\n   or knowledge\" had \"terminated\" \"her responsibilities as surety on this contract.\" Cao and PC Riverview never reached an accord, and after a year of inaction on the case, the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Meanwhile, Lin stuck to the terms of his new agreement with PC Riverview and eventually paid back all past-due rent and late fees. One might have thought that this would have signaled a happy ending to this story-and, indeed, 2012 came and passed without incident. But in 2013, as Lin's lease was poised to expire, Lin vacated the premises without paying the last month's rent and a small balance he owed for the previous month. PC Riverview sued both Lin and Cao to recover the $5,003.50 that Lin owed (as well as interest and attorney fees). The district court granted summary judgment against Lin, but not Cao. The case against Cao proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 At trial, PC Riverview called the president of its managing member, Grace Mitchell, to testify about the assignment from Riverview Properties to PC Riverview. She identified a document that detailed an \"assignment and assumption of leases that [were] entered into when [PC Riverview] purchased the property\" in 2006. Cao objected to the document being entered into evidence because the signatories on behalf of the seller were not present to testify that they signed the document. Mitchell then testified that she had witnessed Riverview Properties' representatives sign the document. The district court admitted the document into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 In closing argument, Cao contended, first, that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Riverview Properties had ever properly assigned its lease to PC Riverview and, second, that the 2010 repayment agreement materially modified the 2006 contract, thereby releasing Cao as guarantor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 The district court ruled for Cao. It determined that \"there was a material modification when [PC Riverview] had Mr. Lin's rent so far behind and allowed him to make changes and differences to that and didn't notify the guarantor of that.\" The district court reasoned that \"if I'm guaranteeing something and there's changes like that and somebody's way behind and they're letting them catch up and they're not telling me, I would consider that a material modification.\" Because it found that Cao had been released from the guaranty, the district court announced that it did not need to reach the question of whether the lease had been properly assigned to PC Riverview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 PC Riverview appealed the district court's ruling to the Utah Court of Appeals. The court of appeals reversed the district court.\n   <em>\n    PC Riverview LLC v.

The court of appeals thus reasoned that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Cao was not relieved of her obligations as guarantor because the [2010 repayment agreement] was the sole modification to the original lease, and [it] only modified the timing of [Lin]'s payments by extending the time in which past due rent could be paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Cao now seeks our review of the court of appeals' decision.

She also argues that the district court improperly accepted PC Riverview's lease assignment into evidence and that the court of appeals erred when it did not remand for findings on\n   whether her lease had expired or whether she and PC Riverview were ever in privity of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 We have jurisdiction under Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(a).

The 2010 Repayment Agreement Between Lin and PC Riverview Did Not Materially Modify Cao's Guaranty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Cao's primary argument centers on the court of appeals' holding that the district court erred when it characterized the 2010 repayment agreement between Lin and PC Riverview as a material modification that freed Cao from her guaranty. Cao correctly notes that a material modification to a contract will free the guarantor from her guaranty obligations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    DiMeo v. Nupetco Assocs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965586\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/251/\">\n    2013 UT App 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965586\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/251/\">\n    309 P.3d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But \"minor alterations\" to a debtor-creditor agreement \"are not of the nature or degree that would trigger a discharge of [the sureties'] pledge of security under suretyship law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965586\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/251/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Cao lodges two complaints against the court of appeals' conclusion that Lin and PC Riverview did not materially modify their contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 First, Cao avers that the court of appeals ignored facts demonstrating that Lin and PC Riverview had modified the lease through their actions even before they entered into the 2010 repayment agreement. Specifically, Cao claims that PC Riverview materially modified the lease when it (1) allowed Lin to stay in the property even after falling behind in the rent and (2) did not notify Cao that Lin was delinquent in paying rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23 Cao misreads the court of appeals' decision. The court of appeals addressed and rejected Cao's contentions. It noted that the \"rights and obligations of a guarantor are often defined in the terms of the guaranty\" and that \"absent express terms to the contrary, '[t]he basic rights and duties of parties under a guaranty are governed by common law.' \"\n   <em>\n    PC Riverview LLC v. Cao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193420\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1185/\">\n    2016 UT App 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193420\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1185/\">\n    381 P.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting 38 AM. JUR . 2D\n   <em>\n    Guaranty\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 53 (2016) ). Cao's guaranty provides that Cao \"shall be the Guarantor and hereby guarantees performance of all covenants, conditions and obligations and duties required of Tenant under said Lease.\" The court of appeals reviewed the terms of the guaranty and noted that it did not offer Cao what she wanted-notice of Lin's default and the right to consent to modifications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193420\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1185/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Here, the guaranty agreement contained no provisions spelling out particular rights in favor of Cao, such as a right to notice or a bar on extensions or modifications absent her consent.\"). Although the court of appeals could have been more explicit, its opinion reflects that PC Riverview did not modify the parties' obligations under the lease when it permitted Lin to continue to operate the restaurant while falling behind in rent payments. Rather, the court of appeals concluded that the arrangement was consistent with the terms of the lease that Cao agreed to guarantee. Indeed, by asking the district court to find that she had a right to notice of default and an opportunity to intervene, it was Cao who sought to modify the parties' agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 Second, Cao argues that the court of appeals misapprehended the significance of the 2010 repayment agreement when it reasoned that the agreement did not materially modify the terms of her agreement with Lin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court of appeals explained that \"[b]ecause the [2010 repayment agreement] only extended the time for [Lin] to pay past due rent, it was not a material modification of the original agreement\" under section 41 of the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty.\n   <em>\n    PC Riverview\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193420\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1185/\">\n    2016 UT App 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193420\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1185/\">\n    381 P.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 Cao contends that \"an extension of time does materially modify a lease\" and that Lin and PC Riverview's 2010 repayment agreement materially modified her obligations as guarantor, thereby discharging her of her personal guaranty. Cao appears to argue that there are some extensions of time that might materially modify a lease. We need not reach that question, however, because the record makes plain that the 2010 repayment agreement was not a material modification. Before the modification, Cao was potentially responsible for Lin's rent, interest, and late fees. And after the 2010 repayment agreement, Cao could have been responsible for Lin's rent, interest, and late fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 26 Minor alterations to the underlying agreement do not materially alter the risk the guarantor agreed to assume.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiMeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965586\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/251/\">\n    2013 UT App 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965586\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/251/\">\n    309 P.3d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted above, section 41 of the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty recognizes this principle:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   If the principal obligor and the obligee agree to a modification, other than an extension of time or a complete or partial release, ... the secondary obligor is discharged from any unperformed duties pursuant to the secondary obligation: (i) if the modification creates a substituted contract or imposes risks on the secondary obligor fundamentally different from those imposed pursuant to the transaction prior to modification; (ii) in other cases, to the extent that the modification would otherwise cause the secondary obligor a loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF SUR. AND GUAR. \u00a7 41 ( AM LAW INST . 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Prior to its decision in this case, the court of appeals had analyzed section 41 of the Restatement and rejected an argument that a time extension coupled with the ability to make interest-only payments was a material modifications that would relieve a surety of her obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiMeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965586\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/251/\">\n    2013 UT App 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965586\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/251/\">\n    309 P.3d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other courts have reached a similar result.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sheet Metal Workers' Local Union No. 100 Wash., D.C. Area Pension Fund v. W. Sur.

Lin and PC Riverview's 2010 repayment agreement anticipates that Lin will \"follow[ ] [the] payment plan ... on the past due balance of the lease agreement.\" The agreement then sets out the repayment schedule, allowing Lin to repay PC Riverview in five payments by January 1, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29 The terms of the 2010 repayment agreement extend the time within which Lin can pay back \"the past due balance\n   <em>\n    of the lease agreement\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) The 1997 lease-which Cao adopted in her 2003 assignment-contemplated just such a scenario: the terms of that provision provide for \"late fees\" on \"past due amount[s]\" and interest on those amounts. Moreover, the lease permitted PC Riverview to waive the lease's conditions and covenants at its discretion. In other words, PC Riverview had the contractual right to waive the late fees and interest that Lin had allowed to accrue. Thus, the 2010 repayment agreement added no terms to the original agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30 The only argument Cao levels against the court of appeals' application of Restatement section 41 focuses on Cao's purported status as a personal and uncompensated guarantor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We recognize that a number\n   of courts-including ours-have drawn an analytical distinction between compensated and uncompensated sureties.

But Cao does not persuasively argue that this line of cases cannot be harmonized with Restatement section 41. Indeed, Cao supports her argument with cases that recognize that \"[d]ealings between the debtor and the primary obligor which\n   <em>\n    materially modify\n   </em>\n   the terms of the guarantor's undertaking generally result in the discharge of the guarantor's obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    Carrier Brokers, Inc. v.

And after PC Riverview and Lin entered into the 2010 repayment agreement, Cao faced the potential of having to pay rent for the term of the lease, interest, and late payments. The 2010 repayment agreement did not expose Cao to different or new terms than she was already exposed to under the lease. There was no material modification. Without more, the mere extension of time at issue here is \"not of the nature or degree that would trigger a discharge of\" Cao's duties under her agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiMeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965586\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/251/\">\n    2013 UT App 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965586\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/251/\">\n    309 P.3d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . PC Riverview is thus entitled to enforce the guaranty Cao signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   II. The Court of Appeals' Error in Not Addressing Alternative Grounds for Affirmance Was Harmless\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 33 Cao argues that the court of appeals erred when it failed to remand for further factual findings regarding whether her guaranty covered only the original term of the\n   lease and not any extensions. She also contends that the district court erred when it admitted evidence supporting a conclusion that PC Riverview had been properly assigned interests in the lease it sought to enforce and, if that document been excluded, there would have been no evidence she was ever in privity of contract with PC Riverview. Cao specifically argues that, \"[a]lthough the Trial Court is granted great discretion in admitting evidence, [it] abused its discretion in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 34 We begin by noting that the court of appeals did not address these arguments before reversing. When a party raises alternative grounds for affirmance, an appellate court \"\n   <em>\n    may affirm\n   </em>\n   the judgment appealed from\" on \"any legal ground or theory apparent on the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

When the court of appeals reverses, and the appellant has briefed grounds for affirmance that were preserved before the district court, the court of appeals must deal with those arguments by either addressing or remanding them. And although we could remand to the court of appeals so it can have a go at these arguments, we are acutely aware that this is a $5,000 dispute that has now been through a trial, an appeal, and a petition for certiorari. Because we can easily dispose of Cao's alternative grounds, we will address these issues rather than remand to the court of appeals for additional proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 35 Cao's first argument is unpreserved. Our rules spell out a preservation requirement, requiring \"that an appellant's brief contain a 'citation to the record showing that the issue was preserved in the trial court; or a statement of grounds for seeking review of an issue not preserved.' \"\n   <em>\n    Donjuan v.

And, while we are not obligated to perform this work for a party, our review of the transcript did not reveal any mention of this argument. We find it unpreserved, and the court of appeals' failure to address it is therefore harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 37 Cao next argues that the court of appeals should have affirmed because the district court erred when it admitted the document assigning the lease to PC Riverview. Cao contends that if the court had excluded the assignment, there would have been no evidence she was ever in privity of contract with PC Riverview. At trial, Cao pressed her argument that even with the assignment in evidence, there was an insufficient factual basis to find that the lease had been assigned to PC Riverview. Because it ruled for Cao on the material modification issue, the district court opined that it did not need to reach the assignment question. Cao raised this argument before the court of appeals, but the court of appeals neither addressed it nor remanded to permit the district court to resolve the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 38 The court of appeals' decision to not address the argument did not harm Cao because the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the assignment. Rule 901(a) of the Utah Rules of Evidence provides that a \"proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\" The rule further states that \"Testimony of a Witness with Knowledge\" \"satisfies the requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . 901(b)-(b)(1) (describing such evidence as \"[t]estimony that an item is what it is claimed to be\"). Furthermore, \"[p]roper authentication does not require conclusive proof but, instead, requires only that the trial court determine that there is 'evidence sufficient to support a finding' \" that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mitchell testified as to the authenticity of a document that detailed an \"assignment and assumption of leases that [were] entered into when [PC Riverview] purchased the property\" in 2006. Cao objected to the document being entered into evidence because no one from Riverview Properties testified about signing the contract. Mitchell then testified as to the authenticity of Riverview Properties' signatures, claiming that the document was signed in her presence. Cao offered no evidence impeaching Mitchell as a witness or casting doubt as to the credibility of her testimony. The district court admitted the document into evidence based on Mitchell's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 40 Cao is correct that the rule \"places the burden of authenticating the document on the party seeking its admission.\" But PC Riverview met its burden when it offered Mitchell's testimony authenticating the document. Cao offered no evidence suggesting that the assignment was not authentic. The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in admitting a document that a witness testified was what PC Riverview claimed it was. While the court of appeals erred in failing to address Cao's two alternative grounds for affirmance, its error was harmless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   III. PC Riverview May Collect Attorney Fees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 41 PC Riverview asks for \"its Court costs and attorney's fees, including its costs and attorney's fees incurred on appeal.\" Cao's 2003 lease assignment provided that, \"[i]n the event of default under any of the terms of this Agreement or the Lease, defaulting party agrees to pay all costs incurred in enforcing this Agreement on the Lease or any right arising [out] of the breach of either, and including reasonable attorney's fees.\" Cao personally guaranteed the terms of that contract. The 2006 lease assignment to Lin-which Cao also personally guaranteed-contains identical language. The court of appeals awarded attorney fees \"in accordance with the terms of the agreement entered into among [Lin], Cao, and the prior owner.\"\n   <em>\n    PC Riverview LLC v.

Cao does not argue that PC Riverview is not entitled to fees if it prevails before this court.

Here, the 2010 repayment agreement did not materially modify the Lease. While the court of appeals erred in not addressing Cao's alternative grounds for affirmance, the error was harmless. We remand to the district court solely to determine the reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred by PC Riverview in the district court and on appeal.

And it is natural that a party in Cao's position would want that notice so that she could take steps to assist Lin from falling further behind and limit her liability under the guarantee. The court of appeals, however, got it precisely right when it held that Cao did not bargain for these additional protections in the guaranty.
