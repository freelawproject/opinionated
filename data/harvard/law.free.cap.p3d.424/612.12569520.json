He appeals from the December 27, 2016 Judgment and Sentence of the 19th Judicial District Court, Lincoln County. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for action consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    1. Whether plain error review of the District Court's mid-trial dismissal of a felony drug charge and subsequent re-instatement of that charge is appropriate in light of Barrows's right to avoid double jeopardy?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    2. Whether the District Court violated Barrows's right to represent himself?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    3. Whether the District Court's written judgment conforms with its oral pronouncement and statutory IT and prosecution surcharges?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63\n   <strong>\n    Double Jeopardy.\n   </strong>\n   Barrows was charged with three counts of felony assault with a weapon and two counts of felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs. One of the drug possession charges involved possession of methamphetamine and the other involved possession of Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine. In the State's case-in-chief, the investigating officer testified he did not send the Lorazepam he collected to the State Crime Lab. Instead, the officer typed the number located on the pills into \"Drugs.com,\" to identify the pills as Lorazepam. During a recess conference with the parties before the State rested, the District Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   told Barrows that his defense counsel \"has basically made sure that you are not going to be convicted of Lorazepam possession because I am not going to give that as a charge.\" Upon resuming trial, the State rested without putting on any additional evidence. The District Court dismissed that charge, stating \"I will dismiss the Lorazepam case. The Lorazepam charge is\n   off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Barrows then presented his defense and testified on his own behalf. The prosecutor asked Barrows whether he knew there was Lorazepam in the vehicle he was driving when he was arrested. Barrows testified that he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 When settling jury instructions, the State proposed instructions relating to the Lorazepam charge. The court asked if the defense objected to the State's proposed instruction stating, \"I wasn't going to give it but since he admitted it.\" Defense counsel did not object. The court explained, \"And my reasoning for letting that Lorazepam in was I thought there might be some actual evidence but just looking it up on the internet isn't enough in my opinion.\" The jury found Barrows guilty of all charges, including possession of Lorazepam. Barrows was sentenced to twenty years each for the three assault with a weapon charges and five years each for the two criminal possession of dangerous drugs charges. The court ran each felony assault with a weapon sentence concurrently and the felony drug possession sentences consecutively, resulting in a net commitment to the Montana State Prison of 30 years. Barrows contends his Lorazepam possession conviction was improper violating his right to avoid double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66\n   <strong>\n    Self-representation.\n   </strong>\n   On the morning of trial prior to voir dire, Barrows expressed displeasure with the competence of his legal counsel. During inquiry with the court Barrows expressed \"I would like to proceed on my own. I would like to speak on my own behalf.\" The District Court initially appeared to grant that request and advised Barrows, \"you have to follow the general rules. You don't get to just talk to the jury. You have to call witnesses, ask questions, make objections, go through voir dire just the way an attorney would.\" The State then advised that sometimes when a person represents himself, it \"can be a great disadvantage to him.\" Thereafter, the District Court questioned whether Barrows really wanted to represent himself versus preferring to be represented\n   by other legal counsel. Barrows admitted he did not know a thing about the way to proceed. After explaining there were complicated issues in a trial, including voir dire, the District Court indicated it did not believe Barrows was at all prepared to represent himself. Barrows did not disagree. The court then retained his legal counsel's representation. At various later times Barrows reiterated his displeasure with his legal counsel asserting he did not adequately cross examine the State's witnesses, failed to negotiate a favorable plea agreement, and did not call witnesses. Following presentation of the evidence during settlement of jury instructions, Barrows's behavior escalated resulting in the need to restrain and remove him. Although he had agreed to sit quietly with counsel upon\n   his return to the courtroom for closing arguments, he instead requested his counsel leave. The District Court denied the request indicating it did not believe Barrows capable of presenting a closing argument. Following closings, Barrows stood up and yelled out to the jury, \"There was[sic] other witnesses in this case that they did not let testify on my behalf.\" This outburst again resulted in the need to remove Barrows from the courtroom. Thereafter, he participated via videoconferencing and cell phone from a different room in the courthouse. Barrows asserts the District Court violated his right to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67\n   <strong>\n    Questioned Elements of the Judgment.\n   </strong>\n   Barrows raised the following issues with the form of the written judgment which need to be amended to conform it to the District Court's oral pronouncement at sentencing: Strike the sentence on page 2, \"If paroled, Defendant shall comply with the following terms and conditions of parole:\"; to strike the conditions 1-12 and 19-40 which deal with parole and were not mentioned in the sentencing hearing; Paragraph 13(d) imposes an IT fee per count of $50 but should impose one per user of $10 total; Paragraph 13(h) imposes a $500 fee for the prosecution which may only total $100. The State concedes the written judgment does not conform to the court's oral pronouncement of sentence and agrees with the amendment of the written judgment as requested by Barrows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Unpreserved issues alleging violation of a fundamental constitutional right are reviewable under the common law plain error doctrine.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Failure to review this case would result in Barrows serving the five-year Lorazepam drug possession charge portion of his sentence consecutive to all other counts and leave unsettled the fundamental fairness of using Barrows's admission made at trial after that charge had been dismissed.

Barrows asserts\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   establishes a double jeopardy violation under the facts of this case. In\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth of Massachusetts charged Smith with unlawful possession of a firearm in addition to two other charges, and the case proceeded to a jury trial. After the prosecution's case-in-chief, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty on the firearm-possession count pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. Proc. 25(a) (2002), which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-28\">\n   The judge on motion of a defendant or on his own motion shall enter a finding of not guilty of the offense charged in an indictment or complaint or any part thereof after the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction on the charge.

Thus, Barrows contends that \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, \"means a court may not reconsider its decision to dismiss a charge once a midtrial dismissal occurs.\" Barrows also argues that his trial represents the very situation\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    was explicitly aimed at avoiding as after the Lorazepam charge was dismissed Barrows chose to testify and made statements and admissions that he may not have otherwise made.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b615 The State argues the plain language of \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, \"indicates that unless or until the court has dismissed the action or case and discharged the defendant, a trial court retains the authority to reconsider a determination on the sufficiency of the evidence.\" The State asserts the language \"action\" or \"case\" means the entire legal proceeding-not a single charge within such a proceeding. The State argues \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, \"means a decision acquitting a defendant of a single count in a multi-count information necessarily remains nonfinal and can be reconsidered until the completion of the action or case as a whole.\" Thus, the State urges this Court to hold that a judge-directed acquittal is only final and irreversible after the conclusion of the entire proceeding, and prior to that time, the judge retains the authority to reconsider that decision upon a showing of good cause. The State's argument is not persuasive, is inconsistent with this Court's interpretation of \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, and is contradictory.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \u00b616 Dismissal of a charge for insufficiency of the evidence is an acquittal, even if the dismissal is in error.\n    <em>\n     Evans v.

If \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, were interpreted as the State urges, the statute would not permit midtrial acquittals of less than all the charges in multi-count trials as dismissal of anything less than all the counts would not \"dismiss the action and discharge the defendant.\" This Court has applied \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, to authorize midtrial dismissals of single counts in multi-count trials.\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     State v.

As Barrows correctly notes, \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, addresses the evidence being \"insufficient to support a finding or verdict of guilty.\" Clearly, such a finding or verdict is made on each particular charge, not the entire proceeding. In the context of midtrial dismissal of less than all counts of a multi-count trial, \"action\" and \"case\" refer to whether the defendant committed a particular offense, not the entire proceeding. Under the State's argument a judicially-directed midtrial acquittal would not become final and irreversible until a finding or verdict is rendered on all counts of a multi-count trial and the entire judicial proceeding is concluded. This is inconsistent with prior holdings of this Court.\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Gregori\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 1, 18 ;\n    <em>\n     Hegg\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 1, 24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \u00b618 The State asserts Barrows has not met his burden to invoke plain error review, incredibly asserting, \"no miscarriage of justice would occur if this conviction were upheld.\" In this case, the District Court's mid-trial ruling dismissing the Lorazepam drug possession charge or count was a judgment of acquittal. This acquittal must be treated as final unless the availability of reconsideration \"has been plainly established by pre-existing rule or case authority expressly applicable to midtrial rulings on the sufficiency of the evidence.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5967659\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/462/\">\n     543 U.S. at 473\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5967659\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/462/\">\n     125 S.Ct. at 1137\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Section 46-16-403, MCA, did not provide the District Court authority to reopen and reconsider its midtrial ruling as its reconsideration occurred after the charge or count was dismissed. As such, the District Court violated Barrows's right to avoid double jeopardy as he was convicted of an offense of which he had already been acquitted. Barrows is now facing a five-year prison sentence. Punishing Barrows for an unconstitutional conviction is by its nature a manifest miscarriage of justice, is fundamentally unfair and compromises the integrity of the judicial process. We therefore reverse on this issue and remand to the District Court for dismissal of the Lorazepam drug possession charge and vacation of the sentence imposed thereon.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \u00b619\n    <em>\n     2.

A defendant who vacillates at trial between wishing to be represented by counsel and wishing to represent himself could place the trial court in a difficult position: If the court appoints counsel, the defendant could, on appeal, rely on his intermittent requests for self-representation in arguing that he had been denied the right to represent himself; if the court permits self-representation the defendant could claim he had been denied the right to counsel. The requirement of unequivocality resolves this dilemma by forcing the defendant to make an explicit choice. If he equivocates, he is presumed to have requested the assistance of counsel.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <em>\n     Langford\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4563760\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/267/95/#p99\">\n     267 Mont. at 100\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4563760\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/267/95/#p99\">\n     882 P.2d at 493\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

After initially expressing a desire to represent himself, Barrows was advised of the perils of doing so and did not again request to represent himself until all evidence was presented and the court and the parties were in the process of settling jury instructions. Thereafter, in an apparent attempt to delay the verdict, Barrows began exhibiting inappropriate and disruptive behaviors, further evidencing it was not appropriate for him to represent himself. From this behavior, it is clear Barrows was not able or willing to conform his behaviors to abide by rules of the courtroom and was at risk of continuing to abuse the dignity of the courtroom and engage in obstructionist misconduct such that he could not represent himself. The record on a whole demonstrates Barrows's invocation of the right to self-representation was not unequivocal, voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.
