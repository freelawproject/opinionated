The two issues before us are (1) whether the right to reimbursement attaches based on the allegations within the information, or under a more fact-specific inquiry, and (2) where reimbursement is appropriate, whether it applies to all costs incurred in defending against the information. The district court found no genuine dispute of material fact and granted partial summary judgment to Christensen. The court explained that Juab School District's arguments reflect a position expressly rejected by this court in\n   <em>\n    Acor v.

We agree and affirm the district court's grant of partial summary judgment. The district court awarded judgment pursuant to a stipulation entered by the parties.

Christensen, then a fifth-grade teacher for Juab School District, allowed a former student to attend a sleepover with his daughter at his residence. The sleepover was not sanctioned by Juab School District and occurred during Christmas break. The student's presence at the sleepover was not related to Christensen's status as a teacher, but rather because of her friendship with Christensen's daughter. Christensen was subsequently accused of sexually assaulting the student during the sleepover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 On January 2, 2013, the Utah County Attorney's Office filed a criminal information against Christensen. The information included one count of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, pursuant to Utah Code section 76-5-404.1(4). The charge was based on three aggravating elements: (1) \"the accused caused bodily injury or severe psychological injury,\" (2) \"the offense was committed by a person who occupied a position of special trust in relation to the victim,\" and (3) \"the accused caused ... penetration, however slight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813179\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/844/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   76-5-404.1(4)(b), (h), (j). The criminal information relied on Christensen's former teacher-student relationship with the victim as the basis for the \"position of special trust\" enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 During criminal trial proceedings, Christensen moved for a directed verdict as to the aggravating elements of \"position of special trust\" and causing \"bodily injury or severe psychological injury.\" The district court granted the directed verdict, citing both the State's failure to present evidence that Christensen had used his position of special trust to exercise influence over the victim and lack of evidence of any injury. The court allowed the charge of aggravated sexual assault of a child based on the third aggravating factor to go to the jury, which found Christensen not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 In January 2015, Christensen filed suit in district court pursuant to Utah Code section 52-6-201(1) (the Reimbursement Statute) in district court for reasonable attorney fees and costs that Juab School District refused to pay. The Reimbursement Statute provides that public employees \"shall\" be reimbursed for \"reasonable attorney fees and court costs necessarily incurred in the [successful] defense of [an] indictment\" that is \"in connection with or arising out of\" their employment if it is inter alia \"under color of the ... employee's authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813179\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/844/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court granted Christensen's motion for summary judgment and ordered reasonable attorney fees and costs and ultimately entered judgment in an amount based on a prior stipulation by the parties. The defendant, Juab School District, appeals this decision on grounds of incorrect application of the Reimbursement Statute. This court has jurisdiction over this appeal under Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Summary judgment requires a showing \"that there is no genuine dispute as\n   to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" UTAH R.

Juab School District sought a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the statute required an inquiry into the employment-relatedness of the actual events themselves, rather than relying on the allegations within the information. The Utah Rules of Civil Procedure require a \"show[ing] that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\" for summary judgment. UTAH R. CIV. P. 56(a). The facts in this case are undisputed. The only issue in dispute is the proper application of the Reimbursement Statute, which is a question of law. Therefore, the court was correct in issuing summary judgment. We affirm the court's holding that \"the allegation and related enhancement attached [Christensen's] right to reimbursement pursuant to the Reimbursement statute\" and its grant of Christensen's motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 We first address the Reimbursement Statute and our reasoning for rejecting any application that analyzes actual events, rather than allegations in an employment-relatedness inquiry. Next, we apply statutory interpretation principles to the Reimbursement Statute. Finally, we examine how the only prong of the Reimbursement Statute that is at issue in this case-\"under color of authority\"-has been previously defined by this court and apply it to the facts of this case. We hold that Christensen is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I. THE REIMBURSEMENT STATUTE PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE AGAINST \"AN INFORMATION FILED ... IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF\" THE ACTS OF A PUBLIC OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 9 The Reimbursement Statute is \"aimed at protecting public employees from the costs of successfully defending against criminal charges that arise out of public employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Acor v. Salt Lake City Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    2011 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    247 P.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Generally, it provides reimbursement for any public employee's successful defense against employment-related charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The statute includes three separate prongs under which criminal charges arise in employment-related circumstances: (1) \"performance of the employee's duties,\" (2) \"the scope of employment, or\" (3) \"under the color of authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    2011 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    247 P.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The three prongs of the Reimbursement Statute are disjunctive. Therefore, an individual need only prove one prong to recover litigation costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 This court's precedent in\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   holds that the job-relatedness of an employee's conduct \"be evaluated at a high level of generality, without regard to the actual guilt or innocence of the charged party.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    2011 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    247 P.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, it distinguishes \"color of authority,\" the prong on which the plaintiff's claim to reimbursement in this case is based, as distinct from the first two prongs of the Reimbursement Statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27 -28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 It is not guilt or innocence that matters under the color-of-authority prong, but rather the allegations within the criminal information. Juab School District mistakenly argues that a specific inquiry into the employment-relatedness of the district attorney's charges against Christensen is inconsistent with this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   . In that\n   decision, this court reversed the lower court's ruling and granted reasonable attorney fees and costs to the plaintiff, who was acquitted of criminal charges related to the alleged sexual abuse of a former student.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. The school district in that case attempted to show actual guilt by including evidence of an admission of an inappropriate relationship, and a journal account of the relationship, which was excluded at trial based on Fourth Amendment violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. We rejected an argument that evidence excluded at trial, which if admitted would have established actual guilt, should preclude the plaintiff from recovering attorney fees and costs when acquitted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Actual guilt or innocence was irrelevant; the employee only needed to show that the charges were related to her employment and that she was acquitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 Also irrelevant in\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   was consideration of whether the criminal acts \"advance[d] the employer's interests or [were] the kind of activity the employee was asked to perform\"; such reasoning \"would eviscerate the terms and conditions of The Reimbursement Statute, since criminal conduct would rarely if ever be in the employer's interest or at its behest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Rather, the statute \"implies a general inquiry into the causal relationship between the employee's conduct and the underlying criminal charges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 This court held in\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement under both the first and the second prongs of the Reimbursement Statute, because the plaintiff's \"performance of her responsibility of interacting with [the victim] ... gave rise to the criminal charges against her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. We declined to \"permit[ ] a reexamination of an employee's guilt of the underlying criminal conduct under the guise of an inquiry into employment-relatedness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Instead, we concluded that \"[i]f the acts ... giving rise to such charges occur at a time and place of authorized employment, acquittal of those charges generally will suffice to entitle the employee to reimbursement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 The\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   opinion clarifies the interpretation of the three prongs of The Reimbursement Statute under which employees are entitled to reimbursement. While the first two prongs require an inquiry into the \"time, place, and nature of the acts giving rise to the criminal charges,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23, the third prong-under color of authority-suggests a much broader scope, \"requir[ing] only action under\n   <em>\n    color\n   </em>\n   of authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n   <em>\n    State v. Watkins\n   </em>\n   clarifies what constitutes \"color of authority by defining someone in a \"position of special trust\" in terms of a person who occupies \"a position of authority, who, by reason of that position is able to exercise undue influence over the victim.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965067\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/209/\">\n    2013 UT 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965067\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/209/\">\n    309 P.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute,\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-5-404.1(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 Here, Juab School District has engaged in a similarly faulty line of reasoning as pursued by the school district in\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   . In this case, however, rather than asserting evidence of guilt as proof that the acts were outside the performance or scope of employment (the first two prongs), Juab School District has relied on Christensen's innocence, the district's lack of knowledge or approval of the sleepover, and the actual circumstances to attempt to preclude him from recovering reasonable attorney fees and costs. It claims that because the sleepover was not actually related to the \"time, place, [or] nature\" of his employment, Christensen could not have been acting under color of authority.\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    2011 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    247 P.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This, however, is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   and would mean that the more baseless the allegations against public employees are, the less likely it would be that the employee would be able to recover attorney fees and costs for a defense. Such an outcome would not only run contrary to the purpose of the statute, which is to compensate employees for costs incurred in defending against criminal charges from which they are ultimately acquitted, but also run counter to the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 We reject Juab School District's argument that the Reimbursement Statute requires an inquiry into whether the actions of the employee must be actually tied to his or her employment, rather than merely alleged to be so. Rather, we reaffirm our holding in\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   that the Reimbursement Statute only requires that the allegations or charges\n   in the criminal information \"aris[e] out of\" or are \"connect[ed]\" with the defendant's employment.

STATUTORY INTERPRETATION OF THE REIMBURSEMENT STATUTE SHOWS THAT CHRISTENSEN IS ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 Whether Christensen is entitled to reimbursement is a matter of statutory interpretation. We have many \"modes of statutory construction\" that we can use when a statute is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Marion Energy, Inc. v.

We use these tools only when a statute is \"susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations after we have conducted a plain language analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985851\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/267/863/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Juab School District argues that the legislature could have spoken more clearly if it intended to attach a right to reimbursement based on allegations in a criminal information. However, \"it will always be the case that the legislature could have spoken more clearly if it had anticipated the precise question before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Baby E.Z.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    2011 UT 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 75,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    266 P.3d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Lee, J., concurring).

Therefore, the issue of the right to reimbursement in this case can be resolved by the plain meaning of the statute. Although the petitioner invokes an examination of potentially bad public policy of having reimbursement arise out of the charges made by a prosecutor rather than the actual acts of the individual petitioning for reimbursement, we decline to address these policy arguments because the language of the Reimbursement Statute is plain and unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 The Reimbursement Statute first requires that an \"information is filed against[ ] an officer or employee.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 52-6-201(1). Both parties agree that Christensen, at all relevant times, was a Juab School District employee. Juab School District is a governmental entity, and therefore he is a public employee for purposes of the Reimbursement Statute. The State of Utah filed a criminal information against Christensen on December 31, 2012, fulfilling the preliminary requirements of the Reimbursement Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 We next consider whether Christensen is exempt from reimbursement based on any exception within the Reimbursement Statute. The Reimbursement Statute cuts off reimbursement for an \"officer or employee\" who \"is found guilty of substantially the same misconduct that formed the basis for the indictment or information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court in the underlying criminal proceedings granted motions for a directed verdict on both the position of special trust prong and the severe injury prong. Thereafter, the jury found Christensen not guilty, and therefore this exception to recovery does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 The Reimbursement Statute requires that the \"indictment or information [be] quashed or dismissed or result[ ] in a judgment of acquittal\" for a public employee to recover attorney fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It also cuts off reimbursement when the criminal information is \"quashed or dismissed upon application or motion of the prosecuting attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, because the underlying criminal proceedings ultimately resulted in Christensen's acquittal by jury verdict, Christensen fulfills this requirement and the exception for the quashing or dismissal \"upon application or motion of the prosecuting attorney\" does not apply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 Finally, we consider whether the information was filed \"in connection with or arising out of any act or omission of that officer or employee during\" (1) \"the performance of the officer or employee's duties,\" (2) \"within the scope of the officer or employee's employment,\" or (3) \"under color of the officer or employee's authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is the requirement that is at issue in this case, and we find that the information against Christensen was filed \"under color of the ... employee's authority,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , as discussed in the next section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 The Reimbursement Statute provides that, if the foregoing requirements are met, then \"that ... employee shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and court costs necessarily incurred in the defense of\n   that indictment or information\" and \"reasonable attorney fees and costs necessarily incurred ... in recovering the attorney fees and costs allowed under this section,\" including those \"incurred on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 52-6-201(1), (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III.

Salt Lake City School District,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    2011 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    247 P.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   , \"the time, place, and nature of the acts giving rise to the criminal charges\" were held to apply only to the first two prongs of the Reimbursement Statute,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    2011 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    247 P.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, any analysis of the \"time, place, and nature\" of Christensen's acts, or whether \"his interaction with the child on the night of the alleged crime was ... related in any way to his capacity as a teacher\" is irrelevant. The third prong of the Reimbursement Statute, \"under color of authority,\" only requires a showing that the \"criminal charges ... directly arose out of acts alleged to have been committed under color of ... authority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    2011 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    247 P.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 A \"position of special trust\" was used as an aggravating factor under Utah Code section 76-5-404.1(4)(h) (aggravated sexual assault) when Christensen was initially charged in the criminal information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"position of special trust\" as an aggravating factor is related to the \"under color of authority\" prong in the Reimbursement Statute.

Therefore, the court's definition of a \"position of special trust\" in\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   is relevant to our decision today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The charge of aggravated sexual abuse of a child in\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   arose out of allegations that the defendant, while a guest at the home of the victim's father, engaged in inappropriate sexual touching of the victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. The district court concluded that \"the position of trust was simply indicated by a mature adult and a 10-year-old child who had lived in the same home,\" and the jury convicted the defendant as charged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. The court of appeals upheld his conviction based on an interpretation that a \"position of special trust may be\n   established ... 'either by occupying a position specifically listed by statute or by fitting the definition of a position of special trust.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (footnote omitted) (citation omitted). We rejected this interpretation, clarifying that to \"establish aggravated sexual abuse of a child\" by a person who occupied a position of special trust in relation to the victim, the State \"must prove both that the defendant occupied a 'position of authority' over the victim and that the position gave the defendant the ability to 'exercise undue influence' over the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39 (quoting UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-5-404.1(4)(h) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 Because the color-of-authority prong in the Reimbursement Statute arises from the aggravating factor of being in \"a position of special trust,\" we determine whether Christensen allegedly occupied \"a position of special trust\" to determine whether Christensen was acting \"under color of authority.\" This is consistent with our analysis of \"color of authority\" in\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   , which explained that \"criminal charges ... arose out of alleged acts committed under color of ... authority\" where the defendant was \"accused of ... turning her responsibility of interacting with [the victim] ... into an opportunity to sexually abuse,\"\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    2011 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    247 P.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or, in other words, where she occupied \"a position of special trust\"-a \" 'position of authority' over the victim ... that ... gave the defendant the ability to 'exercise undue influence' over the victim,\"\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965067\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/209/\">\n    2013 UT 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965067\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/209/\">\n    309 P.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The probable cause statement in the information filed against Christensen stated that \"the defendant was also the victim's 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   grade teacher last year.\" This implied that not only was he in a position of authority as a teacher at her school, but that he was able to exercise undue influence because of the previous student-teacher relationship, thereby enhancing the allegations against Christensen based on \"a position of special trust\" with the victim. Therefore, the criminal information against him alleging aggravated sexual assault satisfies the third prong in the Reimbursement Statute of being charged \"under color of authority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27 The criminal charges against Christensen arose out of alleged acts \"under color of authority.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965067\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/209/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The charges against him were aggravated based on a \"position of special trust,\" or Christensen's prior teacher-student relationship with the victim. UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-5-404.1(c). An allegation of aggravation based on a \"position of special trust,\" as held in\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   , means that a defendant both \"occupie[s] a 'position of authority' over the victim and that the position gave the defendant the ability to 'exercise undue influence' over the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965067\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/209/\">\n    2013 UT 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965067\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/209/\">\n    309 P.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). While the sleepover was not sanctioned by Juab School District, and while the directed verdict indicates that Christensen did not use his position of authority to abuse the victim, the right to reimbursement does not attach upon analysis of actual events, but rather the alleged events contained within the criminal information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Acor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    2011 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988368\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/404/\">\n    247 P.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting a reexamination of the employee's actual guilt or innocence). The probable cause statement in the information pointed to Christensen's teacher-student relationship with the victim as grounds for an aggravated charge. Further, such criminal information did arise out of allegations of acts made under \"color of authority\" because, as in\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   , they alleged that Christensen used a position of trust to \" 'exercise undue influence' over the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965067\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/209/\">\n    2013 UT 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965067\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/209/\">\n    309 P.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Therefore, the allegations fulfilled this requirement of the Reimbursement Statute, in that they alleged an act under color of Christensen's authority as a teacher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 28 Christensen, as a public employee who was charged and successfully defended against a criminal information \"filed ... in connection with or arising out of [an] act or omission ... under color of the ... employee's authority\" seeks reimbursement for his expenses under the Reimbursement Statute. UTAH CODE \u00a7 52-6-201(1). The Reimbursement Statute outlines clear requirements to attach a right for reimbursement. Christensen meets those requirements, and therefore is entitled to reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29 A criminal information was filed against Christensen, a public employee, and\n   he was not found guilty of substantially the same misconduct.

Finally, the criminal information arose out of alleged acts under color of Christensen's authority as the victim's former teacher.
