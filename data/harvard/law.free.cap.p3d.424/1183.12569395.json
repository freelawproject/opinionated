The legislature voted to enact it. The enrolled bill doctrine-a doctrine that ensures judicial respect for the legislative branch-bars this court from second-guessing the legislature's own declaration that it validly enacted that bill into law. Specifically, the enrolled bill doctrine bars this court\n   from invalidating the enrolled I-940 based on pure speculation about whether the legislature would still have enacted I-940 if it had not passed ESHB\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   3003 first. I-940 passed; the judiciary lacks the power to treat it as \"not passed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 The legislature also passed a conditional bill, ESHB 3003, purporting to prospectively amend I-940 if it passed later-in this case, just a few minutes later. But that conditional, prospective bill violates the explicit language and carefully constructed allocation of legislative power contained in article II, section 1 of the Washington Constitution. That section of the constitution bars the legislature from amending an initiative during the same regular legislative session in which that initiative is first considered. The legislature might certainly disagree with an initiative\n   and \"propose a different one dealing with the same subject\" to the Washington voters. WASH. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 1(a). But the legislature did not make such a \"propos[al]\" in this case, and the constitution does not empower a court to compel the secretary of state to put a nonproposal like ESHB 3003 on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 I would therefore reverse the superior court in part and vacate the writ of mandamus compelling the secretary of state to place I-940 on the ballot. A majority of this court, however, disagrees. For that reason, the decision of the superior court to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the secretary of state to place I-940 on the ballot is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   OVERVIEW OF THE CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Washington State Constitution vests the power to make laws in the legislature. But it also reserves some power to make laws in the people: the power to initiate laws directly, through initiatives to the people for election, and the power to initiate laws indirectly, through initiatives to the legislature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 This case concerns the indirect legislative process. De-Escalate Washington referred I-940, regarding police reform, to the legislature for consideration during the 2018 regular legislative session. Article II, section 1(a) provides that once an initiative is certified to the legislature for consideration, the initiative \"shall be either enacted or rejected without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of such regular session.\" If the legislature fails to enact the certified initiative without change or amendment before the end of the regular session, the initiative \"shall be submitted by the secretary of state to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election\" along with any alternative measure proposed by the legislature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 In this case, the legislature \"enacted\" I-940, and it did so before the end of \"such regular session.\" The parties focus their dispute on the impact of another bill enacted during that same regular session, ESHB 3003. ESHB 3003 was enacted right before I-940. It is entitled \"AN ACT Relating to law enforcement; amending [creating and amending statutes and provisions of I-940]\" and it purports to prospectively amend I-940 if I-940 were to pass in the future. LAWS OF 2018, ch. 10, \u00a7 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first question for this court is whether the legislature enacted I-940 \"without change or amendment ... before the end of [that] regular session,\" since the legislature also enacted ESHB 3003 in the same session. WASH. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 1(a). The second question is whether I-940 must appear on the November ballot either alone or with ESHB 3003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 I think it is clear that I-940 and ESHB 3003 were both validly enacted, despite the fact that ESHB 3003 purported to conditionally and prospectively amend I-940 before I-940 was enacted. I therefore conclude that neither I-940 nor ESHB 3003 may appear on the November ballot. But ESHB 3003 is invalid for a different reason: article II, section 1(a) of our state constitution bars the legislature from amending I-940 during the same session in which it was enacted, and ESHB 3003 purports to do just that. I would therefore vacate the writ of mandamus issued by the trial court to compel the secretary of state to place I-940 on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   INITIATIVE HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 When the Washington State Constitution was ratified in 1889, it vested all legislative power in the legislature. The constitution did not reserve any authority in the people to enact or repeal laws directly. But around that time, a deep-seated distrust of representative legislative bodies began to grow among the American people in general and Washington labor groups in particular.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Berry v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"639366\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash/92/16/#p22\">\n    92 Wash. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20P.%2092\">\n    159 P. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1916). By the early 1900s, the people's distrust for their legislative representatives had developed into a national\n   movement toward establishing the people's right to seek direct legislation through initiatives and to repeal laws through referenda.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20P.%2092\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 By the beginning of the 1900s, that movement toward direct legislation had arrived in Washington. Claudius O. Johnson,\n   <em>\n    The Adoption of the Initiative and Referendum in Washington,\n   </em>\n   35 PAC. NW. Q. 291, 295 (1944). Establishing direct legislation in Washington required a constitutional amendment; this in turn required a supermajority of legislators in the house and senate to pass the amendment. WASH. CONST. art. XXIII. To get these votes, community leaders from the Washington State Grange and other labor\n   organizations began demanding that individual legislative candidates pledge their support for direct legislation and constitutional amendments by the people and for a constitutional amendment securing those rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20P.%2092\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 After more than a decade, these groups gained partial success: they secured direct legislative powers in Washington, but not constitutional amendment powers. The critical years were 1911-12. In 1911, an informal coalition of labor leaders from the Washington State Grange, the Direct Legislation League of Washington, the Washington State Federation of Labor, and the Farmers' Union banded together to coordinate and intensify their efforts to place direct legislative and constitutional amendment powers in the people. Johnson,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 299;\n   <em>\n    For Direct Legislation,\n   </em>\n   SEMI-WKLY. ABERDEEN HERALD , Sept. 28, 1911, at 1; Henry K. Ensley, Operation of the Initiative and Referendum in the State of Washington 7 (1938) (unpublished M.A.P.S. thesis, State College of Washington) (on file with the Washington State Library). During the 1911 legislative session, the coalition \"met each evening [in Olympia,] ... planned its work, reported on duties assigned, [and] centralized efforts where needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Report of the Joint Legislative Committee Covering Session of 1911,\n   </em>\n   THE LAB . J., Jan. 19, 1912, at 1. The coalition sought the recall of judges; the direct election of delegates to the national convention; the direct election of United States senators; the passage of an efficient corrupt practices act; the right of the people to seek constitutional amendments through direct legislation; and most relevant here, the initiative, referendum, and recall powers.\n   <em>\n    For Direct Legislation, supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The coalition failed to persuade the legislature to enact a direct constitutional amendment process. But the coalition mostly succeeded in persuading the legislature to give the people a right to initiate and repeal statutes. Indeed, the 1911 legislature enacted the coalition-backed direct initiative and referendum bill-House Bill 153-with only a few changes. LAWS OF 1911, ch. 42. The legislature (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   increased by a few percentage points the number of signatures needed before an initiative or referendum could be certified to the people for election, (2) reduced the time within which the legislature was barred from amending or repealing an initiative or referendum \"approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon\" from four to two years, and (3) added a proviso that before an initiative could become law or a statute could be repealed by referendum, at least one-third of the voters participating in the general election must cast a vote for or against the measure. Johnson,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 300; WASH. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 1. The coalition \"acquiesced in these amendments, believing they were but slightly if at all detrimental to the successful working of the initiative and referendum.\"\n   <em>\n    Report of the Joint Legislative Committee, supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 The people then ratified House Bill 153, as revised, by popular vote on November 1912. That bill gave the people the authority to initiate and repeal statutes by initiative and referendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 Since that time, legislative authority in Washington has been vested primarily in the legislature. But the constitution also \"reserve[s] to [the people] the power to propose bills, laws, and to enact or reject the same at the polls, independent of the legislature.\" WASH. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 1. The people can enact laws directly through \"initiatives to the people\" or indirectly through \"initiatives to the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 The indirect process provides initiative proponents with three advantages over the direct process: the indirect process allows initiatives to become law sooner; it provides legislative feedback; and it results in two\n   opportunities for the initiative to become law-first, by majority vote of the legislature, and second, if that fails, by majority vote of the people. This case involves that indirect process.\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Proceedings in the Legislature regarding I-940\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 In 2017, a coalition of Washington residents and organizations concerned about police use of deadly force in Washington formed De-Escalate Washington to promote reform. They developed I-940. In order to get I-940 certified, De-Escalate Washington needed to collect 259,622 valid signatures. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 34. They collected 359,895 signatures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After verifying a random sample of those signatures, Secretary of State Kim Wyman determined that the remaining unverified signatures likely contained the requisite number of valid ones.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She therefore certified I-940 to the legislature on January 23, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 The constitution sets the rules for how the legislature must proceed after receiving such a certified initiative; the portions that are especially relevant to this case are highlighted below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Such initiative measures, whether certified or provisionally certified [by the secretary of state],\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     shall take precedence\n    </em>\n    over all other measures in the legislature except appropriation bills\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     shall be either enacted or rejected without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of such regular session.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   If any such initiative measures shall be enacted by the legislature it shall be subject to the referendum petition, or it may be enacted and referred by the legislature to the people for approval or rejection at the next regular election. If it is rejected or if no action is taken upon it by the legislature before the end of such regular session, the secretary of state shall submit it to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The legislature may reject any measure so proposed by initiative petition and propose\n    </em>\n    a different one dealing with the same subject, and in such event both measures shall be submitted by the secretary of state to the people\n   </em>\n   for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election. When conflicting measures are submitted to\n   the people the ballots shall be so printed that a voter can express separately by making one cross (X) for each, two preferences, first, as between either measure and neither, and secondly, as between one and the other. If the majority of those voting on the first issue is for neither, both fail, but in that case the votes on the second issue shall nevertheless be carefully counted and made public. If a majority voting on the first issue is for either, then the measure receiving a majority of the votes on the second issue shall be law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   WASH. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 1(a) (emphasis and underlining added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 As this quote shows, the constitution authorized the legislature to respond to I-940 in four ways. First, the legislature could have enacted I-940 \"without change or amendment ... before the end of [that] regular session\"; in that case, the initiative would become law unless the legislature chose or a sufficient number of residents demanded that the initiative be submitted to the people for a vote. Second, the legislature could have rejected I-940 outright; in that case, the initiative would be placed on the 2018 general ballot. Third, the legislature could have failed to act on I-940; in that case, the inaction would be treated as a rejection, and I-940 would appear on the ballot. Fourth, the legislature could have proposed a different measure dealing with the same subject; in that case, both I-940 and the proposed legislative alternative would appear on the 2018 general ballot in the form specified by the constitution. In sum, unless the legislature enacted I-940 \"without change or amendment ... before the end of [the 2018] regular session,\" the secretary of state would have to place I-940 on the November 2018 ballot, either by itself or with a legislatively proposed alternative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 Both the house and the senate passed I-940-without change or amendment in the\n   body of that passed\n   bill-on the last day of the general session, March 8, 2018. LAWS OF 2018, ch. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 But while 1-940 was still pending, the legislature also considered a separate bill-ESHB 3003-that purported to prospectively amend, clarify, and/or supplement parts of I-940, without a vote of the people, if the legislature later enacted I-940.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ESHB 3003 was introduced in the house on March 6, 2018, and passed the house on March 7-the day before the house passed I-940. LAWS OF 2018, ch. 10. The senate then passed ESHB 3003 and I-940 the next day, March 8, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at chs. 10, 11. The governor signed ESHB 3003 that day, but did not sign I-940 because the constitution does not require gubernatorial action on initiatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, both ESHB 3003 and I-940 became law on the same day (March 8, 2018), though the legislature acknowledges that ESHB 3003 was enacted first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 The primary issues before this court are whether the legislature's enactment of ESHB 3003 immediately prior to and during the same regular legislative session as I-940 violated article II, section 1(a) of the Washington State Constitution, and if so, what are the consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B. Proceedings in the Trial Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 Tim Eyman and state Senator Mike Padden of the 4th Legislative District challenged the validity of I-940 and ESHB 3003 in Thurston County Superior Court via petition for writ of mandamus. They moved for summary judgment, arguing that the legislature violated article II, section l(a)'s requirement that initiatives to the legislature be \"enacted or rejected\" \"without change or amendment\" \"before the end of such regular session\" on the ground that the legislature enacted I-940 at the same time as ESHB 3003, and ESHB\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   3003 was a \"change or amendment\" to I-940. CP at 82-95. They argued this meant that I-940 was never truly enacted \"without change or amendment.\" They sought the remedy of compelling the secretary of state to place both I-940 and ESHB 3003 on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 The trial court agreed with Eyman and Padden that the legislature's decision to enact both I-940 and ESHB 3003 violated the constitution but for different reasons. It ruled that ESHB 3003 was not validly enacted because the constitution requires initiatives to \"take precedence\" over other legislation, and it interpreted that language to mean that I-940 had to be enacted or rejected first, before ESHB 3003 was enacted. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Apr. 20, 2018) (VRP) at 58. As for I-940, the trial court acknowledged that a majority of the legislature passed I-940 \"without change or amendment\" but questioned whether those same legislators would have voted for I-940 if they had voted on it first, before ESHB 3003. The trial court reasoned, \"What we know is when the legislature voted on I-940, every legislator knew that the substantive amendments contained [in] ESHB 3003 had already been approved by both houses and signed by the governor. Votes held in reverse could have resulted in something different.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61. The court said, \"If there had been no ESHB 3003, would there have been enough votes in one or both houses to pass I-940 as written? Would it then have-if it had passed both houses, would the governor have signed it as law?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60. Given this uncertainty about what legislators might have done, the trial court concluded that the legislature did not really pass I-940.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 The trial court therefore issued a writ of mandamus compelling the secretary of state to place I-940-by itself-on the November 2018 ballot. CP at 253. The trial court rejected Eyman and Padden's arguments that ESHB 3003 should appear as an alternative measure on the ballot along with I-940.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court reasoned that the legislature did not propose ESHB 3003 as an alternative measure and\n   ESHB 3003 could not be\n   listed on the ballot as a stand-alone provision, either-it is incomplete and written only as a conditional, prospective amendment to I-940. VRP at 62. ESHB 3003 states that it \"takes effect ... only if ... (Initiative Measure No. 940) ... is passed\" and that it \"is void in its entirety\" \"[i]f the initiative is not approved\" by the legislature. LAWS OF 2018, ch. 10, \u00a7 10. The trial court also did not rewrite ESHB 3003 into a viable stand-alone alternative itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   C. Proceedings in the Washington Supreme Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 The legislature and De-Escalate Washington appealed the trial court's ruling directly to this court. Lieutenant Governor Cyrus Habib moved to intervene, raising arguments similar to those of the legislature and De-Escalate Washington in defense of I-940 and ESHB 3003.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court's commissioner granted the lieutenant governor's motion to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 Eyman and Padden cross appealed from the trial court's refusal to compel the secretary of state to place ESHB 3003 on the November 2018 ballot as an alternative measure to I-940.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 26 The secretary of state did not appeal. She has indicated, however, that she needs a ruling by August 31, 2018, to ensure that ballots are timely delivered to military personnel overseas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 27 We retained this case for direct review, granted the parties' emergency motion for accelerated review, and accelerated the date for oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A.

(Short answers: yes, the enrolled bill doctrine bars this court from overruling the legislature's certification that ESHB 3003 was enacted in a procedurally regular manner; but no, it is unconstitutional because it violates article II, section 1(a) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 28 This case concerns the interpretation of the constitutional requirement that an initiative to the legislature \"shall\" be enacted (or rejected) \"without change or amendment ... before the end of such regular session.\" WASH.

If an initiative is certified to the legislature for consideration, the legislature must enact or reject the initiative \"without change or amendment\" or else the initiative must go to the voters for decision.

We conclude that under the enrolled bill doctrine discussed above, ESHB 3003 was validly enacted by a majority vote in the house and senate.

LAWS OF 2018, chs. 11 (I-940 was enacted during the \"2018 Regular Session\"), 10 (ESHB 3003 was enacted\n   during the \"2018 Regular Session\"). The enrolled bill doctrine allows us to rely on those documents.

Thus, in order to save one specific statute, the governor would have had to veto the entire section, even if he agreed with the legislature that the other statutes should be repealed. We held that such clever formatting was an unconstitutional abuse of the legislative power because it infringed on the veto power of the governor-even though the legislature technically did not violate any specific language in the constitution.

The express language of article II, section 1(a) states that I-940 must be \"either enacted or rejected without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of [the] regular\n   session.\" That language carefully allocates powers between the legislature and the people. The legislature's decision to pass a separate bill that purported to conditionally and prospectively amend the people's initiative during the regular legislative session in which that initiative passed violates article II, section l(a)'s express language and the implied allocation of legislative power that it creates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 63 A majority of this court agrees that ESHB 3003 is void and unenforceable and, hence, that we cannot compel the secretary of state to place it on the ballot.

Dissent in part (Madsen, J.) at 1201; Dissent (Stephens, J.) at 1204 n.3. But we frame the issues that way because the constitution demands that we do so. The enrolled bill doctrine is a constitutional doctrine. It is based on the constitution's implied separation of powers and the judiciary's respect for the legislature as a coequal branch of government. It means that this court cannot invalidate a passed, \"enrolled\" bill just because we disagree with it or think the legislature should have passed it in a different manner. For that reason, we cannot reject the legislature's certification that I-940 was duly enacted; an initiative goes to the ballot only \"[i]f it is rejected or if no action is taken upon it by the legislature before the end of [the] regular session.\" Wash.

The trial court interpreted that \"take precedence\" language to mean that the legislature must act on the initiative before enacting legislation on topics covered by the initiative. VRP at 58. Because ESHB 3003 was enacted before I-904 (albeit in the same day) and both cover the same topic of police reform, the trial court determined that ESHB 3003 was invalid. Because I invalidate ESHB 3003 based on different language in article II, section 1(a), and the allocation of powers it creates, I do not address whether the \"take[s] precedence\" language commands the same result.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    In addition, the legislature contends that it has plenary power to amend 1-940\n    <em>\n     at any time,\n    </em>\n    as long as the amendments do not take effect until after the period for seeking a referendum has expired.

[I-940] cannot be amended within the next two years except by a vote of two thirds of both houses of the legislature.\" CP at 91 (citing Wash. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1(c) ). Because I invalidate ESHB 3003 based on the language of article II, section 1(a) and its allocation of powers between the legislature and the people, I do not address the applicability of section l(c)'s two-year bar on initiatives enacted by the legislature either.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-106\">\n   YU, J.

Dissent (Stephens, J.) at 1206. And I agree that the court \"should not go beyond the four corners of the enacted measures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1207. But without going beyond the \"four comers\" of I-940 itself, there is only an unamended, certified enrolled bill that was accepted by the legislature pursuant to article II, section 1 (a) of the state constitution. Engrossed Substitute House Bill 3003 was enacted separately, outside of the \"four comers\" of I-940. It is only through judicial meddling that the court could conclude I-940 was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   enacted \"without change or amendment ... before the end of' the legislative session. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 73 Justice Stephens' reasoning thus directly implicates the enrolled bill doctrine and falsely asserts that \"the legislature in fact rejected I-940.\" Dissent (Stephens, J.) at 1207. Meanwhile, Justice Madsen contends that \"the legislature has proposed an alternative measure.\" Concurrence/dissent (Madsen, J.) at 1201;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   dissent (Stephens, J.) at 1205 n.5.

Sess. (Wash. 2018) ). Unlike the procedure with I-940, when the legislature rejects an initiative with an alternative proposal, neither the initiative nor the proposal is passed into law before submission to the secretary of state. And\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines \"proposal\" as it is commonly understood, that is, temporary: \"Something offered for consideration or acceptance; a suggestion.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1413 (10th ed. 2014). As a validly enacted statute, Laws of 2018, chapter 11 is not a \"proposal\" offered for consideration described by article II, section 1(a). Laws do not become mere proposals at the discretion of this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 74 Here, regardless of what happened before its passage, I-940 was not rejected,\n   and an alternative was not proposed.\n   I-940 was validly enacted into the 2018 session laws by the state legislature. Questioning the express declaration of the legislature regarding the acceptance of a duly enacted bill is necessarily peeking into the legislative process preceding the enactment of a statute.

The procedural mechanics of the legislature, however novel or peculiar, are fully irrelevant when this court is presented with a certified bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 76 This unprecedented judicial act departs from over a century of state precedent and undermines the stability of our laws. This decision will allow similar challenges not just to other initiatives but to any enrolled law where a question arises about whether the legislature complied with certain constitutional procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 77 Apparently free to disregard the enrolled bill doctrine, creative petitioners might now assert a law should be ripped from the statute books-without a judgment about its constitutionality-if, for example, they can demonstrate an improper vote of yeas and nays occurred pursuant to article II, section 22. Or perhaps a law might be dissolved because the legislature neglected to have a presiding officer of each house in open session properly sign a bill according to article II, section 32. A petitioner might soon ask this court to retract an enacted law because it was not introduced\n   at least 10 days before the final adjournment of the legislature as required by article II, section 36, or entered into the proper legislative journal, if requested, pursuant to article II section 21. According to the precedent set by the split opinion in this case and the reasoning in Justice Stephens' dissent, this court is willing to invade the exclusive province of the legislature and allow petitioners to corrupt the finality and deference this court usually affords to the laws bearing the certified seal of Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 78 The result in this case upends the balance of power between the branches of government when it asserts that valid law is \"not a law\" by subjecting it to the uncertainties of the ballot. In this instance, the danger of breaching the separation of powers is less about upholding the will of the legislature than it is about keeping the court within its realm of constitutional authority. This court violates the trust of the people of Washington when it frustrates the finality of the people's initiative to the legislature and neglects to protect the sanctity of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   MADSEN, J. (concurring/dissenting)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 79 I agree with the lead opinion to the extent that it holds Engrossed Substitute House Bill (ESHB) 3003 amended Initiative 940 (I-940) in the same session in which the legislature enacted I-940. In my view, however, because I-940 was not enacted \"without change or amendment\" in the same regular session, it must be certified to the people for a vote as provided in article II, section 1(a) of our state constitution. Accordingly, I disagree with the lead opinion that neither measure should be placed on the November ballot. The governing constitutional provision states in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   (a) Initiative: The first power reserved by the people is the initiative. Every such petition shall include the full text of the measure so proposed. In the case of initiatives to the legislature and initiatives to the people, the number of valid signatures of legal voters required shall be equal to eight percent of the votes cast for the office of governor at the last gubernatorial election\n   preceding the initial filing of the text of the initiative measure with the secretary of state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Initiative petitions shall be filed with the secretary of state not less than four months before the election at which they are to be voted upon, or not less than ten\n   days before any regular session of the legislature.

If such petitions are filed not less than ten days before any regular session of the legislature, he shall certify the results within forty days of the filing. If certification is not complete by the date that the legislature convenes, he shall provisionally certify the measure pending final certification of the measure.\n   <em>\n    Such initiative measures,\n   </em>\n   whether certified or provisionally certified, shall take precedence over all other measures in the legislature except appropriation bills and\n   <em>\n    shall be either enacted or rejected without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of such regular session.\n   </em>\n   If any such initiative measures shall be enacted by the legislature it shall be subject to the referendum petition, or it may be enacted and referred by the legislature to the people for approval or rejection at the next regular election.\n   <em>\n    If it is rejected or if no action is taken upon it by the legislature before the end of such regular session, the secretary of state shall submit it to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election.

Instead, I agree with Justice Stephens's dissent, which notes that \"the plaintiffs make no claims of invalid or unconstitutional action\" and, thus, \"[c]ontrary to the lead opinion's approach, we ... need\n   not decide whether any legislative enactment was invalid or unconstitutional.\" Dissent (Stephens, J.) at 1207. Further, I agree that \"the legislature validly passed both I-940 and ESHB 3003.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20P.%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nowhere in the above quoted language from article II section 1(a) does it indicate that legislative attempts to amend an initiative petition violates the constitution. Rather, such action triggers specific consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 81 I part ways with the dissents by Chief Justice Fairhurst and Justice Stephens to the extent they would require that both I-940 and ESHB 3003 be placed on the ballot. I acknowledge that in the usual circumstance-where the legislature has proposed an alternative measure addressing the same subject matter as an initiative petition-placing both measures on the ballot would be the appropriate result under article II, section 1(a). But in this instance, ESHB 3003, by its express terms, voids itself if 1-940 is placed on the ballot. ESHB 3003 provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   This act takes effect June 8, 2018, only if chapter ... (Initiative Measure No. 940), Laws of 2018, is passed by a vote of the legislature during the 2018 regular legislative session and a referendum on the initiative under Article II, section 1 of the state Constitution is not certified by the secretary of state.

Thus, in this circumstance, only I-940 should be placed on the ballot as required by article II, section 1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 82 In sum, in result I agree in part with the majority that ESHB 3003 does not go on the November ballot. I agree in part with the noted dissents that I-940 does go on the November ballot. Accordingly, the writ of mandamus, \"directing the Secretary of State to certify onto the 2018\n   general election ballot ... Initiative 940,\" should be affirmed.

They gathered sufficient signatures to require the secretary of state to certify the measure to the legislature for consideration during the 2018 legislative session. Discussions ensued, and a compromise bill amending and supplementing I-940 was introduced as ESHB 3003.

The Legislature Did Not Enact I-940 without Change or Amendment during the 2018 Legislative Session, so the Initiative Measure Must Be Placed on the November 2018 General Election Ballot\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6 96 To adopt a proposed initiative, article II, section 1(a) requires the legislature to enact it \"without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of such regular session.\" This is the only instance in which the initiative becomes law without further action. As an opinion of the attorney general in 1971 recognized, a natural reading of the constitutional language indicates that any alteration of an initiative is effectively a legislative rejection of the measure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 5, at 3 (\"In\n   light of that language ['without change or amendment by the legislature'] any alteration in the text of an initiative to the legislature would therefore of necessity constitute a rejection of the initiative and a proposal of an alternative measure on the same subject.\"). Here, of course, the legislature did not alter the text of I-940 in the bill setting forth the initiative measure. Instead, it introduced a separate bill, ESHB 3003, which expressly amended the measure. The legislature and De-Escalate Washington believe this different approach makes all the difference. I do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6 97 Article II, section 1(a) is not concerned with how the legislature styles or sequences the bills it considers. We should not imagine that the drafters of our 7th Amendment failed to anticipate creative approaches to legislating or meant to restrict the \"without change or amendment\" clause to a single vote on a single bill. There is no language in the constitutional text that requires an isolated bill-by-bill analysis. As in all matters of constitutional interpretation, we should be guided by plain language and common sense. The inescapable reality is that the 2018 legislature did not in fact adopt I-940 \"without change or amendment\" but, rather, adopted the initiative in one bill and adopted amendments to the measure in another. This was tantamount to rejection of the measure as proposed, necessitating a vote of the people in the next general election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6 98 This result is clear-unless we accept the argument that article II, section 1(a) allows for amendments to an initiative during the same session in which an initiative is enacted. The legislature and De-Escalate Washington make that argument, but I agree with the lead opinion that it is wrong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Br. of Wash. State Legislature at 14-15; De-Escalate Wash.'s Opening Br. at 13-14. Following established grammatical rules, the clause \"before the end of such regular session\" embraces the clause \"without change or amendment by the legislature,\" meaning that the legislature cannot in the same session adopt but amend an initiative measure and thereby avoid giving the people\n   their say at the ballot box.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   lead opinion at 1192-93. A contrary reading of article II, section 1(a) would allow the legislature to circumvent the constitutional promise of ballot access by \"passing\" while immediately altering an initiative measure in a single session. This is not faithful to constitutional design. In short, to enact \"without change or amendment by the legislature before the end of such regular session\" means just that.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6 99 I disagree with the lead opinion, however, as to the result of the legislature having amended I-940 during the 2018 regular session. The lead opinion concludes that the amending bill, ESHB 3003, \"violates\" article II, section 1(a) and is therefore invalid. Lead opinion at 1192-93. It thus strikes the amendments to 1-940 and treats the initiative measure as having been enacted without change or amendment. This is a fiction at odds with what the legislature actually did, and it achieves a result that leaves the people without their say. I would not question whether I-940 or ESHB 3003 were validly enacted. Instead, accepting at face value the sum total of the legislature's actions on I-940 and ESHB 3003, I would recognize the effect of article II, section 1(a) on those actions. As the attorney general's opinion in 1971 observed, when an initiative measure is enacted with any alteration, this constitutes a rejection of the proposed initiative and the proposal of an alternative. 1971 Op. Att'y Gen.

That is what should happen here.\n   II. By Enacting Both ESHB 3003 and I-940 in the 2018 Legislative Session, the Legislature Created a Different Measure on the Same Subject as I-940, Which Must Also Be Placed on the November 2018 General Election Ballot\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6 100 The superior court issued a writ of mandamus directing the secretary of state to place I-940 on the November 2018 general election ballot. However, the court declined to also require that the version of I-940 amended by ESHB 3003 (so-called I-940B) be placed on the ballot as an alternative measure. The court found it significant that ESHB 3003 was not a stand-alone bill and that the legislature did not intend it as an alternative to I-940.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VRP at 62 (\"I am compelled by the fact that, in fact, that was offered as an amendment to the legislation when it was before the legislature, and the legislature said, no, specifically, this is not an alternative to I-940.\"). I would modify this aspect of the writ of mandamus and direct the secretary of state to place both I-940 and I-940B on the November 2018 general election ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6 101 Article II, section 1(a) is not concerned with whether the legislature regarded ESHB 3003 as creating an alternative to I-940. The term \"alternative measure\" does not appear in the text. The constitutional provision operates not upon what the legislature intended but on what it in fact did. While the legislature, in its brief, cites past instances in which it has expressly proposed an alternative measure to an initiative, article II, section 1(a) does not require such express direction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It has long been clear that any legislative measure enacted on the same subject as an initiative certified to the\n   legislature will be regarded as an alternative measure, even if the overlap is inadvertent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Revenue v. Hoppe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1130145\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/82/549/#p557\">\n    82 Wash.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=512%20P.2d%201094\">\n    512 P.2d 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973) (concluding statute conflicted with proposed initiative measure despite any legislative intent \"to subvert the initiative power of the people\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1971 Op.

Dorsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20A.2d%20908\">\n    60 A.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Maine court held that an initiative and a separate bill enacted during the same legislative session were alternative or substitute measures, regardless of the legislature's intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20A.2d%20908\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20A.2d%20908\">\n    at 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e are not concerned, as we have tried to point out above, with how the legislature may have regarded [the substitute bill]. We must decide only what it is in fact.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \u00b6 103 Here, all parties agree that ESHB 3003 and I-940 deal with the same subject. The legislature admitted as much in its answer to the plaintiff's complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CP at 69 (Legislature Answer to First Am. Compl., para. 118). It is also undisputed that ESHB 3003 expressly amends I-940, albeit prospectively. The main argument against concluding that the resulting measure, I-940B, is an alternative to I-940 seems to be that ESHB 3003 is not self-contained, so it would be necessary for this court or the secretary of state to \"draft a new piece of legislation altogether.\" Reply Br. of Cyrus Habib at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opening Br. of Wash. State Legislature at 31 (arguing court would need \"to essentially draft new legislation by stitching together ESHB 3003 and 1-940\"). I find this argument unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b6 104 First, there is nothing novel in having amendments to an initiative be proposed in a separate bill. Over 40 years\n   ago, the attorney general addressed a question about this very possibility, asking, \"Can the legislature pass a statute relating to a particular section, or sections, in the initiative so as to make corrections to an initiative that has been submitted to the legislature?\" 1971 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 5, at 4. He properly regarded this two-step approach as being no different from legislative action directly amending a proposed initiative: \"We would answer this question in essentially the same manner as question (1).... Any such 'corrective' legislation would constitute an alternative proposal which would have to be submitted to the voters along with the original initiative itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20A.2d%20908\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   \u00b6 105 Nor should we worry that additional drafting is necessary to create the alternative measure the secretary of state must place on the ballot alongside I-940. The 2018 legislature's actions are complete. Had there been no challenge, the code reviser's office would have performed its usual function of incorporating the provisions of I-940 and ESHB 3003 into the Revised Code of Washington. No more is involved in preparing so-called I-940B for the November 2018 general election ballot. Notably, the secretary of state has not protested or sought further guidance from this court. I-940B is properly understood as a different legislative measure on the same subject as I-940. By the clear direction of article II, section 1(a), it must be placed on the November 2018 general election ballot for a vote of the people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   III. The Enrolled Bill Doctrine Is Not Implicated by a Judicial Decision Declaring the Constitutional Effect of Legislative Action and Directing the Secretary of State To Act Consistent with the Constitution\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \u00b6 106 The legislature, De-Escalate Washington, and intervenor, Lieutenant Governor Cyrus Habib, argue that granting a writ of mandamus in this case would run afoul of the enrolled bill doctrine. They criticize the superior court for violating this doctrine by looking behind the face of the\n   bills passed to question legislative procedures or intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Br. of Wash. State Legislature at 24-26; De-Escalate Wash.'s Opening Br. at 12; Opening Br. of Cyrus Habib at 8-20. While their concerns are valid, judicial action that gives effect to the plain language of article II, section 1(a) does not implicate the enrolled bill doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b6 107 The enrolled bill doctrine prohibits judicial meddling into legislative processes. Thus, we do not inquire into the procedures or actions preceding the enactment of a statute that is \" 'properly signed and fair upon its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wash. State Grange v. Locke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875621\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/153/475/#p500\">\n    153 Wash.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499-500,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20P.3d%209\">\n    105 P.3d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Schwarz v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120419\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/85/171/#p175\">\n    85 Wash.2d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=531%20P.2d%201280\">\n    531 P.2d 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975) ). I agree with the legislature and the lieutenant governor that much of the superior court's reasoning implicates this doctrine. For example, questioning whether legislators would have voted for I-940 had ESHB 3003 not already passed seems an impermissible inquiry. At the same time, asking whether the legislature intended to create an alternative proposal to I-940 when it passed ESHB 3003, including by looking at rejected amendments to the bill, also invites judicial peek-a-boo into legislative\n   processes. We should not go beyond the four comers of the enacted measures, or question the validity of the legislature's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b6 108 Properly applying article II, section 1(a) to the facts of this case does not implicate the enrolled bill rule. Article II, section 1(a) simply requires us to consider the constitutional effect of the measures enacted. We need not consider the sequence or timing of the legislative action, or the intent of the legislators who voted on I-940 and ESHB 3003. To repeat the refrain: we care only what the legislature in fact did. Article II, section 1(a) dictates the constitutional effect of its actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b6 109 Contrary to the lead opinion's approach, we also need not decide whether any legislative enactment was invalid or unconstitutional. As noted, the plaintiffs make no claims of invalid or unconstitutional action. This case is\n   thus unlike those in which legislative action is challenged as exceeding constitutional limits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lee v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456849\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/185/608/\">\n    185 Wash.2d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=374%20P.3d%20157\">\n    374 P.3d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (invalidating initiative that sought to force constitutional amendment). We should accept that the legislature validly passed both I-940 and ESHB 3003 and recognize the clear constitutional result of that action under article II, section 1(a). Because the legislature in fact rejected I-940 as proposed and enacted a different measure on the same subject, both I-940 and I-940B \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be submitted by the secretary of state to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election.\" WASH. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 1(a) (emphasis added). A writ of mandamus is appropriate to compel this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerberding v. Munro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452298\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/134/188/#p195\">\n    134 Wash.2d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20P.2d%201366\">\n    949 P.2d 1366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (\"Mandamus will lie to compel a state officer to undertake a clear duty.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   IV. Article II, Section 1(a) Does Not Require a Finding that the Legislature Made a \"Palpable Attempt at Dissimulation\" in Order to Decide the Constitutional Effect of Legislative Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   \u00b6 110 The above analysis does not follow the legislature's proposed test extrapolated from\n   <em>\n    Washington State Legislature v. Lowry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1547131\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/131/309/\">\n    131 Wash.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20P.2d%20885\">\n    931 P.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). That test, which would have us query whether legislative action enacting and amending a proposed initiative reflects a \" 'palpable attempt at dissimulation' \" finds no home in article II, section 1(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 320,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20P.2d%20885\">\n    931 P.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The constitutional text does not make any distinction between valid and invalid legislative votes on an initiative-an inquiry that itself risks running afoul of the enrolled bill doctrine. Rather, it tells us what happens\n   whenever the legislature amends a proposed initiative during the same session in which it enacts the measure. This action constitutes a rejection of the initiative measure, and the amended version constitutes a different measure on the same subject. Both measures must then be placed on the next general election ballot for a vote of the people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   \u00b6 111 The test the legislature would have us employ arose in different circumstances and serves different purposes. The\n   <em>\n    Lowry\n   </em>\n   decision effectuates the implied constitutional premise that one branch of government may be restrained when a natural consequence of its actions is to circumvent the powers reserved to another branch.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1547131\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/131/309/\">\n    131 Wash.2d at 320-21, 330-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20P.2d%20885\">\n    931 P.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, there is no need to inquire into whether the legislature has upset the balance of power between the legislature and the people. Such an inquiry might serve to draw attention to the purpose behind article II, section 1(a) to preserve the people's initiative power, but there is no need to look beyond the plain constitutional language to discern the result that necessarily flows from the legislature's failure to enact a proposed initiative measure without change or amendment. The measure, along with any different legislative measure dealing with the same subject, must be placed on the next general election ballot. Thus, we are not concerned with restraining the legislature's power, but recognizing the result of its actions consistent with article II, section 1 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6 112 Article II, section 1(a) provides only one instance in which a certified initiative measure becomes law by vote of the legislature alone: that is, when it is enacted without change or amendment by the legislature in the session in which it is certified. That did not happen here. By enacting both I-940 and ESHB 3003 amending I-940, the 2018 legislature effectively rejected I-940 and proposed a different measure on the same subject. By the clear directive of\n   article II, section 1(a) of the Washington State Constitution, both alternatives must be placed on the November 2018 general election ballot.
