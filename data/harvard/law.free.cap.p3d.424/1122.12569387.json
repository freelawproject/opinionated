Because we conclude that trial counsel did not perform deficiently in failing to raise the specific federal and state constitutional issues that Brocksmith now raises on appeal, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Brocksmith was driving northbound on Wall Avenue in Ogden when his SUV veered into the southbound lanes and collided with another vehicle, inflicting serious bodily injury on the vehicle's driver and a passenger. After Brocksmith admitted that he had used \"marijuana over the weekend,\" the investigating officer obtained a search warrant to\n   conduct a blood draw. Blood analysis revealed the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and THC metabolite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The State subsequently charged Brocksmith with two violations of Utah Code section 58-37-8(2)(g)-(h)(ii) (the Measurable Amount Statute), which makes it a crime for a person to operate a motor vehicle in a negligent manner causing serious bodily injury or death while knowingly and intentionally having a measurable amount of a controlled substance in the person's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 During trial, Brocksmith orally moved to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that the Measurable Amount Statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied under both the United States and Utah Constitutions. Brocksmith did not submit a memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss nor did he provide any legal authority to bolster his contention. In fact, when the trial court asked him to \"elaborate a little further\" by pointing to the \"elements of the code section that [he found] unconstitutional,\" Brocksmith could not identify the sections of the code at issue or any specific constitutional basis for his argument. Instead, he noted only that the statute does not provide a \"causal nexus\" \"between the fact that there's some trace amount of substance in someone's blood and [the fact] that they caused an accident.\" In other words, \"but for this substance allegedly being in Mr. Brocksmith's system, there would be no criminal count here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, ruling that the Measurable Amount Statute is constitutional both on its face and as applied to Brocksmith. The jury convicted Brocksmith on both charged counts. Brocksmith timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Brocksmith contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to adequately raise federal and state constitutional challenges to the Measurable Amount Statute. \"When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review and we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Layton City v.

But Brocksmith maintains that he preserved his third issue in which he argues that the Measurable Amount statute is unconstitutional because it \"lacks a causation element and [therefore] creates a presumption of guilt.\" We begin by analyzing whether Brocksmith preserved the causation argument. Because we conclude that he did not, we next consider whether Brocksmith's trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to raise the constitutional challenges that Brocksmith asserts on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I. Preservation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Brocksmith contends that the third issue-whether the Measurable Amount statute is unconstitutional because it lacks a causation element-was preserved because he argued to the trial court that the statute lacked a \"causal nexus.\" We conclude that this issue was not properly preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 \"As a general rule, claims not raised before the trial court may not be raised on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

When pressed by the trial court, Brocksmith failed to point to any relevant legal authority to support his argument that criminal statutes must include a causation element. Indeed, he did not even identify any specific constitutional provision that might impose such a requirement. Such a cursory mention of the issue did not provide the trial court with \"an opportunity to address a claimed error and, if appropriate, correct it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8349380\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/164/366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation simplified).

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 Brocksmith contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel to the extent that his trial counsel failed to raise three constitutional challenges to the Measurable Amount Statute. Specifically, Brocksmith claims that the Measurable Amount Statute violates Utah's uniform operation of laws provision, that it is unconstitutionally vague, and that it is unconstitutional because it lacks a causation element. We reject his argument that any reasonably competent trial counsel would have raised these novel issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 Under\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Certainly, there need not necessarily be a case on point declaring the particular statute at issue unconstitutional; indeed, one can envision situations in which a statute would clearly violate established constitutional principles, even if no court has yet applied those principles to the statutory language in question. Where the statute clearly violates established constitutional principles, any reasonable attorney would be expected to challenge its validity. But where the statute is not clearly unconstitutional, a defendant is not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel merely because his attorney does not advance every conceivable non-frivolous argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 In this case, the arguments Brocksmith advances regarding the constitutionality of the Measurable Amount Statute are truly novel.
