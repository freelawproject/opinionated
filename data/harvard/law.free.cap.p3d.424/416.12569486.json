For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that when a party timely files a notice of change of judge as a matter of right under Rule 10.2(b), a court cannot inquire beyond the required avowals into the reasons for the notice. Accordingly, we accept special action jurisdiction, reverse the superior court, vacate the evidentiary hearing, and remand to the Gilbert Municipal Court to reassign this case to a new judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 A Gilbert prosecutor filed a timely notice of change of judge as a matter of right in the Gilbert Municipal Court pursuant to Rule 10.2. The notice included the avowals required by Rule 10.2(b), but counsel for the defendant objected, claimed that the notice was for an improper purpose under Rule 10.2(b)(2), and requested a hearing. The originally-assigned judge transferred the case to the presiding judge for a notice of change of judge hearing. The prosecutor objected to a hearing and argued that the notice should be automatically granted. Counsel for the defendant argued that a hearing was proper to determine whether the notice was for an improper purpose and requested discovery\n   about the prosecutor's history of notices. The presiding judge reviewed the parties' filings and set the matter for an \"evidentiary hearing\" on the notice of change of judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Petitioner then sought special action review in the superior court and requested a stay of the evidentiary hearing. The prosecutor again argued that it was improper for the presiding judge to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the notice of change of judge as a matter of right was filed for an improper purpose. The superior court accepted jurisdiction but denied relief. The superior court reasoned that an evidentiary hearing was appropriate because the defendant had objected on the ground that the notice was made for an improper purpose under Rule 10.2(b), and the rule \"contemplates that the presiding judge should make a determination on the matters of a claim under Rule 10.2 that a notice was improper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Petitioner then sought special action review in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Special action jurisdiction is appropriate when a party lacks \"an equally plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal,\" Ariz. R.P. Spec. Act. 1(a), and \"the case presents an issue of statewide importance and first impression,\"\n   <em>\n    Hamblen v.

Accordingly, we accept special action jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Petitioner argues that a court may not hold a hearing to inquire into a party's reasons for requesting a change of judge as a matter of right under Rule 10.2(a)(1). The defendant responds that a court may inquire whether the assigned prosecutor is abusing the rule when defendant objects to the change of judge. For the following reasons, we agree with Petitioner, vacate the order setting an evidentiary hearing, and remand for reassignment to a new judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 \"Each side in a criminal case is entitled to one change of judge as a matter of right.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.2(a)(1). Historically, the procedure under Rule 10.2 was \"summary and automatic.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. City Court of Tucson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473770\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/150/99/#p102\">\n    150 Ariz. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473770\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/150/99/#p102\">\n    722 P.2d 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 270 (1986). Before 2001, a party to a criminal case could invoke that procedure simply by filing a \" 'Notice of Change of Judge' signed by counsel, if any, stating the name of the judge to be changed.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.2(b) (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 However, in 2001, the Arizona Supreme Court promulgated \"experimental\" amendments to Rule 10.2. The amendments were intended to address \"abuse of this rule\" and \"ensure a party's right to have a matter heard before a fair and impartial judge without the necessity of divulging details that could cause needless embarrassment and antagonism or showing actual bias which may be difficult to prove.\" Court Comment to Experimental 2001 Amendments to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.2. These amendments added the following requirement for a Notice of Change of Judge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The notice shall also include an avowal that the request is made in good faith and not:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1.

For the purpose of using the rule against a particular judge in a blanket fashion by a prosecuting agency, defender group or law firm ( [\n   <em>\n    City Court of Tucson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473770\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/150/99/#p102\">\n    150 Ariz. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473770\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/150/99/#p102\">\n    722 P.2d 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   6.

R. Crim. P. 10.2(b) (effective July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002). The pertinent provisions of the rule have been restyled, but remain the same in all material respects today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.2(a)(1) and (b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 9 The question presented here is whether the 2001 and subsequent changes to Rule 10.2 altered the pre-existing \"summary and automatic\" nature of a notice of change of judge as a matter of right to allow a court to inquire beyond the required avowals into whether a notice is filed for a proper purpose. For the reasons that follow, the answer is no; the \"summary and automatic\" nature of the rule is explicit and continues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 10 First, the text of the rule as it has existed since 2001 provides no authority for a court to inquire into the reason for a notice of change of judge. Instead, the rule provides that if a notice is timely filed and contains the required avowals, \"the judge should proceed no further in the action\" and \"the presiding judge must immediately reassign the action to another judge.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.2(b)(3) and 10.2(d)(2). Allowing either the original judge or the presiding judge to do anything other than \"immediately\" reassign the case is inconsistent with the rule's plain language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 11 Second, in\n   <em>\n    Bergeron ex rel. Perez v. O'Neil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152610\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/640/#p647\">\n    205 Ariz. 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647-48, \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152610\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/640/#p647\">\n    74 P.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 959-60 (App. 2003), the court examined the \"experimental\" amendments to Rule 10.2 and found that the trial court's inherent authority does not include determining the propriety of reasons for a Rule 10.2 notice. As discussed in\n   <em>\n    Bergeron\n   </em>\n   , the Arizona Supreme Court carefully crafted Rule 10.2 to avoid judicial involvement in notices, leaving potential sanctions for professional misconduct as the safeguard against misuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . (noting \"that the supreme court received the benefit of extensive debate and thereafter so carefully set forth the remedies for potential abuse of the rule ...\"). Thus, a \"lawyer who files a notice of change of judge in any of the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 10.2(b) has abused the rule and may face discipline for violating the lawyer's professional responsibilities....\" Court Comment to Experimental 2001 Amendments to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 12 None of the changes to Rule 10.2 promulgated after\n   <em>\n    Bergeron\n   </em>\n   suggest a different result. In enacting the 2004 Amendments to Rule 10.2, the Arizona Supreme Court commented that the changes were intended to preserve the historical benefits of the peremptory change of judge as a matter of right and keep courts out of evaluating the propriety of Rule 10.2 notices:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Arizona's rule permitting peremptory change of judge has historically been viewed as \"salutary\" on the grounds that \"it is not necessary to embarrass the judge by setting forth in detail the facts of bias, prejudice or interests ... nor is it necessary for judge, litigant and attorney to involve themselves in an imbroglio which might result in everlasting bitterness on the part of the judge and the lawyer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Court Comment to the 2004 Amendments to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Anonymous v.

The corresponding amendments to the Arizona Rules of Professional Conduct provide that \"fil[ing] a notice of change of judge under Rule 10.2, Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure, for an improper purpose, such as obtaining a trial delay or other circumstances enumerated in Rule 10.2(b)\" is \"professional misconduct.\" Ariz. R. Sup. Ct. 42, ER 8.4(g). As with the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the amendment to ER 8.4 was promulgated \"to address abuse of Rule 10.2 while preserving the traditional benefits of the right to peremptory change of judge.\" Court Comment to 2004 Amendment to ER 8.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 14 Thus, if a party or a judge has reason to believe that the rule is being\n   abused, the remedy is to report the abuse to the State Bar.\n   <em>\n    Bergeron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152610\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/640/#p647\">\n    205 Ariz. at 651-52, \u00b6 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152610\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/640/#p647\">\n    74 P.3d at 963-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Requiring a party to appear at an evidentiary hearing and explain why she filed the notice eliminates the traditional benefits of the peremptory change of judge, is not expressly or implicitly contemplated by Rule 10.2, and violates the imperative of Rule 10.2(d)(2).
