Footnote 1 explains the scope of this Court's holding. Because it is important to define precisely the question this Court decided and the question we declined to decide, we deny the State's request to remove the footnote. We have, however, amended the footnote to clarify that the State's invitation to reframe the issue came in response to questions it received at oral argument.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-10\">\n   JUSTICE PEARCE, opinion of the Court:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 1 A Utah Highway Patrol Trooper stopped a vehicle for an improper lane\n   change and asked both the driver and George Matthew Martinez, a passenger, for identification. The trooper ran a warrant check and learned that Martinez had an outstanding arrest warrant. The officer searched Martinez incident to his arrest and discovered a glass pipe with methamphetamine residue inside. The State charged Martinez with possession of a controlled substance, but the district court granted Martinez's motion to suppress the evidence. The district court concluded that the trooper had violated Martinez's Fourth Amendment rights when he asked to see Martinez's identification and ran a warrants check without reasonable suspicion that Martinez had committed or was about to commit a crime. The State appeals the district court's suppression order, arguing that an officer may ask a passenger to supply his identification and run a background check on him during a routine traffic stop. We hold that officer safety concerns justified the negligibly burdensome extension of the traffic stop and reverse the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Jeremy Horne stopped a car after the driver failed to properly signal a lane change. Martinez was a passenger in the vehicle. Trooper Horne explained the reason for the stop and asked the car's driver for his license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. While the driver was collecting his documents, Trooper Horne also asked Martinez for identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 Trooper Horne gathered documentation from both the driver and Martinez and returned to his patrol car. He conducted a records check of both the driver and passenger using his in-car computer system. He entered the driver's driver license number first and then immediately entered Martinez's driver license number. According to Trooper Horne, after entering a number, it generally took \"less than five seconds or so\" to retrieve information regarding warrants, license status, and a photo. Trooper Horne first learned that the driver's license was valid and that the driver had no outstanding warrants. \"Immediately after\" that, Trooper Horne reviewed Martinez's inquiry results and learned that Martinez had an outstanding arrest warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Trooper Horne returned to the car-now two to three minutes into the stop-and arrested Martinez. When Trooper Horne asked Martinez if he had anything illegal on his person, Martinez admitted that he did and produced a glass pipe, which later tested positive for methamphetamine residue. After Martinez's arrest, Trooper Horne gave the driver a \"verbal warning and allowed him to leave.\" The driver chose to stay, however, to help Martinez locate a battery for his hearing aid. The driver left twenty-two minutes after the initial stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State charged Martinez with possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. Martinez moved the district court to suppress the evidence Trooper Horne collected, arguing that the officer had violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Martinez claimed that \" '\n   <em>\n    [a]ny\n   </em>\n   further temporary detention' for investigative questioning after fulfilling the original purpose for the traffic stop constitutes an illegal seizure, unless an officer has probable cause to arrest or a reasonable suspicion of a further illegality.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    State v. Hansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9371833\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/63/650/\">\n    2002 UT 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9371833\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/63/650/\">\n    63 P.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Because Trooper Horne asked for Martinez's identification without reasonable suspicion, Martinez argued, the information Trooper Horne obtained as a result of that illegal inquiry should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 The district court granted Martinez's motion to suppress evidence after concluding that Trooper Horne had violated Martinez's Fourth Amendment rights when he asked to see Martinez's identification. It concluded that \"[i]nvestigation of the passenger without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity is beyond the scope of a routine traffic stop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 The State appeals the district court's suppression order, arguing that an officer may ask a passenger to supply his identification\n   and run a background check during a routine traffic stop as long as it does not unreasonably extend the stop's duration. The State's argument is consistent with United States Supreme Court precedent. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 The district court's determination presents us with a mixed question of law and fact.

Such a finding is \"law-like\" in that law enforcement and the general public need \"a consistent rule established by set appellate precedent.\" And it is not \"fact-like\" because the ultimate determination will often rest on the \"general reasonableness\" of the facts rather than \"the demeanor or credibility\" of witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 39 (citations omitted).

We reverse the decision of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The State's opening brief framed the question presented as whether it is \"reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for a police officer\n    <em>\n     to ask\n    </em>\n    to see a passenger's identification and run a background check during a routine traffic stop.\" (Emphasis added). In response to questioning at oral argument, the State asked us to decide whether officer safety concerns allow an officer\n    <em>\n     to demand\n    </em>\n    identification from a passenger in a vehicle during a routine traffic stop absent reasonable suspicion. We decline the State's invitation to address the propriety of a demand because that is not the question the district court addressed nor the question the State initially briefed. The district court analyzed this case as a request and not a demand. The district court concluded that \"[i]t was beyond the permissible scope of a routine traffic stop for the trooper to run a warrants check on the passenger, Mr. Martinez. Moreover, it was unreasonable for the trooper to do so without at least some minimal suspicion that Mr. Martinez was involved in some kind of criminal activity.\" The court found that Trooper Horne \"\n    <em>\n     asked for\n    </em>\n    and took\" identification from Martinez, not that he\n    <em>\n     demanded\n    </em>\n    identification from Martinez. (Emphasis added). Moreover, the word\n    <em>\n     demand\n    </em>\n    appears nowhere in State's opening brief. The State doubles down in its reply brief, explaining that \"[t]he issue in this case is straightforward: Is\n    <em>\n     requesting\n    </em>\n    to see a passenger's identification and then running a criminal background check a reasonable safety precaution during a traffic stop?\" (Emphasis added). It then clarifies, \"[f]irst, Trooper Horne did not demand Defendant's identification; he merely asked if he could see it.\" In response to Martinez's briefing, the State's reply brief does argue that even if Trooper Horne did not demand Martinez's compliance, he could have. But that is not enough to persuade us to accept the invitation the State extended at oral argument to reframe the question and decide an issue that the district court did not rule on and the State did not address in its opening brief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Some state courts have ruled that their state constitutions prohibit officers from questioning passengers in stopped vehicles absent reasonable suspicion.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.
