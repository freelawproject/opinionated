Defendant fired one shot at Father, missing but causing secondary injuries, then fired three shots at Son, fatally wounding him. Defendant then fired another six shots outside the shop at no particular target.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 After trial, Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, a first degree felony; discharge of a firearm with injury, a second degree felony; and eight counts of discharge of a firearm, all third degree felonies. The aggravator enhancing Defendant's murder charge was that Defendant, in murdering Son, also \"knowingly created a great risk of death to a person other than [Son].\" Defendant appeals all of these convictions, arguing that the aggravator was unsupported by the evidence, and arguing that, for various reasons, the trial court should have granted his motions for mistrial and for new trial. We affirm Defendant's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On March 14, 2012, Father and Son were working at a smoke shop when Father noticed a car parked in an alley next to the shop that was situated in such a way that Father worried it might cause a hazard for the shop's patrons. Father approached Defendant, who was standing near the car, explained his concerns, and asked Defendant to move the car. Defendant refused. Father noted his own physical disability and stated that there wasn't anything he could personally do about Defendant's refusal, but repeated his concern that people could be injured and reiterated his request that Defendant move his car. Defendant again refused to move the car and asked, \"What are you going to do about it?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Following this exchange, Father went back inside the smoke shop and told Son what had happened, and Son decided to go outside and talk to Defendant. Son's entreaty was likewise unpersuasive; when Son asked Defendant to move the car, Defendant not only refused, but also punched Son in the face. Son returned blows, and a fistfight ensued, with Son ending up getting the better of Defendant. When the fight was over, Defendant got into the car and fled, and Father and Son went back inside the shop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 After fleeing from the fistfight, Defendant went to a friend's (Friend) house, and complained to Friend that people at the smoke shop had hit him. Friend offered to help Defendant go back and fight those who hit him. Defendant agreed that this sounded like a good idea, and so the two of them drove back to the smoke shop. When they arrived, they both exited the car, and Friend began to walk toward the entrance. Before he got there, Defendant passed Friend and entered the smoke shop carrying a high-powered rifle that was approximately three feet long.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once inside, Defendant told a customer to leave the premises, and then began shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 The smoke shop consisted of one room that was approximately twenty-four feet long and fifteen feet wide, with a single door along the longer wall. When Defendant entered the shop, Father and Son were standing behind a waist-high glass counter that was laid out in an S-shape near the wall opposite the door. Father and Son were standing between three and seven feet apart. Defendant proceeded across the small shop, toward Father and Son, until he was standing approximately three feet from the counter and some five feet away from both Father and Son. From this location, Defendant fired a single shot in Father's direction, narrowly missing Father but hitting the glass counter and interior shelving near Father, causing glass and wood shrapnel to hit Father's leg. After this shot was fired, Father fell to the floor behind the counter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 After missing his shot at Father, Defendant immediately turned toward Son and took one or two steps toward him, saying, \"I'm going to kill you.\" Defendant stopped when he was standing at the counter, approximately three feet away from Son, and extended the barrel of the gun toward Son, so that the muzzle of the rifle was very close to Son. From that location, Defendant shot Son, causing Son to fall on the floor behind the counter. Defendant then leaned over the counter, and shot Son two more times. While Defendant was shooting Son, neither Defendant nor his rifle was facing Father; rather, Father was to Defendant's right, about five feet away, on the floor behind the counter. Still, Father was close enough to feel the \"muzzle blast\" from the rifle on his face as Defendant shot Son. After shooting Son, Defendant left the store through the front door and fired another six shots outside the shop, apparently at no particular target.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 After interviewing witnesses and conducting an investigation, law enforcement officers apprehended Defendant and Friend a few days later. Defendant was charged with aggravated murder, discharge of a firearm causing bodily injury, and eight counts of discharge of a firearm. Friend was charged with murder, and with nine counts of discharge of a firearm. The aggravator enhancing Defendant's murder charges was that Defendant, in the course of murdering Son, also \"knowingly created a great risk of death\" to Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 At trial, Father and several other witnesses testified during the State's case-in-chief, identifying Defendant as the shooter and describing the argument and fistfight between Defendant, Father, and Son. These witnesses also described Defendant's conduct during the shooting itself. Friend was one of these witnesses, and he described his conversation with Defendant following the fistfight, their subsequent drive to the smoke shop, and the events that took place after their arrival. Friend gave this testimony pursuant to a plea bargain in which the State agreed to reduce Friend's charges and recommend only probation in this case in exchange for Friend's truthful testimony. As part of this plea agreement, the State also agreed to dismiss an aggravated burglary charge against Friend in a separate case in which Defendant was also a codefendant. During cross-examination, Defendant's counsel asked Friend about the details of his plea arrangement, including whether he had an aggravated burglary charge pending in a separate case. When Friend answered that question in the affirmative, Defendant's counsel asked if that charge would also be dismissed as part of the bargain. Friend responded, \"I think,\" at which point the State requested a sidebar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 During the sidebar, the State explained that the aggravated burglary charge\n   was for an incident that took place ten days prior to the events at the smoke shop. The State acknowledged that it intended to dismiss Friend's aggravated burglary charge, but also stated that part of the plea agreement in this case was that Friend would also testify against Defendant in the aggravated burglary case, if necessary. The State asserted that if Defendant's counsel questioned Friend about the aggravated burglary charge, it would open the door for Friend to disclose that Defendant was a codefendant in that case, thereby alerting the jury to the fact that Defendant also stood accused of committing aggravated burglary in a separate incident just ten days before the events at the smoke shop. In response, Defendant's counsel stated that Friend's counsel had informed Defendant's counsel that Friend's aggravated burglary charge would be dismissed in exchange for Friend's testimony in this case. Defendant's counsel then stated that he would rather not provide the State with an opportunity to tell the jury about Defendant's potential culpability in the aggravated burglary case, and therefore elected to refrain from further questioning on the subject. The trial court then instructed the jury to \"disregard any reference or any discussion that was previously made about any unrelated case being dismissed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 As the trial continued, the State presented further testimony from law enforcement officers who investigated Defendant's involvement in this case. These officers testified that Defendant had access to an AK-74, the type of rifle that the State believed was used in the shooting. One officer (Officer) also testified that, on the day Defendant was arrested, Defendant still had bruising on his face. Following Officer's testimony, the jury submitted proposed questions to the trial court, some of which the court directed Officer to answer. One of these questions asked Officer whether, at the time Defendant was arrested, Defendant had offered any explanation for the bruising on his face. In response, Officer stated that, while law enforcement officers had noticed the bruising at the time of Defendant's arrest, \"because he invoked his rights we weren't able to ask him about that, so we didn't get an answer to that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 Defendant's counsel quickly objected to Officer's response. Outside the presence of the jury, Defendant's counsel moved for a mistrial, arguing that Officer had improperly commented on Defendant's invocation of his constitutional right to be free from self-incrimination. The State opposed the motion for mistrial, and asserted that Officer's reference to Defendant's invocation of his rights was harmless because it was indirect, inadvertent, and would not be used by the State as evidence of Defendant's guilt. The State instead suggested that the court give a curative instruction to the jury explaining to them that Defendant did nothing wrong by invoking his right to remain silent. In response, Defendant's counsel indicated that she would object to a curative instruction and reiterated that she believed mistrial was the only appropriate remedy for any harm caused by Officer's statement. The court denied Defendant's motion for a mistrial and, because Defendant objected to one, did not give a curative instruction. Neither Defendant nor the State brought up Officer's statement again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 At the close of the State's case-in-chief, Defendant moved to dismiss the aggravator enhancing his murder charge. Defendant argued that the State had not presented sufficient evidence that Defendant, in murdering Son, had knowingly exposed Father to a great risk of death, because Defendant's shots directed towards Son occurred at close range when Father was several feet outside of Defendant's direct line of fire. Defendant also asserted that because Defendant's first shot (directed at Father) was not one of the shots contributing to Son's death, it should not factor into the analysis of whether Defendant created a great risk of death to Father. The trial court denied Defendant's motion to dismiss the aggravator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b614 Following the presentation of the State's case-in-chief, Defendant elected to testify on his own behalf. During the State's cross-examination, Defendant admitted to buying ammunition for an AK-74 at one point in time but denied buying ammunition on four other occasions. In response, the State tried to impeach Defendant by producing ammunition purchase receipts that the State represented were found in Defendant's house pursuant to a search warrant. Defense counsel\n   objected, on the ground that the receipts in question were not in fact seized from Defendant's home. After a brief recess, the State conceded that the receipts had not been found in Defendant's house, and therefore the trial court sustained Defendant's objection. In addition, at the trial court's instruction, the prosecutor explained to the jury that the State could not tie the ammunition purchases represented by the receipts to Defendant, and apologized to the jury for stating otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b615 After presentation of the evidence, the case was submitted to the jury, which deliberated for an entire day, from 8:00 a.m. until nearly 5:00 p.m. At about 4:30 p.m., without previously seeking the input of the attorneys, the trial judge entered the jury room and asked the jurors whether they were close to a verdict, such that they could conclude deliberations that day, or whether they thought they would need to come back the next day. The jurors indicated that they thought they were \"close to a verdict\" but that they would \"let [the court] know ... if [they] needed to reconvene.\" Within minutes of this communication, the trial judge entered the courtroom and informed the attorneys of the interaction, and made a record of what was said. At the time, neither party objected to the trial court's ex parte communication. A few minutes later, around 5:00 p.m., the jury indicated that it had reached a verdict, which was then read in open court. The jury convicted Defendant on all charges, and determined that the aggravator applied to Defendant's murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b616 About six weeks after Defendant's conviction, the trial court sentenced Defendant to life in prison without the possibility of parole for aggravated murder; to a term of three to fifteen years for discharge of a firearm with injury to another, to run consecutive to the murder sentence; and to a term of three to five years for each of the eight counts of discharge of a firearm, to run concurrently with each other and with the other sentences. Within ten days of sentencing, Defendant filed a Motion for New Trial pursuant to rule 24 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, which required (at the time) that a Defendant must move for new trial \"not later than 10 days after entry of the sentence\" and that \"affidavits or evidence of the essential facts in support of the motion\" must be submitted with the motion. Utah R. Crim. P. 24(b), (c) (2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant's motion cited to the trial testimony, but did not attach any other supporting evidence. Over the next several months and without seeking leave from the court, Defendant filed a number of affidavits and exhibits, as well as an amended motion for new trial. The trial court refused to consider these additional documents on the ground that they were untimely submitted and procedurally improper. Thus, in evaluating whether to grant Defendant a new trial, the court considered only Defendant's original motion for new trial and the trial record itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b617 In his original motion, Defendant asserted that he was entitled to a new trial for several reasons. First, he claimed that the State \"misled\" Defendant into believing that Friend's aggravated burglary charge in the separate case would not be dismissed on the basis of Friend's testimony in this case, when Defendant asserts that the State in fact did dismiss Friend's aggravated burglary charge after Friend's testimony in this case. Next, Defendant claimed that he was entitled to a new trial because the receipts that the State attempted to introduce (then withdrew and apologized for after Defendant's objection) were allegedly \"doctored\" by the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Defendant claimed that he was entitled to a new trial because the trial court's ex parte communication with the jury thirty minutes before delivery of the verdict was prejudicial, in that it may have influenced the jury to resolve the case more quickly than it otherwise would have. After reviewing Defendant's motion, the court determined that an evidentiary hearing was not necessary\n   and denied Defendant's motion in a written ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b618 Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b619 Defendant asks us to consider four issues. First, he contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the application of the \"great risk of harm\" aggravator to his murder conviction, and therefore insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for aggravated murder. Evidence is insufficient to support a jury verdict when, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, it is nonetheless so \"inconclusive or inherently improbable\" that \"reasonable minds must have entertained a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Aggravator\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b623 Defendant first contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he knowingly placed Father at \"great risk of death\" in the course of shooting Son. Arguing from this premise, Defendant asserts that his murder charge should be reduced from aggravated murder to murder. We are unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b624 \"Criminal homicide constitutes aggravated murder if,\" in the course of \"intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] the death of another ... the actor knowingly created a great risk of death to a person other than the victim and the actor.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-202\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(c) (LexisNexis 2017). Defendant argues that, under the facts of this case, he did not create a great risk of death to Father when he shot and killed Son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b625 Defendant bases this argument on several contentions. First, Defendant asserts that the three shots he fired at Son should be viewed as \"acts of independent significance\" separate from both the initial shot Defendant directed at Father and the random shots Defendant fired at no apparent target outside the smoke shop. Second, Defendant asserts that at the time Defendant shot and killed Son, Father was several feet away and out of Defendant's direct line of fire, such that the three shots constituting the murder itself could not have endangered Father. Third, Defendant asserts that the variety of weapon used to kill Son, a rifle, presented minimal risk that Father would be inadvertently injured as compared to the risk that may have been presented by other potential weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b626 Before directly addressing the merits of Defendant's arguments, it is necessary to frame the discussion by reference to applicable case law. We are aware of only two Utah cases in which this aggravator was at issue:\n   <em>\n    State v. Pierre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10473527\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/572/1338/\">\n    572 P.2d 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1977), and\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   , the use of the aggravator was upheld, and the State relies heavily on that case. In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, the aggravator was held to be inapplicable, and Defendant analogizes to that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b627 The\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   case involved one of the defendants in the \"Hi-Fi Murders\" case that made headlines in the 1970s. In that case, the defendant and his accomplices bound five victims in the basement of a \"Hi-Fi Shop.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10473527\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/572/1338/\">\n    572 P.2d at 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant appealed, contending that, at the time he shot the three victims who died, there was no evidence that the two victims who survived were \"placed in a great risk of death.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10473527\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/572/1338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10473527\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/572/1338/\">\n    at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is a fact-intensive inquiry whose application will vary from case to case. In some cases, a threat is obvious: if the defendant shoots at, points a weapon at, or otherwise directly threatens the third party during the course of the murder, this factor will weigh in favor of applying the aggravator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10473527\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/572/1338/\">\n    572 P.2d at 1343, 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the two surviving victims were actually shot by the defendant just seconds apart from the murders, and the aggravator applied);\n   <em>\n    Nash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745132\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/143/392/\">\n    694 P.2d at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the defendant pointed a gun at the third party immediately after and immediately before shooting the murder victim, and the aggravator applied). In other cases, the threat may be less obvious but perhaps present nonetheless, as in cases where a third party may be at risk of harm from a stray or ricocheting bullet. In analyzing this factor's applicability, courts may consider things like the type of weapon used (using a gun is different than beating a victim with fists or a shovel handle), the manner in which the defendant deployed the weapon (spraying a crowd with gunfire is different than training the weapon on one person), and any damage the third party may have actually sustained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10412597\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/740/1264/\">\n    740 P.2d at 1265-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a third party was not endangered when a defendant beat his victim to death with a shovel handle on the other side of the basement);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

Further, Father was no more than seven feet away from Son, and some five feet away from Defendant, when Defendant shot Son-in close enough physical proximity that Father could feel the muzzle blast from the shots targeting Son. Even though Father was not in the direct line of fire at the time Defendant shot Son, his close physical proximity to Defendant and Son at the time Defendant shot Son, coupled with the fact that Defendant had actually fired a shot at Father just seconds earlier, is sufficient for Father to properly be considered within the \"zone of danger.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10412597\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/740/1264/\">\n    740 P.2d at 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Defendant did more than merely make verbal threats or point a gun at Father-Defendant actually fired a rifle shot at Father at close range just seconds before he shot Son, narrowly missing\n   Father but causing wood and glass shrapnel to hit him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b637 In light of all of this evidence, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying Defendant's motion at the close of the State's case-in-chief. All three of the factors weigh in favor of application of the \"great risk of death\" aggravator, and therefore there exists sufficient evidence upon which a jury could base a finding that Defendant, in the course of murdering Son, knowingly placed Father at great risk of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   II.

He simply filed them without asking for permission to do so.

Defendant contends that the court erred when it denied that motion on its merits, and maintains that he is entitled to a new trial for three reasons: (a) the State violated his constitutional rights by failing to disclose the details of its plea deal with Friend; (b) the State prejudiced Defendant's case by presenting falsified evidence in the form of the four ammunition receipts; and (c) the court's ex parte communication with the jury prejudiced Defendant.

Specifically, Defendant asserts that, when asked at trial if Friend's separate aggravated burglary charge was being dismissed in exchange for Friend's testimony in this case, the State clarified that the dismissal of Friend's aggravated burglary charge was conditioned in part on Friend testifying truthfully against Defendant in the aggravated burglary case. Defendant claims that, in fact, the State intended to dismiss Friend's aggravated burglary charge solely in exchange for Friend's testimony in this case, and that the State failed to disclose this information when Defendant's counsel asked about the details of the plea deal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Defendant maintains he is entitled to a new trial.

Because of this, even if the terms of the plea agreement were as Defendant alleges, and even if the State improperly failed to disclose those terms, Defendant knew or reasonably should have known all of the relevant details of the arrangement through his counsel's discussions with Friend's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b649 Moreover, we note that even had Defendant not known the true details of Friend's plea deal with the State, and even if it were clear that the State suppressed those details, there is no evidence that Defendant sustained any prejudice as a result. Indeed, the jury in this case already knew from Defendant's cross-examination of Friend that Friend was also charged with murder and discharge of a firearm in this case, and that, by testifying against Defendant, Friend was receiving a favorable plea deal. Previously we have held that, where a jury is already aware that a codefendant is receiving a plea deal in exchange for his testimony, \"[t]he mere possibility of a more favorable deal for [a codefendant]\" does \"not substantially affect [that codefendant's] credibility as a witness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In this case, Defendant fails to convincingly demonstrate that making the jury aware of one more charge that would purportedly be dismissed in exchange for Friend's testimony would have materially altered the jury's view of Friend's credibility, much less that it would have materially altered the overall outcome at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b650 Finally, we note that Defendant's counsel had a compelling tactical reason to refrain from further exploring the details of Friend's plea arrangement. As the State noted during the sidebar, Defendant was charged as a codefendant for the same aggravated burglary as Friend, so inquiring further into Friend's plea deal with respect to the aggravated burglary charge may have opened the door for the State to inform the jury that Defendant had been charged with aggravated burglary as well. Upon considering this possibility, Defendant's counsel indicated that he believed \"open[ing] that door\" would constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, and thus he declined to inquire further into the details of the plea deal. We agree with Defendant's trial counsel that there was a plausible tactical basis for counsel to refrain from making further inquiry into the details of Friend's plea agreement. Accordingly, \"where the defense had the opportunity to use ... evidence to its advantage during trial but [fails] to do so,\" we do not overturn a conviction based on the alleged\n   suppression of that evidence.\n   <em>\n    Bisner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451398\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/37/1073/\">\n    2001 UT 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451398\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/37/1073/\">\n    37 P.3d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b651 Under these circumstances, the trial court did not err when it determined that Defendant was not entitled to a new trial because of any issue with the State's disclosure of the terms of Friend's plea bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b652 Defendant next asserts that he was entitled to a new trial due to the State's actions in attempting to introduce the ammunition receipts. Defendant contends on appeal that the State \"doctored\" the receipts to implicate Defendant and that their introduction at trial was \"so outrageous as to shock the conscience,\" thus meriting remand for a new trial under\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, Defendant's motion for new trial was accompanied by no timely evidence supporting this claim. Further, Defendant received everything that he asked for on this issue at trial: the evidence was excluded, the trial court admonished the jury not to consider it, and the State apologized to the jury for its introduction. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the grounds that the State had allegedly \"doctored\" the receipts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b653 Finally, Defendant asserts he was entitled to a new trial on the basis that he was prejudiced by the judge's ex parte communication with the jurors, in which the judge asked the jurors whether they would be finished deliberating soon or whether the jury would need to continue deliberations the next day. Defendant contends that this communication was prejudicial because it could have influenced the jury to end its deliberations by 5:00 p.m., and argues that the jury might not have found him guilty if it had deliberated longer.

Indeed, where \"the judge's communication with the jury [does] not involve any substantive issues,\" but instead is \"brief and deal[s] with the timing of the jury's dismissal for the day,\" our supreme court has indicated that a presumption of prejudice is not warranted, especially where \"the judge appropriately disclose[s] the communication\" to both parties at trial \"and neither [party] [objects] to the interaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.

However, Defendant fails to explain how Officer's statement actually operated to impeach him. Indeed, Defendant makes no effort to tie Officer's statement to any particular statement or position of Defendant's that Defendant's post-arrest silence was used to impeach. Neither Officer nor the State ever related Officer's statement to any particular action or statement by Defendant, and no party made any mention of Officer's statement again during the trial.

Officer's statement was brief, comprising just three lines in the trial transcript, and came after the jury had already heard evidence from several witnesses establishing Defendant's conduct prior to and during the murder. The State did not refer to Defendant's silence at any other time during the entirety of the trial, and at the time the comment was made it did not concern any narrative that Defendant offered or eventually would offer at trial. Further, the trial court offered to issue a curative instruction to the jury, which offer Defendant refused.

Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to consider late-filed addenda to Defendant's motion for new trial, or when it denied that motion on its merits. And the trial court did not err in denying Defendant's motion for mistrial. Accordingly, we affirm Defendant's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    No witness testified to the exact length of the rifle, but the rifle's approximate length was clearly shown in photographs admitted into evidence at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    This rule was amended, effective on November 1, 2015, to allow a defendant to move for a new trial within fourteen days of sentencing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah R. Crim. P. 24(c) (2015). Because the pertinent facts in this case predate the alteration, we cite to the version of rule that applied at the time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Specifically, Defendant alleged that the State had \"whited out\" a facsimile transmission line at the top of the documents. Defendant contends that the presence of the facsimile transmission information on the document demonstrates that the receipts were not found in Defendant's home.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In his brief, Defendant also raised a number of constitutional objections to Utah's statutory sentencing scheme for defendants convicted of aggravated murder. At oral argument, Defendant withdrew those objections, and therefore we do not address them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    In complex cases, it might seem unrealistic to expect a defendant to prepare and file a motion for new trial, including all supporting documentation, within ten (or fourteen) days after sentencing. However, in most cases, a defendant will know very soon after the jury's verdict that he or she might want to move for a new trial, and in many cases, sentence is not imposed until six or seven weeks following the verdict. As a practical matter, then, a defendant will usually have significantly longer than ten (or fourteen) days to prepare a motion for new trial. In this case, for instance, sentencing occurred forty-one days after the verdict, and Defendant therefore had more than fifty days, even without an extension, to prepare his motion for new trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    As a threshold matter, we note that some of Defendant's untimely-filed addenda to his motion for new trial purportedly provided further evidence on this issue. Because we have already determined the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to consider Defendant's untimely filings, we consider only the facts which were properly before the court, chiefly the facts presented in the trial transcript itself.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    \"We are aware that some federal circuits do not read\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    \" to permit a prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence during trial.\n    <em>\n     State v.
