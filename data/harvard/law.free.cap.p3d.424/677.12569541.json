Inside this car, the officers found John Columbus unresponsive and slumped over in the driver's seat with a fatal bullet wound to his back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 4 The evidence showed that Columbus had driven to that neighborhood to sell marijuana to Ramie Brown, who had arranged to meet him at Mitchell's house. Little did Columbus know that Brown and Austin Olinger had devised a scheme to rob him of his marijuana, or that they would soon involve Mitchell, Cody Taylor, and Kiwane Hobia in their criminal conspiracy. The plan was for Brown to get into the car with Columbus to make the purchase and, when Columbus produced the marijuana, to grab it and flee. Needing a ride to Mitchell's house, Olinger called Taylor who arrived in his white Chevrolet Trailblazer and he drove Brown and Olinger to Mitchell's, the designated meeting place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 5 When Columbus arrived at Mitchell's house, Brown got into Columbus' car as planned and the two drove away. When Brown asked where they were going, Columbus explained that he did not have the marijuana with him and that they were heading to his house to get it. Brown then informed Columbus that he did not have the purchase money with him and the two of them returned to Mitchell's house. Brown got out and told Olinger, Mitchell, and Hobia that Columbus wanted his money up front, prompting a change of plan. Brown rejoined Columbus and Olinger, Mitchell and Hobia also got into Columbus' car. Columbus followed Olinger's directions, believing he was going to where the money was. Columbus parked in a nearby parking lot as directed and guns were pointed at his and Brown's heads. Brown testified that Mitchell was the one pointing a gun at Columbus and that he instructed Columbus not to move. Brown exited the car and ran, but before he was out of the parking lot, he heard a gunshot. He turned in time to see Mitchell standing outside the car behind the driver's side door with a pistol in his hand. The conspirators all scattered on foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 6 Taylor, who had stayed behind at Mitchell's house, picked up a somewhat excited Olinger and Hobia, who were out of breath and barely talking. Olinger directed Taylor to the crime scene parking lot where he got out and grabbed a gun holster lying by the curb before the three returned to Mitchell's house. Mitchell was at his house and out of breath like he had been running. Mitchell asked Taylor to go for cigarettes. Olinger went with Taylor, but the two were pulled over by police on their way back from the store. The officers noted a strong odor of marijuana coming from inside Taylor's Trailblazer. A search of the Trailblazer uncovered the gun holster Olinger retrieved from the parking lot and two loaded handguns as well as a bag of marijuana in Olinger's pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 7 Brown was arrested the next day and Mitchell was apprehended a couple of weeks later. Both Brown and Taylor testified against Mitchell at trial. In addition to this accomplice testimony, the State presented evidence that connected Mitchell to the murder weapon as well as text messages that showed Mitchell was an active participant in the commission of the robbery that resulted in Columbus' death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Harjo\n    </em>\n    Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 8 Mitchell contends his convictions must be reversed because the district court failed to hold an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Harjo v.

A closer look, however, reveals there is no actual conflict because these two former instructions addressed completely different situations: OUJI-CR (2d) 9-17 concerned out-of-court statements offered pursuant to the co-conspirator hearsay exception ( 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2801(B)(2)(e) ) for statements in furtherance of a conspiracy for which no corroboration is required for admission while OUJI-CR (2d) 9-39 concerned the in-court testimony of one conspirator against another for which corroboration is required in order to sustain a conviction that rests upon the co-conspirator's testimony if the co-conspirator qualifies as an accomplice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 16 The\n   <em>\n    Pink\n   </em>\n   Court reversed the defendant's robbery conviction in that case because it was based upon the uncorroborated testimony of two accomplices. It affirmed, however, the defendant's conspiracy conviction that rested upon the very same accomplice testimony from the same accomplice witnesses. The Court, in reviewing Pink's sufficiency of the evidence challenge for conspiracy, made a distinction concerning the status of these accomplice witnesses labeling them co-conspirators for purposes of Pink's conspiracy conviction and finding their testimony as such required no corroboration. The corroboration requirement of accomplice testimony in Section 742 cannot be so easily circumvented. An accomplice is one who is or could be charged for the offense for which the accused is being tried.\n   <em>\n    Sellers v.

This time he claims that his conspiracy conviction must be reversed because the State failed to prove that he was a member of the conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Without sufficient evidence of his membership in the conspiracy, he contends that his felony murder conviction cannot stand because it is predicated on the conspiracy. We disagree and evaluate this challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence using the standard set forth in \u00b6 11,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 19 The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, showed that Ramie Brown and Austin Olinger entered into an agreement to rob the victim and that Cody Taylor, Kiwane Hobia and Mitchell later became parties to that agreement. The evidence further showed that one or more of these men performed an overt act in furtherance of their plan. \"In a conspiracy prosecution, the critical inquiry is whether the circumstances, acts, and conduct of the parties are of such a character that the minds of reasonable men may conclude therefrom that an unlawful agreement exists.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The evidence presented sufficiently proved that Mitchell joined the conspiracy after Brown and Olinger made an agreement to rob the victim and that he participated in the plan once it was put into action. Evidence of an unlawful agreement and an overt act in furtherance of the plan is all that is required to support a conviction for conspiracy. 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7\u00a7 421 &amp; 423. Based on the record before us, we find that any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Mitchell was guilty of the crime of Conspiracy to Commit Robbery with a Dangerous Weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 20 We reach the same conclusion concerning Mitchell's conviction for First Degree Felony Murder. The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, showed that the victim died during the commission of an armed robbery perpetrated by Mitchell and his co-conspirators. 21 O.S.Supp.2012, \u00a7 701.7(B). Mitchell's argument that his felony murder conviction was based on his unproven membership in the conspiracy is unpersuasive and unsupported by the record. First, the evidence sufficiently proved Mitchell was a member of the conspiracy as discussed above. Second, and more importantly, the State charged Mitchell with felony murder, alleging that the victim's death occurred during the course of an armed robbery in which Mitchell was an active participant. Mitchell's felony murder conviction was not based on his membership in the conspiracy, but was a discrete offense. The State's evidence proved Mitchell was both a party to the conspiracy and an active participant in the fatal armed robbery. We find on this record ample proof from which any rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Mitchell was guilty of the crime of First Degree Felony Murder.

Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 33 Mitchell argues that the district court erred in admitting State's Exhibit Nos. 22 through 26, namely the cell phone logs of the victim and several of his co-conspirators.

He has failed to show either that error occurred or that error affected the outcome of his case. Consequently, he cannot make the requisite showings of deficient performance and prejudice.

The cumulative error doctrine applies when several errors occurred at the trial court level, but none alone warrants reversal. Although each error standing alone may be of insufficient gravity to warrant reversal, the combined effect of an accumulation of errors may require a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.
