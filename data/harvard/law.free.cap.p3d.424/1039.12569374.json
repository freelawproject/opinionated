McLeod contends that the evidence should be excluded because the officer's subjective\n   basis for the arrest was a mistaken belief that McLeod was the subject of an active arrest warrant. In denying the motion to suppress, the district court ruled that the arrest was objectively justified. Notwithstanding the officer's mistaken subjective basis for arrest, the officer's observation of a hand-to-hand transaction gave rise to probable cause to arrest McLeod for committing a drug crime. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 A Salt Lake City police officer was surveilling a high-crime area known for drug activity. The officer was stationed on the top of a parking structure, using binoculars to look for hand-to-hand drug transactions. As a nine-year veteran of the police force, the officer was familiar with the characteristics of such transactions. He had been involved in approximately one thousand drug-related stops and had completed multiple narcotics trainings. The officer testified at an evidentiary hearing that in his experience, when a hand-to-hand drug transaction occurs, a pedestrian will walk up to a potential drug dealer and engage in a short conversation. After the pedestrian pulls out money, the drug dealer will usually remove drugs from his or her mouth and hand them to the pedestrian. According to the officer, certain drugs are typically packaged in a \"twist,\" which is a pinky-sized bag that has been twisted and then melted on the end to prevent breaking. The color of the twist varies based on the type of drug it contains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Through his binoculars, the officer noticed a suspicious interaction about sixty-five to seventy yards away from his location. He watched as a man, later identified as McLeod, approached a second man on the street and handed him green paper, which appeared to be money. The second man then reached into his mouth, grabbed a black item that appeared to be a twist of heroin, and handed it to McLeod. McLeod immediately put the black twist into his pocket and continued walking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Believing he had witnessed a hand-to-hand drug transaction, the officer exited the parking structure and intercepted McLeod on the street. The officer immediately recognized McLeod as a suspect he had arrested four months earlier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In connection with charges stemming from that prior arrest, the officer had appeared at McLeod's preliminary hearing twenty days earlier and had heard the court issue an arrest warrant when McLeod failed to appear. Unbeknownst to the officer, McLeod had appeared later that afternoon, and the court had recalled the warrant at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Assuming that the warrant was still active, the officer arrested McLeod. He then conducted a search incident to arrest, which uncovered a syringe, heroin, and cocaine. When the officer later conducted a records check, he discovered that the warrant had been withdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The State charged McLeod with two counts of possession or use of a controlled substance, third degree felonies, and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, a class B misdemeanor. McLeod moved to suppress the drug evidence, contending that the officer had neither probable cause to arrest McLeod for the alleged drug transaction nor a good-faith basis to arrest McLeod on a twenty-day-old warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 In denying the motion, the district court noted that \"it is very unusual for a person to walk up to someone else on the street and give that person what appears to be money and then get something out of that person's mouth in return.\" The court determined that \"a reasonably prudent person, especially with [the officer's] training and experience, would easily and reasonably believe he had witnessed a hand-to-hand drug transaction.\" Because the district court concluded the hand-to-hand transaction gave rise to objective probable cause to arrest, it did not reach McLeod's argument that the officer lacked good faith when he arrested McLeod on a recalled warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 McLeod pled guilty to one count of possession or use of a controlled substance, a class A misdemeanor, preserving his right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Crim. P. 11(j). This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 McLeod contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the officer arrested him without probable cause to believe McLeod was engaged in unlawful drug activity, thereby tainting any evidence recovered during the search incident to arrest. Specifically, McLeod contends that given the distance from which the officer observed the hand-to-hand transaction and the uncertainty regarding the items exchanged, the officer's observations supported only reasonable suspicion to investigate, not probable cause to arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 \"We review a [district] court's decision to grant or deny a motion to suppress for an alleged Fourth Amendment violation as a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The officer testified that he had been looking for hand-to-hand transactions in a high-crime area when he watched McLeod approach a man on the street and give him what appeared to be money. The officer believed it was money because, with the aid of binoculars, he could see green paper. The man then removed a small, black item from his mouth and gave it to McLeod, who immediately placed it in his pocket and departed.

In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , we were not asked to determine whether the circumstances that gave rise to reasonable suspicion may have also supported probable cause for an arrest. Indeed, we have found no Utah appellate court decisions addressing whether and under what circumstances a hand-to-hand transaction may give rise to probable cause. But other jurisdictions have held that witnessing a hand-to-hand transaction, under circumstances suggestive of drug activity, may give rise to probable cause to arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, McLeod did not simply engage in a hand-to-hand exchange-McLeod accepted and placed into his pocket a small, black item that another man had just removed from his mouth. The officer testified that it is common for drug dealers to \"pull [drugs] out of their mouth.\" While it may be possible to imagine innocent explanations for this peculiar conduct, none is remotely as likely as the conclusion that McLeod had engaged in a hand-to-hand drug transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caicedo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7470845\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/622/149/#p150\">\n    622 So.2d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An observation as to a known mode of transportation of drugs is a factor properly considered in a probable cause determination.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 Second, even though the officer observed the transaction from sixty-five to seventy yards away, he had an unobstructed view, and with the aid of binoculars, he was able to see the color of the items exchanged. Specifically, he saw McLeod give green paper to the second man, and he saw the second man hand something small and black to McLeod. The indeterminate nature of these items does not negate a probable cause determination, because the officer's belief that McLeod took possession of a controlled substance \"need not be characterized as a certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
