We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Defendant married a woman (Mother) in September 2009. Defendant and Mother lived together with Mother's minor children-the victim (Victim) and her older sister (Sister).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In 2011, as the family was preparing to be \"sealed\" in an LDS temple, Mother asked Victim if she \"felt worthy to go to the temple so [they] could have [their] forever family.\" According to Mother, Victim stated that she \"felt like she was good but she didn't feel like everybody involved was [worthy].\" Victim explained to Mother that \"[Defendant] had been touching [her] inappropriately.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Mother confronted Defendant with Victim's allegations. Defendant denied sexually abusing Victim. Defendant suggested that \"[Victim] was having nightmares, it must have been dreams, it wasn't true.\" Mother believed Defendant because he \"was the man [she] was getting ready to go through the temple [with], he was a police officer, he was a firefighter.\" Mother and Defendant told Victim that she must have been dreaming because Defendant \"would never do anything like that to [her].\" Victim \"went along with it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Victim later testified that she \"knew what had happened, ... that [Defendant] was touching [her] and that they weren't dreams,\" but she went along with Mother and Defendant because Defendant had threatened to divorce Mother. Victim wanted \"an eternal family\" and wanted Defendant and Mother to stay together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In September 2013, Defendant disclosed to Mother that he was having an affair, and they separated in October 2013. Defendant moved to live with his new girlfriend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   About a week after Defendant moved out, Victim told a school counselor that Defendant had sexually abused her. Victim later testified that she told the counselor because she \"was losing [her] forever family.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 In November 2013, a detective interviewed Victim after she received a referral from the Division of Child and Family Services. During her interview with the detective, Victim alleged that on at least two separate occasions, Defendant had \"tried to put his penis inside of her and that it hurt.\" The detective also met with Mother, who relayed an allegation by Sister that Defendant had \"come into her bedroom and wanted to cuddle with her,\" but Sister told him to get out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The detective gave Sister an opportunity to make a written statement, but Sister did not make any disclosures regarding rape or other sexual abuse at that time. According to the detective, the witness statement form had \"a disclaimer that tells people to make sure they fill that out honestly\" and \"if they fill it out and it's not honest, they could be charged with a crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Around that time, the detective also interviewed Defendant. A video recording of Defendant's interview was played for the jury at trial. In the recording, Defendant admitted that there were \"a couple of incidents where [he and Victim] had some inappropriate touching.\" When the detective asked Defendant to explain \"how [he] inappropriately touched [Victim],\" Defendant explained, \"I touched [Victim's] private areas with my hands and with my privates\" \"[t]wo or three\" times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 In December 2013, a pediatric nurse physically examined both Victim and Sister. She testified that neither child's examination revealed any \"trauma or ... tearing or ... scar tissue.\" The pediatric nurse explained that this was not unusual because \"the body can ... heal very quickly in that area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Defendant was charged with two counts of rape of a child, one count of object rape of a child, two counts of sodomy on a child, and three counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Victim's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 At trial, Victim testified that Defendant sexually abused her from the summer of 2011 through \"June or July of 2013.\" The abuse occurred in Defendant's bedroom. According to Victim, Defendant called her \"his baby girl\" \"[w]hile he was touching [her],\" but he never called her that before the abuse began. Victim testified that there had been multiple instances of inappropriate touching, but she only testified with particularity about two instances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Victim testified that the first instance had occurred in the early morning after Mother had gone to work. Defendant picked Victim up and carried her to his room, where he laid her on his bed and took off her clothes. Defendant took off his robe, revealing that he had no clothes on underneath. Victim had \"no idea what was going on\" and \"was so scared.\" According to Victim, Defendant told her \"if [she] ever told anyone what he was about to do, that he would get a divorce with [her] mom.\" Defendant then got on top of Victim and started touching her breasts with his hands. Defendant also licked her vagina. Defendant then \"sat up and ... tried to push his penis\" into Victim's vagina. When Victim told him to stop, Defendant \"reached over to his night stand drawer and pulled out a bottle of green jelly.\" Defendant squeezed some of the jelly \"on his finger and ... started rubbing [Victim's] vagina with it and then he tried to push his penis into [her] vagina again.\" Defendant pushed his penis into Victim's vagina \"[a] little bit\" and ultimately ejaculated \"[o]n top of [her] vagina.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Victim testified that the second incident also occurred in the early morning while Mother was at work. Defendant again carried Victim from her room to his room, laid her on his bed, and took off her clothes. She testified that Defendant was again wearing a robe but that this time, he wore religious \"garments\" underneath the robe. Defendant asked Victim \"if [she] wanted to make love.\" When Victim asked Defendant what that meant, he replied, \"I'll show you.\" Defendant then \"put his finger in [Victim] and started fingering [her].\" Victim told Defendant that she \"didn't want to do this, that it hurt too much.\" Defendant then \"reached over to his night stand drawer and ... grabbed the bottle of green jelly.\" Defendant set the bottle on the bed and started licking Victim's vagina. He then rubbed the jelly on Victim's vagina and his penis and \"tried to put his penis in [her] [while] he kept grabbing [her] breasts and squeezing them.\" Victim testified that Defendant again put his penis inside her \"[a] little bit\" and that he ejaculated in her vagina. Defendant told Victim that \"[she] had to go sit on the toilet for it to come out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 Victim further testified that she did not \"call for help\" or tell anyone because she did not want anyone to know about the abuse and because Defendant was her \"first image of a father and [she] wanted to keep it that way. [She] wanted her forever family to be forever.\" In addition to the two specific instances that Victim described, she estimated that Defendant had touched her inappropriately more than ten times between the summers of 2011 and 2013, but she also testified it happened \"sometimes once, twice a week.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Sister's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 In November 2013, while she was visiting her grandmother for Thanksgiving, Sister claimed, for the first time, that she had also been previously sexually abused by Defendant. Sister met with the detective a second time after the Thanksgiving holiday. Sister testified at trial that Defendant had raped her approximately thirty times from early 2011 to the summer of 2013. Sister testified that the rapes occurred in her downstairs bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 According to Sister, \"[f]or the first little while, [Defendant] would just come down in his ... garments,\" and \"he would rub [her] back underneath [her] shirt.\" This happened for approximately six months. Sister testified that Defendant then started removing both his and Sister's clothes and raping her. Sister testified that the rapes were violent and that she would \"try to fight and ... kick and get away from him,\" but Defendant \"started putting belts around [her], around [her] arms so that [she] couldn't flail.\" Sister stated that Defendant would sometimes bring his own belt to bind her arms, but more often than not he used her belt. Defendant threatened to divorce Mother if Sister told anyone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 Sister acknowledged that she had told police that during the rapes, Defendant would sometimes \"throw [her] around and grip on [her] hair.\" Sister also told police that Defendant would \"spank [her] buttocks so hard that it [became] red and it hurt\" and that the rapes caused her to bleed. And while Victim had testified that Defendant called her his \"baby girl\" when he abused her, Sister testified that Defendant never called her that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 Sister further acknowledged that during and after the alleged abuse, she maintained good grades and participated in extracurricular activities. She also admitted that after Victim had reported Defendant's abuse, Mother had asked Sister if Defendant had been abusing her, and Sister had replied that he had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Mother's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 Mother testified that although Victim told her in 2011 that Defendant had \"been touching her inappropriately,\" Mother believed Defendant when he denied abusing Victim because \"[h]e was the man that [she] was married to and getting ready to be sealed to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 Mother testified that when she learned that Defendant was having an affair with his new girlfriend, her \"world crumbled\" and she had \"suicidal thoughts.\" Mother stated, \"We were sealed in the temple, he was supposed to be my eternal spouse [but] he's having an affair.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 According to Mother, there was \"no possible way\" that Victim could have independently\n   known about the bottle of green jelly that Defendant had used on her. Mother testified that Victim had \"no access to the bedroom\" and that Defendant \"was a very private person\" who always kept the bedroom door locked when he and Mother were not home. Mother testified that the bedroom door was closed when she and Defendant were home and that she never found Victim \"poking\" around in their bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b622 Mother admitted that after Defendant moved in with his new girlfriend, she went to their house and confronted Defendant and pushed him. She stated that she was \"[v]ery angry at that time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 Mother further testified that Victim \"was a social butterfly\" and that both Victim and Sister were \"[a]s normal as teenagers can be.\" She stated that Defendant \"had a closer relationship\" with Victim because Defendant and Sister \"butted heads.\" Lastly, Mother testified that both girls remained active in their extracurricular activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Mother's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b624 Defendant's mother testified that she had stayed with the family during the summer of 2011 while she recovered from back surgery. She testified that she had not seen \"anything that alarmed [her] in behaviors involving the children and [Defendant]\" and that she did not see \"any changes in any behaviors between the two girls and [Defendant].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b625 Defendant's mother testified that on one occasion after Defendant moved in with his new girlfriend, Mother went to the girlfriend's house and \"took ahold of [Defendant] and just started shaking him.\" She also testified that Mother had stolen some of Defendant's property and that Mother had told her that she was \"going to see that she got [Defendant's] annuity [from an accident] for her girls.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 Finally, Defendant testified. He denied ever raping either Victim or Sister. Defendant acknowledged that he had admitted in his interview with the detective that there had been some \"inappropriate touching\" between Victim and himself. In explaining what he meant by \"inappropriate touching,\" Defendant testified that \"[t]here had been a couple of times that [Victim] had come into the bedroom and had climbed up in bed with [him] to snuggle\" and that \"she'd pull[ed] herself in really close to [him].\" He testified that he was once lying on his side when Victim \"started pulling herself back into [him] a little bit tighter, kinda scooching back in, trying to get close\" and that she had \"started rubbing up against [his] private areas with her back side.\" He clarified that by \"back side\" he meant her \"buttocks area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b627 According to Defendant, he and Victim had been lying there for a few minutes when she \"reached up and grabbed [his] hand and was kinda rubbing herself with it.\" He testified that Victim \"then pushed [his hand] down towards her private area\" and that \"when [he] realized [his] hand touched her private area\" he \"pulled [his] hand away and responded to her, telling her that's not what we do, it's not a good thing.\" Defendant testified that his garments never came off and that Victim's clothes never came off. He testified that \"there [was] skin-to-skin touching\" when Victim \"pushed [his] hand down toward her private area\" and that his \"hand actually touch[ed] her private areas underneath the clothing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b628 Defendant further testified that a similar incident occurred a few weeks later. He stated that after the second incident he told Victim, \"[W]e don't do that, that's not the right thing. I love you, we don't do things like this.\" Defendant denied ever being \"sexually aroused with [Victim]\" and stated that the inappropriate touching \"was [not] something that [he] intended to have happen\" nor \"something [he] wanted to have happen.\" Defendant testified that Sister's testimony was untrue and that he had never tied her up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b629 On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Defendant \"to explain how [his] penis touched [Victim's] private parts,\" and Defendant replied, \"I don't know.\" Defendant stated that Victim \"had snuggled back into [him] and was grinding against [him], grinding into [his] private parts.\" Defendant stated that he did not tell Mother what had happened because he \"knew that [she] would be very, very, very, very unhappy with any of it\" and that he was trying to protect Victim. The\n   prosecutor further asked Defendant, \"So, [the detective] asked you if there was any inappropriate touching and you're telling me that you confessed to touching [Victim] in her private parts with her [sic] hands and your penis to protect [Victim] from her mother?\" Defendant replied, \"Yes.\" Defendant stated that he was initially willing to confess to a crime to protect Victim, but he was no longer worried about protecting her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b630 Defendant also testified that several years previously, he suffered \"severe closed-head injuries\" that required brain surgery. Defendant stated that he still suffers from short-term and long-term memory problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b631 The jury convicted Defendant on all counts. He now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b632 Defendant raises two principal issues on appeal. First, he contends that \"the admission of evidence regarding other violent sexual crimes allegedly committed against a person other than the complaining witness was error that deprived [him] of his right to [a] fair trial.\" Second, he contends that \"the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by repeatedly eliciting testimony and making argument regarding various religious matters not relevant to the charges, by arguing facts that were not in evidence, and by expressing his own personal opinion and personally disparaging [Defendant].\" Defendant concedes that these issues were not preserved but asserts that we may reach their merits via the plain error and ineffective assistance of counsel exceptions to preservation. \"The plain error standard of review requires an appellant to show the existence of a harmful error that should have been obvious to the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Character Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b634 Defendant first contends that \"evidence of uncharged rapes was inadmissible and prejudicial, requiring reversal.\" Defendant contends that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence to Sister's \"allegations of extreme and violent rapes committed against\" her by Defendant. Alternatively, Defendant contends that the trial court plainly erred by not excluding this evidence sua sponte under rule 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b635 Around one month after Defendant and Mother separated, Sister came forward with allegations that she had been sexually abused by Defendant. At trial, Sister testified-without objection from trial counsel or intervention by the trial court-that Defendant had raped her approximately thirty times between early 2011 and the summer of 2013. Sister did not testify about specific incidents, stating that \"[t]here wasn't much variation between each time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b636 According to Sister, \"[f]or the first little while, [Defendant] would just come down [to her room] in his ... garments,\" and \"he would rub [her] back underneath [her] shirt.\" This happened \"for about ... six months.\" Sister testified that Defendant then started removing both his and Sister's clothes and raping her. Sister would \"try to fight and ... kick and get away from him,\" but Defendant \"started putting belts around [her], around [her] arms so that [she] couldn't flail.\" Defendant threatened to divorce Mother if Sister told anyone. Sister testified that when Victim first reported Defendant, Sister had \"an opportunity to write out a written statement\" but that she did not disclose the abuse then because she \"was scared.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sister ultimately disclosed Defendant's\n   alleged abuse in November 2013 when she visited her grandmother for Thanksgiving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b637 On cross-examination, Sister clarified that Defendant \"only started wearing garments after he and [Mother] were sealed in the temple.\" Trial counsel asked Sister, \"[S]o anything that he did with you was after the temple ceremony?\" Sister replied, \"No. No. No. ... [H]e would come down in ... clothes but then, towards the end, he would come in his garments.\" Sister stated that Defendant would sometimes massage her back and admitted that she never told Mother about it even though \"at that time ... [she] felt that that was inappropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b638 Trial counsel further elicited testimony from Sister that Defendant would often pull the belts so tight that her hands would go numb and she would feel \"pins and needles in [her] fingers.\" Sister acknowledged that she had told police that Defendant made her bleed, that Defendant would \"throw [her] around and grip on [her] hair or pull [her] hair,\" and that Defendant would \"spank [her] buttocks so hard that it [became] red and it hurt.\" She stated that she would \"yell[ ] out loud hoping that someone would hear,\" but \"[n]obody heard.\" Sister confirmed that these incidents were violent and that she had testified at the preliminary hearing that Defendant \"would tell [her] to shut up and ... put his hand over [her] mouth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b639 Rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence provides that \"[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with the character.\" Utah R.

Certainly, it was deliberate: counsel stipulated to the admission of the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b644 And the record shows that counsel's strategy was to attack Victim's credibility by portraying her testimony as an extreme fabrication concocted as part of a plot with Mother to get revenge on Defendant for his infidelity and his decision to seek a divorce. Trial counsel was able to use Sister's testimony to further that strategy by suggesting that Mother had enlisted both Victim and Sister in her revenge plot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b645 Trial counsel previewed this strategy during his opening statement. For example, he highlighted that \"these allegations came out when ... a divorce was pending.\" And he asserted that \"[t]his case is about revenge and retaliation and [a] money grab.\" Trial counsel told the jury that it would hear evidence that before Defendant and Mother were married, Defendant \"had been awarded an annuity from an accident\" and that \"after these allegations came out, it was [Mother's] plot to seize everything from him\" and that Mother had said \"that she's going to take all of his money, all of his annuity for her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b646 Trial counsel explained that the jury would hear \"allegations from [Sister] and ... how extreme they are.\" He stated that while Sister would testify that Defendant had \"tied her up with a belt, her hands, and she flailed and screamed constantly to get him to stop,\" there was \"no physical evidence whatsoever. No bruising, no nothing and no explanation, no logical explanation why this abuse, if it happened, was never being reported.\" Trial counsel further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   You will hear that [Victim] had been going to counseling for years, to various different counselors, people who are trained to help her to get these kinds of allegations out, but yet, none have ever come out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   You will hear that these girls' behaviors were never different. They acted the same before, [during] and after, happy children. Impossible for them to behave in that way if the abuse they allege was taking place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   You'll hear all of this and at times, it's going to be confusing and at times, we're going to point out all inconsistencies of these girls [and] we point out inconsistencies because inconsistencies show the difference between a real memory and a fabricated memory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b647 Trial counsel then elicited testimony to support this theory. To begin with, trial counsel highlighted many of the inconsistencies between Victim's preliminary-hearing testimony and her trial testimony. For example, while Victim testified on direct examination at trial that Mother was the first person she had told about Defendant's abuse, trial counsel elicited testimony from Victim that at the preliminary hearing, Victim had stated that the first person she had told about Defendant's abuse was a friend. Trial counsel highlighted other inconsistencies in Victim's testimony, including (1) the fact that Victim had contradicted herself regarding the timeframe of Defendant's abuse, (2) the fact that, at the preliminary hearing, Victim had failed to \"say anything about [Defendant] licking [her] or putting his mouth on [her] vagina,\" (3) the fact that Victim had never mentioned until trial that Defendant \"ejaculated inside of [her] and [she] had to go sit on the toilet ... to get it out,\" and (4) Victim's contradictions regarding the time of day Defendant abused her. Trial counsel also elicited testimony from Victim that she had \"maintained good grades from 2011 until now.\" Victim testified that she was upset when Defendant left and that \"prior to that time, despite what [she] said he was doing to [her], [she] was still close to him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b648 Trial counsel also highlighted inconsistencies in Sister's testimony. For example,\n   contrary to Sister's trial testimony, during the preliminary hearing, Sister had denied that Defendant had ever \"struck [her] while the incidents were taking place.\" Sister also testified that during and after the alleged abuse, she had maintained good grades, participated in extracurricular activities, and held a job. She testified that \"when [Victim] first reported this, [her] mother asked [her] if [Defendant] had been abusing her,\" and Sister \"told her no.\" Sister also failed to disclose the alleged abuse when police asked her for a written statement, even though the witness statement form had \"a disclaimer that tells people to make sure they fill that out honestly\" and \"if they fill it out and it's not honest, they could be charged with a crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b649 Trial counsel elicited testimony from Mother that she was suicidal after Defendant left her because Defendant \"was supposed to be [her] eternal spouse.\" Mother admitted that after Defendant moved in with his new girlfriend, she went to their house and confronted Defendant and pushed him. Mother described Victim as a \"social butterfly\" and stated that both Victim and Sister were \"[a]s normal as teenagers can be.\" Mother also testified that Victim and Defendant had a \"closer relationship\" than Sister and Defendant, and that Sister and Defendant \"butted heads.\" Lastly, Defendant's mother testified that Mother had threatened that \"she was going to see that she got [Defendant's] annuity for her girls.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b650 In closing argument, trial counsel reiterated the theme that Victim's and Sister's claims were fabricated. Trial counsel observed that, \"the whole time[,] these girls were living a normal life\"; that they continued to be involved in extracurricular activities; and that \"[t]heir behavior around [Defendant] in front of everyone was consistent.\" Trial counsel highlighted the inconsistencies in Victim's and Sister's testimonies and asserted that when traumatic events like the ones Victim and Sister claimed occur, \"memories form and you can recall them.\" Trial counsel asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Ask yourself, can anyone have this kind of suffering, as much as they claim and continue living a normal life? Why would anyone want to sit on [Defendant's] lap or go places with him? Why would anyone be social? If you were traumatized like these girls claim by that man, you would not be social, you would not be near him, you would not want anything to do with men, period. You would have major issues in your life and you would not have good grades, but yet, none of that is the case here.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Trial counsel observed that none of the counselors that Victim had seen over the years suspected that \"there was ongoing abuse\" and that Mother had described Victim as \"a social butterfly.\" Trial counsel further argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Are they saying these things because they're [mad] that [Defendant] left them, the person they thought was their father and they're mad at him when he left them and ruined their life[;] for once, they had stability in their life and he-he left them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Or are they saying it because they want part of his annuity? We heard testimony that the mom said, I'm going to get his annuity. She's not entitled to it unless he gets convicted and then [she] says that my daughters suffered extreme emotional distress and need money to compensate for their damages. What's going on here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Trial counsel also highlighted Mother's anger toward Defendant and reminded the jury that Mother had once attacked Defendant and contemplated suicide when she found out Defendant was leaving her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b651 Regarding Sister specifically, trial counsel highlighted \"how extreme\" and \"how violent\" her allegations were and reminded the jury of the fact that, \"when first asked if there had been anything inappropriate,\" Sister had said no, but then \"three weeks later, all of a sudden comes forward with these very serious allegations of being tied down and beaten, of being brutally raped.\" He also highlighted that Sister had not told the pediatric nurse \"about pain, nothing about bleeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b652 Trial counsel ended his closing argument by stating, \"[W]hen you look at the big picture, all of the inconsistencies, I'm going to ask you to find [Defendant] not guilty, because when everything is said and done, your story stays the same when it's a real memory and your story changes because you can't remember the lies you made up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b653 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that trial counsel's decision not to object to Sister's testimony was supported by a reasonable trial strategy-to persuade the jury that both Victim's and Sister's allegations of abuse were fabricated. Trial counsel highlighted inconsistencies in each girl's testimony and elicited testimony that they both acted normally, maintained good grades, and participated in extracurricular activities during and after Defendant's alleged abuse. Trial counsel emphasized the fact that the girls only reported the abuse after Mother's and Defendant's divorce was pending and that they could have been motivated to allege abuse because they were \"[mad] that [Defendant] left them\" or \"because they want[ed] part of his annuity.\" And trial counsel used Sister's testimony, specifically the timing and extreme nature of her allegations, to further the defense's theory that this case was \"about revenge.\" In sum, we conclude that the record indicates that trial counsel chose to refrain from objecting to Sister's testimony so that he could use her testimony to support the defense's overall theory of fabrication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b654 Trial counsel's choice to use Sister's testimony as part of the defense's trial strategy did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in light of the other evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As previously discussed, Defendant confessed to sexually abusing Victim. During his videotaped interview with the detective, Defendant admitted that he had \"touched [Victim's] private areas with [his] hands and with [his] privates\" \"[t]wo or three\" times. Although Defendant argues on appeal that this admission \"was somewhat ambiguous and allowed for multiple interpretations,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was given an opportunity on cross-examination to clarify his interview statement. Specifically, the prosecutor asked Defendant to confirm that he had said that he \"touched [Victim's] private parts with [his] hands and penis,\" and Defendant replied, \"That was what was on the video, yes.\" While Defendant's testimony was not an unequivocal admission of guilt, Defendant was given an opportunity to clarify his statement and instead chose to accept the prosecutor's interpretation of his words. In addition, as previously recounted, Victim testified in great detail about Defendant's abuse.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b611-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b655 Given the totality of the evidence, including Defendant's confession and Victim's detailed testimony, pursuing a fabrication defense was a reasonable trial strategy.
