The district court awarded Father custody of the two children: NSW, born in 2003, and ERW, born in 2006. In November 2017, Mother filed a \"Motion for Ex-Parte for Emergency Custody\" [sic]. Mother alleged that NSW had been expelled from school, Father had abandoned NSW by sending him to live with his paternal grandmother, and Father was alienating the children from her. On these grounds, she asked for \"emergency custody\" of NSW and ERW. Mother never served the motion on Father or his counsel. The district court denied the motion in a two-sentence order, which Mother now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] Mother alleges that the district court did not follow Wyoming law or consider the best interests of the children \"when making [its] decisions throughout these proceedings,\" and that the order was either clearly erroneous or contrary to the great weight of the evidence. She requests this Court grant her a modification of custody, visitation, and child support. Father contends that the order is not an appealable order and requests this Court dismiss the appeal, sanction Mother, and order her to reimburse him for fees and costs incurred to defend the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Although Mother, on appeal, asks for custody modification, she did not make that request in the district court. The motion from which Mother appeals can be interpreted only as seeking temporary custody modification. It was not made pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-2-204\">\n    Wyo. Stat.

In the body of the motion, Mother specifically moved the district court \"to grant me emergency custody\" of the children. Mother did not serve the motion on Father or his counsel, in accordance with her request that the district court enter the order ex parte-a procedure reserved for temporary relief in extraordinary circumstances. Without notice to the other party, \"a trial court may ...

Mother asks this Court to \"remand the current custody order,\" \"award primary physical custody\" of the children to her, set forth a reasonable visitation schedule, and \"[i]nstruct the District Court to calculate child support consistent with the new custody arrangement.\" She either seeks our untimely review of the 2014 divorce decree's provisions for custody, visitation, and child support; or she is asking this Court to review a custody modification decision that she never requested, and was\n   therefore never decided by the district court. Neither is even arguably reviewable on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b611] Even though \"[t]he litigant acting pro se is entitled to 'a certain leniency' from the more stringent standards accorded formal pleadings drafted by lawyers; ... the administration of justice requires reasonable adherence to procedural rules and requirements of the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Osborn v.
