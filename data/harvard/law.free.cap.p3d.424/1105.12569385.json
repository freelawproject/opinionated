(Air Systems) crashed a company truck while commuting to work one morning, sustaining fatal injuries. His wife, Geneinne Ellen Davis (Davis), filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Subsequently, both an administrative law judge (ALJ) and the Utah Labor Commission (the Commission) denied Davis's claim, determining that at the time of his death Worker was not acting in the course and scope of his employment and that Davis was therefore not entitled to workers' compensation benefits. Upon review, we decline to disturb the Commission's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Worker was employed by Air Systems to install air-conditioning units and ductwork in various construction projects in the Salt Lake City and Park City areas. Air Systems allowed Worker to drive a pickup truck owned by Air Systems back and forth each day from his home to the various worksites, and Air Systems allowed Worker to choose the route he took to the worksites each day. Air Systems paid the cost of fuel for the truck as well as all maintenance costs. Worker was sometimes accompanied by another Air Systems employee while commuting to work, and would sometimes use the truck to pick up materials and equipment from supply vendors or from Air Systems' office on his way to the worksites. Worker was not paid for the time he spent commuting to and from work in the truck, but was paid for time spent picking up materials and equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 On August 15, 2015, Worker left his home to commute to a jobsite in Park City, where he had been working periodically for several months. On that particular morning, Worker was not accompanied by any other employees, did not stop at Air Systems' office or any supply vendors, and was not transporting company materials or equipment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, on that particular morning, Worker chose to travel to Park City over Guardsman Pass, a narrow high-mountain road, instead of using the more conventional (and quicker) route up Parleys Canyon on Interstate 80. While traveling over Guardsman Pass, the truck went off the side of the road on a sharp curve and rolled down a steep mountainside. Worker was ejected from the truck and fatally injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Following Worker's death, Davis filed a claim with Air Systems seeking compensation for Worker's funeral and burial expenses. Air Systems responded by asserting that Worker was not acting \"in the course and scope of his employment\" at the time of the accident. Davis then applied for a hearing with the ALJ, who agreed with Air Systems and denied Davis's claim, determining that Worker was not acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident because, even though Worker was driving a company truck, Worker was commuting to work. Davis subsequently sought review with the Commission, which affirmed the ALJ's decision. Davis now seeks judicial review of the Commission's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Davis raises a single issue for our review: whether the Commission erred in denying Davis's claim for workers' compensation benefits related to Worker's death.

App. 1995) (stating that \"[a]s a general rule, injuries sustained by an employee while traveling to and from the place of employment do not arise out of and in the course of employment and are, therefore, not covered by workers' compensation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 However, there are several exceptions to the general \"going and coming\" rule, among them the \"so-called 'instrumentality' exception,\" whose application depends upon whether the vehicle in question is an \"instrumentality of the employer's business in light of the employer's benefit from and control over it.\"\n   <em>\n    Jex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972423\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/306/799/\">\n    2013 UT 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972423\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/306/799/\">\n    306 P.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Davis concedes that Worker was commuting to work when his accident occurred, and that the facts of this case therefore generally fall within the \"going and coming\" rule. However, Davis contends that the \"instrumentality exception\" to the \"going and coming\" rule applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 When analyzing whether a vehicle is an instrumentality of an employer's business, our supreme court has identified two critical factors: (1) the degree of control the employer exercises over the employee's use of the vehicle; and (2) the benefit the employer derives from the employee's use of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. These two factors are evaluated \"on a sliding scale,\" so that if one factor is only weakly present, a strong showing of the other factor will be necessary in order to establish that a vehicle is an instrumentality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37 n.7 (stating that \"[w]here employer control is lacking, a greater showing of benefit is required\"). Thus, in order to demonstrate that Worker's accident occurred in the course and scope of his employment, Davis must demonstrate that Air Systems exercised such control over the company truck and reaped such benefits from Worker's use of the truck as to make the truck an instrumentality of Air Systems' business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Before turning to an analysis of these factors under the facts of this case, it is important to note the breadth of the instrumentality exception to the \"going and coming\" rule. While other exceptions (such as the \"special errand exception\") are narrowly analyzed on a trip-by-trip basis and, if applicable, bring only a particular day's commute within the course of employment, the instrumentality exception is \"all-purpose,\" such that, if it applies, \"every work commute\" taken in a particular vehicle will fall within the course of employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19 &amp; n.2, 20, 48. Thus, in order for the instrumentality exception to apply in this case, Davis must demonstrate that Air Systems controlled Worker's use of the truck and/or reaped such a benefit from Worker's use of the truck to such a degree that every drive Worker took in the truck fell within the course of his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 We first analyze the \"control\" factor, and conclude that Davis makes only a moderate showing that Air Systems exercised control over his use of the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Davis first points out that Air Systems owned the truck (and took possession of it\n   after the accident) and paid fuel and maintenance costs. We grant Davis's point with regard to ownership-certainly ownership is a crucial indicator of at least the right to control. Indeed, the fact that Air Systems owned the vehicle gave it the right to place restrictions on its use and even gave it the right, if it wished, to remove the truck from Worker's possession entirely. Company ownership of the vehicle is, without question, a fact that demonstrates at least the potential for control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 But the fact that Air Systems paid for the fuel and maintenance costs related to the truck's use does not go very far toward indicating control. Ensuring that a vehicle is fueled and regularly maintained is part and parcel of vehicle ownership and operation, regardless of whether someone else is allowed to borrow or use the vehicle. Indeed, Air Systems would have had to pay fuel and maintenance costs on the truck even if it had elected to require the truck to be parked on its property every night. Similarly, had Worker used his own vehicle to commute to and from job sites, Worker would have needed to fuel and maintain that vehicle. We are unpersuaded that Air Systems' decision to pay for the fuel and maintenance costs associated with the truck meaningfully supports the conclusion that Air Systems controlled Worker's use of the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 It is also important here that, even though Air Systems, by virtue of its ownership of the truck, had the\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to exercise control over its use, as a factual matter it did very little to actually impose any restrictions on Worker's use of the truck. The only specific restriction to which Davis can point is the fact that Worker was not free to drive the truck wherever he wanted; rather, Air Systems only allowed Worker to use the truck to travel between his home, jobsites, Air Systems' offices, and various locations to pick up materials. There are other restrictions Air Systems could have imposed, but did not. For instance, Air Systems placed no restrictions on what Worker had to wear when operating the truck, or on what Worker had to take with him in the truck when driving it. Likewise, Air Systems placed no restrictions on Worker's ability to invite passengers to ride with him in the truck, and did not ever mandate that Worker transport other employees to worksites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972423\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/306/799/\">\n    2013 UT 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 42-43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972423\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/306/799/\">\n    306 P.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"providing a ride for [other employees] was ... not a requirement of [worker's] employment, but a mere request\"). Air Systems placed no restrictions on when Worker had to begin or end his commute. Moreover, and significantly for present purposes, Air Systems made no effort to dictate to Worker what route he had to take when traveling to and from his home in the truck. The hands-off approach taken by Air Systems in this case can be contrasted with more restrictive approaches taken by employers in other cases in which employers elected to place heavy restrictions on a vehicle's use.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8320482\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/153/179/\">\n    2007 UT 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8320482\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/153/179/\">\n    153 P.3d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the employer required the worker \"to carry a service gun, police radio, identification, flashlight, ticket book, report forms, and flares and wear appropriate attire in the vehicle at all times,\" and placed restrictions on when and under what circumstances passengers could ride in the vehicle).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 In summary, Air Systems owned the truck and, as owner, did have the right to control its use. But in order for this factor to weigh heavily in favor of Worker, more must be shown than simple company ownership of the vehicle. In this case, we do not view the level of control exercised by Air Systems as particularly high, and conclude that Air Systems' \"control over [worker] was no greater than its control over any other employee traveling to and from work.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VanLeeuwen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10340668\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/901/281/#p284\">\n    901 P.2d at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we conclude that Davis has made, at best, only a moderate showing with regard to the \"control\" factor. Especially considering the deferential standard of review we apply here, we have no reason to take issue with the Commission's determination that the \"control\" factor does not weigh strongly in favor of applying the instrumentality exception here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 Next, we analyze the \"benefits\" factor, and conclude that Air Systems realized only minimal or incidental benefits from Worker's use of the truck, and that Davis has made only a relatively weak showing with regard to this second factor. This\n   conclusion is guided by our supreme court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Jex\n   </em>\n   , in which it held that \"[m]ere incidental benefit is not sufficient, standing alone, to sustain invocation of the instrumentality exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Jex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972423\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/306/799/\">\n    2013 UT 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972423\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/306/799/\">\n    306 P.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 Davis first points out that Air Systems benefitted from Worker's use of the truck because Worker would more reliably get to work on time and because Worker would occasionally use the truck to give other Air Systems employees a ride to work. However, as our supreme court has noted, \"the benefit of having employees show up to work is not a meaningful one in light of the 'going and coming' rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. This is true even if an employee uses a vehicle to ensure that more than one employee arrives at work on time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 Davis further argues that Air Systems received a benefit from Worker's use of the truck because Worker sometimes stopped at a vendor or at the Air Systems office on his way to the worksites to pick up tools or equipment for one of the jobs he was working on. Indeed, during the administrative proceedings, a representative of Air Systems stated that he perceived Worker's capacity to haul tools and equipment to be the primary benefit Air Systems reaped from Worker's use of the truck. While the fact that Worker was able to use the company truck to haul materials he might not have been able to haul in a company car is a fact that demonstrates some benefit to Air Systems, this benefit did not depend on Worker's use of the truck for commuting purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Air Systems could have required Worker to drive his personal vehicle to a company parking lot and transfer to the company truck each day before picking up materials, and could have thereby reaped substantively the same benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 Finally, Davis asserts that Air Systems received a benefit from Worker's use of the truck because Worker, in driving the truck to his home every day, would have been more motivated to care for the truck as if it were a personal vehicle rather than treating it like a rental vehicle, thus improving the maintenance of the vehicle. While we do not doubt that this could theoretically have been the case, Davis cites no record evidence to support her contention that the truck was better maintained due to Worker's use of it, and in any event any benefit realized by Air Systems as a result of marginally better maintenance is a rather small benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 In summary, there is no question that Air Systems did realize some incidental benefit from allowing Worker to commute in the company truck: Worker arrived at work on time more reliably, maintenance may have been accomplished more regularly, and Worker could stop on his way to work and pick up materials. However, we do not view these benefits as particularly significant, and conclude that Davis has made only a relatively weak showing with regard to the \"benefits\" factor. We therefore have no reason to take issue with the Commission's determination that \"Air Systems' ... benefit from [Worker's use of] the truck [was] minimal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 Applying these two factors on a sliding scale, we conclude that Davis has failed to make the showing necessary to convince us that the instrumentality exception applies here. Davis cannot make a particularly strong showing on either part of the test. Accordingly, we simply cannot conclude that Air Systems' control over and benefit from Worker's use of the truck was such that \"every work commute\" Worker took in the truck should be considered within Worker's \"course of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972423\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/306/799/\">\n    2013 UT 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972423\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/306/799/\">\n    306 P.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 In fact, we find this case materially indistinguishable from our decision in\n   <em>\n    VanLeeuwen\n   </em>\n   , in which a landscaping company provided one of its supervisors with a company truck for use during his commutes, but placed no meaningful restrictions on the employee's use of the truck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VanLeeuwen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10340668\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/901/281/#p284\">\n    901 P.2d at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In that case, the employer received a much higher level of benefits than were realized in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8320482\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/153/179/\">\n    2007 UT 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8320482\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/153/179/\">\n    153 P.3d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the \"City benefitted from the program by having more officers available for immediate response, from better care of patrol cars, and from increased police visibility\"), and, as noted above, exercised a much higher degree of control over the employee's use of the vehicle,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (requiring the employee \"to carry a service gun, police radio, identification, flashlight, ticket book, report forms, and flares and wear appropriate attire in the vehicle at all times,\" and placing restrictions on when and under what circumstances passengers could ride in the vehicle).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 We see no infirmity in the manner in which the Commission applied the two-factor test for application of the instrumentality exception to the \"going and coming\" rule. There is ample support, both in the record and in the law, for the Commission's conclusions that Air Systems did not exercise a high degree of control over Worker's use of the truck, and that Air Systems derived only minimal or incidental benefits from Worker's\n   use of the truck. Accordingly, we decline to disturb both the Commission's determination that the truck was not an instrumentality of Air Systems' business, and its ultimate conclusion that Worker was not acting in the course of his employment at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    If Worker had stopped on his way to work to pick up materials before proceeding to Park City, Davis may have been able to invoke the \"special errand\" exception to the \"going and coming\" rule.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Drake v.

However, Worker was not transporting any such materials during the commute in question and, accordingly, Davis makes no argument that the \"special errand\" exception ought to apply in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Davis asserts, for the first time on appeal, that Air Systems benefited from Worker's use of the truck because Worker was \"essentially 'on-call' \" while using the truck and could be directed at any time by Air Systems to perform work-related errands using the truck. However, Davis cites no evidence in the record that Worker was ever asked to perform any such tasks in his off hours.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Davis argues that\n    <em>\n     VanLeeuwen\n    </em>\n    is inapplicable here because, as part of our discussion in that case, we included an analysis of the benefits that accrued to the employee (as opposed to the employer) from the employee's use of the truck. Davis correctly points out that the supreme court, in\n    <em>\n     Salt Lake City Corp.\n    </em>\n    , made clear that any benefits received by the employee \"are largely irrelevant to this scope-of-employment inquiry,\" and that \"[t]he benefits conferred on the [worker] cannot be used to offset or diminish the significance of the benefits derived by the\" employer.\n    <em>\n     Salt Lake City Corp. v.

However, our vestigial discussion in\n    <em>\n     VanLeeuwen\n    </em>\n    about employee benefits was brief, and does not appear to have played a critical role in the result reached. In fact, while we mention benefits to the employee twice in\n    <em>\n     VanLeeuwen,\n    </em>\n    the bulk of our analysis concerned the supervisor's assertion \"that [the employer] received a substantial benefit\" from the employee's use of the truck, and our examination of whether the supervisor was \"under the control and supervision of [the employer]\" during his commutes.\n    <em>\n     VanLeeuwen v.
