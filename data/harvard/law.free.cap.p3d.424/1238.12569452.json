Solvay claims that the manufacturing machinery and equipment (M\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   &amp; E) exemption from sales tax applies to its purchases of chemicals to create a \"working solution\" essential to its production of hydrogen peroxide. We reverse the trial court and remand for entry of summary judgment for Solvay because the chemicals at issue meet the definition of \"machinery and equipment\" under the M &amp; E exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. HYDROGEN PEROXIDE PRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Solvay operates a chemical manufacturing plant in Longview that manufactures hydrogen peroxide for sale. Integral to its production is a \"working solution\" composed of diisobutyl carbinol (DC), aromatic solvent G (ASG), and amyl-anthraquinone\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AQ). AQ is the critical ingredient for the creation of hydrogen peroxide, while the DC and ASG ensure the solution maintains the appropriate physical properties for resolution of the required chemical reactions. The taxation of Solvay's purchases of DC and ASG are at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The production of hydrogen peroxide requires three distinct steps: hydrogenation, oxidation, and extraction. The working solution makes a complete circuit through these steps to create hydrogen peroxide. It is then circulated back to the first step and the circuit begins anew. The working solution is removed from the plant only for maintenance or special projects. Although no part of the working solution becomes any part of the final product, the working solution may be thought of as \"a liquid catalyst in that [it] provide[s] a reactive surface for combination of the atoms/molecules that will become the final product.\" CP at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Longview plant as a whole maintains approximately 210,000 gallons of working solution at any given time. It consists of approximately 15 percent DC, 50 percent ASG, and 35 percent AQ. The relative proportions of the three components remain consistent throughout the entire hydrogen peroxide manufacturing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 During normal operation of the plant, some working solution is lost as it is piped through the various processes outlined above. On a weekly basis, some quantity of working solution also becomes contaminated and unusable. The plant loses approximately 900 to 1,000 gallons of working solution per week. Solvay samples and monitors the solution approximately twice a week to ensure that it maintains the proper proportions of each chemical. It is topped off about once per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Solvay usually purchases ASG and AQ pre-mixed together. It then adds additional ASG to reach the proportions it needs to create the working solution. Solvay usually makes two purchases of ASG per year, each of about 6,500 gallons. It makes four purchases of DC per year of an unknown quantity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 A Solvay employee stated in a declaration that \"[t]he working solution is a functional part of the reaction vessels and the reaction vessels cannot not [sic] operate without being filled with working solution.\" CP at 207. He also stated that \"[o]nce the working solution has been injected into the loop it has a useful life of approximately 4.5 years.\" CP at 209.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II. LITIGATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 In 2013, DOR audited Solvay for a period beginning in 2008 and ending in 2011. As a result, it calculated that Solvay owed $113,350 in \"use tax and/or deferred sales tax\" on DC and ASG it had purchased for use in its working solution. CP at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 Solvay appealed DOR's assessment to the DOR appeals division, which affirmed. In December 2014, Solvay paid the taxes assessed against it and filed a complaint in the Thurston County Superior Court for a refund of those taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 In December 2016, DOR issued a discovery request to Solvay, requesting copies of exemption certificates\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   it had provided\n   to sellers when purchasing ASG and DC. In February 2017, Solvay produced ten exemption certificates, all signed in February 2017, for purchases it made between January 2008 and November 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether DC and ASG qualify as \"machinery and equipment\" under the M &amp; E exemption. The trial court denied Solvay's motion and granted DOR's. Solvay appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 We review summary judgment orders de novo, performing the same inquiry as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Sheikh v.

It then analyzes the dictionary definitions of \"machinery,\" \"machine,\" and \"device\" in various dictionaries. Finally, it states that Rule 13601's list of examples of \"devices\" fit \"within the common dictionary definition of 'machinery and equipment' and 'device.' \" CP at 204. After that, the remainder of ETA 3121 analyzes the M &amp; E exemption's applicability to books and computer software specifically. ETA 3121's analysis of computer software provides guidance as to DOR's intended interpretation of unintuitive types of \"devices.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 33 Rule 13601 lists examples of \"devices\" as: \"[f]orklifts, chainsaws, air compressors, clamps, free standing shelving, software, ladders, wheelbarrows, and pulleys.\" Rule 13601(2)(c). Nothing in Rule 13601 limits the definition of \"software\" to specific situations. However, ETA 3121 explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Computer software satisfies Rule 13601's definition of device because it is performs [sic] a task and is also not attached to a building or site. Consequently, computer software can qualify for the M &amp; E exemption if it meets a used directly test. The issue is whether the computer software performs a task in relation to the qualifying operation. For example, a computer software program that controls the operation of equipment that cuts logs into lumber qualifies for the M &amp; E exemption. It performs a task, the control of a piece of eligible machinery, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   is used directly in the manufacturing operation. On the other hand, a CD-ROM of a repair manual for this equipment does not qualify for the M &amp; E exemption because the computer software does not perform a task in the manufacturing operation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   CP at 204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 34 All DOR's reasons for considering computer software to be a \"device\" for the M &amp; E exemption appear equally applicable to the chemicals at issue in this case. Like software, the chemicals do not fit with the common understanding of what a \"device\" is, but still perform an important role in the manufacturing process. ETA 3121 states that only software that \"performs a task in relation to the qualifying operation\" is a \"device\" under the M &amp; E exemption. CP at 204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 35 The working solution, flowing through its loop and providing the medium in which all of the chemical reactions required to form hydrogen peroxide occur, is as critical to Solvay's operations as the lumber software DOR references in ETA 3121. DOR's analysis of what makes software a \"device\" under the M &amp; E exemption is equally applicable to the working solution Solvay uses in its manufacturing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   C. INGREDIENT OR COMPONENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 36 Solvay additionally contends that its working solution is \"exempt as an ingredient or component of the reaction units that form the working solution loop.\" Br. of Appellant at 18. It claims that the \"working solution loop is composed of a series of reaction units or stages that are attached to the land,\" forming an industrial fixture of which the working solution is part. Br. of Appellant at 19 n.4. It compares the working solution to\n   the refrigerant in an air conditioner or the mercury in a thermometer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 37 DOR responds that the chemicals at issue \"merely circulate through various equipment in Solvay's plant.\" Br. of Resp't at 21. It contends that Solvay's argument fails to identify a specific piece of equipment that the chemicals become a part of, instead claiming they become an ingredient or component of \"the entire manufacturing process.\" Br. of Resp't at 22. We agree with Solvay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 38 The statutory definition of \"machinery and equipment\" includes \"tangible personal property that becomes an ingredient or component\" of \"industrial fixtures, devices, and support facilities.\" RCW 82.08.02565(2)(a). Webster's dictionary defines \"component\" to mean \"a constituent part.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INT'L DICTIONARY 466. It additionally defines \"ingredient\" as \"something that enters into a compound or is a component part of any combination or mixture.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INT'L DICTIONARY 1162.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 39 For the working solution to be an ingredient or component of the \"working solution loop,\" as Solvay argues, the loop itself must be an industrial fixture or device. A \"fixture\" is \"something that is fixed or attached as a permanent appendage or a structural part,\" or \"a chattel that has been so wrought into or annexed to realty (as a house) that it may be regarded as legally a part of it.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INT'L DICTIONARY 861. An industrial fixture, therefore, is best understood as something that is fixed or attached to an industrial site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 40 Solvay's working solution loop consists of the hydrogenator, the oxidizer, the extraction column, and all the reaction vessels and pipes that connect these mechanisms. It meets the dictionary definition of an industrial fixture, as it is \"fixed or attached\" to the Longview plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 41 A Solvay employee made an unrefuted declaration that the \"working solution is a functional part of the reaction vessels and the reaction vessels cannot not [sic] operate without being filled with working solution.\" CP at 207. Because the working solution loop is an \"industrial fixture,\" the working solution itself is an \"ingredient or component\" of it, making it \"machinery and equipment\" in its own right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   D. OTHER EXEMPTION STATUTE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 42 DOR contends that Solvay's expansive reading of the M &amp; E exemption would intrude on other tax schemes specifically designed for chemicals. It contends that allowing Solvay to obtain the M &amp; E exemption for its chemical purchases would allow it to \"avoid the more stringent requirements for receiving a sales tax exemption under RCW 82.04.050(1)(a)(iii).\" Br. of Resp't at 29. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 43 RCW 82.04.050(1)(a)(iii) exempts from retail sales tax:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Purchases for the purpose of consuming the property purchased in producing for sale as a new article of tangible personal property or substance, of which such property becomes an ingredient or component or is a chemical used in processing, when the primary purpose of such chemical is to create a chemical reaction directly through contact with an ingredient of a new article being produced for sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This exemption contains two distinct requirements: (1) the property must be purchased for the purpose of consumption in the production of a new article of tangible personal property or substance; and (2) it must either (a) become an ingredient or component of the new article or (b) be a chemical used in processing. RCW 82.04.050(1)(a)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 44 Although Solvay's working solution meets the latter requirement, it is not consumed in Solvay's production of hydrogen peroxide. This statute would therefore not exempt Solvay's purchases of working solution. Nonetheless, DOR contends that the existence of this exemption prevents the M &amp; E exemption from applying to the working solution or any kind of chemicals used in the manufacturing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 45 DOR's contention that calling DC and ASG \"machinery and equipment\" under the M &amp; E exemption would let it \"avoid the more stringent requirements\" for an exemption under this other statute is misleading. Br. of Resp't at 29. Neither statute has more stringent requirements than the other because\n   they apply to different items. One exempts machinery and equipment used in manufacturing; while the other exempts raw materials that are consumed in the manufacture of other products, often including chemicals. An additional exemption for chemicals used in manufacturing with different specific requirements does not convince us that chemicals can never qualify under the M &amp; E exemption. We reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   II. EXEMPTION CERTIFICATES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 46 DOR contends that, even if Solvay's purchases of DC and ASG qualify for the M &amp; E exemption, Solvay failed to provide DC and ASG sellers with exemption certificates, as required by RCW 82.08.02565(1)(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although it acknowledges that Solvay has now provided each seller with an exemption certificate, it claims that Solvay failed to \"strictly comply with all the express requirements\" of the statute. Br. of Resp't at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 47 The M &amp; E exemption requires that \"sellers making tax-exempt sales under this section must obtain from the purchaser an exemption certificate in a form and manner prescribed by the department by rule. The seller must retain a copy of the certificate for the seller's files.\" RCW 82.08.02565(1)(b). DOR regulations mandate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   The purchaser must provide the seller with an exemption certificate. The exemption certificate must be completed in its entirety. The seller must retain a copy of the certificate as a part of its records. This certificate may be issued for each purchase or in blanket form certifying all future purchases as being exempt from sales tax. Blanket certificates are valid for\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   as long as the buyer and seller have a recurring business relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Rule 13601(3)(a). DOR provides a standardized form on its website for purchasers to fill out and offer sellers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 13601(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 48 In this case, Solvay provided copies of ten single use exemption certificates it had provided to its sellers. Each certificate provided all of the information required by Rule 13601(3)(a). Each certificate was signed on February 8, 2017 and stated the purchase date it applied to. These dates ranged from January 2008 to November 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 49 Neither the statute nor the rule require a purchaser to provide a seller with an exemption certificate at the time of sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOR does not argue that there are any timing requirements for the required exemption certificates. Rather, it claims that Solvay must \"strictly comply with all the express requirements in a statute.\" Br. of Resp't at 32. Because Solvay provided its sellers with exemption certificates, it complied with all duties the statute imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 50 We conclude that the M &amp; E exemption applies to Solvay's purchases of DC and ASG for use in its working solution.
