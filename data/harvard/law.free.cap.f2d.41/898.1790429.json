This question has been before this and other courts a number of times, and it has been consistently held that a credit is not allowed when the Commissioner signs the schedule of overassessments for transmission to the collector. Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, 68 Ct. Cl. 97; West Leechburg Steel Co. v. United States, 40 F.(2d) 131; Atlas Powder Co. v. United States, 40 F.(2d) 136, and Pottstown Iron Co. v. United States, 40 F.(2d) 142, 145, decided by this court April 7, 1930, and United States v. Boston Buick Co. (C. C. A.) 35 F.(2d) 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">Some point is made by the defendant in this ease of the fact that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue did not sign the schedule of refunds and credits certified by the collector on June 19, 1924, but we think this is unimportant. It is shown that, under the practice of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in respect of refunds and credits, the collector is required to certify the schedules to the Commissioner, and they are examined and checked by the Bureau and approved by the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who acts for \u2022 the Commissioner in this respect, and, if there appears to be no amount to be refunded, as was true in the ease of this taxpayer, the schedules are not signed by the Commissioner, but are filed in the appropriate place as a part of the permanent records of. the Bureau. In Pottstown Iron Co. v. United States, decided by this court April 7, 1930, this court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">\u201cUpon the receipt of these documents [schedule of overassessments and certificates of refunds and credits] from the collector the Commissioner, if he finds that any interest is payable upon the eredit, has a cheek issued for the amount thereof which is forwarded to the collector, together with the certificates of overassessment to be mailed to the taxpayer. If the Commissioner determines that an overpayment to be credited is one that bears no interest under the statute, he forwards the certificates of overassessment to the collector with instructions that he mail them \u25a0 to the taxpayer. Whether the Commissioner, in such a case, signs the schedule certified to him by the collector or not, the credit is taken and made effective by whatever action the Commissioner takes in approving the report of the collector. It is stipulated that in cases of this kind the certificates of overassessment received from the collector with his reports are returned by the Commissioner to the collector for mailing to the taxpayer. The date on which this is done, if the Commissioner does not formally sign the schedule, would constitute the Commissioner\u2019s approval-of the report of the collector and would make ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>fective the credit of the overpayment against the additional assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">In this ease the facts establish that the credit was finally allowed on June 30, 1924. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of $33,470 as interest on the overpayment for 1920 computed under the provisions of section 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924, and judgment in its favor will be entered for that amount. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">This ease was tried before the appointment of WHALEY, Judge. He therefore took no part in its decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
