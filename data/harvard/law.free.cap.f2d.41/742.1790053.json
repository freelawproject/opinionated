Subsequent to the decision of that case, the plaintiffs, in order to protect themselves against the same infringer, were forced to file a supplemental bill to protect themselves against further alleged infringement. On final hearing, such supplemental bill was dismissed. Whereupon this appeal was taken. In our view, the court below failed to grasp the significance of our former decision. As shown by the excerpt quoted, the gist of the patent was the result obtained by it, namely, a covering \u201cprotected from wear by a clamped continuous sleeve.\u201d That was the new product, a monopoly of which the patentee was given. All three of defendant\u2019s devices protect the covering from wear, and they do it by a continuous sleeve which allows no abrasion. They contend, however, they do it a different way from Murray, in that he used a groove in his cross-sections, and they use no groove. But it will be noted that, while Murray used a U-shaped, cross-section groove, that the effective, functional part or agency of his groove was the outer leg of the U and its depressed bottom, while the other leg of the U was nonfunctional. It was the upstanding shoulder of the functional side of the U which the material covered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>and the depression o\u00ed the bottom of the U which permitted continuous clamping.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">While the patent showed a groove, and in fact it was a groove, it was its recess bottom that constituted its functional efficiency. Indeed, such recess character was mentioned in the opinion wherein we refer to \u201cmaking such a groove or <em>recess </em>on the lower side of these cross-strips that the plurality of enveloping sleeves located between the clamping ends of the transverse sections eould be dispensed with and be replaced by an unbroken continuous sleeve, which extended over the whole length of the rim of the lower supporting frame.\u201d The defendants, instead of using a groove or cross-section recess, have recessed the entire cross-section by lowering it. But this change of form retains the whole substance of functional capacity of Murray\u2019s groove. What they have in effect done is to retain the functional side of Murray\u2019s groove and flatten out the nonfunctional side thereof by the use of a lowered or depressed cross-strip. While varying the form, they have retained function, and their depressed and recessed cross-strip is the functional equivalent of Murray\u2019s groove. In our judgment, they obtain Murray\u2019s result, and they do it by what are the mechanical functional equivalents of Murray\u2019s device. For doing so they must be adjudged infringers, and as such liable to account.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
