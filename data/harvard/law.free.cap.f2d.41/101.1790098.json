Among them are the following: Fruit-O-Jel, Advo Jel, Nu-J ell, Easy Jell, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">It appears from the record that John F. Enz, appellee\u2019s predecessor, had used the mark \u201cEnzo\u201d for evaporated milk and other products; and that, after he sold his so-called milk business, he engaged in the business of manufacturing jelly powders, and on. April 9, 1926, adopted and used the mark \u201cEnzo Jel\u201d on jelly powders.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">It is contended by appellant that \u201cappellee has appropriated its valuable trade-mark Jell-0 and has merely reversed it in Enzo Jel. 0 Jel is Jell-0 backwards,\u201d and that the use by appellee of its trade-mark will be likely to cause confusion in the trade and deceive purchasers. Indeed, it is contended that confusion has already occurred as a result of the use by appellee of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is concluded with the following observations :</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u201cThere is no similarity between the two marks either as to appearance, sound or suggestion, except as to the word \u2018Jel\u2019 or \u2018Jell\u2019 which is descriptive and as such not register-able. It appears from the record that there are many trade names for jelly powders in which the word \u2018Jell\u2019 forms a part of the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">\u201cThe controlling part of the applicant\u2019s mark is the word \u2018Enzo,\u2019 derived from the applicant\u2019s surname Enz, to which is added the suffix O. There is nothing in the opposer\u2019s mark which corresponds in any particular to the applicant\u2019s surname.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">In the case of Apex Electrical Manufacturing Company v. Landers, Frary <em>&amp; </em>Clark, 41 F.(2d) 99, this court, in an opinion by Graham, P. J., said:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">\u201cIn our opinion, there has been too much refinement of r\u00e9asoning by both the Patent Office and counsel in some of these eases in the attempted dissection of words used as trade names. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">\u201cIn considering whether a trade name will be confusing or not, consideration should be given to the whole word.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">The quoted language is particularly applicable to the issues and the contentions of counsel for appellant in the ease at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">We cannot accept the views of counsel for appellant that the mark \u201cEnzo Jel\u201d is merely the mark \u201cJell-O\u201d reversed. On the contrary, the marks are quite different in appearance and sound. They do not suggest that the goods on which they are used have a common origin. Accordingly, in our opinion, their use on goods of the same descriptive properties will not be likely to cause confusion or deceit in the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">We are in accord with the conclusion reached by the Commissioner of Patents, and his decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
