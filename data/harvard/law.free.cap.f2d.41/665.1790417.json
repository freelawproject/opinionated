Appellant claims that the applicant had a fair hearing before the immigration authorities and that the order of deportation is therefore conclusive on the courts, and that therefore habeas corpus should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">The appellee, Yip Kim Wing, a China-man, at the age of 16 years, applied for admission into the United^States as the son of Yep Wah Yuen, <em>a </em>citizen of this country. He was denied admission and ordered to be returned to China because such relationship was not satisfactorily proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">The alleged father, Yep Wah Yuen, was admitted to the United States June 17, 1908, as the foreign-bom son of Yup Lung Sat, a native-born American citizen. He has made three trips t\u00f3 China. On his return from the first trip, May 5, 1913, he claimed to have married Jin Shee and to have a son named Yep Kim Wing, bom as a result of such marriage, on September 24, 1912. On his second return from China, May 23, 1922, he stated that he had a son, Yep Kim Wing, 11 years old, and one Yep See Wing, born June 21, 1921. On his third and last return he brought the applicant with him and claimed to have left in China the above-mentioned son, Yep See Wing, and two younger sons, Chun Wing, born June 15, 1927, and Gwong Wing, born March 25, 1929. In the present record the alleged father gives the date of birth of Chun Wing as October 25,1927, with no explanation of the discrepancy in his two statements as to date of -birth. Applicant stated that his alleged brother Chun Wing was bom \u201clast year,\u201d tenth month, first day (November 12, 1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">Another discrepancy in the testimony between the .alleged father and applicant relates to the grandparents of applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">The applicant testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b698-18\">\u201cQ.

And you are correct in your statement that her father died three or four years a^\u00b0 and tbat/T wife\u2019s mother died ten years ag\u00b0? <em>A. </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\">The applicant thus states that both his Patemal grandparents died in his Dome in the ^ ^ ^ T? ago/7 and that his grandfather died first, wMe the alleged father states tbat his father died \u201e6 or 7 yoars <em>\u00bb </em>giving tbe date ag Deoember; 1923, or January, 1924, about a year previous to his mother, who he states died in 1924, and that both died in the old village of Hong Mee and not the new village of Ung On. It will be observed that the only point on which they agree, aside from the names, is that the grandfather died first. As to the maternal grandparents, the appellee states that his grandfather whose name he \u00a7'lves as ^ ^ years a^\u00b0 he at fded *moral f company^ with his mother; that his grandmother, named Wong Shee, died about a year \u00a1ater&lt; His alleged father states that his wi\u00a3o\u2019s father\u2019s name is Jin <em>Lee </em>Hung; that he died three or four years ago; that his wife\u2019s mother\u2019s name is Wong Shee, and that she died about ten years ago. We have set out the testimony in order to show that there was no inadvertent transposition of grandParents, due to a misunderstanding of the terms \u201cmaternal\u201d and \u201cpaternal.</p>\n<p id=\"AG9\">,, Tte appellee states that he had a brother older than himself who died when he was only a few days old; hence he was born and died before the appellant vas born. Tho al_ leged fethep denies tHs_ He le\u00a3t Sm Fran_ cisco Fecember 1911^ and claims to have been married January 14, 1912, and the applicant was born September 24, 1912. Obviously there could be no older child of this marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"A4gp\">The alleged father testified in April, 1920, that his wife was then living in Hong Mee village and in 1926 that she lived in that village with his two sons, the applicant and Yep See Wing. He now claims that his family moved from the Hong Mee village to the Ung 0n villaSe about ei&amp;ht or nine years a\u00a3\u00b0 or lg21 <em>^ </em>1922_ He tegtified tbat tbeso two villages &amp;re aW three blockg apart. Ap_ pellee n1aiM that he was born in Ung On village and has never been in Hong Mee village \u00a3n b\u00a3s jjfe g0. fgj. as be ean remember. Appellee further states that the only school he ever attended was in the Ung On village, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>while the father claims that he never went to school there and always went to school in the Hong Mee village and that he was attending school there when the alleged father arrived from China in January, 1927. The appellee and the alleged father also differ as to the name of the teacher. The alleged father also testifies that the mother wrote him that the applicant had attended school in Sai How village for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"AU4\">_. \u201e ....... In view of these discrepancies m the testimony relied upon by the applicant, we cannot say that the applicant was denied a fair hearing on the question of his right to enter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"As0\">The order of the District Court is re- , _ verse .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
