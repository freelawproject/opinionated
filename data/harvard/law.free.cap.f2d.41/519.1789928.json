Thereupon the defendants entered a plea of nolo contendere. The court then heard evidence offered for the government and for the defendants, and then announced a finding that each of the defendants was guilty, as charged; and, after overruling motions to vacate the finding of guilty, and for new trial, and in arrest of judgment, adjudged them guilty, imposed sentence, and allowed appeal. This practice has been more or less prevalent where it was desired to submit a criminal cause to the court without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-24\">There is here presented a situation strikingly like that in United States v. Norris, 50 S. Ct. 424, 425, 74 L. Ed. 1076, decided by the Supreme Court May\"26,1930, wherein it was said that, \u201cin the face of an indictment good in form and substance, and of a plea thereto of nolo contendere, which * * * has all the effect of a plea of guilty for the purposes of the case,\u201d and that \u201cfor that case [the plea of nolo contendere] was as conclusive as a plea of guilty would have been.\u201d It whs also held that the stipulated evidence there received, after plea of nolo contendere, was \u201cineffective to import an issue as to the sufficiency of the indictment, or an issue of fact upon the question of guilt or innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-26\">The only contention urged in appellant\u2019s brief is that the seetion of the National Prohibition Act upon which this information is based is unconstitutional. In view of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Richbourg Motor Co. et al. v. United States, 50 S. Ct. 385, 74 L. Ed. 1016, May 19, 1930, we need give no consideration to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-27\">In the Norris Case it was said: \u201cIf the stipulation be regarded as adding particulars to the indictment, it must fall before the rule that nothing can he added to an indictment without the concurrence of the grand jury by which the hill was found.\u201d In the present case the aeeusation was by an information of the United States attorney. If it may be assumed that sworn testimony presented after the plea of guilty, or its equivalent nolo eontendere, may \u201cbe regarded as adding particulars to the\u201d <em>information </em>(a matter we do not decide), we would have here the further particulars of sale by defendant of a still designed for making whisky \u2014 upon representation by Roitman, the main defendant, that it would make whisky \u2014 and explicit directions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>as to the manner of its use, and the ingredients needed, and the process of making, and pouring from a jug a glass of whisky, which he gave the customer, remarking that with that apparatus just as good whisky could be made; whereupon the still, with other appliances and coloring matter, was sold and delivered to the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The judgments must be, and they are, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
