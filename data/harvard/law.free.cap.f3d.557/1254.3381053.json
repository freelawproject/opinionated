Williams argues that the district court erred in lowering his sentence by only three months because the amended guidelines do not adequately rectify the disparate treatment of individuals sentenced for crack cocaine crimes. Because the record does not make clear whether the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when resentencing Williams, we VACATE Williams\u2019s sentence and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-16\">In 2004, Williams was convicted of distribution of crack cocaine (\u201cCount 1\u201d) and carrying a firearm during a drug offense (\u201cCount 4\u201d). Rl-35. The district court calculated Williams\u2019s base offense level at 20. After awarding Williams a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the court arrived at a total offense level of 17. Williams\u2019s criminal history category was set at IV, yielding a guideline range of thirty-seven to forty-six months of imprisonment for Count 1, followed by a consecutive sixty-month sentence for Count 4. The district court sentenced Williams to forty months of imprisonment for Count 1, followed by the consecutive sixty-month sentence for Count 4 for a total of one hundred months of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-17\">Williams filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706. R1-54 at 1-2. In his motion he asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that mandatory treatment of the amended provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and \u00a7 2D1.1 would violate <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). R1-54 at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-20\">On 13 March 2008, the district court reduced Williams\u2019s sentence for Count 1 from forty to thirty-seven months of imprisonment, based on a reduction of his base offense level from 17 to 15. The sixty-month sentence for Count 4 remained unchanged. Rl-55. The two-level reduction of the base offense level resulted in an amended guideline range of thirty to thirty-seven months of imprisonment on Count 1 \u2014 down from his original range of thirty-seven to forty-six months. Williams now appeals the district court\u2019s amended sentence to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This authority is limited to those guideline amendments listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) that \u201chave the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (Nov.2008). Amendment 706 is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 713 (Nov.2008). Effective 1 November 2007, Amendment 706 adjusted downward by two levels the base offense level assigned to each threshold quantity of crack cocaine listed in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, a district court has discretion to reduce the sentence of a defendant whose sentencing range has been lowered by Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">Any sentencing reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements direct that a defendant is not entitled to a full resentencing during \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3). The Commission\u2019s policy statement further provides that district courts are to determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the subsequently amended provision had been in effect at the time the defendant was originally sentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). This is achieved by substituting the amended provision for the corresponding guideline provision that was applied when the defendant was sentenced, while \u201cleaving] all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, a district court may not reconsider any of its original sentencing determinations other than the provision subject to the amendment. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">After recalculating the guidelines, the district court next must consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. 1(B); <em>see also United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that the district court \u201cmust consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d when determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s original sentence). The district court is not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, \u201cas long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 762 (citing <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997) (finding that the district court\u2019s short order, referencing the government\u2019s brief that enumerated specific elements relevant to a \u00a7 3553(a) inquiry, provided sufficient reasons for the court\u2019s sentence)). In <em>Eggersdorf, </em>we found that the district court\u2019s statement that it had \u201creviewed the motions, the Government\u2019s [response], the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>record, and [] otherwise [was] duly advised\u201d was sufficient, especially as (1) the motion set forth the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cword for word,\u201d (2) the government\u2019s response cited facts \u201crelevant to the ... section 3553(a) inquiry,\u201d and (3) the same judge presided over both the original sentencing and re-sentencing. <em>Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322-23. While the district court must undertake this two-step analysis, its decision whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, and to what extent, remains discretionary. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Although Williams does not expressly raise the issue on appeal in so many words, we liberally interpret Williams\u2019s argument as a challenge to the court\u2019s failure to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to his resentencing. In this case, the district court summarily granted Williams\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction, without discussing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as required under \u00a7 1B1.10 and <em>Vautier. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 762; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. 1(B); R1-55. While we have considered a district court\u2019s failure to adequately discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors only in those cases in which sentencing courts have denied motions for sentence reduction, we see no reason why the same underlying rationale should not extend to instances in which district courts grant such motions. The commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 specifically provides that a sentencing court \u201cshall consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining: (I) whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted; and (II) the extent of such reduction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)). When considered in conjunction with our relevant precedent, the guideline\u2019s commandment admits of little ambiguity. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court was required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making its reduction determination and observe that the record does not allow us to further conclude that the district court did so on this occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">Williams appeals the district court\u2019s sentence imposed after granting his motion to reduce sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because the record is silent as to whether the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when re-sentencing Williams, we VACATE Williams\u2019s sentence and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
