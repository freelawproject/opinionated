Moseley appeared before a notary public of Limestone County, and severally acknowledged that they had executed and delivered it for themselves and for the firm of Moseley Brothers, for the purposes and considerations stated in it. And it appears from the certificate of the county clerk of that county that the deed, with the notary\u2019s certificate, was filed in .his office for record at nine o\u2019clock.on the morning of January 24,1884, and was duly' recorded, the same day, at ten o\u2019clock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-11\">\u25a0The petition alleged, among other things, that, on the 23d day of January, 1884, the firm of Moseley Brothers was insolvent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>and being insolvent, S.

The special demurrer showed that the petition was excepted to as insufficient in law upon the following grounds: 1, one or more partners could not make an assignment for the benefit of creditors that would bind the copartnership, and pass the property of the firm; 2, an assignment by two of the partners only could not be\u2019 ratified by the partners not signing or executing the same, so as to interfere with rights of creditors accruing before such ratification, and any pretended ratification which would operate as an assignment of real estate could not take place by parol or by .parol ratification; 3, the deed, signed and executed by two of the partners only, could not and did not purport to convey and pass the individual and separate property of the partners not signing it, and, consequently, the deed was void upon its. face; 4, the deed does not, on its face, show that it was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>by Moseley Brothers as insolvent debtors, or by them in contemplation of insolvency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-4\">The demurrers were sustained, and, the plaintiff declining to amend, the action was dismissed with costs to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-5\">The statutes of Texas in force when the above assignment was made provided: \u201c Art. 65a. Every assignment made by an insolvent debtor, or in contemplation of insolvency, for the benefit of his creditors, shall provide, except as herein otherwise provided, for a distribution of all of his real and personal estate other than that which is by law exempt from execution, among all his creditors in proportion to their respective claims, and however made or expressed, shall have the effect aforesaid, and shall be construed to pass all such estate, whether specified therein or not, and every assignment shall be proved or acknowledged and certified and recorded in the same manner as provided by law in conveyances of real estate or other property.\u201d \u201c Art. 65c. Any debtor desiring to do so, may make an assignment for the benefit of such of his creditors only as will consent to accept their proportional share of his estate, and discharge him from their respective claims, and in such case the benefits of the assignment shall be limited arid restricted to the creditors consenting thereto, the debtor shall thereupon be and stand discharged from all further liabilities to such consenting creditors on account of their respective claims, and when paid they shall execute and deliver to the assignee for .the debtor a release therefrom; provided, that such debtor shall not be discharged from liabilities to a creditor who does not receive as much as one-third of the amount due and allowed in his favor as a valid claim against the estate of such debtor.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>Art. <em>65s. </em>Any attempted preference of one creditor or creditors of such assignor shall be deemed fraudulent and without effect.\u201d Act of March <em>24, 1879, </em>as amended April <em>7, 1883, </em>Sayles\u2019s Texas Civil Stat. vol. 1, pp. 61, 62, 68.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b632-6\"><em>Mr. Ba/wnie Robertson </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-7\">The only ground upon which the invalidity of this assignment can be asserted is, the failure to embrace in it the private property of all of the members of the firm, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>partnership property. It is contended, in support of the judgment of the Circuit Court, that in the case of <em>Donoho </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>58 Texas, 164, it was held that no assignment is good under the Texas statute, unless it conveys the whole of the property of the partner and of every, member thereof not exempt from forced sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-5\">There.is an expression in the opinion in that case that gives some color to this claimbut an examination of the case will show that the assignment then before the court provided for releases by the creditors, which the one now in controversy does not do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-6\">The distinction in this respect between the two classes of' assignments is apparent. \"When a release is exacted of a creditor, the whole of the property that is subject to the demands of the creditor should be surrendered by the assignment. On the other hand, when no release is exacted \u2014 when the creditor surrenders no right or remedy\u2014-no good reason exists why the assignment should not stand good for such property as it conveys for the benefit of all of the creditors alike rather than be subjected alone to the demands of a single attaching creditor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-7\">The doctrine contended for has not been announced by the Supreme Court of Texas in a single case where the assignment in question was like the one now before the court \u2014 one for the equal benefit of all creditors without exacting a release. On the contrary, every case subsequent to <em>Donoho </em>v. <em>Fish Bros. &amp; Co. </em>has carefully limited the rule to assignments that exact releases. <em>Baylor County </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>69 Texas, 330; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>77 Texas, 619; <em>Still </em>v. <em>Focke, </em>66 Texas, 715; <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>61 Texas, 406, 410; <em>Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>68 Texas, 638.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b633-8\">No appearance for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b633-9\">Mb. Justice Hablan,</author>\n<p id=\"Af5\">after stating the facts as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">As no brief has been filed in behalf of the defendants in error, and as we are not informed by the record of the precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ground upon which the court below proceeded, we will restrict our examination of this case to the single ground upon which the plaintiff'in error questions the correctness of the judgment. After referring to the provisions of the above statute, he says that the only ground upon which the invalidity of the assignment of January 23, 1884, can be asserted is the failure to embrace in it the private property of all the members of the firm as well as the property of the partnership. We take this to be a concession that the deed did not pass the private property of the individual members of the firm. This concession was, we think, required by a reasonable interpretation of that instrument. The words used import an assignment by the firm of only firm property to pay the debts due by the firm to such creditors as would accept the provisions of the deed. \u00a7o that the inquiry is, whether the statute relating to assignments for the benefit of creditors embraced such a\u2019 deed as the one in question. We lay out of view the allegation in the petition that no property was owned by Moseley Brothers or by any of the members of the-firm that was not conveyed by the deed, except such as was exempted from.sale by law, because the officer, having in his hands an attachment against property, so conveyed, can only be guided, in the absence of actual notice, by the legal effect of the deed. As said in <em>Donoho </em>v. <em>Fish Bros. &amp; Co., </em>58 Texas, 164, 166, 167, \u201ca deed which purports to convey only such property as the makers thereof own as copartners cannot be held to pass the title to any other without making for the makers of the deed a contract which they never intended.\u201d Besides, the allegation referred to does not distinctly state that the several partners owned no property in their respective individual rights. It is rather the statement of a legal conclusion, namely, that all the property which the assignors owned, whether as partners or in their respective individual rights, not exempt from forced sale, was conveyed by the deed of assignment; whereas, as we have stated, the words of the deed do ..not embrace any property, except such as the firm of Moseley Brothers owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In <em>Donoho </em>v. <em>Fish Bros. &amp; Co., </em>which was the case of an assignment by a partnership of partnership property for the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>benefit of such creditors as would accept its provisions and release the debtors, the court said: \u201c Such. an assignment is not contemplated by the act, even if there were no restriction in it upon the right of' all creditors to participate in the proceeds of the sale of the property by requiring a release of the debtor; for the.act contemplates that all of the property, real and personal, of the debtors \u2022 making the assignment, except such as is exempt from forced sale, whether the same be part-. nership property or such as is owned by each partner in his own individual right, shall pass by the assignment. The law does not undertake to make assignments for debtors; it provides how an assignment may be made, and aids and makes complete an assignment which evidences an intention of the debtor to comply with its provisions.\u201d After observing that-if the deed of assignment purported to convey all the property belonging to the members of a firm, however defective in form, it would pass not only the property each partner owned in his individual right, but also such as they owned in partnership, the court proceeded: \u201c If, however, copartners could under the act make an assignment of partnership property only for the benefit of the creditors of the firm alone, . . . there would be an insuperable objection to such an assignment containing a clause requiring a release of the debtors by the creditors as a condition to the right to participate in the proceeds of the assigned property. . . . He who wants the benefit of the act by which he seeks to be released from his j\u00fast debt, without full payment, must comply with the act by conveying to the assignee all of the property required to be conveyed, whether the same be owned by him individually, or as a member of a firm, and if he does not do so by the terms of his deed aided by the law, his assignment is void and interposes no obstacle to' creditors in collecting their debts by usual process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Subsequently, in <em>Coffin </em>v. Douglas, 61 Texas, 406, 407, the Supreme Court of Texas said: \u201c In the case of <em>Donoho </em>v. <em>Fish Bros, &amp; Co., </em>58 Texas, 164, it was held that an assignment made by partners, which did not purport to pass title to all the property owned by the partnership, and by the members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>thereof in their separate rights, and not exempted from forced sale, could not be sustained as a valid assignment under the act of March 24, 1879.\u201d So in <em>Still </em>v. Focke, 66 Texas, 715, 723: \u201cA partnership may make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, but in such case, the property of the partnership, and the property of each member of it, which is subject to forced sale, must pass by the assignment.\u201d See also <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>77 Texas, 619, 620, 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">It is, however, contended by the plaintiff that <em>Donoho </em>v. <em>Fish Bros. &amp; Co., </em>and the other cases cited, were cases of deeds of assignment of firm property only, which required creditors, accepting their provisions, to discharge the debtors from their respective-claims; whereas, the deed here in question did not exact releases from the accepting creditors. There is no good reason, it is argued, why a deed, which does not require releases from creditors as a' condition of participating in the benefits of an assignment, \u201c should not. stand good for such property as it conveys for the benefit of all the creditors alike rather than be subjected alone to the demands of a single attaching creditor.\u201d <em>We </em>cannot assent to the interpretation so placed by plaintiff upon the cases cited. It may well be doubted whether the requirement in the deed of assignment, that the proceeds of the property shall be applied to the payment and satisfaction of the firm\u2019s indebtedness \u201c in the proportion of the respective claims of such of our creditors as shall accept these presents,\u201d does not import that such creditors must release the assignors; otherwise the reference to accepting creditors was meaningless. Independently of this view, the Supreme Court of Texas .distinctly holds, in the cases cited, that, the statute in question did not contemplate an assignment by partners for the benefit of creditors of partnership property only, that is, such an assignment is not provided for by, and cannot be administered under, that statute. An \u2022assignment of that character may be valid as between the assignors and the creditors who accept- its provisions. But no reason is given other than the one above stated -\u2014 which we deem insufficient \u2014 why such an assignment would be an obstacle in the way of creditors who do not accept its provisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>from collecting their- debts in the ordinary modes prescribed by law, or why the marshal might not, in the discharge of his duty, have levied the attachments in his hands upon the property in dispute, subject, it may be, to the rights of creditors who accepted the proceeds of the property covered by the deed. The issue in the present action is not, and could not be, whether Crow, Hargardine &amp; Co. and Goodbar, White &amp; Co. had sufficient grounds for suing out their attachments against the property of Moseley Brothers, nor as to the duty of the marshal to execute them by levying upon any property or interest in property that was subject to an attachment issued against the property of that firm. The issue is as to the authority of that officer to seize, as the property of the firm of Moseley Brothers, the\u2019particular property embraced by the deed of January 23, 1884. We have seen that no title passed to Doyle, the assignee, in virtue of the statute regulating assignments for the benefit of creditors; and as the contrary view is the only ground upon which the correctness of the judgment below seems' to be questioned in this court, we need not consider the case in any other aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
