Upon the return of the cause the master reported that -the amount due him up to July 1, 1887, upon the bonds, as if exchanged, calculating the interest at five per cent with semi-annual rests, and giving interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>upon interest at the same rate, was \u00a310,620 ; and up to February 28,1883, upon the same basis, was \u00a386251^r.

(2) Is not the appellant entitled to his three unpaid half yearly interest coupons which have been simply ignored by the Circuit Court ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>I. The appellant claims that upon all past-due coupons and' past-due bonds, he is entitled that interest be calculated according to the rate fixed by law in South Carolina, viz. seven per cent. That this is the rate in South Carolina upon both overdue bonds and coupons, was not disputed. But if it is doubted now, it is enough to refer to the case of <em>Langston </em>v. <em>South Carolina Railroad Co., </em>2 So. Car. 249.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-4\">It has also been held in South Carolina that where a person entered into a, bond, conditioned for the payment of four per cent interest on legacies till the legatee comes of age, to pay him his proportion of the principal, the legatees are entitled to seven per cent interest <em>(i.e. </em>the legal interest of the State) from the time the bond becomes due. <em>Gaillard </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>1 Nott &amp; McCord, 67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-5\">In <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>22 How. 118, in which the opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Taney, the court held, as to the mode of computing interest where the note did' not, by the contract, carry the interest expressed until its full satisfaction, that, when it fell due, the statute must interpose and regulate it. See also <em>Walnut </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>108 U. S. 683.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWe\">Also in South Carolina when the interest is payable at certain times, interest is calculated on interest from the dates it fell due. <em>O'Neall </em>v. <em>Bookman, </em>9 Rich.

S. 74, this \u201cquestion of interest is always one of local law;\u201d the rule of this court is the same as that of South Carolina. <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>22 How. 118; <em>Aurora City </em>v. <em>West, </em>7 Wall. 82; <em>Bernhisel </em>v. <em>Firman, </em>22 Wall. 179; <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Trust Co., </em>100 U.

Hoes the law of South Carolina, seven per cent, govern ? or does the law of England, five per cent, govern? We submit that the law of South Carolina does!</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-9\">No question of law has been more unsettled than this \u2014 whether the' <em>lex fori </em>or the <em>lex loci contractus </em>shall prevail. It has never been definitely settled.' See 16 Am. Law Review, 497; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Story Conflict of Law's, 7th ed. \u00a7 296, <em>a. </em>One of the most recent and satisfactory solutions is by Professor Bar of Goettingen. He says: \u201c If in some foreign country where a subject of this country has an estate or a trading house, a higher rate, of interest than ours is allowed and is in use by reason that capital is more scarce or the security is not so good, then the foreign lender, with whose money the estate has been improved or the trading concern extended, is entitled even in our courts to demand his -higher rate of interest as was arranged. The restrictions on- the rates of interest are local taxes upon the price of money. The opposite theory, instead of .benefiting our citiz\u00e9ns, would destroy their credit.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-5\">In our case, no rate of interest after maturity is fixed, nor is any place fixed for its payment after maturity \u2014 no agent is appointed in England, to accept service of legal proceedings \u2014 nor was it' in any way possible to obtain a judgment in England which could be enforced against the company\u2019s property. The only remedy Ooghlan had was to appeal to the State, or, as that, since the close of .the war, is notoriously useless, to enforce the statutory mortgage given to the State to secure their bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">The cases in the \u2018United States Supreme Court show the sam\u00f3 apparent discrepancy, though real agreement on the point suggested by Professor Bar that, after maturity, the rate of interest allowed is that of the place where the money is really used. <em>De Wolf </em>v. Johnson, 10 Wheat. 367; <em>Andrews </em>v. Pond, 13 Pet. 65; <em>Cook </em>v. Moffat, 5 How. 295; <em>Miller </em>v.

These coupons are still attached to the bonds, in the hands of the appellant, who is also the holder of the bonds. That they are not barred by time was not questioned. They became due January and July, 1867, and January 1,1868. This suit was begun on the 4th April, l\u00a3ol. Twenty years is the bar to the bonds in South Carolina. <em>Shubrick </em>v. Adams, 20 So.

Ea/rle </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-4\">Mr. Justice Harlan,</author>\n<p id=\"A1N\">after stating the cas\u00e9, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We have seen that the bonds in suit were redeemable on the first day of January, 1866, and not before without the consent of the holder, and were payable in pounds sterling with interest at the rate of five per cent per annum from date, the interest to be paid semi-annually on named days, \u201c on presenting the proper coupons for the same at the house of Palmers; Mackillop, Dent <em>&amp; </em>Co., London, where the principal will also be redeemed on the surrender of this certificate.\u201d The contract, therefore, was one which in all its parts was to be performed in England. Nevertheless, it is contended that the principal sum agreed to be paid should bear interest at the rate, seven per cent, fixed by the laws of South Carolina. The only basis for this' contention is the mere fact that the bonds purport to have been made in that State. But that fact is not conclusive. All the terms of the contract must be examined, in connection with the attendant circumstances, to ascertain what law was in the view of the parties when the contract was executed. For, as said by Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Wayman </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>10 Wheat. 1, 48, it is a principle, universally recognized, that \u201cin every forum a. contract is governed by the law with a view to which it was made.\u201d And by Lord Mansfield, in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>2 Burrow, 1077, 1078 : \u201c The parties had a view to the lavv of England. The law of the place can never be the rule when the transaction is entered into with an express view to the law of another country as the rule by which it is to be governed. Now here the payment is to be in England; it is an English security, and so intended by the parties.\u201d Referring to these and many other cases, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Matthews, held, upon full consideration, in <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>106 U. S. 124, 136, that the law upon which the nature, interpretation and validity of a contract depended, was that which the parties, either expressly or presumptively, incorporated into it as constituting its obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tion. This doctrine was reaffirmed in <em>Liverpool &amp;c. Steam Co. </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co., </em>129 U. S. 397, 458, where it was said that, according to the great preponderance, if not the uniform concurrence of authority, the general rule was, \u201c that the nature, the obligation and the interpretation of a contract are to be governed by the law of the place where it is made, unless the parties at the time of making it have some other law in view.\u201d The elaborate and careful review of the adjudged cases, American and English, in the two cases last cited, leaves nothing to be said, upon the general subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">What law, then, did the parties have in Anew as determining the legal consequences resulting from the non-performance of the contract between them? Presumptively, the law of England, where the contract Avas to be entirely performed. The bot\u00edds and coupons were to be presented and paid there, and not elsewhere. They were to be paid in pounds sterling at a designated house in London. The fair inference is that the railroad company negotiated the bonds abroad, and made them payable in that city, in order to. facilitate a sale of them to foreign buyers. Every circumstance connected with the contract tends to show that the parties intended that all questions in respect to performance or the legal consequences of a failure to perform, were to be determined by the law of the place, and the only place, where the obligation to make payment could be discharged, and where the breaeh of that obligation would occur, if payment was not made at the appointed \u2022time and place. In this view of the contract, the rate of interest, after the maturity of the obligations, was not determinable by the law of South Carolina. This is abundantly established by the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In <em>De Wolf </em>v. Johnson, 10 Wheat. 367, 383, the court said: \u201c The legal fulfilment of a contract of loan, on the part of th\u00e9 borrower, is repayment of the money, and the security given is but the means of securing what he has contracted for, which, in the eye of the law, is to pay where he borrows, unless another place of payment be expressly designated by the contract.\u201d. In <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>13 Pet. 65, 77, Chief Justice Taney, speaking for the court, said: \u201c The general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>principle in relation to contracts made in one place to be. executed in another is well settled. They .are to be governed by the law of the' place of performance; and if the interest allowed by the laws of the place of performance is higher than that permitted at the place of the contract, the parties may stipulate for the higher interest without incurring the penalties of usury.\u201d So, in <em>Carnegie </em>v. Morrison, 2 Met. (Mass.) 381, 397, Chief Justice Shaw, after stating the general rule to be that the <em>lex loci contractus </em>determines the nature and legal quality of the act done, whether it constitutes a contract, etc., said : \u201c But a contract, made in one country, may contemplate the execution of deeds, or other contracts, making payments or doing other legal acts, in another; in regard to which, the law of the foreign country, where the act is to be done, will govern the contract.\u201d In <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>The Earl of Waldegrave, </em>2 Beavan, 282, 284, which was an action against the acceptor of bills of exchange, drawn in Paris, where the drawer and' acceptor were at the time resident, and made payable in London, the bills, on their face, did not state any particular rate of interest. Lord - Langdale, Master of the Bolls, after observing that the law of the country where a contract, merely personal, is made, determines its validity and interpretation, While the law of the forum regulates the mode of suing, and the time within which suit must be brought for non-performance, said: \u201c The contract of the acceptor, which alone' is now to be considered, is to pay in <em>England; </em>the non-payment of the money when the bill becomes due is a breach in <em>England </em>of the contract which was to be performed in <em>England. </em>Upon the breach, the right to damages or interest immediately accrues; interest is given as compensation for the non-payment in <em>England </em>and for the delay of payment suffered in <em>England; </em>and I think that the law of <em>.England, </em>that is, the law of the place where the default has happened, must govern the' allowance of interest which arises out of that default.\u201d See also, <em>Boyces Edwards, </em>4 Pet. 111, 123; Miller <em>v.

S. 384, are in entire harmony with these principles. <em>Tilden </em>v. <em>Blair </em>was an action by the holder of a bill drawn at Chicago, Illinois, upon parties in New York, and accepted payable at a bank in New York. The defence was usury, and the question was presented as to whether the contract was a New York or an Illinois contract. If a New York contract, there could have been no recovery; for, by the law of that State, if a contract was usurious, it was void, and no recovery could have been had of principal or interest. The court held it to be an Illinois contract and its validity determinable .by the laws of that State, for the reason that before the acceptance had any operation, before it became a bill, the acceptors (for whose accommodation the bill was drawn) sent it to Illinois to be there negotiated, and, by that act, indicated a purpose to create an Illinois bill. The court also based' its judgment, in part, upon an Illinois statute providing that when any contract or loan is made in that State, or between its citizens and the citizens of any other State or country, bearing interest at a rate that was legal in Illinois, it should be lawful to make the principal and interest payable in any other State or Territory, or in London, in which case the contract or loan should be deemed, and considered as governed by .the laws of Illinois, and not be affected by the laws of the place where it was to be performed. Rev. Stats. Illinois 1874, p. 615, c. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">It was because of that statute that a note given in Illinois by a citizen of that State to a Connecticut corporation, payable in New York, for money loaned by the latter to the former, and secured by mortgage upon real estate in Illinois, was held, in <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>not to be a New York contract in respect to the interest that might be taken, but to be, in that regard, governed by the laws of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"A2C\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The presumption arising from the face of the bonds, that the legal consequences of a failure to pay them, according to their terms, were to be determined by the law of the place of performance, is strengthened by the practical construction the parties put upon the contract after, the bonds matured. Seven coupons, with the .instalment of interest for July 1, 1866, all held by appellant, were \u201c capitalized \u201d upon the basis of treating the \u00a3500 bonds as bonds for \u00a3600, and the \u00a3250 bonds as bonds for \u00a3300. The appellant ref\u00fcsed to surrender his bonds, for fear that by so doing he would lose the benefit of the State\u2019s guaranty of them; yet he received-interest from time to time as if they had been exchanged. On the ,13th of April, 1869, a payment was made to him of interest due July 1,1,868, which was endorsed on his bonds, in this form : \u201c Paid on this bond \u00a315, half-yearly dividend due 1st July, 1868, as if it had been exchanged for a new bond.\u201d A similar endorsement was made on his bonds for each half-year\u2019s dividend or interest up to July 1, 1880. When the receiver, in Claflin <em>v. </em>South Carolina Railroad Company, made payments of interest, such payments were stamped upon the bonds in this form: \u201c Paid \u00a330 sterling, interest due July 1,1878, and January 1, 1879.\u201d For the interest paid to him for July 1, 1879, appellant executed a receipt in this form: <em>\u201c </em>Received of Baring Brothers <em>&amp; </em>Co., as agents of John H. Fisher, receiver of the South Carolina Railroad Company, ninety pounds sterling, being interest due July 1, 1879, on bonds of the Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad Company, of \u00a3500 each, with eight coupons attached, representing 600 pounds sterling, and numbered, respectively, as follows: 18, 19, 20, 22, 23.\u201d Receipts of the same kind were given for him, by his London bankers, for the interest due January 1,1880. Similar payments of interest were made and endorsed, throughout the whole period from July 1, 1868, to July 1, 1880, on the twelve original \u00a3250 bonds, differing from the others only in showing that the half-yearly interest paid on those bonds was \u00a37 10s. \u25a0 The receipts or endorsements on both series of bonds show that, commencing regularly with the interest due July 1, 1868, but including the instalment due July 1, 1866, Coghlan received interest, at the rate of five per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>cent per annum, Upon the \u00a3500 and \u00a3250 bonds,, respectively, as if exchanged for \u00a3600 and \u00a3300 bonds. He admits, in his deposition, that the only demand ever made by or on -his behalf of interest, at the rate of seven per cent on the bonds was by his original complaint in this suit filed August 28, 1880. These facts make it clear that the claim of interest, after the maturity of the bonds, at the rate of seven per cent inste\u00e1d of the rate of five per cent, was an afterthought upon \u25a0his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In what has been said, we have assumed that the allowance of interest at the rate of five per cent per annum was in conformity with the law of the place of payment. The court was not informed by the pleadings or proof as to what that law was, and judicial notice could not, therefore, be taken of it. <em>Liverpool Steam Co. </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix Ins. </em>Co., 129 U. S. 397, 445, and authorities there cited. The railroad company makes no complaint of the allowance that was made of interest, and the appellant does not claim that a larger allowance was required by the .law of the place of performance. He insists only that ' he was entitled, of right, after the maturity of the bonds and \"the respective coupons, to interest at the rate, seven per cent, fixed by the.laws of' South Carolina; and this, notwithstanding the guaranty by the State of the faithful performance .of the contract of loan was upon the condition that \u201c the interest to be received thereby and made payable thereon \u201d should not . exceed the rate of five per cent per annum. For the reasons already stated, we are of opinion that .the law of that State did not determine the rate of interest, and that this interpretation of the contract, if it were doubtful, is sustained by the practical construction placed upon it by the conduct of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">One other question in the case requires notice at our hands. The railroad company did not prove payment of the instalments of interest due January and July, 1867, and January, 1868, although the evidence shows payment of the interest due July 1, 1866, and the interest accruing on and after July 1, 1868, up to July 1,1880. A reversal is asked upon the ground, among the others already examined, that the court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>not requiring the interest due on the above dates, respectively, to be paid with interest after maturity to the date of the final' decree. No mention is made in the special master\u2019s report of May 5, 1882, or in the interlocutory decree of 1883, or in the master\u2019s report of 1887, or in the final decree of 1887, of .the interest due January and July, 1867, and January, 1868. There was no exception to the reports of 1882 and 1887, upon the ground that they did \u25a0 not include interest for those three periods of six months. The reasonable inference is that the appellant did not produce before the master and prove the interest coupons .for those periods, or did not ask that they be included in the report as to the amount due upon the basis fixed in the- interlocutory decree of 1883. Having failed to except to the report upon the ground that it did not include them,- we do not think that the appellant should be now heard, to urge this as an objection to the final decree. Besides, as by the evidence the interest due July 1, 1866, was included with the interest due July 1,1868, in the capitalization whereby the \u00a3500 and \u00a3250 bonds were treated as if exchanged for \u00a3600 and \u00a3300 bonds, it would be strange if the instalment of interest due for the intermediate periods of January and July, 1867, and January, 1868, were not embraced by that arrangement. There is no explanation of this in the record. It is not an unreasonable presumption, in view of all the circumstances, that in some way, not disclosed by the evidence, those coupons were settled, or treated as settled, when the railroad company commenced in 1869 to pay, and the appellant received, interest on the bonds, as if exchanged for new bonds of \u00a3600 and \u00a3300. Be this as it may, we are not inclined to disturb the decree upon the ground that it does not make' provision for the interest coupons due January and July, 1867, and January, 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-5\">Mu- Justice Gray did not hear the argument and took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
