The defendant thereupon said that the facts' in the case were fully set forth in the complaint, and that he could not answer further, whereupon judgment was entered for plaintiff, as prayed for in his complaint.

S. 273, as decisive of this. It is admitted that that case is an authority in point. It is respectfully submitted that there was error in the judgment of the court on that question, and that it should be overruled. The decision in that case seems to have been based on a construction of sections 2853, 2854, 2855 and 2860, Rev. Stat., without reference to other sections that explain them. \"When all the provisions on the subject of consular invoices are read together as a whole, it is clear that they were never intended to apply to free importations; they are in fact repugnant to such a construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-9\">Id <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mosby </em>the court says: \u201c In addition to this, it is entirely clear that the question of determining whether goods to be shipped will, when imported into the United States, be free from duty is a question which could not be left to the determination of a consul.\u201d With all dire respect it seems to be a <em>-non sequitwr </em>to say that a consul determines that imports are free of duty in a case where he is not called on to perform any official duty in regard to them. As the consul never hears of a shipment where he certifies no invoice, it is hard to see how it is left to him to determine whether the goods are free or. dutiable, or where his judgment comes in.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>The Chief Justice:</author>\n<p id=\"Ag2\">The judgment is reversed and cause remanded, with a direction to sustain the demurrer and to dismiss the action, upon the authority of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>133 U.
