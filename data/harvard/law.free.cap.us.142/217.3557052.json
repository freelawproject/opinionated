Its railroad in Maine was constructed by the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad Company, under a charter from that State, which authorized it to construct and operate a railroad from the city of Portland to the boundary line of the State; and, with the permission of New Hampshire and Vermont, it constructed a railroad from that city to Island Pond in Vermont, a distance of 149\u00a3 miles, of which 82\u00a3 miles are within the State of Maine. In March, 1858, that company leased its rights and privileges to the defendant, The Grand Trunk Railway Company, which had obtained legislative permission to take the same; and since then it has \u2022 operated that road and'used its franchises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-10\">A statute of Maine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> passed in 1881, enacted that every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>corporation, person or association, operating a railroad in the State, should pay to the state treasurer, for the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>State, \u201c an annual excise tax for the privilege of exercising its franchises \u201d in the State, and it provided that the amount of such tax should be ascertained as follows: \u201c The amount of the gross transportation receipts, as returned to the railroad commissioners for the year ending on the thirtieth of September next preceding the levying of such tax, shall be divided by the number of miles of railroad operated, to ascertain the average gross receipts per mile; when such average receipts per mile shall not exceed twenty-two hundred and fifty dollars, the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>shall be equal to one-quarter of one per centum of the gross transportation receipts; when the average receipts per mile exceed twenty-two hundred and fifty dollars, and do not exceed three thousand .dollars, the tax shall be equal to one-half of one' per centum of the gross receipts; and so on, increasing the rate' of the tax one-quarter of one per centum for each additional seven hundred and fifty dollars of average gross receipts per mile or fractional part thereof, <em>provided, </em>the rate shall in no event exceed three and one-quarter per centum. \"When a railroad lies partly within and partly without this State, or is operated as a part of a line or system extending beyond this State, the tax shall be equal to the same proportion of the gross receipts in this State, as herein provided, and its amount determined as follows: the grbss transportation receipts of such railroad, line or system, as the case may be, over its whole extent, within and without the State, shall be divided by the total number of miles operated, to obtain the average gross receipts per mile, and the gross receipts in this State shall be taken to be the average gross receipts per mile, multiplied by the number of miles operated within this State.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-4\">The act also provided that the governor and council, on or before the 1st of April in each year, should determine the amount of such tax and report the same to the state treasurer, who should forthwith give notice thereof to the corporation, person or association upon which the tax was levied; and that such tax should be due and payable, one-half on the 1st of July next after the levy and the other- half on the 1st of October following; and it declared that if any party should fail to pay the tax as required, the state treasurer might proceed to collect the same, with interest at the rate of ten per centum per annum, by an action of debt in the name of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">The defendant, The Grand Trunk Railway Company, made no returns as a corporation, but it furnished the data and caused the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad Company to make a. return of the gross transportation receipts over its road, 149\u00a3 miles in length, including the 82-J miles in Maine, for the years 1881 and 1882, and upon this return the governor and council, pursuant to the statute, ascertained the proportion of the gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>receipts in the State, and assessed the tax in controversy accordingly. The tax thus assessed for 1881 was $9569.66, and for 1882, $12,095.56, and, to recover these amounts as debts to the State, the present action was brought in the Supreme Judicial Court of the State of Maine, and, on application of the defendant, it was transferred to the Circuit Court of the United States. The defendant pleaded <em>nil debet, </em>accompanied with a statement of special matters of defence. By stipulation of the parties, the case was tried by the court, which held that the imposition of the taxes in question was a regulation of interstate and foreign commerce, in conflict with the exclusive powers of Congress under the Constitution of the United States, and was therefore invalid. It accordingly gave judgment for the defendant, that the plaintiff take nothing by its writ, and that the defendant recover its costs. From that judgment the case is brought to this court on writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-5\"><em>Mr. Charles E.

I, Sec. 8, Part 3, of the Constitution of the United States ? IS such a tax a regulation of or an interference with interstate and foreign commerce? We contend that it is not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">We do not deem it profitable to examine all the cases where this question has been before the court in its various phases. We refer only to those upon which we rely as bejng closely in point, sustaining our contention, and to their present status in this court as authority. The cases of <em>State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, </em>15 Wall. 284, and the <em>Delaware Railroad Tax, </em>18 Wall. 206, are, we think, decisive in support of our proposition, if they are still binding authority upon this court. A chronological examination of these cases will give a clear idea of the law as it is held to-day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The case of the <em>State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts </em>was one where the State of Pennsylvania assessed a tax upon th\u00bf Heading Hailroad Company, a corporation created by the State of Pennsylvania, under a statute that required railroad companies incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania to \u201c pay to the Commonwealth a tax of three-fourths of one percentum upon the gross receipts of said company,\u201d and as a basis for said tax the company was required to transmit to the auditor general \u201c a statement, under oath or affirmation, of the amount of the gross receipts of the said company during the preceding six months.\u201d Here is to be noticed a very important distinction between the Pennsylvania statute and the Maine statute involved at bar. The Pennsylvania statute does not confine the \u201c gross receipts \u201d to those received within the State; the Maine statute does. The Pennsylvania statute in terms \u2014 no exception appearing in the act and in its practical application \u2014 applied to all receipts from transportation as well without the State as within it. It covered receipts from freight exported without the State. It could and did operate <em>exh'a territorially. </em>The Maine statute does not and cannot, and certainly the Maine statute is less open to the imputation that it is a regulation of interstate commerce than the Pennsylvania statute. In that case the court held that the Pennsylvania statute was valid, (1) because it was 9 a tax upon the fruits of such transportation after they had become intermingled with the general property of the carrier; and (2) upon the ground that it was a tax upon the' value of-the franchise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\"><em>We </em>presume that the cases of <em>Fargo </em>v. Michigan, 121 U. S. 230, find <em>Philadelphia Steamship Co. </em>v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326, will be relied upon as overruling the case of <em>State Tax upon Railway Gross </em>Receipts, but before discussing those cases it is important to call attention to the respect paid by this court to that case as authority up to the time of the decisions in those two cases. See <em>Osborne </em>v. Mobile, 16 Wall. 479; <em>Erie Railway Co. </em>v. Pennsylvania, 21 Wall. 492; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Charleston, </em>96 U. S. 432; <em>Brown </em>v. Houston, 114 U. S. 622; <em>Hall </em>v. DeCuir, 95 U. S. 485; <em>Moran </em>v. <em>New </em>Orleans, 112 U. S. 69.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>In a dissenting opinion in the case of <em>Pacific Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>118 U. S. 557, 593, Mr. Justice Bradley, with whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Gray concurred, treats the case of <em>State Tax on Railway Gross </em>Receipts, as still authority and binding upon the court, and says upon that point: \u201cWe have omitted to cite a number of cases corroborating the views we have expressed. The case of <em>State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, </em>15 Wall. 284, is weighted with arguments and considerations in this direction. We would also refer to the cases of <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Mobile, </em>16 Wall. 479; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>17 Wall. 560; <em>Railroad Commission Cases, </em>116 U. S. 307, 334, 335; \u201d thus clearly assuming that the first case referred to was still binding as authority in the United States Supreme Court, and no intimation is made in the dissenting opinion that the doctrine asserted in that case had been in any way at that time questioned, disputed or denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\"><em>Fargo </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>so far from overruling <em>State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, </em>indirectly affirms it. It makes the following distinctions between the two cases: First, the corporation which was the subject of that taxation was a Pennsylvania corporation, having the situs of its business within the State which created it and endowed it with its franchises. Upon these franchises thus conferred by the State it was asserted the State had a right to. levy a tax. Second, this tax was levied upon money in the treasury of the corporation, upon money within the limits of the State, which had passed beyond the stage of compensation for freight and had become like any other property or money liable to taxation by the State. The case before us has neither of these qualities. The corporation upon- which this tax is levied is not a 'corporation of the- State of Michigan, and has never been organized or acknowledged as a corporation of that -State. The.money which it received from freight carried within the State probably never was within the State, being paid to the company either at the beginning or the end of its route, and certainly at the time the tax was levied it was neither money nor property of the corporation within the State of Michigan. Neither of these grounds of distinction obtain in the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>As to <em>Philadelphia &amp; Southern Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>122 U. S. 326, inasmuch as the court, took pains to distinguish the case then under consideration from the second ground relied upon in <em>State Tax on Railway Cross Receipts, </em>it is a fair presumption, at least, that the court were not then prepared to declare that ground unsound. \"We are not aware that the case of <em>State Tax on Railway Cross Receipts </em>is questioned or denied in any other decision in this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-4\">The case of the <em>Delaware Railroad Tax, </em>18 Wall. 206, is, we think, strongly in point in our favor. That was a case where the tax, though not assessed upon the gross railway receipts, was assessed upon net earnings or income received from, all sources during the preceding year, and with the exception of this distinction between the particular sum upon which the tax was assessed, which we submit is in no sense material to the question under discussion, the act of the legislature by virtue of which the tax was assessed was strikingly parallel to that at bar. On the hearing in this court the state officers of Delaware withdrew their appeal, and the. inquiry of the court was thus limited to the validity of the act so far as it imposed the taxes specified in its first and fourth sections. The tax im-. posed by the first section is the tax that is parallel to the tax at bar. Among other objections it was contended that the act conflicted with the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the several States, and upon this point the court in the opinion say : \u201c The tax imposed by the act in question affects commerce among the States and impedes the transit of persons and property, from one State to another, just in the same way, and in no other, that taxation of any kind necessarily increases the expenses attending upon the use or posses-. sion of the thing taxed. That taxation produces this result of itself constitutes no objection to its constitutionality.\u201d See also <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>21 Wall. 466.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\">For these reasons we must submit that when the cases of <em>Fargo </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>and the <em>Philadelphia Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>are confined to the precise facts before the court in each case, neither of them can be held to be in .point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>against our contention. While' no one can examine the opinions of this court during the last fifteen years upon this question of interstate commerce without becoming impressed with the obvious tendencies to enlarge the doctrine, and limit the power of the State to regulate or affect in any way commerce or its instruments, we think that the fact that in the two most recent cases in the United States that have been announced by the court, that of <em>McCall </em>v. California, 136 U. S. 104, and <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad </em>v. Pennsylvania, 136 U. S. 114, where the court passes adversely, under this clause in the Constitution, upon statutes imposing license taxes, three of the justices dissented in each case, may indicate that the doctrine applicable to these cases has been extended as far as a fair construction of the Constitution trill authorize the court to go. It seems to us that the limit has been reached in this case, and that, unless the court' are prepared to still further extend it, the cases upon which we rely are unshaken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">Now that Congress, by its recent interstate commerce legislation, is regulating -many of these matters, and giving a legislative definition of the proper limits of the Federal and state powers, there would not seem to be any occasion for any extension of these Federal powers by construction on the part of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\">It is further submitted that the method provided in the statute of determining the value of the franchise upon which this tax should be assessed is one that is eminently fair and just to the corporation, though it may be argued that it is in fact, by its method of application, a mere tax upon the use of the franchise. In the language of the court in <em>State Tax on Railway Cross Receipts </em>the tax at bar \u201c imposes no greater burden upon any freight or business from which the receipts come than would an equal tax laid upon a direct valuation of the' franchise.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AU5g\"><em>Mr. A.

The defendant in error is a foreign corporation, and the case finds that its principal place \u25a0 of business is at Montreal. The receipts went to the home office. The statute does not base the tax upon that ground;</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\">The questions involved in the present contention are confined to the following inquiries: (1) Was the business of the defendant in error commerce between the States or with a foreign country ? (2) Is this tax placed upon it \u201c for the privilege of exercising its franchises within the State,\u201d a burden upon, or otherwise a regulation of such commerce?</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\">The rule to be Applied depends.upon the facts presented by the record. Repeated and well-considered cases have left no doubt as to what, the law is. If the record presents a case where the business in relation to which the tax is levied is interstate or foreign commerce, and the tax placed upon it, by tlie burden it imposes, or, otherwise, operates as a regulation of such commerce, then the law which authorizes such tax is unconstitutional and void, however ingenious the phraseology which it employs in its illegal usurpation of powers conferred by the Constitution exclusively upon Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-9\">In <em>Lyng </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>135 U.

It is unnecessary to spend time in replying to his elaborate argument, in which he attempts to show that the case has not been overruled. This record presents no state of facts such as would bring it within the scope and authority of that decision, even if it was- unquestioned law; but whether it das been entirely overruled or not, it has been so questioned that it is no longer a conclusive authority, even in a similar case,-and to-day would not, in its present form, find its way into the reports of this court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-11\">AN ACT RELATING TO THE TAXATION OE RAILROADS.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">\n<em>Be it enacted by the Senate and Souse of Representatives in the Legislature, assembled, as follows :</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Sect. 1.

Justice Field,</author>\n<p id=\"AYsr\">after -stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The tax, for the collection of which this action is brought, is an excise tax upon the defendant corporation for the privilege of exercising its franchises within the State of Maine. It is so declared in the statute which imposes it; and that.a tax of this character is within the power of the State to levy there can be no question. The designation does not always indicate merely an inland imposition or duty on the consumption of commodities, but often denotes an impost for \u00e1 license to pursue certain callings, or to deal in special commodities, or to exercise particular franchises. It is used more frequently, in this country, in the latter serise than in any other. The privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>lege of exercising the franchises of a corporation within a State is generally one of value, and often of great value, and the subject of earnest contention. It is natural, therefore, that the corporation should be made to bear some proportion of the burdens of government. As the granting of the privilege rests entirely in the discretion of the State, whether the corporation be of domestic or foreign origin, it may be conferred upon such conditions, pecuniary or otherwise, as the State in its judgment may deem most conducive to its interests or poliey. It may require the payment into its treasury, each year, of a specific sum, or may apportion the amount exacted according to the value of the business permitted, as disclosed by its gains or receipts of the present or past years. The character of the tax, or its validity, is not determined by the mode adopted in fixing its amount for any specific period, or the times of its payment. The whole field of inquiry into the extent of revenue from sources at the command of the corporation, is open to the .consideration of the State in determining what may be justly exacted for the privilege. The rule of apportioning the charge to the receipts of the business would seem to be eminently reasonable, and likely to produce the most satisfactory results, both to .the State and the corporation taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The court below held that the imposition of the taxes was a regulation of commerce, interstate and foreign, and therefore in conflict with the exclusive power of Congress in that respect; and on that ground alone it ordered judgment for the defendant. This ruling was founded upon the assumption that a ref-' erence by the statute to the transportation receipts and to a certain percentage of the same in determining the amount of the excise tax, was in effect the. imposition of the tax upon such receipts, and therefore an interference, with interstate and foreign commerce. But a resort to those receipts was simply to ascertain the value of the business done by the corporation, and thus obtain' a guide to a reasonable conclusion as to the amount of the excise tax which should be levied; and we are unable to perceive in that resort any interference with transportation, domestic or foreign, over the road of the railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>company, or any regulation of commerce which consists in such transportation. If the amount ascertained were specifically imposed as the tax, no objection to its validity would be pretended. And if the inquiry of the State as to the value of the privilege were limited to receipts of certain past years instead of the year in which the tax is collected, it is conceded that the validity of the tax would not be affected; and if not, we do not see how a reference to the results of any other year could affect its character. There is no levy'by the statute on the receipts themselves, either in form or fact; they constitute, as said above, simply the means of ascertaining the value of the privilege conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"AAk\">This conclusion is sustained by the decision in <em>Home Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>134 U. S. 594. The Home Insurance-Company was a corporation created under the laws of New. York, and a portion of its capital stock was invested in bonds of the United States. By an act of the legislature of that State, of 1881, it was declared that every corporation, joint stock company or association, then or thereafter incorporated under any law of the State, or of any other State or country^ and doing business in the State, with certain designated exceptions not material to the question involved, should be Subject to a tax upon its corporate franchise or business, to be computed as follows: if its dividend or-dividends made or declared during the year ending the first day of November, amounted to six per centum or more upon the par value of its capital stock, then the tax was to be at the rate of one-quarter mill upon the capital stock for each one per cent of the dividends. A less rate was provided where there was no dividend or a dividend less than six per cent. The purpose of the act was to fix the amount of the tax each year upon the franchise or business of the corporation by the extent of dividends upon its capital stock, .or, where there were no dividends, according to the actual value of the capital stock during the year. The .tax payable by the company, estimated according to its dividends, under that- law, aggregated seven thousand five hundred dollars. The company resisted its payment, asserting that the tax w\u00e1Sj in fact, levied upon the capital stock of the company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>contending that there should be deducted from it a-sum,bearing the same ratio .thereto that the amount invested in- bonds of the United States bore to its capital stock, and that the law requiring a tax, without such reduction, was unconstitutional and void. It was held that the tax was not upon the capital stock of the company nor upon any bonds of the United States composing a part of that stock, but upon the corporate fran-. chise or business of the company, and that reference was only made to its capital stock and dividends for the purpose of determining the amount of the tax to be exacted each-year. And the court said: \u201cThe validity of the tax can in no way be dependent upon the mode which the State may deem fit to adopt in fixing the amount for any year which it will exadt for the franchise. No constitutional objection lies in the \u2022 way of, a legislative body prescribing any mode of measurement to determine the amount it will charge for the privileges it bestows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The case of <em>Philadelphia and Southern Steamship Co. </em>v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326, in no way conflicts with this decision. That was the case of a tax, in terms, upon the gross receipts of a steamship company, incorporated under the laws of the State, derived from the transportation of persons and property between different States and to and from foreign countries. Such tax was held, without any dissent, to be a regulation of interstate and foreign commerce, and, therefore, invalid. <em>We </em>do not question the correctness of that decision, nor do the views we hold in this case in any way qualify or impair it.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Justices Harlan, Lamar, Brown and myself dissent from the judgment of the court in this case. . \u00a5e do so both on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>principle and authority. On. principle, because, whilst the purpose of the law professes to be to lay a tax lip\u00f3n the foreign company for the privilege of exercising its franchise in the State of Maine, the mode of doing this is unconstitutional. The mode adopted is the laying of a tax on the gross receipts of the company, and these receipts, of Course, include receipts for interstate and international transportation between other States and Maine, and between Canada and the United States. Now, if after the previous legislation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which has been adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>with regard to admitting the company to carry on business within the State, the legislature has still the right to' tax it for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the exercise of its franchises, it should do so in a constitutional manner, and not (as it has done) by a tax on the receipts derived from interstate and international transportation. The power to regulate commerce among the several States (except as to matters merely local) is just as exclusive a power in Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>gress as is the power to regulate commerce with, foreign nations and with the Indian tribes. It is given in the'same clause and couched in the same phraseology; but if it may b^ exercised by-the States, it might as well be expunged from the Constitution. \"We think it a power not only granted to be exercised, but that it is of first importance, being one of the principal moving causes of the adoption of the Constitution. The disputes between the different States in reference to interstate facilities of intercourse, and the discriminations adopted to favor each its own maritime cities, produced a state of things almost intolerable to be borne. But, passing this by, the decisions of this court for a number of years past have settled the. principle that taxation (which is a mode of regulation) of interstate commerce, or of the revenues derived therefrom, (which is the same thing,) is contrary to the Constitution. Going no further back than <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>Pullman's Southern Car Co., </em>117 U. S. 34, we find that principle laid down. There a privilege tax was imposed upon Pullman\u2019s Palace Car Company, by general legislation it is true, but applied to the company, of $50 per annum on every sleeping car going through the State. It was well known, and appeared by the record, that every sleeping car going through the State carried passengers from Ohio and other northern States, to Alabama, and <em>vipe versa, </em>and we held that Tennessee had no right to tax those cars. It was the same thing as if they had taxed the amount derived from the passengers in the cars. So also in the case of <em>Leloup </em>v. <em>The Port of Mobile, </em>127 U. S. 640, we held that the receipts derived by the telegraph company from messages sent from one State to another could not be taxed. So in the case of the <em>Norfolk and Western Railroad </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>136 U. S. 114, where the railroad was a link in a through line by which passengers and freight were carried into other States, the company was held to be engaged in the business of interstate commerce, and could not be taxed for the privilege of keeping an office in the State. And in the case of <em>Crutcher </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>141 U. S. 47, we held that the taxation of an express company for doing an express business between different States was unconstitutional and void. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in the case of <em>Philadelphia &amp;c. Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylv</em>ania, 122 U. S. 326, we held that a tax upon the gross receipts of the company was void because they were derived from 'interstate and foreign commerce. A great many other cases might be referred to, showing that in the decisions and. opinions of this court this kind of taxation is unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>It follows from what we have sai(d, that the judgment of the court below must be</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\"><em>Reversed, and the cause rema/nded, with directions to enter judgment inf'mor of the State for the amount of the tames demanded </em>/ <em>and it is so ordered.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b252-8\">Mr. Justice Bradley, with whom concurred Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Lamar and Mr. Justice Brown, dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>We </em>think that the present decision is a departure from the line of these decisions. The tax, it is true, is called a tax on a franchise. It is so called, but what is it in fact <em>% </em>It is a tax on the receipts of. the company derived from international transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">This court and some of the state courts have gone a great length in sustaining various forms of taxes upon corporations. The train of reasoning upon which it is founded may be questionable. A corporation, according to this class of decisions, may be taxed several times over. It may be taxed for its charter ; for its franchises; for the privilege of carrying on its business ; it may be taxed on its capital; and it may be taxed on its property. Each of these taxations may be carried to the full amount of the property of the company. I do not know that jealousy of corporate institutions could be carried much further. This court held that the taxation of the capital stock of the Western Union Telegraph Company in Massachusetts, graduated according to the mileage of lines in that State compared with the lines in all the States, was nothing but a taxation upon the property of the company ; yet it was in terms a tax upon, its capital stock, and might as well have been a tax upon its gross receipts. By the present decision it is held that taxation may be imposed upon the gross receipts of the company f\u00f3r the exercise of its franchise within the State, if graduated according to the number of miles that the road runs in the State. Then it comes to this: A State may tax a railroad company upon its gross receipts in proportion to the number of miles run within the State, as a tax on its property ; and may also lay a tax upon these same gross receipts, in proportion to the same number of miles, for the privilege of exercising its franchise in the State ! I do not know what else it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>.not tax the gross receipts for. If the interstate commerce of the country is not, or will not be, handicapped by this course . of decision, I do riot understand the ordinary principles which govern human conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We dissent from the opinion of the court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The \u201c previous legislation \u201d referred to in the dissenting opinion is stated in the record as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u201c The court found the facts, as follows: By an act of the Legislature of' this State approved Peb\u2019y 10, 1845, the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad Company was incorporated, with power to construct and maintain a railroad from some point in the city of Portland to the boundary line of the -State of Maine\u2018at such place as will best connect with a railroad to be constructed from said boundary to Montreal, in Canada.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u201cSection 14 of the act of incorporation further provided \u2018 said corporation is vested with power and authority to continue and prolong said' railroad beyond the line of this State to the boundary of Canada, and to pur-' \u2019chase, take and hold lands or the right of way over lands for the purpose of constructing said railroad in continuation, without the Pmits of this State, on and over said lands to the said boundary of Canada:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u201c \u2018 Provided the same can be done consistently with the laws and regulations of the State or States in which said lands lie and through and over the territory of which such railroad in continuation would pass.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u201c The necessary authority for such continuation of the railroad was obtained from the States of New Hampshire and Vermont, and the road was constructed from Portland to Island Pond, in Vermont.
