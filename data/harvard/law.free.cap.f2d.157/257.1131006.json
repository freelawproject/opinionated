Jones, substitute committee of the estate of her father, an adjudged lunatic. Evidence for the prosecution disclosed that appellant received from Mrs. Jones, in her capacity as committee, some 23 monthly retirement checks payable to her father. Appellant gave Mrs. Jones reason to believe that the proceeds of these checks, less a small monthly cash allowance paid to her for use in behalf of her father, were being deposited in the Industrial Bank in her name as committee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was shown that some of the checks entrusted to him were cashed in liquor stores and restaurants, and others were deposited to his personal account at the Industrial Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">The prosecution introduced two annual reports, prepared in appellant\u2019s office, signed by Mrs. Jones and filed with the Auditor for the District Court. Each of these reports falsely stated that substantial funds were on deposit in the Industrial Bank in Mrs. Jones name as committee. It was shown that in fact the bank had never had an account so designated. Testimony by appellant\u2019s secretary showed that the basic information on the first report filed with the Auditor Was furnished by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-19\">The Government also introduced testimony tending to show that appellant was in poor financial condition during the period in which the alleged embezzlement took place, and that he departed from Washington in November of 1944 for an extended period under circumstances suggesting that he may have known that the Auditor\u2019s office would be examining the Jones account.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-20\">We shall review the points raised on this appeal in the order of trial chronology. Appellant first urges that the trial court should have directed a verdict for the defendant at the close of Government\u2019s opening statement. This argument is based on the prosecutor\u2019s failure to state that the Government would prove a <em>\u201cwrongful </em>conversion\u201d or <em>\u201cfraudulent </em>taking\u201d. We observe that this argument does not go to the sufficiency of the indictment. It is addressed only to the opening remarks of the prosecutor. We have not been referred to any authority, nor have we found any, which holds that the prosecution\u2019s opening remarks must be in the precise language of the indictment. Here, the indictment was admittedly good, and the opening statement on behalf of the Government set out in considerable detail the nature of the evidence upon which the prosecution would rely. The omission referred to did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>prejudice the defendant in making his defense or entitle him to a directed verdict at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Likewise, we do not think the trial court erred in refusing the defendant\u2019s motion that the Government be required to elect to place its case on one of the three crimes charged before putting in evidence. .This is a matter within the discretion of the trial court and its ruling was not an abuse of that power.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As for any confusion which might have existed as a result of the prosecution being allowed to put in its case before making an election, we think it was well dispelled by the election at the end of the Government\u2019s case and by the instructions to the jury. There is nothing to indicate that the defense was in any way damaged by this ruling of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Appellant urges vigorously that \u201cthe most flagrant error in this case\u201d was the trial court\u2019s failure to rule that, where funds are voluntarily turned over to the accused, a demand for their return is necessary to support a prosecution for the crime of embezzlement. In the circumstances of this case neither the authorities nor sound reason are on the appellant\u2019s side of this point. It has been repeatedly held that a demand and refusal to pay over may be strong evidence going to make out the crime, but that such a showing is not fundamentally necessary where there is other convincing proof to support the conviction. See for example, Fullerton v. Government of the Canal Zone, 5 Cir., 8 F.2d 968, 972 (where a public officer failed to turn funds over to his successor) ; State v. Sterett, 160 Wash. 439, 295 P. 182; State v. Ross, 55 Ore. 450, 104 P. 596, 604, 106 P. 1022, 42 L.R.A..N.S., 601; State v. Moyer, 58 W.Va. 146, 52 S.E. 30, 6 Ann.Cas. 344; and People v. Hopper, 274 Mich. 418, 264 N.W. 849, 850.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">In such cases as the one before the court the test as to the necessity for demand would appear to be not whether the funds were acquired voluntarily, but rather, whether there is either a fixed time for accounting, at which time the accused defaulted, or some other convincing proof to uphold the charge of wrongful conversion. Here there is considerable question as to the weight which can be attached to much of the government\u2019s evidence, particularly that relating to the financial condition of the defendant. However, it was shown that at the times set for accounting to the Auditor\u2019s Office the defendant caused to be filed fraudulent reports.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This highly significant fact, coupled with the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s departure from the city, when it appears he had every reason to know that an examination of the account was in order, was ample, we think, to dispel any reasonable doubt concerning his guilt that might have been entertained by the jury. Repayment will not, of course, serve to clear the defendant. Henry v. United States, 50 App.D.C. 366, 273 F. 330; State v. Baxter, 89 Ohio St. 269, 104 N.E. 331.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Essentially, appellant contends that the crime was not made out because no one asked him for the funds. To prove the crime it was necessary that the prosecution demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>there was a wrongful conversion by the defendant. A mere conversion will not suffice. Hence, the core of the crime, and the burden for the prosecution, is the proof of the accused\u2019s \u201cwrongful\u201d intention. We have previously held that: \u201cThis intent may be proved directly; or it may be inferred from the circumstances of the case as disclosed by the evidence; or it may be inferred from the nature of the conversion itself; but in all'cases the inference must \u2022be deduced by the jury, and not by the court.\u201d Masters v. United States, 42 App. D.C. 350, 357,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ann.Cas.l916A, 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Appellant charges that it was error for the trial court to permit the former wife of the defendant to testify as to certain events occurring during coverture.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To come within the privilege enunciated by the statute the communication must have been one of a confidential nature. An examination of the record discloses that some of the former wife\u2019s testimony concerned the defendant\u2019s financial affairs before they were married, other portions of the testimony relate to transactions, or prospective transactions which by their nature required communication to third persons. We have failed to find anything in the record that can be properly classified as a \u201cconfidential\u201d communication in the sense required by a reasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Appellant further contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence which reflected on the defendant\u2019s financial condition prior to and after the time of the indictment. The argument is without merit. The testimony complained of was reasonably related to the dates charged in the indictment. We think our holding on a similar point in the Ambrose case applies here. Ambrose v. United States, 45 App. D.C. 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The objections raised by appellant concerning the instructions which the trial court gave and refused to give, are not convincing. We have examined the instructions of the trial court and have not found them in error as to the law of embezzlement, or in regard to the jury\u2019s duty in considering such evidence as was presented, and the applicability of the law of fugitivity as it related to the defendant in this case. Similarly, we find from the record that the defendant was not prejudiced by the court\u2019s handling of an inquiry addressed to the bench by a member of the jury during the course of the trial. Not only did the court at that time admonish the jurors to hold their questions until the-completion of the trial, but counsel for the defense agreed with the court on the procedure to be followed in dealing with this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-12\"> D.C.Code 1940, \u00a7 22\u20141202.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-13\"> D.C.Code 1940, \u00a7 22\u20141301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b312-14\"> D.C.Code 1940, \u00a7 22\u20142203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b312-15\"><em> </em>Each check was in the amount of $71.47, of which $15 was paid back to the complaining witness for use in behalf of her father.
