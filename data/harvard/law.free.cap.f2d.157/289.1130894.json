Sawyer on behalf of appellants, aliens then in custody of I. F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Wixon, District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at San Francisco, California. Wixon was ordered to show cause why the writ should not be issued. In response thereto, he filed a return, which was not traversed. From a judgment denying the petition this appeal is prosecuted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The petition stated that appellants\u2019 detention in Wixon\u2019s custody was illegal. This, however, was a mere statement of a conclusion. The petition did not state any fact or facts warranting the conclusion. Hence the court was not required to accept the conclusion as correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">It appeared from the petition and from the return that appellants were detained in Wixon\u2019s custody, under and by virtue of deportation warrants, copies of which were 'attached to and made part of the return. The warrants were issued under and pursuant to \u00a7 14 of the Immigration Act of 1924, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 214, and directed that appellants be deported to the Netherlands East Indies.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The petition stated that appellants were ex-seamen and were \u201cbeing deported for refusal to man Dutch or British ships sailing to Indonesia.\u201d The warrants showed that appellants were being deported because, after due hearings, it had been found that some of them were, at the time of entry, not entitled to enter the United States, and that the others had remained in the United States for a longer time than</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">was permissible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was not claimed that the hearings were unfair, or that the findings were incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">The petition stated that appellants were subject to, and claimed allegiance to, \u201cthe Government of the Republic of Indonesia,\u201d and that, if deported to the Netherlands East Indies, they would \u201cbe arrested as disloyal and traitorous to the Netherlands Government and subjected to severe punishment and possible execution.\u201d These facts \u2014 if facts they were \u2014 did not entitle appellants to a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">There is no merit in the contention that appellants\u2019 deportation would be a cruel and unusual punishment and hence a violation of the Constitution of the United States. Amend. 8. Deportation is not punishment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">There is no merit in the contention that appellants have a right of asylum which precludes their deportation. Aliens illegally m the United States have no right of asylum therein.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">Contending that they were and are entitled to a writ of habeas corpus, appellants cite Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 89 L.Ed. 2103, and United States ex rel. Weinberg v. Schlotfeldt, D.C.N.D.I11., 26 F.Supp. 283. Bridges v. Wixon does not support appellants\u2019 contention. United States ex rel. Weinberg v. Schlotfeldt is clearly erroneous<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and should not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> After the appeal was taken, Wixon was appointed custodian of appellants, and Wixon as custodian was substituted as appellee in the place and stead of Wixon as Director.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\"> Ex parte Cuddy, 131 U.S. 280, 286, 9 S.Ct. 703, 33 L.Ed. 154; Whitten v.
