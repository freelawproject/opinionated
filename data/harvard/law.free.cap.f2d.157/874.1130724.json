The boom on the wrecker was operating off its southeast corner, that is, the southeast corner of the wrecker was nearest the locomotive and was the fulcrum of the lifting process. It was the\u2019 outrigger at the southeast corner of the boom that was down and in place and that broke, allowing the wrecker to overturn. It was this outrigger that a witness testified had been welded in 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">The plaintiff also showed that there was another outrigger, or heavy steel beam, in the center of the side of the wrecker next to the locomotive, which center beam, or outrigger, could have been put in place to support the wrecker, but that it was not so used. It is contended that if this center outrigger had been in place it would have taken some of the strain and would also have prevented, or would have aided in preventing, the wrecker from overturning.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">At each corner of the wrecker there are also rather heavy and strong, tonglike appendages called \u201crail clamps\u201d, which were designed and intended to be fastened to the fail beneath the wrecker. There is a divergence of views as to the function and efficacy of these clamps, but the inference is allowable that each had the function of aiding to some extent in holding the wrecker to its place on the rails. There is testimony, also, that the clamps were unfastened at the time of the accident. What effect these clamps would have had in tending to prevent the overturning of the wrecker; what the effect would have been of the failure of the defendant to use the center outrigger in supporting the operation of the wrecker; whether or not it was a want of due care in the circumstances for the foreman of the operation to disreg\u00e1rd the warning of parties as to the precarious condition of the operation; whether or not it was negligence to undertake to pick up the locomotive from the turntable; whether or not it was negligence to use a wrecker of the size, type, and age of the wreck'er in question for the work involved; were all questions of fact about which the minds of reasonable men might differ, and there was no error in submitting the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-16\">We think that the lower Court fully, fairly, and correctly charged the jury and that no reversible error was committed in the making of the charge or in the refusal of the charges requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-17\">The judgment of the Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b929-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
