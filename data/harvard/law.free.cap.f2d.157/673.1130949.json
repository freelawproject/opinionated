Since the deficiencies were not the same, this required a refund of part of the deficiency paid for the year 1935, and an increased deficiency for 1936. The taxpayer had sought to amend its petition before the Tax Court to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>form to the facts; hut apparently that court became confused and denied the application. In any case we held that its refusal was \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d and concluded our opinion as follows: \u201cThe cause is remanded to the Tax Court with direction to amend its order to conform to the ruling here made.\u201d Our mandate affirmed the order below; but remanded the cause to the Tax Court \u201cwith direction to amend its order to conform to the ruling made in the opinion of this court.\u201d This the Tax Court did, by an order awarding a refund for 1935, and increasing the deficiency of 1936. The taxpayer has appealed upon the ground that \u00a7 272(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 272(e), gives jurisdiction to the Tax Court to increase a deficiency only in case \u201cclaim therefor is asserted by the Commissioner at or before the hearing or a rehearing\u201d; and, although the Commissioner did assert a \u201cclaim\u201d by \u2022amending his answer to increase the deficiency for 1936, at the hearing held upon remittitur of our mandate, that was not a \u201crehearing,\u201d so that the court had no jurisdiction to execute our mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"> We cannot now see why we found it necessary to remand the case at all; \u00a7 1141(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 1141(c)(1), gives us power to \u201cmodify * * * the decision of the Tax Court, with or without remanding the case for a rehearing, as justice may require.\u201d It is true that the error was not of the kind which appears upon the face of the record, and which may be corrected at the time; but plainly the section does not limit our powers to correcting such errors without a rehearing. However, whether we had the power to correct this error without remand, we did remand it, and \u00a7 1141(c)(1) certainly gave us power to remand the case for a \u201crehearing,\u201d and perhaps only for a \u201crehearing.\u201d By what legerdemain the Tax Court became incapable of obeying our mandate \u201cto amend its order to conform to the ruling made,\u201d escapes us. The theory appears to be that the merits have somehow become so enmeshed in a web of verbiage, that the taxpayer is to be relieved of paying what it concededly owes.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
