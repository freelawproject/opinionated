The cases were consolidated for trial, trial was had before a jury, and the verdict was for the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-31\">Appellants bought tickets in Philadelphia for passage on appellee\u2019s railroad to Greensboro, North Carolina; these tickets included through seat reservations for spec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ified seats in specified cars. They boarded the train at Philadelphia and occupied the designated seats: At Alexandria, Virginia, and again at Charlottesville, the conductor and others of the train crew requested that they move to other seats in another car. They refused. Agents of the railroad notified the Police Department of the City of Lynchburg, Virginia, \u201cof the situation that confronted them.\u201d At Lynchburg, Virginia, a police officer boarded the train. The conductor pointed out appellants. Some conversation ensued. The officer requested them to move to the other car, and, when they refused, he told them that in that case he would have to compel them to get off the train. Thereupon they got off.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The agents of the railroad and the police officer claimed to act pursuant to the Virginia statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which requires that railroads operating in th'at state furnish separate cars for white and colored passengers, and makes it a misdemeanor for any company or person to fail, refuse, or neglect to comply. Appellants claimed that the statute was invalid as to interstate passengers and, therefore, inapplicable to them, and that they had contracted with the railroad for specified seats in specified cars. It is now clear that their contention regarding the invalidity of the statute is correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The railroad did not urge in the trial court the validity of the Virginia statute and does not urge it here. Neither does it rest its case upon its right to make and enforce reasonable regulations; nor does it claim that the conductor and train crew acted without the scope of their authority. Appellants claimed that the police officer acted on behalf of the railroad in ejecting them from the train, and that the conductor nnd train crew participated in the ejection. The railroad denied that claim. The issue before us is the correctness of the charge to the jury upon the law on that point. .</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In the charge to the jury, the court said: \u201cI used the expression \u2018acting in behalf of the defendant\u2019 in referring to the police officer, and this expression should be explained. If a person does nothing more than notify a police officer of an apparent violation of the law, such person is not answerable for the act of the police officer on his own initiative. Stated in another way, mere information to officers of the law tending to show that an offense has been committed, or that some person may be suspected of its commission is not enough, of itself, to establish the fact that the informer participated in the conduct of the officer. Therefore, if all the conductor did, or all that any of the employees of the company did was to notify the police officer of what he thought was a violation of the law, the defendant would not be liable for what the officer did on his own initiative. But, on the other hand, if the conductor or other employee did more than that, the defendant would be answerable for the police officer\u2019s conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">But the court continued, later in the charge:</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">\u201cI shall now read you defendant\u2019s prayer for \u2018 instruction No. 2, which I have reframed, \u2014 and this is the one which is more or less repetitious of what I have already said to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">\u201cThe jury are instructed that the burden of proving that the police officer at Lynch-burg acted on behalf of the defendant is on the plaintiffs, and if you find that the police officer, in requiring the plaintiffs to leave the defendant\u2019s train, if you so find, was acting solely as a police officer of the city of Lynchburg, and not wholly or partly <em>as an agent for defendant, </em>then your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">This case is governed by the rules of law applicable to the obligations of a common carrier to its passengers and its liabilities for breach of those obligations. A common carrier is required to protect its passengers against assault or interfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>cnce with the peaceful completion of their journey.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But an exception to the general rule is that an agent of the carrier is not required to interfere with a known officer of the law apparently engaged in the performance of his duty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This exception covers the action of an agent of a carrier in pointing out to a known officer of the law persons as to whom the officer inquires.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Some cases hold that the exception does not apply if the agent knows that the arrest is illegal, <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but that doctrine seems to contemplate factual knowledge and does not impose upon the carrier\u2019s agent the obligation to decide questions of law. Under the exception, the railroad is not liable for action of its agents in notifying police officers of violations of law or suspected violations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This latter is so because of the basic public policy which protects such notification generally <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and also because of the primary duty of a conductor of a train to protect passengers from injury by others; e. g., assault, robbery, insult^ disturbance, etc., in which cases the conductor must call the police. But the exception goes no further. It does not cover the \"action of the agent in otherwise causing, procuring, assisting in, or participating in the arrest or ejection, or where the arrest is at the instance of the agent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other words, there is a clear line between the action of an agent of a carrier in merely notifying the police of a violation of law or identifying persons at the request of a police officer, and his action in going beyond mere notification or identification and by some additional act procuring, causing, directing, or participating in an arrest or ejection. Liability in the latter cases rests upon joint tortfeasance or breach of contract, and not upon agency.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">It follows that the instruction to the jury by the trial court in the case at bar was correct except for the injection of the issue of agency. It was not necessary that the policeman be the agent of .the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>railroad company in order that the company be liable. The court, therefore, erred in telling the jury that if it found that the police officer was not acting wholly or partly as an agent of defendant, the verdict must be for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Appellee urges that the cases were brought by plaintiffs and tried upon the theory of agency. We do not find that the record so presents them. The complaints lay the claim \u201cby reason of the' defendant\u2019s unlawful action through its agents and servants, as aforesaid, and through persons acting at its instance and behest, * * * and * * * by reason of the defendant\u2019s' unlawful, wanton and reckless breach of contract, through its agents and servants, * * As we read those averments, the \u201cagents and servants\u201d were the conductor and the train crew, and the \u201cpersons acting at its instance and behest\u201d were the police. Thus, the complaint lies in tort against the railroad as a tort-feasor with others, i. e., the police, and in contract by reason of the acts of the conductor and train crew in calling the police. The complaint alleges the damages as caused by \u201cactions of the defendant through its lawful \u00e1gents and servants and police officers acting at its instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In his argument upon his motion for a directed verdict, counsel for the railroad presented the view that there was no jury issue \u201cupon the question of agency\u201d, but the position of counsel for the appellants was, \u201cIn this case we have an actual participation by the company every step of the way\u201d, and his argument was that the evidence showed participation by the conductor in the actual ejection, and also showed instructions by the conductor to the officer in addition to mere notification and identification. In reply, counsel for the railroad again urged that the question was one of agency. But the court said that the question was whether the company, through its agents, \u201cindicated\u201d what the police officer should do, whether the conductor \u201cwas directing\u201d the officer. And the court denied the motion with the comment, \u201cBut the explanation to the officer when the inquiry was made, 'Where do you want them to go?\u2019 instead of saying, \u2018Enforce the law, Officer\u2019, he said, \u2018I want them to go into the next car.\u2019 \u201d At that point, it seems clear that appellants were urging participation by the company, through the conductor, at every step in the incident, whereas the company was urging that an agency of the police officer must be shown; and the court was of the view that there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury upon the issue of participation. Later, however, in discussing the prayers, the court told counsel for appellants, \u201cYou have to establish agency before this jury before you can recover.\u201d Counsel for appellants said, \u201cSuppose he acted at the instance of the railroad company?\u201d. The court repeated, \u201cI say if he is not acting as an agent the plaintiffs cannot recover,\u201d and counsel for appellants said, \u201cBut that begs the entire question.\u201d The record contains more of the same nature. In fact, counsel for appellants at one point referred to the removal from the train as being \u201cthrough this person acting \u2014 and I use your Honor\u2019s expression \u2014 as its agent.\u201d But we have quoted enough to show that appellants\u2019 claims were made and urged on the basis that the company, by the conductor, actually participated in the ejection, while the railroad was insistent throughout that appellants must show that the officer acted as an agent of the company. This controversy, which ran through the whole case, culminated in that part of the charge to the jury which referred to agency. That part of the charge was, as we have said, error, and because the dispute concerning the point ran persistently through the entire course of the case, we think the error was substantial and reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Appellee says that any theory under which it might be liable, aside from the relationship of agency as between it and the officer, would be a new theory in these cases and was not presented below in this case, and that all the facts have been considered by the jury upon the issue of agency. We cannot agree. The cases, some of which we have cited, appear to us to be in unanimous accord that liability may rest upon a joint tort-feasance entirely apart from an agency, or upon a breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>contract. Upon the trial, it was appellee\u2019s case, not appellants\u2019 claim, which was rested upon agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Our opinion in this case is consistent with those of this court in Washington, B. &amp; A. Electric R. Co. v. Waller, 1923, 53 App.D.C. 200, 289 F. 598, 30 A.L.R. 50, and Kinchlow v.
