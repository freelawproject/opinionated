J.</author>\n<p id=\"b130-23\">This is an appeal from an order of the District Court granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The action was brought by appellant, Olive Ewing Clapper, the widow and beneficiary of Raymond L. Clapper, against Aetna Life Insurance Company, on a policy of life insurance issued to appellant\u2019s husband in the amount of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-24\">The policy, written in 1928, contained a provision for a further payment of $5,000 in the event the insured\u2019s death resulted from an accident. The complaint charged that while the policy was in full force and effect, insured, being neither in the military or naval service, lost his life while an invited guest-passenger in a United States Naval aircraft flying in the vicinity of the Marshall Islands. The accident resulted from a mid-air collision with another aircraft and the plane in which the insured was a passenger fell into the sea, burst into flames and sank. Insured\u2019s body was never recovered. The Insurance Company paid the face amount of the policy, but denied further liability. Thereafter appellant brought this action to recover the additional $5,000 payable in the event of insured\u2019s accidental death.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-25\">The motion of the defendant Insurance Company for summary judgment urged that it was exempted from liability for the accidental death of the insured, since the policy provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-26\">\u201cIf the death of the insured occurs * * * from bodily injuries effected solely through external, violent and accidental means * * *\u2022 [and] not * * * from <em>an aeronautic flight </em>or submarine descent, * * * the Company will pay, * * (Italics supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-29\">Appellant contends that the clause \u201cfrom an aeronautic flight\u201d does not in the facts of this case exempt appellee from liability, since, as counsel insist, it is a term of art, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>implying an occupational or experimental position with regard to the particular flight and does not relate to or embrace a passenger on board a plane.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Appellee, to the contrary, contends that the clause covers any and all flight or travel in an airplane, regardless of the insured\u2019s position as a passenger or as a member of a plane\u2019s crew. Thus the single question for decision is whether insured met his death as a result of \u201can aeronautic flight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Counsel for appellee concede that if the language of the clause were \u201cparticipating in or engaged in an aeronautic flight,\u201d the Insurance Company would be liable. Likewise, they concede that all ambiguities, doubts and uncertainties, if any, as to the meaning of the policy must be resolved in favor of the insured. They insist, however, that the provision in the policy excluding liability if death results from \u201can aeronautic flight\u201d is not ambiguous, but is \u201cso plain that he who runs may read,\u201d and can mean but one thing \u2014 i. e., an absence of liability, irrespective of the role the insured played when he occupied space in the plane on its fatal trip \u2014 in short, that it excludes any claim arising as the result of death in consequence of an airplane flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We are unable to agree with this contention. It is quite true that no case is cited and we have found none in which the liability exclusion-clause is in precisely the same words as in the present case, but cases, state and federal, construing language more or less similar may be cited in large numbers. In such cases the holding was that the clause \u201cparticipating or participation in aeronautics,\u201d or \u201cengaged in aeronautic operations, activity or expeditions,\u201d does not cover the case of a person who had no other relation to the flight than as an ordinary passenger.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Here the language of the policy is, as we have pointed out, somewhat different, and as it is written it relieves the insurer of liability in consequence of death resulting from \u2014 an aeronautic flight. If the words used had been \u201cresulting from\u2014 a flight,\u201d \u2014 the case would be simple, for it is obvious that the death of Mr. Clapper was in consequence of \u2014 a flight. The actual language, however, is \u201can aeronautic flight,\u201d and the inclusion of the word \u201caeronautic\u201d when considered in the light of its accepted meaning involves a different problem. We think undoubtedly the parties intended to use the phrase in the sense generally recognized in air travel. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary defines the word aeronautics as \u201cThe science that treats of the operation of aircraft,\u201d and the word aeronautic as \u201cPertaining to aeronautics or aeronauts.\u201d Certainly, as appellee concedes, insured on the occasion of his death was not \u201cparticipating\u201d in aeronautics. Moreover, if the flight to be within the exemption of the policy must be one pertaining to the science of operating aircraft, it follows that a mere passenger in an airplane is outside its provisions. For, as was said by the Eighth Circuit, \u201cA mere passenger has no part in the art of the aeronaut and does not study, apply, or advance the science of aerial navigation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, it would be <em>going too </em>far to say that as to the insured the particular flight in question was an \u201caeronautic flight.\u201d But even if this interpretation is subject to challenge, the same result would follow, since at best the phrase is so ambiguous as to compel a decision in favor of the insured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>To say more than this would tend perhaps to uncertainty rather than to clarity. If the Insurance Company had meant what it now says it meant, the opportunity was at hand when the policy was issued to express its position in plain words. If, for example, it intended to exclude <em>any </em>death resulting from an airplane flight, words of plain import could have been found so that no question could be raised. In the deliberate use of a word or phrase having a well recognized technical meaning, it is a fair conclusion that the insurer meant that something more must be shown than the mere use, as a passenger, of the facilities of an airplane.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\"> See: King v.
