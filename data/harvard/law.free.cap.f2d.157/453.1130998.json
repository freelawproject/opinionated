The amended libel, hereafter called the libel, prayed that the food be seized and condemned. The food was seized. Appellee excepted to the sufficiency of the libel. The exception was sustained, and a decree was entered dismissing the libel and directing that the food be released to appellee. \u25a0 From that decree this appeal is prosecuted. The question is whether the libel stated facts sufficient to warrant condemnation of the food.</p>\n<p id=\"b-A_K\">Condemnation was sought under \u00a7 304 (a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334(a), which provides : \u201cAny article of food * * * that is adulterated<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> * * * when introduced into or while in interstate commerce<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> * * * shall be liable to be proceeded against while in interstate commerce, or at any time thereafter, on libel of information and condemned in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the article is found: * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">The libel stated that the food was shipped in interstate commerce from Denver, Colorado, to Douglas, Arizona, in 1943 \u2014 75 cartons on February 13, 1943, and 100 cartons on June 18, 1943. The libel further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u201cThat said food * * * is [on September 28, 1945] adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.A. as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u201c342(a) (3) in that it consists wholly or in part of a filthy substance<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by reason of the presence therein of insect fragments, rodent hairs, and rodent excreta;</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u201c342(a) (4) in that it has been held under insanitary conditions whereby it has been contaminated with filth <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> while held in the original packages by [appellee] at [ap-pellee\u2019s] warehouse in Douglas, Arizona.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Thus the libel stated, in substance and effect, that on September 28, 1945-more than two years after it was shipped in interstate commerce \u2014 the food was adulterated. The libel did not state that the food was adulterated when introduced into or while in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, the libel stated, in substance and effect, that the food was adulterated while held in original packages by appellee at its warehouse in Douglas, Arizona. Thus it appeared that the adulteration of the food occurred after it ended its interstate journey and came to rest at appellee\u2019s warehouse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Appellant contends that the fact that the food was adulterated while held in original packages was sufficient to warrant its condemnation. We do not agree. As shown above, \u00a7 3C4(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334 (a), under which this proceeding was brought, provides for the condemnation of \u201cAny article of food * * * that is adulterated * * * when introduced into or while in interstate commerce.\u201d It says nothing about original packages. The terms \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d and \u201coriginal packages\u201d are not synonymous. Articles may be in interstate commerce without being in original packages. They may be in original packages without being in interstate commerce. They may be in both interstate commerce and original packages and, if in both, may cease to be in interstate commerce and yet remain in original packages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hence the fact that the food was adulterated while held in original packages did not show that it was adulterated when introduced into or while in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Appellant cites, in support of its contention, \u00a7 10 of the Food and Drug Act of 1906,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 14, which provided that \u201cAny article of food * * * that is adulterated * * * and is being transported from one State * * * to another for sale, or, having been transported, remains * * * in. original unbroken packages * * * shall be liable to be proceeded against * * * and seized for confiscation by a process of libel for condemnation.\u201d This proceeding was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>brought, and could not have been brought, under \u00a7 10 of the Food and Drug Act of 1906, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 14, for that section was repealed <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> long before this proceeding was brought. As stated above, this proceeding was brought under \u00a7 304(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334(a). The quoted provision of \u00a7 10 of the Food and Drug <em>Act </em>of 1906, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 14, is not in \u00a7 304(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334(a), and should not be read into it by construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Whether Congress could have provided in \u00a7 304(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334(a), for the condemnation of any article of food that is adulterated while held in original packages after being transported in interstate commerce need not be considered, since Congress did not, in fact, so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Appellant says that administrative officers charged with the duty of enforcing \u00a7 304(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334(a), have interpreted it as providing for the condemnation of any article of food that is adulterated while held in original packages after being transported in interstate commerce. Being clearly erroneous, that interpretation need not and should not be followed by the courts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Appellant has cited no court decision supporting its contention, and we have found none. We conclude, as did the court below, that the libel did not state facts sufficient to warrant condemnation of the food.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-18\"> Act of June 25, 1938, c. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-19\"> Section 402 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 342, provides: \u201cA food shall be deemed to be adulterated\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b508-21\">\u201c(a) <em>* * * </em>(3) if it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance * * * or (4) if it has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth s\u00a1: * <em>%</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-28\"> Section 201(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321(b), provides: \u201cThe term \u2018interstate commerce\u2019 means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any. place outside thereof, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b509-13\">See \u00a7 402(a) (3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 342(a) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b509-14\"> See \u00a7 402(a) (4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 342(a) (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b509-15\"> See \u00a7 304(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b509-16\"> Cf.
