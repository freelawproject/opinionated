On a trial without a jury, the court entered judgment for $1,-509.44, consisting of $629.72 for overtime compensation, an equal amount for liquidated damages, and $250 for an attorney\u2019s fee. The employer has appealed from the allowance of any recovery, on the ground that King was employed in a bona fide executive capacity and was therefore not subject to the overtime provisions of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> King has cross-appealed from the refusal to allow him more.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">On the employer\u2019s appeal, the only question is whether the court erred in finding that King was not employed in a bona fide executive capacity, within the definition of that term promulgated by the Administrator.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">The parties were agreed that King had been engineer of the ice plant during all of the period involved, but his employer contended that he further had had charge of the manufacturing end of the business and of the employees in that department and that during part of the time he had been assistant manager of both the manufacturing and selling operations of the plant. King denied that he had been either a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>superintendent or a manager. He testified that he kept the machinery in operation and in condition, but that a considerable part of his time was spent in such tasks as pulling ice, scoring it, assisting in loading it from the platform, and repairing windows, screen doors, cold storage latches and other things around the plant. He estimated that 85 percent of his time was spent in manual labor. A former workman in the plant made a similar estimate. Other witnesses gave instances of manual tasks which they had seen him on various occasions performing. The employer testified that King had no such manual duties and that any work of that nature which he may have done was without the employer\u2019s knowledge. An array of witnesses, consisting of employees, former employees, and customers of the plant, was produced to show that King had done \u2022 very little, if any, of such work, within their observation, and that there was no occasion for him to do so in view of the number of other employees available for that purpose. A more minute detailing of the evidence can serve no useful publication, or other, purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The trial court said in its memorandum opinion: \u201cWhether the plaintiff was employed in a bona fide executive capacity must be determined from the testimony. The plaintiff, to a certain extent, was the manager of the manufacturing department and the plaintiff directed the work of the other employees in that department subject, however, to the general overall supervision of the defendants. There isn\u2019t any doubt but that the suggestions of plaintiff and recommendations as to the hiring and firing of employees was given particular weight by the defendants, and in the manufacture of ice and in the general operation of the manufacturing department the plaintiff exercised discretionary powers. He was compensated for his services on a salary basis of more than $30.00 per week, although his salary was in fact calculated upon a monthly basis, but the proof is clear that the plaintiff actually engaged in manual labor in excess of \u201820 percent of the number of hours worked in the workweek by nonexempt employees under his direction.\u2019 It is not contended that the plaintiff was in sole charge of an independent establishment or a physically-separated branch establishment. Therefore, it cannot be said in view of the testimony that the plaintiff was employed in a. bona fide executive capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Thus, what the court held was that the employer had failed to satisfy the sixth element of the Administrator\u2019s definition (footnote 2) of \u201cemployee employed in a bona fide executive * * * capacity,\u201d by preponderantly proving that King was an employee \u201cWhose hours of work of the same nature as that performed by nonexempt employees do not exceed 20 percent of the number of hours worked in the workweek by the nonexempt employees under his direction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u201cTaking the entire evidence,\u201d as we said on the same issue in Ralph Knight, Inc., v. Mantel, 8 Cir., 135 F.2d 514, 516, \u201cwe are unable to say that this finding of the court was \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 (Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c).\u201d \u201cThis Court, upon review, will not retry issues of fact or substitute its judgment with respect to such issues for that of the trial court. * * * The power of a. trial court to decide doubtful issues of fact is not limited to deciding them correctly.\u201d Cleo Syrup Corporation v. Coca-Cola Co., 8 Cir., 139 F.2d 416, 417, 150 A.L.R. 1056. To weigh opposing evidence, determine credibility of witnesses, and choose between permissible inferences is the function of the trial court, and findings of fact thus-made cannot ordinarily be said to be clearly erroneous if they are supported by substantial evidence. Kincade v. Mikles, 8 Cir., 144 F.2d 784, 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Despite the earnestness of the employer\u2019s argument here, that is the situation presented by the record. We cannot hold that the trial court\u2019s finding is contrary to the clear weight of the evidence or that it is not supported by substantial evidence, unless we should totally ignore the testimony of King and his witnesses, which the trial court accepted, in part at least, as being credible upon the issue we are considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>What we have just said is also applicable to King\u2019s cross-appeal. The trial court found on all the evidence that King had worked 16 hours overtime a week during the period involved. It was not bound to accept King\u2019s general testimony, unsupported by any extraneous evidence such as records, etc., or by other credible testimony, that throughout the period of his employment he had worked at least 72 hours overtime a week in the daytime and at least 5 hours overtime a week at night. Nor does the contention merit serious consideration that the court as a matter of fact should have held that King was on duty 24 hours a day, because it had been agreed that he might be called to the plant from his home at any time, if something went wrong with the machinery. The evidence shows that he was free to go where and do what he pleased during this alleged waiting time, and that he did so, only advising the plant where it would be possible' to reach him in case of an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The Supreme Court said in Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, 136, 137, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 163, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124: \u201cWe have not attempted to, and we cannot, lay down a legal formula to resolve cases so varied in their facts as are the many situations in which employment involves waiting time. Whether in a concrete case such time falls within or without the Act is a question of fact to be resolved by appropriate findings of the trial court. * * * This involves scrutiny and construction of the agreements between the particular parties, appraisal of their practical construction of the working agreement by conduct, consideration of the nature of the service, and its relation to the waiting time, and all of the surrounding circumstances. Facts may show that the employee was engaged to wait, or they may show that he waited to be engaged. * * * Each case must stand on its own facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In the present case, the trial court plainly was warranted in finding that King was not \u201cengaged to wait\u201d after he left the plant, but that he merely \u201cwaited to be engaged.\u201d The controlling facts are not similar to those in the Skidmore case, supra, or to those in Armour &amp; Co. v. Wantock, 323 U.S. 126, 65 S.Ct. 165, 89 L.Ed. 118. The view of the trial court further is in harmony with Interpretative Bulletin No. 13 of the Wage and Hour Division, in which it is said: \u201cIf the employee is required to remain on call in or about the, place of business of the company, the time spent should be considered hours worked. If, on the other hand, the employee is merely required to leave word where he can be reached in the event of a call and is not tied down to any particular place, such time need not ordinarily be considered hours worked.\u201d See also Super-Cold Southwest Co. v. McBride, 5 Cir., 124 F.2d 90, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">King urges also that he should have been allowed a larger attorney\u2019s fee. The considerations which may control the fixing of an attorney\u2019s fee necessarily are flexible and inabsolute, and where the matter is submitted abstractly, as it was here, without proof of specific time spent, etc., the question of the amount is simply one of general reasonableness. While trial courts and appellate courts equally are regarded as experts on the value of legal services^ McDougal v. Black Panther Oil &amp; Gas Co., 8 Cir., 277 F. 701, 707, a trial court ordinarily has a better opportunity for practically appraising the situation, and an appellate court ryill interfere only to correct a patent injustice, where the allowance is clearly excessive of insufficient, Mercantile-Commerce Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Southeast Arkansas Levee Dist., 8 Cir., 106 F.2d 966, 972. Tt is to be borne in mind also that a statute such as is here involved, in providing for the allowance of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, does not contemplate an amount in the nature of a speculative or contingent fee, Business Men\u2019s Assurance Company of America v. Campbell, 8 Cir., 18 F.2d 223, 226, but merely one that is reasonable on the basis of time necessarily spent and character of effort required, in such relationship to the amount recovered as is fair under the circumstances of the particular situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">While the allowance made by the trial court may seem moderate, we do not feel that it can be said on the record or generally to be so clearly insufficient as to amount to an injustice. It does not appear, however, from its amount, to have been intended to cover services beyond the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>court and, in the exercise of our appellate discretion, we shall allow King an additional $250 for services necessary in connection with the employer\u2019s appeal.

Corporation, 2 Cir., 144 F.2d 292, 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">With this modification, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-15\"> 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a) provides: \u201cThe provisions of sections 206 [minimum wages] and 207 [maximum hours] of this title shall not apply with respect to (1) any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, professional, or local retailing capacity, or in the capacity of outside salesman (as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the Administrator) * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-16\"> By regulation of the Administrator, effective October 24, 1940, 5 F.R. 4077, 29 Code of Fed.
