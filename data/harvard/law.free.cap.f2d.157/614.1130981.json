Thackrey, publisher of the New York Post, and her husband Theodore O. Thack-rey, its managing editor, against Eleanor Patterson, publisher of the Washington Times-Herald, and Austine Cassini, a Times-Herald writer. The complaints charge that the defendants published two newspaper articles which the complaints quote in full. The District Court ruled that the articles were not libelous per se and that the complaints made no sufficient allegations of special damage. The court therefore dismissed the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-26\"> The first article says, in terms or in effect, that the plaintiff wife bought the plaintiff husband with money; that she finds him disappointing as an editor, and also inadequate as a husband; that in both these capacities her desire is for a different man, Charles B. McCabe, publisher of the Daily Mirror; and that she and McCabe \u201care the subject of conjectures.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second article correctly describes, and so in effect repeats, the first as \u201clinking Mrs. Thack-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>rey\u2019s name romantically with that of Charles B. McCabe.\u201d Obviously this romantic linking, and the first article as a whole, tend to hurt the standing of the plaintiff wife and also of the plaintiff husband \u201cwith a considerable and respectable class in the community.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It follows as a matter of law that the. articles are libelous. A mere assertion of marital discord is libelous, and these articles go far beyond that.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since their libelous meanings are obvious and do not depend upon extrinsic facts, it was unnecessary to plead extrinsic facts or an innuendo. It was also unnecessary to allege special damage. The court erred in dismissing the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-16\"> \u201c * * * Charles B. McCabe, handsome red-head, dressy publisher of the New York Daily Mirror, and Mrs. Theodore Olin Thackrey, sultry, dressy publisher of the New York Post, are the subject of conjectures.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">\u201cDorothy married in the not too distant past her present managing editor, Ted Thackrey, * * * decided she and Thackrey had found the answer to their mutual interests tied up in one newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">\u201cBut according to the saucy little rumors, which stemmed from her own sheet, she\u2019s no longer . . . well . . . so-o-o completely sure. Perhaps Thackrey isn\u2019t such a genius after alL Maybe be isn\u2019t turning in the kind of work she expected for the paper, or on the home hearth, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-28\">\u201cSo stretching her pretty neck over the fence, Dorothy Schifl: Hall Backer Thack-rey, wealthy owner of the New York Post, is looking longingly at the green pastures in an adjacent field, where wanders handsome McCabe of the Daily Mirror.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-29\">\u201cDynamic, sandy-haired McCabe\u2019s smart appearance is not the only reason for sloe-eyed glances by la belle publisher sans merci. Dorothy insists she knows a good newspaperman when she sees one. And she watches with envy and admiration the excellent job McCabe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>does at the Mirror, both columnists and Colony-ists agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\u201cShe believed when she married Ted Thackrey that she had the best that money could buy in her managing editor. Eor all the world knows, she may have. Still, why is it the food on someone else\u2019s plate is always what you wish you\u2019d ordered yourself?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\"> Peck v.
