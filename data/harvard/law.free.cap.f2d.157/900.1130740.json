For the background of the case, see our opinion in Harry C. Blatchley, Petitioner, 157 F.2d 894. Appellee New England Public Service Company has filed a motion to docket and dismiss the appeal, which motion is supported by a memorandum filed by the Commission. We think that the motion must be granted for the reason that appellant Goldfine, in the circumstances disclosed, has no standing to appeal from the order enforcing the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">The appeal is dismissed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
