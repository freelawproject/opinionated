Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7 22(a). The facts were stipulated, and the court below held that the amount received represented the purchase price for the sale of a capital asset. D.C., 65 F.Supp. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-25\">The taxpayer was the beneficiary for life of a testamentary trust created by the will of her husband. There is no question here about the taxability of current income from the trust. The question here is whether the taxpayer merely assigned future income or parted with title to the corpus of the estate from which income was expected to be produced. We agree with the court below that she sold her entire life interest in trust property. Blair v. Commissioner, 300 U.S. 5, 57 S.Ct. 330, 81 L.Ed. 465; Bell\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 137 F.2d 454; Quigley v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 143 F.2d 27; McAllister v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 157 F.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-26\">In Hort v. Commissioner, 313 U.S. 28, 61 S.Ct. 757, 85 L.Ed. 1168, wherein the landlord released his tenant from a 15-year lease upon payment of a lump-sum in cash, there was no sale or transfer of property. The consideration was held to be a mere substitute for rent. In that transaction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>lease was cancelled and the tenant did not get anything except a release from the contract. That case is not applicable here. The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
