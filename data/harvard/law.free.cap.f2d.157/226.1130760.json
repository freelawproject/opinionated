HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The defendant appeals from a judgment holding valid and infringed all claims but number eighteen of Reissue Patent No. 20,-092, issued on September 1, 1936, to Clesson E. Mason, the original having been issued on February 14, 1933 (No. 1,897,135), upon an application filed on September 15, 1930. The district court discussed the case at length in a published opinion (Foxboro Company v. Taylor Instrument Companies, 58 F.Supp. 313), to which we refer for an account of the general nature of the invention, of the specifications and claims, and of the contentions of the parties. Assuming that the reader will be familiar with these, we find it necessary to consider only two questions: (1) Whether Mason forfeited his patent because of his failure to disclaim certain of his claims; and (2) whether the claims are invalid, because they do not describe any patentable advance over the art, as it had developed on September 15, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">The answer to the first question depends upon the effect of Mason\u2019s disclaimer of claims two, three and five of the original patent on May 11, 1933, shortly after it issued. Claim one and claim four were retained, and claim four is precisely the same as claim two of the reissue. A different question would have arisen, had original claim four not been in the patent, and had Mason disclaimed claims two and three and then attempted to revive claim three, adding to it the new element by which original claim four was different from original claim three. Since, however, he carried original claim four into the reissue unchanged (as claim two), there never was a period during which he was not claiming the invention which it defined; and the question comes down to whether the disclaimer of original claim two and three demanded the disclaimer also of claim four. In Maytag Co. v. Hurley Machine Co., 307 U.S. 243, 59 S.Ct. 857, 83 L.Ed. 1264, the Supreme Court held that, when a patentee had disclaimed two claims which had been held invalid, but failed to disclaim a third which was not \u201cdefinitely distinguishable\u201d from the disclaimed claims, he forfeited his patent. It is true that Roberts, J., added (307 U.S. at page 245, 59 S.Ct. at page 859) that the owner of a patent, \u201cby disclaiming those claims, has confessed that the patentee therein claimed \u2018more than that of which he was the original or first inventor or discoverer\u2019 \u201d; and the defendant argues that this confession must be considered a conclusive admission that the matter contained in original claims two and three was in the prior art, from which it would follow that the differentia of the original claim four from those claims must be enough to constitute invention. In the case of claim four the differentia was as follows: \u201cSaid chamber being adjustably movable as a whole and by said adjustment affecting movement and adjustment of one of said elements relative to the other.\u201d This language can only refer to the fact that bellows, \u201c39,\u201d can be moved by means of the \u201cframe, 45,\u201d so as to adjust the nozzle to the flapper; and that, the defendant argues, would not require invention. If the language quoted from Maytag Co. v. Hurley Machine Co., supra,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> be read literally, this argument would not be without force; but a number of courts \u2014 beginning with Judge Archbald\u2019s decision in Manhattan General Construction Company v. Helios-Upton Co., C.C.1905, 135 F. 785, 802\u2014have decided that a disclaimer should not be taken as, an admission by the patentee that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>claimed matter was not patentable;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we do not believe that the Supreme Court intended to overrule this doctrine. The consequence of so holding would be indeed severe, for it would result, whenever the patentee made any disclaimer, that he risked his whole patent except in so far as his remaining claims were patentably distinguishable from those disclaimed. In United Chromium, Inc., v. International Silver Co., supra,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 60 F.2d at pages 914, 915, we stated our reasons for thinking that by disclaimer a patentee does not so concede. We have tacitly assumed for argument that the doctrine of Maytag Co. v. Hurley Machine Co., supra,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applies as much when a patentee voluntarily disclaims one claim, but fails to disclaim another which is not \u201cdefinitely distinguishable,\u201d as when a court has declared a claim invalid. We do not, however, mean to express any opinion on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">We limit our consideration of the validity of the claims to those on which the plaintiff alone relies: reissue claims two, five, ten and thirteen. Of these four, two and ten are \u201cproportioning\u201d claims, and claims five and thirteen are \u201creset\u201d claims. All these were in the original patent in substantially the same form that they appear when reissued; and the same indeed applies to all the first sixteen claims of the reissued patent. As to these we need not consider whether Mason showed adequate excuse for any reissue whatever, because, even though he did not, the surrender of the original patent, resulting from the acceptance of the reissue, did not invalidate any claims which he carried over into the reissue. For a time this was in some doubt (Eby v. King, 158 U.S. 366, 15 S.Ct. 972, 39 L.Ed. 1018), but the amendment to \u00a7 64, Title 35, U.S.C.A., i'n 1928, has now set the question at rest Schenk v. United Aircraft Corp., D. C., 43 F.Supp. 679, 686. Although that amendment uses the word, \u201cidentical,\u201d we read this as \u201csubstantially identical,\u201d and the first sixteen reissued claims are substantially identical with their originals. Finally, we do not think that claims two, five, ten and thirteen are too vague to be valid. They are, indeed, stated with the turgidity customary in such documents, but it is possible to identify with sufficient certainty those parts of the disclosure to which they refer. We proceed therefore to consider their validity in the light of the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In November, 1924, Thomas Lindsay filed \u201ccomplete specifications\u201d for a patent which issued on May 28, 1925 (1925, Brit. Pat. 234,194), for a controlling apparatus of the same general class as Mason\u2019s. The single figure shown is for the control of the pressure in a steam pipe by means of a steam valve, operated by a pulley and weight which move it in one direction, and a piston and cylinder which move it in the opposite direction. We can see no patentable distinction between moving the valve in this way and' attaching it to a diaphragm opposed by a spring; and indeed, Lindsay, who had described such a diaphragm in an earlier patent (1924 Brit.Pat. 218,370) incorporated this in his patent as an alternative (page 5, lines 37-41). The piston is moved against the weight by the pressure of a \u201cnon-compressible\u201d fluid, introduced into the cylinder, whose waste from the cylinder allows the weight to pull the piston back. Control of the steam pressure is accomplished by tapping the main pipe by the lead, \u201c35,\u201d to the bellows, \u201c34,\u201d in a steam tight chamber. , The compression of this bellows raises the \u201clever, 37,\u201d against the pressure of the \u201cspring, 38,\u201d and at the end of this lever is the \u201ccup, 31,\u201d which acts as a baffle for the nozzle, \u201c23.\u201d So far as we can see, this is a precise analogue of Mason\u2019s flapper and Bourdon tube, except that Lindsay\u2019s regulating device \u2014 bellows, \u201c34\u201d with its spring, \u201c38\u201d \u2014 and his damping-device \u2014 the bellows, \u201c43\u201d with its spring, \u201c41\u201d \u2014 act upon the flapper. The plaintiff sets great store on this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The \"non-compressible fluid\u201d which enters the piston comes into the control system by means of the \u201cpipe, 13,\u201d which ends in the \u201cvalve, 14,\u201d which, when it is open, leads in turn through the \u201cpipe, 11,\u201d to the cylinder, and when closed, permits the cylinder to waste the fluid. Branching from the \u201cpipe, 13,\u201d before it reaches the \u201cvalve, 14,\u201d is the lead, \u201c20,\u201d which ends in the \u201cneedle valve, 18,\u201d beyond which is the lead to one side of the \u201cdiaphragm, 16,\u201d the other side of the diaphragm being in contact with the stem of the \u201cvalve, 14.\u201d Beyond the \u201cneedle valve, 18,\u201d and, opposite to the lead into the diaphragm, the \u201cpipe, 21,\u201d leads away and ends in the nozzle, \u201c23,\u201d for which the \u201ccup, 31\u201d acts as a flapper. If we assume the \u201ccup\u201d to be sealing the nozzle, the pressure in the \u201cpipe, 13,\u201d will be held by the \u201ccup\u201d and will pervade the whole system, having only two possible outlets: through the \u201cvalve, 14,\u201d when it is displaced, and through the nozzle, \u201c23.\u201d The pressure upon the diaphragm, \u201c16\u201d when it becomes strong enough to overcome the resistance of a \u201cspring, 15,\u201d will unseat the \u201cvalve, 14,\u201d and the fluid will pass into the cylinder through the \u201cpipe, 11\u201d and shift the control valve, \u201c3.\u201d If the pressure in the steam pipe were to become strong enough to contract the bellows, \u201c34,\u201d the \u201clever, 31,\u201d would rise and would open the nozzle, \u201c23,\u201d and the system would return to its original position.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">If the machine had done nothing more, the result would have been a series of corrective movements of the valve, \u201c3,\u201d which would overcompensate: a phenomenon known in the art as \u201chunting.\u201d In order to prevent this and to damp the control proportionally to changes in the steam pressure in the main pipe, Lindsay added another set of elements. Leading out of the \u201cpipe, 11,\u201d just as it feeds into the cylinder is a \u201cpipe, 46,\u201d controlled by a needle valve, 47.\u201d This pipe ends in an \u201cair-vessel,\u201d \u201c48,\u201d from near the bottom of which the \u201cpipe, 49,\u201d leads to a chamber, containing a second bellows, \u201c43,\u201d whose collapse when the chamber is under pressure raises the \u201clever, 40,\u201d against the \u201cspring, 41.\u201d The free end of this lever is flexibly connected with the free end of the \u201clever, 37\u201d; i. e., with the \u201ccup, 31\u201d (page 5, lines 125-128). If the \u201ccup, 31,\u201d be assumed to \u2018be sealing the nozzle, \u201c23,\u201d and if the \u201cvalve, 14,\u201d be unseated, the pressure in the cylinder,, will be communicated to the bellows, \u201c43,\u201d which will tend to lift the \u201clever, 40,\u201d against the \u201cspring, 41,\u201d and push up the \u201ccup, 31,\u201d against the spring, \u201c38.\u201d The effect of this is to oppose the action of the bellows, \u201c34\u201d; i. e., to \u201cdamp\u201d its action proportionally to the change of pressure in the steam pipe. This is true because in proportion as the bellows, \u201c34,\u201d tends to break the seal of the \u201ccup, 31,\u201d it also tends to reduce the pressure in the whole system and thus to reseat the \u201cvalve, 14,\u201d in response to the \u201cspring, 15.\u201d That wastes the cylinder and with it reduces the pressure upon the bellows,. \u201c43,\u201d allowing the \u201cspring, 41,\u201d to operate jointly with the \u201cspring, 38,\u201d against the pressure on the bellows, \u201c34.\u201d Thus every pressure upon that bellows will tend to be checked, not only by the \u201cspring, 38,\u201d as it would always be; but by a proportional increment of the stored force of the \u201cspring, 41,\u201d released by the decrease in pressure upon the bellows, \u201c43.\u201d It is not necessary to describe the reverse movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The plaintiff objects to Lindsay as an anticipation, and it is not indeed a complete one. In the first place, it operates by a \u201cnon-compressible\u201d fluid; in the second, only the flapper is operated upon, both to correct the departure from normal in the steam pipe and proportionally to damp that correction; in the third place, the flapper is not left free to vary in its pressure upon the nozzle, but is positively pressed upon the nozzle by the joint action of the springs, \u201c38,\u201d and \u201c41\u201d; in the fourth place, the pressure upon the bellows, \u201c43,\u201d must pass through the \u201cneedle valve, 47.\u201d Except for these four differences, the relevance of which to support Mason\u2019s invention we reserve for the time being, claims two and ten of the patent would be anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">In February, 1926, Wingfield filed \u201ccomplete specifications,\u201d which resulted, on July 8, 1926, in a British patent (1926, Brit. Pat 254,469), for the purpose of obviating \u201chunting,\u201d which he described as \u201cthe tendency for the controlled device to carry out its full movement\u201d (page one, lines 71-73) ; i. e., to overcompensate. Wingfield prr-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>posed to avoid this by imparting \u201cto the relay valve a check movement, or movement in the opposite direction to that imparted by temperature impulse device * * * so that the movement of the controlled device * * * is inhibited before it has moved through its whole travel\u201d (page 2, lines 11-18). Figure three with its description (page 3, lines 99430, and page 4, lines 1-23), is the nearest to Mason, and is the only part that we need discuss. Changes in temperature in the main system which, as an example, we may take as a steam chamber, are transmitted by the \u201cthermostat, T,\u201d set in that chamber, to the diaphragm chamber, \u201cC,\u201d and expand or contract it, as the temperature increases or decreases. This change in the chamber tends to raise or lower, the flapper, \u201cQ,\u201d which seals the nozzle, \u201cF.\u201d As the seal is relatively tight or loose, the pressure in the \u201cchamber, D,\u201d is raised or lowered; that pressure being fed into the chamber through the \u201cneedle valve, E,\u201d from the main supply. An unlettered member carries the nozzle and is fastened by means of the \u201cextension, G,\u201d and the \u201clink, I,\u201d to the \u201clever, K\u201d; and any rise of the bellows in the chamber, \u201cD,\u201d is in this way communicated to the right end of the \u201clever, K,\u201d which pivots either on the \u201cmain valve shaft, L,\u201d or on the \u201cspring, S.\u201d In either case the seal of the \u201cleakport, B,\u201d becomes firmer. That seal is the only opening out of the chamber, \u201cR,\u201d and into it the controlling pressure passes unobstructed. The pressure in the chamber, \u201cR,\u201d thus increases, and the bellows in that chamber begins to close the main valve, \u201cV,\u201d reducing the temperature in the boiler.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">If this were all, the \u201cvalve, V,\u201d would completely close until the diaphragm, \u201cC,\u201d had collapsed, had tightened the seal of the flapper, \u201cQ,\u201d and the nozzle, \u201cF,\u201d and until the pressure in the chamber, \u201cD,\u201d had opened the \u201cleakport, B.\u201d However, the action of the bellows in the chamber, \u201cR,\u201d is checked by the changes in pressure within the chamber, \u201cD,\u201d in the following way. As the pressure in the chamber decreases, owing to the weakening of the seal between \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cF,\u201d the right end of the \u201clever, K,\u201d rises and stops any \u201cbleeding\u201d at the \u201cleakport, B.\u201d This movement in its turn\u2014 with some lag depending upon the set of the \u201cneedle valve, E,\u201d \u2014 increases the pressure in the chamber, \u201cD,\u201d because' the nozzle, \u201cF,\u201d rises with the \u201clever, K.\u201d This increase in pressure within the chamber, \u201cD,\u201d tends to depress the right end of the \u201clever, K,\u201d and thus to weaken the seal of the \u201cdisc Mi,\u201d upon the \u201cleakport, B,\u201d which reduces the pressure in the chamber, \u201cR,\u201d and allows the spring upon the shaft of the valve, \u201cV,\u201d to withdraw the valve. Thus, although the partial closing of the valve, \u201cV,\u201d automatically corrects the assumed overheating in the boiler, that correction is itself checked by the bellows in the chamber, \u201cD.\u201d It is to be noticed that in Wingfield the damping device is not applied to the flapper, \u201cQ,\u201d as in Lindsay; but the position of the flapper is always fixed by the diaphragm, \u201cC,\u201d quite as in Mason\u2019s Bourdon tube. Moreover, the flapper does not act against any positive pressure, like the springs, \u201c38,\u201d and \u201c41,\u201d of Lindsay; and the \u201cnozzle, F,\u201d is itself moved to and from the flapper by the bellows in the chamber, \u201cD,\u201d just as Mason\u2019s nozzle is moved by the bellows, \u201c39.\u201d Of the four differences between Lindsay and Mason therefore only two exist between Wingfield and Mason: (1.) the pressure by hypothesis is that of a \u201cnon-compressible\u201d fluid; and (2.) the pressure in the chamber, \u201cD,\u201d must pass through the \u201cneedle valve, E.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">On May 22, 1929, a German named Wiinsch filed an application which became Pat. No. 1,959,889, issued May 22, 1934. The application was amended by the introduction of Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6, on August 16, 1930, and the plaintiff argues that these figures \u2014 and, we assume, the descriptive text \u2014 cannot be taken as earlier than Mason\u2019s invention, because the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cSta-bilog\u201d was given a \u201cfield test\u201d in January, 1930. This effort to carry back the invention cannot prevail. It rests wholly upon the testimony of Hall, unconfirmed by contemporary documents, for Exhibit Pr21-N. does not support it; rather it tends to indicate that the \u201cStabilog\u201d \u2014 if the document does refer to the \u201cStabilog\u201d \u2014 had not yet been fully perfected; for it was only \u201ccoming along very shortly\u201d as late as February 5, 1930. Indeed, the use of the phrase, \u201cfield test,\u201d itself strongly suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>that the invention was still in fieri. In fact, there is so little difference between Wtmsch\u2019s figure one and figure three that it would not change the result if we confined ourselves to the first: but, for whatever the distinction may be worth, Figure three with its text must be taken as part of the prior art. Wiinsch wished to regulate pressures in the main pipe, \u201cD,\u201d and he does so by means of the \u201cvalve, 21,\u201d actuated in one direction by the pressure within the \u201ccylinder, 19,\u201d and in the other direction by the \u201cspring 171.\u201d Pressure changes in the main pipe, \u201cD,\u201d are communicated through the \u201cpipe, 1,\u201d to the \u201ccasing, 2,\u201d which contains the \u201cdiaphragm, 21,\u201d upon the other side of which the \u201crod, 14,\u201d abuts. This rod passes through the wall of the casing and its other end abuts upon one side of the \u201ctube, 4,\u201d which is hinged at \u201c4a.\u201d When the pressure in \u201cD\u201d increases, the diaphragm moves the rod to the left, and the rod moves the tube to the left.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The \u201ctube, 4,\u201d is filled with \u201ccompressed air or a gas or an oil under pressure\u201d (page one, lines 55, 56), coming from a source not disclosed. As the tube swings to the left under the impulse of the diaphragm, its open end moves across the orifice at the end of the \u201cpipe, 5,\u201d and by this means it injects into that pipe more or less of the fluid passing out of the tube. \u201cIf the pressure in the pipe, D, increases, the diaphragm 21 is bent to the left and swings the hollow arm, 4, to the left also so that more pressure oil will enter into the tube, 5\u201d (page 2, lines 119-121). The \u201cpressure oil\u201d (which might equally well be \u201cair\u201d or \u201ca gas\u201d) enters the \u201cpipe, 5, \u201d and passes to the right side of the \u201ccylinder, 6,\u201d in which moves the \u201cpiston, 9,\u201d on each side of which are the springs, \u201c7,\u201d and \u201c8,\u201d. so designed that the \u201cpiston is normally held in its medium position\u201d between them (page one, lines 85, 86).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">As the \u201cpiston, 9,\u201d moves to the left it carries with it the \u201cpiston rod, 26,\u201d which moves one end of the \u201cdouble-armed lever, 11,\u201d fulcrumed at \u201c27,\u201d not described. The lower arm of the \u201clever, 11,\u201d pushes the \u201cspring, 3,\u201d in a direction opposite to that of the movement of the \u201cpiston rod, 26,\u201d and, since the opposite end of this spring abuts upon the \u201ctube, 4,\u201d the motion of the \u201ccylinder, 9,\u201d is transmitted to the \u201ctube, 4,\u201d in opposition to the pressure within the \u201cdiaphragm, 2.\u201d In this way the movement of the \u201cpiston, 9,\u201d is \u201cdamped\u201d and the correction of the pressure in the pipe, \u201cD,\u201d by means of its \u201cvalve, 21,\u201d is proportionally held back and prevented from over correcting. Although the mechanical train disclosed is very different from Mason\u2019s in detail, not only is the whole theory of proportional damping disclosed, but the means are in the essence the same. It is true that the pressure in the system is not controlled by a flapper obstructing the discharge of a nozzle, but the shifting of the \u201ctube, 4,\u201d across the mouth of the \u201cpipe, 5,\u201d which varies the pressure received by that pipe; and it is also true that the \u201cpipe, 5,\u201d does not have a lead to the \u201cpipe, 18,\u201d putting the \u201ccylinder, 6,\u201d in shunt as it were. But both these features were in Lindsay and Wingfield, and, as we shall show, a combination of elements in this narrow art was not an adequate basis for invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">There remains the validity of Mason\u2019s \u201creset\u201d claims; supported by his disclosure: i. e., \u201crestricted connection, 55,\u201d and the bellows, \u201c53,\u201d which serve to check the \u201cdamping\u201d action of the bellows, \u201c39.\u201d These two bellows are so \u201cbiassed,\u201d that, when each is under equal pressure, they set the nozzle at a point in its range, at which, when the flapper is also set there, the temperature in the \u201ctank, 9,\u201d is that desired. This corrects the following difficulty. With proportioning control alone the system comes to an equilibrium when the supply of steam or other power through the \u201cpipe, 7,\u201d just answers the demands. Changes in the demands upon the \u201ctank, 9,\u201d may, however, result in an equilibrium at a point other than that of the desired temperature. It is to prevent this, and to insure that the point of equilibrium shall always be at the desired point that Mason introduced his \u201creset\u201d device, which operates as follows: The fluid coming through the \u201cpipe, 43,\u201d is retarded in its passage through the \u201crestricted connection, 55,\u201d so that it reaches the bellows, \u201c53,\u201d later than it reaches the bellows, \u201c39.\u201d Eventually the pressure in the two bellows becomes equal, and the nozzle is then at the desired point Since the flapper and the nozzle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>always tend to set the \u201cvalve, 5,\u201d at a position which will supply the steam necessary to answer the demands on the system, the point of equilibrium will in the end be identical with the desired temperature.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Wiinsch disclosed \u201cthe two chambers in the cylinder, 6,\u201d as \u201cconnected with one another by a pipe, 61, into which a delicate valve, 10, preferably a needle valve, is inserted,\u201d (page one, lines 87-89). Again, \u201cthe valve, 10, is so adjusted that a certain part-equalization of the pressures in the two cylinder chambers takes place through the pipe, 61, and, as the pressure in the left hand chamber of the cylinder correspondingly increases, the same takes place in the left hand chamber of the cylinder, 19\u201d (page 2, lines 17-23). As the pressures in both chambers tend to equalize, the pressure on the \u201cpiston, 20,\u201d increases and this tends to close the \u201cvalve, 21,\u201d and cut down the supply. However, by this equalization the \u201cpiston, 9,\u201d itself tends to move to the right and in so doing to move the \u201ctube, 4,\u201d to the left, just as the original movement of the \u201cdiaphragm, 21\u201d, had done, This movement of the \u201ctube, 4,\u201d in turn increases the pressure in the right hand chamber of the \u201ccylinder, 6.\u201d Thus, we have three separate forces set up through the increase of pressure in the right side of the \u201ccasing, 2.\u201d The first is the movement of the \u201cpiston, 9,\u201d to the left which is communicated to the \u201cvalve, 21,\u201d through the \u201cpiston, 20.\u201d Simultaneously with this is the counteracting force set up through the elements 26, 11 and 3, which by moving the \u201ctube, 4,\u201d reduces the pressure in the \u201cpipe, 5,\u201d and \u201cdamps\u201d the first effect. The third force operates later in time; and by the bleed of the \u201cneedle valve, 10,\u201d tends to move the \u201cpiston, 9,\u201d back to the right and in so doing to increase the pressure in the right hand chamber of the \u201ccylinder, 6,\u201d which as before is transmitted to the \u201cpiston, 20.\u201d This continues until the pressure in the \u201ccasing, 2,\u201d has been brought back to normal. Such is the undisputed testimony of Clarridge, who speaks of this feature of the disclosure as an \u201cautomatic reset.\u201d The \u201cneedle valve, 10,\u201d is the equivalent of Mason\u2019s \u201crestricted connection, 55\u201d; the left hand chamber of the \u201ccylinder, 6,\u201d is the equivalent of Mason\u2019s bellows, \u201c53,\u201d which tends gradually to remove the \u201cdamping\u201d action of the \u201cbellows, 39,\u201d just as the left hand chamber of Wiinsch gradually removes the \u201cdamping\u201d of the train of members 26, 11 and 3. _ j</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">That there are differences between the disclosures of these three prior patents and Mason\u2019s is true, but these are irrelevant except in so far as they appear in Mason\u2019s claims, and they do not appear there, except the element of an \u201celastic fluid\u201d in all but the first three; and Wiinsch disclosed \u201cair\u201d or a \u201cgas\u201d as an alternative to \u201coil.\u201d We should have no warrant for limiting the claims by the elements of the disclosure which they do not include, even if the elements were new. A patentee who claims broadly must prove broadly; he may not claim broadly, and recede as he later finds that the art unknown to him has limited his invention. That is the chance he must take in making broad claims; if he has claimed more than he was entitled to, the statute does give him a locus poenitentiae, but he must seasonably disclaim the broad claims in toto. He may not keep them by interpretative limitation; he must procure new claims by reissue. This is the significance of Milcor Steel Co. v. George A. Fuller Co., 316 U.S. 143, 62 S.Ct. 969, 86 L.Ed. 1332. This applies with exceptional force to the case at bar, in which Mason not only had his day in the Patent Office, but twice thereafter amended his claims; first, by his disclaimer, next, by reissue. It is true that Mason\u2019s single figure discloses no \u201cneedle valve\u201d in the pipe, \u201c43,\u201d and the flapper, \u201c35,\u201d as free from any opposing . force, yet from start to finish neither the claims nor the specifications so much as intimated that either of these features was an element of the invention. It would be enough to prevent such an interpretation of the claims that, after so many efforts the claims remained silent upon these details, even if the specifications had mentioned them; but the interpretation becomes doubly impossible when we remember that no invention can be saved by features which appear only in the figures, and are not mentioned in the text. Permutit Co. v. Graver Corp., 284 U.S. 52, 60, 52 S.Ct. 53, 76 L.Ed. 163; Vickery v. Barnhart, 118 F.2d 578, 585, 28 C.C.P.A., Pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>ents, 979. There is still another reason for the same result. We should have no warrant for supposing that, if Mason had limited his claims as the plaintiff wishes and must do, the examiner would have thought them patentable variants over Wingfield and W\u00fcnsch, neither of which he discovered. As to W\u00fcnsch, the plaintiff argues that, since it was pending while Mason\u2019s first application was in the Patent Office, we must suppose that the examiner did not think it relevant, else he would have brought it into interference. Yet upon Mason\u2019s original application the same examiner who later passed on the reissue, cited only two inconsequential references, although Lindsay\u2019s American patent had already issued. It would surely be hazardous to assume that the same man who later cited Lindsay against the invention should earlier have disregarded Wunsch, if he had had it in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">For these reasons, merely as a matter of interpretation, we could not properly save the claims by incorporating into them those elements upon which the plaintiff relies to distinguish from the prior art; and even if we could, it would not save them. Apparently it is true that the art began to feel the need of \u201cmultiple capacity\u201d controllers as early as 1920, and if Mason had been the first to devise one, it would be plausible to argue that so long an interval was an indication that the invention required ingenuity out of the common. But that is not the history of the development of these machines. As we have seen, Lindsay filed his \u201ccomplete specifications\u201d in November, 1924; they were certainly one step in that development. Wingfield filed his \u201ccomplete specifications\u201d in February, 1926, less than two years later; that was another step \u2014 the flapper was unrestrainedly free to respond to changes in pressure. W\u00fcnsch\u2019s German application followed Wingfield in June, 1928; that was still another step: he disclosed the \u201creset,\u201d and the alternative of \u201cair\u201d or \u201ca gas,\u201d as well as \u201coil.\u201d Mason followed W\u00fcnsch in September, 1930, with whatever was new in his disclosure, and there is undoubtedly much that was new, if we altogether disregard his claims. But, were we even free to compose combinations out of such new elements in disregard of the claims, how could we say that, coming as they did and being what they are, they were inventions? Mason at best was the last of a number of inventors, who in quick succession made steps in a gradual development, and if any of the steps are notable, Mason\u2019s does not appear to be among them. So far as he is concerned, his work is merely the latest refinement of a continuous progress, proceeding by trial and error. True, Mason may personally be entitled to more credit than that; he may have devised the whole machine unaided; but that is not the test; the law unsparingly charges him with an acquaintance with all the earlier developments of the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We do not forget that sheet anchor of patentees \u2014 success\u2014and we will assume, not only that the plaintiff\u2019s machines have had great success, but that the defendant\u2019s as well are to be counted as further evidence of success. As one factor in determining the issue of invention, success may indeed be important; but it is usually troublesome to know what weight to give it, and it is extremely apt to lead one wholly astray. As courts have again and again observed, all sorts of factors other than the novelty and value of the disclosure may aceount for success: e. g., excellence of design not shown in the disclosure, fineness of workmanship, reputation of the maker, advertising and the like. In the case at bar let us, nevertheless, eliminate all such possible factors; let us suppose that it was only the differences between the disclosure of Mason and those of Lindsay, Wingfield and W\u00fcnsch, which for the first time made possible a machine acceptable to the art. We should still be as far as ever from any safe use of this evidence, for the question is of the success to be attributed to that part of the disclosure which the claims have selected. Only in case we have some assurance that the success was here due to those factors by which the claims differed from the prior art, ought we take it as a criterion; and it would certainly be a gratuitous assumption to suppose that the industry\u2019s acceptance of these machines was due in any measure to those factors in the claims, if indeed there are any. We therefore reject the industry\u2019s acceptance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of these machines as any evidence whatever that Mason\u2019s claims were valid; and, being thrown back upon any advance over the art discoverable in them, we are at a loss to find any unless it be the gathering of factors which had all appeared before. When that occurs by gathering from remote arts, it is often an index of much insight and perspicacity; but not when the combination is of factors to be found in the very field, and especially in so special a field as this; and certainly not when the tempo has been so swift as it was here.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Finally, when all else is said, we cannot ignore the change in recent years in the standard of invention adopted by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is as idle to pretend that there has been no change (In re Shortell, 142 F.2d 292, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1062), as it would be to protest against it; and it is as much the duty of a lower court to give effect to it, as it is its duty to give effect to any other of the decisions of that court. We are to dispose of the question of invention, so far as we can divine, as we think the Supreme Court would dispose of it; and, once the cloud of complicated scientific theory, with which it has been surrounded, is blown away, and the issues are bared as they really are, we have no doubt that that court would hold the claims invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Judgment reversed; complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">On Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b288-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The petition for rehearing points out a mistake in our description of Wingfield\u2019s disclosure: The \u201cspring S\u201d is a tension spring and cannot act as a pivot for the \u201clever K.\u201d Next it is true that when the left end of the \u201clever K\u201d descends with any increase of pressure in the chamber \u201cR\u201d the \u201cleakport B\u201d will tend to open and this is what decreases the pressure in that chamber and stops the descent of the valve. On the other hand it is equally true that as the \u201cdiaphragm C\u201d by expanding raises the flapper, \u201cQ\u201d and thus decreases the pressure in the chamber \u201cD\u201d the right end of the \u201clever K\u201d rises, thus tending to tighten the \u201cleak-port B.\u201d There is in this way a continual balancing between the forces acting upon the \u201cleakport B\u201d which is the important thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">We find nothing in the petition to change our original disposition of the appeal, and it is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">Petition for rehearing denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-17\"> 307 U.S. 243, 59 S.Ct. 857, 83 L.Ed.1264.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\"> Permutit Co. v.
