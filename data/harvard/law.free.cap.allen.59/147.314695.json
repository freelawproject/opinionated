Before any use had been made of the lumber, the plaintiffs purchased the same, together with the contract for building the house, of Sargent, and took a bill of sale therefor, dated the 22d of February, 1848, and receipted by Sargent, who, at the same time, delivered the lumber to them. The plaintiff, in pursuance of the provisions of the building contract, made payments to Bradbury, and to his order, on the 21st and 22d of February, 1848. On the 25th of February, the lumber was attached by the defendant, as the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of Bradbury; whereupon the plaintiffs brought this action of replevin to recover the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-5\">J. <em>G.

The plaintiffs claim title under an alleged sale of the property from Bradbury to Sargent, and a sale from him to the plaintiffs. But there is nothing in the statement of facts, to support the alleged sale from Bradbury to Sargent. The boards and timber were delivered to Sargent, to be used in completing the contract between him and Bradbury; and Sargent\u2019s sale to the plaintiffs was unauthorized and void as against Bradbury. The defendant, therefore, who attached the boards and timber, as the property of Bradbury, is entitled to a return.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
