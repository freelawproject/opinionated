Henshaw <em>vs. </em>Eben Davis.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b155-7\">Three months\u2019 service, in one item, is not a proper subject of book-charge, ff a party\u2019s book of account is not objected to. when offered in evidence, but ir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>suffered to go to the jury, the judge may nevertheless instruct them, that it <em>ia </em>not competent evidence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">In this case, which was an <em>action of </em>assumpsit, tried before Bigelow, J., in the court of common pleas, to recover the amount of a promissory note signed by the defendant, and indorsed to the plaintiff by Perley R. Slater, after the same \u2022had become due and payable, the defendant filed an account against Slater, in set-off, consisting of various items, among which was a charge for three months\u2019 labor, $90; a charge for a promissory note of David Olmstead, $86; and a charge for cash lent, $50; in proof of which, he offered his book of original entries, supported by his suppletory oath.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">The plaintiff objected to the admission of the book in evidence to prove the second and third items of charge, and the judge sustained the objection; and, when the case was closed on both sides, the judge instructed the jury, that the book was equally incompetent to prove the charge for three months\u2019 labor ; and that unless they should be satisfied by other evidence, that the charge for work was true, they ought not tv allow it in set-off in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-8\"><em>W. </em>Hilliard, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-9\"><em>S.

It is sometimes competent to introduce the book, if corrobo rated, otherwise not; and it might be supposed, if not ob <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>jected to in the outset, that corroborating evidence would be offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The judge could not know, until the end of the trial, what corroborating evidence there would be; and after the evidence was all in, it was proper for the court to decide upon the competency of the book. This is a species of evidence peculiar in its nature, of the competency of which, in each case, the court must decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
