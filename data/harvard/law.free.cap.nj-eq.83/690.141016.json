Flynn, appellant, <em>v. </em>Joseph A. Flynn, Jr., respondent.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b716-7\">[Submitted July 6th, 1914.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AfW\">Decided November 16th, 1914.]</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b716-8\">In a suit for divorce on the ground of <em>desertion </em>\u2014 Held, that the petitioner was not a <em>dona fide </em>resident of this state \u201cat the time the cause of action arose,\u201d within the meaning of the jurisdiction clauses of the Divorce act of 1907 <em>(Comp. Stab. p. 3031). Gets: </em>v. <em>Getz, 81 N. J. Eq. 465, </em>followed.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b716-9\">On appeal from a decree of the court of chancery advised by Advisory Master Clarence S. Biddle, who filed the following conclusions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b716-10\">The desertion commenced in the State oE New York in August, 1904. After this the petitioner lived with her mother in that state until the latter\u2019s death in August, 1908, when she removed to the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b716-11\">The jurisdictional fact stated by the master that the petitioner was a <em>bona fids </em>resident of this state when the cause of action arose cannot be sustained. <em>Koch </em>v. Koch, <em>79 N. J. Eq. 24.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b716-12\">The petition should be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b716-13\">Further depositions having been taken on order therefor, the following memorandum was filed:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b716-14\">The additional testimony is to the effect that shortly before the petitioner became a resident of this state the defendant said that if the petitioner would leave her folks and live elsewhere than in the city of Brooklyn, or would live \u201cout of the state,\u201d ho would support her. I do not understand that the husband and wife agreed to live separate until the wTife got ready to live out of the State of Mew York; and there is no indication that the wife gave assent to the husband\u2019s previous desertion, and after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>taking up lier residence in this state, notified him of that fact and called upon him to fulfill his part of the agreement. The most favorable light in which the situation can be viewed from the wife's standpoint (and T think the true one) is, that the husband did not arrest the period of desertion by such display of mental attitude.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b717-5\">It is clear to me that the solicitor is dissatisfied with <em>Koch </em>v. Koch, <em>79 N. J. Eq. 24. </em>Since the former memorandum in this case, the court has decided <em>Getz </em>v. Getz, <em>81 N. J. Eq. 465. </em>It does not appear to me to bo becoming to further agitate the point in this court; but the petitioner if aggrieved must resort to her appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b717-6\">The clerk is directed to dismiss this petition at once.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b717-7\"><em>Messrs. Teeple &amp; </em>Unger, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b717-8\">Pee Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The decree appealed from will Ire affirmed, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed in the court below by Advisory Master Biddle. \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Ci-tief-Justice, Garrison, Swayze, Trenci-iaed, Parker, Bergen, Minturn, Kalisck, Black, Bogert, Vbedenbuegi-i, ' Terhune, Heppenheimer, Williams \u2014 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
