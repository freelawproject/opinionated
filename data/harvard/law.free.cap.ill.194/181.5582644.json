English, as the trustee in a deed of trust executed August 8, \u00cd895, by Henry Brand on his electric light plant in the city of Danville, brought his bill in the circuit court of Vermilion county to foreclose the deed of trust as a mortgage, and, for alleged fraud, to have two certain deeds of conveyance of said plant, one made by Brand to appellee Prank Lindley on August 9, and the other by Lindley to the Danville Gas, Electric Light and Street Railway Company on August 31, 1895, adjudged to be subject and junior to said deed of trust. The bill also prayed for an accounting for waste. The material allegations of the bill were denied by the answers, and issue having been joined the cause was referred to the master to take and report the evidence, with his conclusions. The master took and reported the evidence and recommended a dismissal of the bill. On the hearing the chancellor sustained exceptions to the master\u2019s report and entered a decree for the complainant, as prayed in his bill. On appeal the Appellate Court reversed the decree and remanded the cause, with directions to dismiss the bill. The complainant then took this appeal, by which he seeks a reversal of the judgment of the Appellate Court and an affirmance of the decree of the circuit court.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\" pgmap=\"182(238) 183(374) 184(345)\">It appears from the evidence that on the 8th of August, 1895, Henry Brand was the owner of the said electric light plant, and being indebted to the First National Bank of Danville for money previously borrowed, to the amount of \u00a716,000, made and delivered to appellant, as trustee, the deed of trust in question to secure its payment,\u2018subject to a previous mortgage, already of record, securing a debt of \u00a73180 to a foreign creditor; that upon delivery of the deed of trust Brand stated to 'appellant that if it should be placed on record at once it would ruin his credit, and as he owed some small debts he requested appellant to withhold the deed of trust from the records for a few days, so that he might have time to adjust them. Appellant acquiesced, and replied that the instrument would not be filed for record for a few days. Appellant, who was one of the officers of and employed in said First National Bank, was then about to depart on a trip to the far west, and deposited the deed of trust in a box to be placed in the bank vault. There was at the same time another electric light plant in the city of Danville, owned by the Danville Gas, Electric Light and Street Bailway Company, and the competition between the two had resulted in financial losses to both. This company, for convenience, we will call the \u201cDanville company.\u201d William P. Cannon was the largest stockholder, the secretary and one of the directors of this company. On August 9, \u2014 the next day after Brand had delivered his deed of trust to the appellant, \u2014 he, Brand, sought an interview with Cannon for the purpose of selling to him his said plant, offering to take \u00a718,000, and finally \u00a715,-000, for it. Cannon consulted with his attorneys and then declined to buy. He and Brand do not agree in their testimony as to what was said between them at the two or more interviews they had on the day in question, but Cannon admits that he ascertained or knew at that time that the \u00a716,000 deed of trust had been given, and the evidence is that at Brand\u2019s request Cannon undertook to find a purchaser for the plant, and went to see Lindley for that purpose. Lindley was a practicing attorney in Danville, and a sort of general trader and speculator in commercial paper and other commodities. He had been ill, and was then at his residence convalescing. He said he would not give \u00a715,000 but would give \u00a712,500 for the property. Cannon did not tell him that Brand had given the deed of trust to appellant, and the preponderance of the evidence is that Lindley did not learn of the existence of the deed of trust until after he had bought and paid for the property and had received and filed for record the conveyance to him from Brand and had obtained possession of the plant. Cannon reported Lindley\u2019s offer to Brand and Brand accepted it, but required that the deal should be closed up that day. Lindley, who was a member of the law firm of Penwell &amp; Lindley, procured Penwell to draw the deed for execution by Brand, and then, with one Samuel, a notary public, was driven in a cab, between seven and eight o\u2019clock in the evening, to the residence of Brand, where Brand and his wife executed and acknowledged the deed. Samuel was- an employee in the Second National Bank, of which bank Cannon was president. Penwell &amp; Lindley were attorneys for said bank, and Penwell was president of the Danville company, of which, as before said, Cannon was secretary. Lindley obtained the purchase money, $12,-500, from said Second National Bank in the form of a certificate of deposit for that amount, by giving his individual check therefor. He was a man of means and a depositor of said bank, but at that time had there only a few hundred dollars to his credit. After Brand and his wife had executed and acknowledged the deed to Lindley at his house on the evening of August 9, Lindley declined to pay over the purchase money until he could examine the records, and thereupon he and Samuel drove to the residence of the recorder of deeds, (who had closed his office at six o\u2019clock,) and then, in company with the recorder, went to the latter\u2019s office, where Lindley ascertained that there were no liens on record on said plant except the above mentioned mortgage of $3180., He then transferred and delivered to Brand, who had also come over to the recorder\u2019s office, said certificate of deposit and then filed for record his deed from Brand. He then asked Brand for possession of the property, and at his request Brand went with him to the electric light plant and introduced him to his superintendent and informed him of the sale, and the superintendent thereupon agreed with Lindley to act thereafter for him in the business. Lindley continued to operate the plant for a few weeks, and, designing to form a corporation to carry on the business, obtained from the Secretary of State a certificate of incorporation, but before concluding the matter, and on August 31, 1895, he sold and conveyed, by deed of general warranty, the plant and business to the said Danville company for $13,000. Said company thereupon took possession and dismantled the plant, removing the machinery, etc. Much testimony was taken concerning the value of Brand\u2019s plant when Lindley purchased it, and different values were fixed, varying from $13,000 to $30,000.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-4\" pgmap=\"185\">Kimbrough &amp; Meeks, and Lawrence &amp; Lawrence, for. appellant:</attorneys><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\" pgmap=\"185\">Mere omission to record a mortgage, though caused by request of the mortgagor, does not make the mortgage fraudulent as to subsequent creditors and purchasers.

On his inquiry Brand told him there was nothing against the property but what the record showed, viz., the \u00a73180 mortgage, and Lindley understood that he was buying the property subject to that mortgage. Lindley examined the records and found no other lien, and there is no proof that he knew that Brand was indebted to the First National Bank, or to appellant, in any sum. Indeed, appellant does not base his principal contention on this branch of the case. Before the trial of the case Brand had been arrested, imprisoned and fined, and when, or before, he was released he paid \u00a76500 of the purchase money he obtained from Lindley, in part payment of the \u00a716,000 secured by the deed of trust. He became a witness for appellant, but his testimony did not tend to prove notice to Lindley of said deed of trust, but the contrary, and whatever the business and confidential relations of Lindley with Cannon,. Penwell and Samuel, or others, may have been, a court would not be authorized therefrom, in the face of the positive testimony of Lindley, Cannon and others to the contrary, to find that Lindley had such notice. Besides, it could hardly be presumed that Lindley, who was a lawyer and knew the effect of notice to him of an unrecorded mortgage on the plant, would, with such notice, have paid so large a sum for it, \u2014 a sum which the evidence shows was very nearly, if not altogether, equivalent to its full value, subject to said mortgage of \u00a73180.</p> <p id=\"b191-4\" pgmap=\"191(354) 192(149)\">Nor can we find that the evidence sustains the other branch of the case, which must rest upon the claim that Lindley was in fact without notice of the deed of trust, but was a mere dummy in the transaction, employed by Cannon, Penwell and others, as representatives of said Danville company, to procure the plant, ostensibly for himself but in reality for said company, freed from the lien of appellant\u2019s unrecorded deed of trust, and that the scheme was finally consummated by the conveyance from Lindley to said company. Aside from inferences which the appellant insists should be drawn from the events as they subsequently happened, and from the business and confidential relations of the persons mentioned, there is no evidence to sustain the contention of the appellant. Fraud cannot be presumed, but must be proved. Men who may be associated together in business, or as officers or members of one or more business corporations, are as free to deal with each other, and with others, as are men not so associated, without the imputation of having acted fraudulently, \u2014 unless, indeed, their relations are of a fiduciary character, where, as in some cases, their dealings may be held to be constructively fraudulent, even though there be no fraudulent intent. The clear preponderance of the evidence in this case is that Lindley did not buy the plant for the Danville company, but for himself, and that there was at the time no sugges.tion by Cannon, Lindley, or any one else, to the contrary. True, he borrowed the money from the Second National Bank, of which Cannon was president; but he transacted his banking business at that bank, and he made his check good in a few days after the purchase. He was known to Cannon, the secretary, and to Penwell, the president of the Danville company, as a trading man, with whom such purchases were not unusual; and even if they entertained the thought that their company might be able to purchase the property of him at a later period, that would not be sufficient to stamp the transaction with fraud, nor to lead to the conclusion that Lindley did not buy in good faith for himself, nor to render his title insecure for any i-eason. Then, again, on his part, he had as much right to buy with the intention to sell again at a profit as with intention to permanently operate the plant. It may well be that Cannon, as a stockholder in and secretary of said company, may have believed it to be beneficial to his interests and to the interest of said company, that Brand\u2019s plant should pass into friendly rather than unfriendly hands, and so believing took an active part in the sale as he did. If so, we cannot adjudge the transaction fraudulent on that account. Law, as well as common sense, expects and allows men to act for their own interest where they are not acting in any trust relation.</p> <p id=\"b192-5\" pgmap=\"192\">The claim is also made that, as showing notice or bad faith, or both, Lindley paid only a small part of the real value of the plant. This claim is not sustained by the evidence, but the weight of the evidence is that with the mortgage of $3180 resting on the property it was worth but very little, if anything, more than $12,500. Indeed, several witnesses of experience in establishing such plants testified that aside from the value of the real estate proper, all of the machinery and appliances could be furnished and put up new for $10,000, and the evidence showed that the real estate was worth from $3000 to $4000.</p> <p id=\"b192-6\" pgmap=\"192(96) 193(64)\">It is also contended that, inasmuch as William P. Cannon, the secretary of the Danville company, had notice of appellant\u2019s unrecorded deed of trust, it follows that the company had the same notice. This would doubtless be true if Cannon had purchased the property for said company, but the evidence shows that he was acting for Brand, at his request, to find him a purchaser, and having brought Lindley and Brand together, Lindley purchased for himself. It is not contended that Cannon acted as agent of Lindley so as to charge Lindley with notice. It certainly does not appear that in his negotiations between Brand and Lindley he was acting for or even within the scope of his authority from the Dan-ville company, or that said company ever ratified or had anything to do with the transactions between Brand and Lindley. We cannot, therefore, hold that Cannon\u2019s knowledge was also the knowledge of the company.</p> <p id=\"b193-5\" pgmap=\"193\">But if it were held that the Danville company had notice of appellant\u2019s unrecorded deed of trust when Lindley purchased, still, if Lindley did not make the purchase for said company, but made it for himself without notice, his conveyance to the company conferred as good a title to it as he himself had, irrespective of the knowledge of the company, for the law is, that a purchaser from a grantee who obtained title in good faith and for value, without notice of prior equities, will be protected against such equities although he had notice thereof himself.

Ency. of Law, 589.</p> <p id=\"b193-6\" pgmap=\"193(171) 194(48)\">Counsel for appellant concede the rule, but insist that all the persons who were acting in negotiating the sale by Brand, or in taking title from him, were acting in concert for and on behalf of the Danville company, and-that therefore the rule does not apply. The evidence, as before said, fails to sustain this branch of the case. As observed in Shinn v. Shinn, 91 Ill. 477: \u201cSomething more than suspicions are required to prove an allegation of fraud. The evidence must be clear and cogent, and must leave the mind well satisfied that the allegation is true.\u201d That Brand acted fraudulently is not doubted, but his fraud cannot be imputed to his grantee who had no knowledge of it. The appellant, by withholding his deed of trust from the public records, put it in the power of Brand to commit a fraud on him, and he cannot be permitted to shift the loss caused by such fraud of Brand upon subsequent purchasers, without sufficient proof that they either participated in the fraud or had notice of it before the purchase. To thus protect the holders of such unrecorded liens at the expense of others who subsequently deal with the property would nullify the statute and impede the sale and transfer of real property.</p> <p id=\"b194-7\" pgmap=\"194\">Finding no error the judgment of the Appellate Court must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"ADX\" pgmap=\"194\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b194-8\" pgmap=\"194\">Magruder, J., Cartwright and Hand, JJ., dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
