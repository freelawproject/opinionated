No distinction seems to have been drawn between the names \u201cWomen\u2019s\u201d and \u201cYoung Women\u2019s,\u201d as applied to the various local associations, the object of each being the promotion of the moral, religious, intellectual and temporal welfare of women, especially young women who are self-supporting.</p> <p id=\"b196-3\" pgmap=\"196(200) 197(316) 198(17)\">Appellee first became incorporated in 1877 under the name \u201cThe Women\u2019s Christian Association,\u201d which name was in 1887 changed to \u201cThe Young Women\u2019s Christian Association of Chicago.\u201d In effectuation of its purposes it maintains two boarding houses, a free medical dispensary, library, employment bureau, etc., and is enabled to do so by the aid of contributions of money and other valuable articles from its friends. No religious or sectarian test has been required of the voting and managing members of the association other than that of Christian character, although its managing board has been composed of women from nearly all of the evangelical churches of Chicago; neither has such a test been applied as a prerequisite to representation in the biennial international conferences, but at some one or more of these conferences the question of applying the so-called \u201cevangelical test\u201d was more or less urged and discussed informally. The mooted question thus discussed was whether or not the conference should adopt a resolution that in the future no association should be permitted representation in the conference unless its separate constitution should contain a provision making a prerequisite to voting and office-holding membership therein that they should be members in good standing of evangelical churches. Through the influence of some of the leading members of the conference the proposed resolution was never acted upon by the conference but was kept out of that body. The result was, that steps were taken by at least some of those who favored such a test, to organize a central association of women to which no member of any association should be admitted unless its voting and office-holding membership should be limited to women who were members of churches subscribing to the \u201cevangelical test.\u201d The first convention of these latter persons was held in 1886, at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and at that time a national.committee was elected, which, on October 9, 1891, became incorporated in this State as \u201cInternational Committee of Young Women\u2019s Christian Associations,\u201d the appellant here. The objects of the appellant, as set forth in its charter, are: \u201cThe organization and development of young women\u2019s Christian associations for the promotion of the physical, social, intellectual and spiritual education of women,\u201d and its management is vested in a board known and described as \u201cInternational Committee.\u201d Since its organization and incorporation, local associations said to number over three hundred have come under its management and control, two local associations having been organized in Chicago, the previously chosen field of appellee, under the names, respectively, of \u201cThe North Chicago Young Women\u2019s Christian Association\u201d and \u201cThe West Chicago Yonng Women\u2019s Christian Association,\u201d and in furtherance of that work the appellant has issued and circulated through the mails a publication known as \u201cThe Young Women\u2019s Christian Association Quarterly,\u201d which was latterly succeeded by \u201cThe Young Women\u2019s Christian Association Evangel.\u201d Much confusion has arisen on account of the similarity in name of the appellant and appellee. Letters intended for the one have been delivered to the other, visitors intending to call upon the one have called upon the other, and donations intended for the one have been received by the other.</p> <p id=\"b198-3\" pgmap=\"198(328) 199(193)\">It is apparent the motive for the creation of the \u201cInternational Committee\u201d was brought about by the failure of \u201cThe International Conference\u201d to adopt the resolution requiring the \u201cevangelical test.\u201d That those persons who favored the adoption of such a resolution had a right to withdraw from the international conference when convinced that their views were not agreeable to the majority of the conference, and to call a convention of those who were favorable to their views, and to select a committee or board of managers to have general supervision over the work of the associations comprising that convention, is not denied and must be conceded by all. The question here, however, to be decided is, had such persons, upon their withdrawal and re-organization, a right to adopt as a name for its managing board \u201cInternational Committee of Young Women\u2019s Christian Associations,\u201d a name which contains substantially the entire corporate name of appellee, a previously incorporated association, preceded by the words \u201cInternational Committee of,\u201d which clearly indicate to the ordinary mind that appellant is a committee of appellee and the conference .with which appellee is affiliated and with which appellant has no connection, and to use that name in the conduct of its affairs? We think not. The object, work, sources of support and field of' labor of each being substantially the same, and the name of appellee having been adopted and in use by it many years prior to the incorporation of the appellant, the appellant had no right to adopt as its corporate name one so similar to that of appellee, or to incorporate in its name words which would indicate to the public that it was the representative of appellee and the conference with which appellee is affiliated. In addition to the similarity of name and the representation contained in appellant\u2019s name that appellant is the representative of appellee and the conference with which it is affiliated, from an examination of the entire record it clearly appears that such name was adopted by the appellant advisedly, and for the purpose of leading the general public, and the persons with whom it was likely to be associated and from whom it hoped and expected to obtain support by way of donations, to believe that it stood as the committee and representative of the associations known as \u201cThe Young Women\u2019s Christian Association,\u201d then organized in the field where it expected to operate. Appellant may have felt justified in so doing by reason of the failure of the \u201cInternational Conference\u201d to adopt the \u201cevangelical test,\u201d yet such conduct, in law, amounts to a fraud upon the public and appellee. While it is true that generic terms or mere descriptive words are the common property of the public and not ordinarily susceptible of appropriation by an individual, that fact will not prevent the issuing of an injunction to restrain the use of such terms and words at the suit of one who has already adopted them, where the evidence shows a fraudulent design and that the public will be misled.</p> <p id=\"b199-5\" pgmap=\"199\">In Knott v. Morgan, 3 Keen, 215, an injunction having been issued restraining the defendant from imitating the plaintiff\u2019s line of omnibuses, the court said: \u201cIt is not to be said that the plaintiffs have any exclusive right to the words \u2018Conveyance Company\u2019 or \u2018London Conveyance Company, \u2019 or any other words, but they have a right to call upon this court to restrain the defendant from fraudulently using precisely the same words and devices which they have taken for the purpose of distinguishing their property, and thereby depriving them of the fair profits of their business by attracting custom on false representation that carriages really the defendant\u2019s belong to and are under the management of the plaintiffs.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b199-6\" pgmap=\"199(37) 200(65)\">In Croft v. Day, 7 Beav. 84, Lord Langdale, in granting an injunction to restrain the defendant from using labels or show-cards calculated to produce deception, said: \u201cMy decision does not depend on any peculiar or exclusive right the plaintiffs have to nse the name of Day &amp; Martin, but upon the fact of the defendant\u2019s using those names in connection with certain circumstances and in a manner calculated to mislead the public, and to enable the defendant to obtain, at the expense of Day\u2019s estate, a benefit for himself to which he is not in fair and honest dealing entitled.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b200-3\" pgmap=\"200\">In .Lee v. Halley, L. R. 5 Ch. App. Cas. 155, the complainants being coal merchants carrying on business at 22 Pall Mall, London, as \u201cThe Guinea Coal Company,\u201d the defendant, their former manager, set up for himself in Beaufort Buildings, Strand, as \u201cThe Pall Mall Guinea Coal Company,\u201d and afterwards removed to 46 Pall Mall. An injunction having been granted restraining the defendant from trading in that name in Pall Mall, it was held by the court of appeals in chancery that the injunction was properly issued. In announcing the decision Lord Justice Giffard said: \u201cI quite agree that they (the plaintiffs) have no property in the name; but the principle upon which the cases on this subject proceed is, not that there is property in the word, but that it is a fraud on a person who bas an established trade and carries it on under a given name, that some other person should assume the same name with a slight alteration, in such a way as to induce persons to deal with him in the belief that they are dealing with the person who has given a reputation to the name. * * * I think this injunction has been properly granted upon the well known principles of this court, which are applicable to all cases of this description, viz., that it is a fraud on the part of a defendant to set up business under such a designation as is calculated to lead, and does lead, other people to suppose that his business is the business of another person.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b200-4\" pgmap=\"200(46) 201(17)\">In McLean v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245, it is said: \u201cNor is it necessary, in order to give a right to an injunction, that a specific trade-mark should be infringed, but it is sufficient that the court is satisfied that there was an intent on the part of the respondent to palm off his goods as the goods of the complainant.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b201-3\" pgmap=\"201\">We are of the opinion the Appellate Court properly held that the name of the appellant is so similar to the name of appellee and so arranged as to deceive and mislead the public into believing that the appellant is the appellee, or a committee or representative of appellee and the conference with which it affiliates, and properly directedthe superior court to grant a perpetual injunction against the appellant restraining it from using the name \u201cInternational Committee of Young Women\u2019s Christian Associations,\u201d or any colorable imitation thereof, etc., as prayed for in said original and supplemental bills.</p> <p id=\"b201-4\" pgmap=\"201\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will therefore be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"ATz\" pgmap=\"201\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <author id=\"b201-5\" pgmap=\"201\">Mr. Justice Magruder:</author> <p id=\"As7\" pgmap=\"201\">I take no part in this decision.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b201-6\" pgmap=\"201\">Mr. Chief Justice Wilkin,</author> <p id=\"AxF\" pgmap=\"201\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b201-7\" pgmap=\"201(157) 202(126)\">The prayer of the bill in this case is, in effect, that the defendant be restrained from using its corporate name, and the Appellate Court, in remanding the cause, directed the superior court \u201cto grant a perpetual injunction against it, in accordance with the prayer of the bill and supplemental bill.\u201d The effect, therefore, of the affirmance of the judgment of that court will be to perpetually enjoin the defendant from using the name under which it was regularly incorporated. The corporate name of the complainant, as stated in the bill and admitted by the answer, is, \u201cThe Young Women\u2019s Christian Association of Chicago,\u201d and that of the defendant, \u201cInternational Committee of Young Women\u2019s Christian Associations.\u201d The defendant has not, therefore, as stated in the foregoing opinion, adopted as a name for its managing board \u201ca name which contains substantially the entire corporate name of the complainant, preceded by the words \u2018International Committee of.\u2019 \u201d The defendant\u2019s name is not \u201cInternational Committee of the Young Women\u2019s Christian Associations of Chicago.\u201d It was, in fact, only the four descriptive words,\u201cYoung Women\u2019s Christian Associations.\u201d It does not purport to be the committee of any association, but of associations generally. The names are not, therefore, the same, or so similar as to be mistaken for each other. As we said in Elgin Butter Co. v. Elgin Creamery Co. 155 Ill. 127: \u201cOrdinary attention will enable any one to distinguish between them.\u201d Section 2 of the act concerning corporations (Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1899, p. 434,) was not, therefore, violated by the Secretary of State in granting the license to the defendant to organize its society under its corporate name.</p> <p id=\"b202-3\" pgmap=\"202\">The complainant had no exclusive right to the use of the generic name \u201cYoung Women\u2019s Christian Association.\u201d (Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Co. v. Employers' Liability Ins. Co. 16 N.Y. Sup. 396; Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. of Kansas, 2 id. 296; Goodyear India Rubber Glove Manf. Co.v. Goodyear Rubber Co. 128 U. S. 598; Bolander v. Peterson, 136 Ill. 215.) The cases do not always distinguish between trade-marks and trade names, but there is no exception to the rule that no individual or corporation can appropriate a name composed of ordinary descriptive words, which may with equal truth be used by any other individual or corporation to designate its business, its character or its purposes.</p> <p id=\"b202-4\" pgmap=\"202(104) 203(369) 204(112)\">That a generic name or words cannot be appropriated by a later corporation for the purpose of defrauding an earlier one is conceded, and the cases cited in the foregoing opinion go to that extent, and no farther. Croft v. Day, 7 Beav. 84, is a leading case on that doctrine, and is referred to in both Goodyear India Rubber Glove Manf. Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co. and Elgin Butter Co. v. Elgin Creamery Co. supra. In the former, after holding that the name \u201cGoodyear Rubber Company\u201d was not one capable of exclusive appropriation, etc., it was said: \u201cThe case at bar cannot be sustained as one to restrain unfair trade. Relief in such cases is granted only where the defendant, by his marks, signs, labels or any other-way, represents to the public that the goods sold by him are those manufactured or produced by the plaintiff, thus palming off his goods for those of a different manufacturer, to the injury of plaintiff,\u201d \u2014 citing, among other cases, that of Croft v. Day, supra; also, McLean v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245. In the Elgin Butter Co. case, after holding that the Elgin Butter Company could not acquire such property in the words \u201cElgin Butter and Creamery\u201d as to prevent a subsequently formed corporation from using its corporate title, in the absence of fraudulent conduct calculated to lead the public to understand that the corporations were one and the same, and after saying: \u201cThe gist of the complaint seems to be that the use by the Elgin Creamery Company of its corporate name in its business of manufacturing, dealing in and selling butter has a tendency to, and does, confuse and mislead dealers in the market and the public at large, and lead them into the false belief that the corporation incorporated as \u2018Elgin Creamery Company\u2019 is one and the same with the corporation incorporated as \u2018The Elgin Butter Company.\u2019 The bill proceeds upon the theory that the name \u2018The Elgin Butter Company,\u2019 and the claimed addition thereto of the words \u2018Proprietor of the Elgin Creamery Company, \u2019 are the trade name and trademark of complainant, and that it has the exclusive right and property in both said corporate name and said addition, and that no other person or corporation has a legal right to combine the word \u2018Elgin\u2019 with either the word \u2018butter\u2019 or the word \u2018creamery\u2019 in conducting his or its business,\u201d \u2014 we used the following language: \u201cEven if the corporate names of the two corporations are somewhat similar, yet, in the absence of any intent, act or artifice to mislead dealers in the market or the public at large as to the identity of the corporations, the Elgin Creamery Company has the same right to use its corporate name in the transaction of its business that the Elgin Butter Company has to use its corporate name. It would seem that the same rule should apply to corporations in this regard that obtains in respect to natural persons, and in the absence of any fraudulent or wrongful intention or act, or any contract to prohibit it, every natural person has the absolute right to use his owu name in his own business.\u201d (Meneely v. Meneely, 62 N.Y. 427.) Certain cases are then referred to, among others, Croft v. Day, supra, which are distinguished upon the ground that \u201cin each of those cases there was present the element of fraudulent acts and intent.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b204-3\" pgmap=\"204\">The distinguishing feature of the Croft case, as well as each of the other cases cited in the majority opinion, is, in the language of Lord Langdale, \u201cthe fact of the defendant\u2019s using those names in connection with certain circumstances and in a manner calculated to mislead the public, and to enable the defendant to obtain, at the expense of Day\u2019s estate, a benefit for himself to which he is not, in fair and honest dealing, entitled.\u201d The bill in this case does not charge that the defendant has at any time, by words or conduct, represented itself as being the complainant or in any way connected with it, nor does the proof tend to establish any such state of case. It is no longer contended that the complainant has the right to appropriate to its own exclusive use the words \u201cYoung Women\u2019s Christian Association,\u201d and yet the defendant is to be perpetually enjoined from using those words in its name without proof of its having done anything except to carry on the charitable work for which it was incorporated.</p> <p id=\"b204-4\" pgmap=\"204\">In my opinion there is nothing in this case calling for the interference of a court of equity, and the chancellor properly dismissed the bill.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b204-5\" pgmap=\"204\">Mr. Justice Carter:</author> <p id=\"AZR\" pgmap=\"204\">I concur in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Wilkin.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
