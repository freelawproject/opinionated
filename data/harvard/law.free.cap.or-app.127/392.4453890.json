We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Defendant is a daycare provider who worked in her home. After three infants in her care were seriously injured within a five-month period, she was charged with assault and criminal mistreatment. At trial, defendant offered the oral testimony of one psychologist and two reports prepared by another psychologist as \u201c[ejvidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused.\u201d OEC 404(2)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state objected on the grounds that the evidence was an impermissible comment on witness credibility, that it was not properly the subject of expert testimony and that it was scientific evidence and, as such, required a foundation as set out in <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court excluded the evidence, concluding that it was a prohibited comment on the credibility of a witness and that \u2018 \u2018professional character evidence\u201d is different in kind from the character evidence contemplated by OEC 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In defendant\u2019s offer of proof, the psychologist testified that defendant had a low propensity for violence and that she controlled her temper, traits normally susceptible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>proof by character evidence under OEC 404(2)(a). However, the psychologist also testified that \u201cI don\u2019t see the traits that we see in many child abusers.\u201d The other psychologist\u2019s report indicated that defendant had completed the \u201cChild Abuse Potential Inventory\u201d and that the inventory did not \u201cidentify [defendant] as having characteristics similar to known, active, physical child abusers.\u201d The substance of the evidence was expert testimony as to whether the defendant possessed certain traits that are part of a \u201cchild abuser profile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><em>In State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 756 P2d 620 (1988), the Supreme Court held that evidence of \u201chow normal children usually react to sexual abuse,\u201d or \u201csex abuse syndrome,\u201d required a <em>Brown </em>foundation before it was admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cWe suggest that in future cases involving \u2018syndrome\u2019 testimony full foundations be established, if indeed it can be shown that the so-called \u2018typical\u2019 reactions can be demonstrated to be either typical or reliable.\u201d 305 Or at 631.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Whether it is labeled a \u201csyndrome\u201d or a \u201cprofile,\u201d the type of evidence proferred by defendant in this case involves comparing an individual\u2019s behavior with the behavior of others in similar circumstances who have been studied in the past. This comparison evidence purports to draw its convincing force from scientific principles. It requires an expert witness who can explain the data and test results, and, if necessary, the scientific principles that are said to give the evidence its reliability or accuracy. As such, it is scientific evidence. <em>See State v. Brown, supra, </em>297 Or at 407. Therefore, for the evidence to be admissible, defendant must demonstrate the evidence\u2019s probative value under the test announced in <em>Brown. State v. Milbradt, supra, </em>305 Or at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"> Defendant relied on OEC 404 and chose not to address any of the <em>Brown </em>factors. She thereby failed to establish the probative value of child abuser profiles. When it appears from the record that the trial court arrived at a correct result, but on grounds different from those which, in our opinion, are more correct, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed. <em>Carlson v. Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>57 Or App 695, 705 n 12, 646 P2d 43, <em>rev den </em>293 Or 801 (1982). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Regardless of its admissibility under OEC 404, profile evidence is scientific evidence and, therefore, a foundation must be laid as set forth in <em>State v. Brown, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\"> OEC 404(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201cEvidence of a person\u2019s character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that the person acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">\u201c(a) Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\"> In <em>Brown, the </em>court laid out seven factors for a court to consider in determining whether to admit scientific evidence.
