J.</author>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Defendant appeals his conviction of burglary in the first degree in case number CA A78493.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 164.225. The conviction was based on defendant having stolen approximately $40 worth of empty pop cans from the foyer area of a fraternity house at Willamette University. The issue is whether the fraternity house in this case is a \u201cdwelling,\u201d which, under Oregon\u2019s burglary statutes, elevates the seriousness of the offense from a Class C felony to a Class A felony. We hold that it is, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">ORS 164.215 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 164.255, a person commits the crime of burglary in the second degree if the person enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">\u2018 \u2018 (2) Burglary in the second degree is a Class C felony. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">ORS 164.225 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of burglary in the first degree if the person violates ORS 164.215 <em>and the building is a dwelling </em>***[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">((\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 ij: \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">\u201c(2) Burglary in the first degree is a Class A felony.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">ORS 164.205 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">\u201c(1) \u2018Building,\u2019 in addition to its ordinary meaning, includes any booth, vehicle, boat, aircraft or other structure adapted for overnight accommodation of persons or for carrying on business therein. Where a building consists of separate units, including, but not limited to, separate apartments, offices or rented rooms, each unit is, in addition to being a part of such building, a separate building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">\u201c(2) \u2018Dwelling\u2019 means a building which regularly or intermittently is occupied by a person lodging therein at night, whether or not a person is actually present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Thus, dwellings are a subset of the larger category, buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Defendant argues that the fraternity house is a building and that only the bedrooms <em>within </em>the house are dwellings. He contends that, because he committed theft in the foyer, and not one of the bedrooms, he did not commit first degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The term \u201cdwelling\u201d is not limited to the sleeping areas within a structure. For example, in <em>State v. Haas, </em>13 Or App 368, 510 P2d 852, <em>affd </em>267 Or 489, 517 P2d 671 (1973), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>420 US 714, 95 S Ct 1215, 43 L Ed 2d 570 (1975), we held that the defendant\u2019s entry into an unoccupied garage that was attached to a home constituted entry into a dwelling. The fraternity house in this case contains a living room, dining room, bathrooms and a number of bedrooms. It serves as a place of lodging at night for its student occupants. Given these facts, the house fits squarely within the definition of a \u201cdwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-15\"> Defendant\u2019s probation on a prior conviction was revoked in case number CA AJ\u2019ca'M:. Although the cases were consolidated on appeal, defendant raises no issue cone-' ning the probation revocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
