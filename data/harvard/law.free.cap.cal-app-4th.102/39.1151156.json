J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Jerold Daniel Friedman (plaintiff) appeals from a judgment entered after the general demurrers of Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (defendants), were sustained without leave to amend. In the published portion of this opinion, we resolve the question of whether veganism is a \u201creligious creed\u201d within the meaning of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Government Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 12940. We conclude veganism is not a \u201creligious creed\u201d within the meaning of the FEHA. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AV2\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Our Supreme Court has set forth the standard of review we must apply on appeal from a judgment following an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend as follows: \u201cOn appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, the standard of review is well settled. The reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. [Citations.] The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.] The judgment must be affirmed \u2018if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] However, it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory. [Citation.] And it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317]; accord, <em>Zelig v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 45 P.3d 1171]; <em>Blank v. Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">B. <em>The Complaint\u2019s Allegations of Religious Creed Discrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">The trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrers without leave to amend to plaintiffs first through third causes of action of his original complaint for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>religious creed discrimination and retaliation in violation of the FEHA. The trial court concluded veganism was not a religious creed within the meaning of the FEHA. In his original complaint, plaintiff alleged as follows. He is a strict vegan. Further, he alleged: \u201cAs a strict Vegan, [plaintiff] fervently believes that all living beings must be valued equally and that it is immoral and unethical for humans to kill and exploit animals, even for food, clothing and the testing of product safety for humans, and that such use is a violation of natural law and the personal religious tenets on which [plaintiff] bases his foundational creeds. He lives each aspect of his life in accordance with this system of spiritual beliefs. As a Vegan, and his beliefs <em>[sic], </em>[plaintiff] cannot eat meat, dairy, eggs, honey or any other food which contains ingredients derived from animals. Additionally, [plaintiff] cannot wear leather, silk or any other material which comes from animals, and cannot use any products such as household cleansers, soap or toothpaste which have been tested for human safety on animals or derive any of their ingredients from animals. This belief systemf] guides the way that he lives his life. [Plaintiff s] beliefs are spiritual in nature and set a course for his entire way of life; he would disregard elementary self-interest in preference to transgressing these tenets. [Plaintiff] holds these beliefs with the strength of traditional religious views, and has lived in accordance with his beliefs for over nine (9) years. As an example of the religious conviction that [plaintiff] holds in his Vegan beliefs, [plaintiff] has even been arrested for civil disobedience actions at animal rights demonstrations. This Vegan belief system guides the way that [plaintiff] lives his life. These are sincere and meaningful beliefs which occupy a place in [plaintiffs] life parallel to that filled by God in traditionally religious individuals adhering to the Christian, Jewish or Muslim Faiths.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Plaintiff was hired by a temporary agency to work for defendants as a computer contractor. He worked at a pharmaceutical warehouse owned by defendants. He had no contact with any of defendants\u2019 patients. Plaintiff alleged it was not anticipated that he ever would have contact with any of defendants\u2019 patients. Defendants offered plaintiff a permanent position with Kaiser. A written contract was prepared. Subsequently, however, plaintiff was advised \u201cthat to finish the process of becoming an employee he would need [a] mumps vaccine.\u201d Plaintiff could not be vaccinated with the mumps vaccine because it is grown in chicken embryos. To be vaccinated, it was alleged, \u201cwould violate [plaintiffs] system of beliefs and would be considered immoral by [him].\u201d When plaintiff refused to be vaccinated with the mumps vaccine, defendants withdrew the employment offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>C. <em>The FEHA and Differing Definitions of Religion</em></p>\n<p id=\"AF\">1. <em>The FEHA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The elements of a religious creed discrimination claim are that: the plaintiff had a bona fide religious belief; the employer was aware of that belief; and the belief conflicted with an employment requirement. <em>(Soldinger v. Northwest Airlines, Inc. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 345, 370 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 747].) With respect to the first element, possession of a bona fide religious belief, section 12940, subdivision (a) states in part: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice . . . [If] (a) For an employer, because of the . . . religious creed ... of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person . . . or to bar or to discharge the person from employment ... or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d Further, section 12940, subdivision (/), states in part: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [1f] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [If] (0 For an employer ... to refuse to hire or employ a person . . . because of a conflict between the person\u2019s religious belief or observance and any employment requirement, unless the employer . . . demonstrates that it has explored any available reasonable alternative means of accommodating the religious belief or observance . . . , but is unable to reasonably accommodate the religious belief or observance without undue hardship . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Definition of the terms \u201creligious belief or observance\u201d and \u201creligious creed\u201d are provided in a statute and in a regulation. Section 12940, subdivision <em>(l) </em>defines religious belief as follows: \u201cReligious belief or observance, as used in [section 12940], includes, but is not limited to, observance of a Sabbath or other religious holy day or days, and reasonable time necessary for travel prior and subsequent to a religious observance.\u201d Further description of the scope of the religious belief protection in the FEHA is found in section 12926, subdivision (o), which states: \u201cAs used in this part in connection with unlawful practices, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context: [f] . . . [If] (o) \u2018Religious creed,\u2019 \u2018religion,\u2019 \u2018religious observance,\u2019 \u2018religious belief,\u2019 and \u2018creed\u2019 include all aspects of religious belief, observance, and practice.\u201d The administrative agency charged with enforcing the FEHA, the Fair Employment and Housing Commission, has also enacted a regulation defining \u201creligious creed.\u201d California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 7293.1 (regulation 7293.1), defines \u201creligious creed\u201d as follows: \u201c \u2018Religious creed\u2019 includes any traditionally recognized religion as well as beliefs, observations, or practices which an individual sincerely holds and which occupy in his or her life a place of importance parallel to that of traditionally recognized religions.\u201d Consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>with regulation 7293.1, plaintiff argues that his commitment to a vegan lifestyle occupies a place in his life parallel to that of traditionally recognized religions. Regulation 7293.1, by its express terms, reflects the notion that religious creed extends beyond traditionally recognized religions to encompass beliefs, observations, or practices occupying a parallel place of importance \u201cto that of traditionally recognized religions\u201d in an individual\u2019s life. As will be discussed later, that concept of religion originates from two United States Supreme Court cases involving conscientious objection to military <em>service\u2014United States </em>v. <em>Seeger </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 163, 164-188 [85 S.Ct. 850, 853-855, 13 L.Ed.2d 733], and <em>Welsh v. United States </em>(1970) 398 U.S. 333, 335-344 [90 S.Ct. 1792, 1794-1798, 26 L.Ed.2d 308].</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">It is well settled that the interpretation of a statute by an agency charged with its administration is entitled to great weight. <em>(Woods v. Superior Court </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 668, 679 [170 Cal.Rptr. 484, 620 P.2d 1032]; <em>Morris v. Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 748 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697].) The administrative interpretation must be consistent with the statute and not in conflict with it. (\u00a7 11342.2; <em>Esberg v. Union Oil Co. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 262, 269 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 47 P.3d 1069]; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ralee Engineering Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 66, 82 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046].) Judicial review is limited to whether the agency reasonably interpreted the legislative mandate and whether the regulation is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. <em>(Woods v. Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 679; <em>Morris v. Williams, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at pp. 748-749.) Nevertheless, final responsibility for interpretation of the statute rests with the courts. <em>(Woods v. Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 679; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, 67 </em>Cal.2d at p. 748.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">2. <em>California Decisional Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">We have not found any Department of Fair Employment and Housing decision or any California judicial authority construing \u201creligious creed\u201d within the meaning of the FEHA or regulation 7293.1. But California courts have grappled with the question of what constitutes a religion in other contexts. We discuss several of those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In <em>Smith v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 1143, 1166 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 700, 913 P.2d 909], the California Supreme Court, in a plurality opinion authored by Associate Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, observed that a religious belief is something other than \u201ca philosophy or a way of life.\u201d Justice Werdegar further noted, \u201c \u2018[R]eligious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>merit First Amendment protection.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1167-1168, quoting <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Review Bd., Ind. Empl. Sec. Div. </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 707, 714 [101 S.Ct. 1425, 1430, 67 L.Ed.2d 624].) Whether the plaintiffs actions were based on his religious beliefs was not at issue in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In a frequently cited opinion, <em>Fellowship of Humanity v. Co. Alameda </em>(1957) 153 Cal.App.2d 673, 677-693 [315 P.2d 394], the Court of Appeal, in an opinion authored by then Presiding Justice Raymond Peters, discussed at length the meaning of \u201creligious worship\u201d in a property tax exemption case. The court framed the question before it as follows: \u201c[W]e will assume that the [trial court\u2019s] findings, properly interpreted, are to the effect that the adoration of, and reverence to, a deity have no place in the beliefs of [the Fellowship of Humanity]. That presents the fundamental question\u2014is a belief in God or gods essential to \u2018religious worship,\u2019 as those terms are used in the state Constitution?\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 680.) The court noted that early federal cases <em>(Davis v. Beason </em>(1890) 133 U.S. 333, 342 [10 S.Ct. 299, 300, 33 L.Ed. 637], overruled on other grounds, <em>Romer v. Evans </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 620, 634 [116 S.Ct. 1620, 1623, 134 L.Ed.2d 855]; <em>Berman v. United States </em>(9th Cir. 1946) 156 F.2d 377, 380; <em>George </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1952) 196 F.2d 445, 451) had defined religion by reference to a belief in a deity or a Supreme Being. However, Presiding Justice Peters observed: \u201c[T]here are forms of belief generally and commonly accepted as religions and whose adherents . . . practice what is commonly accepted as religious worship, which do not include or require as essential the belief in a deity. Taoism, classic Buddhism, and Confucianism, are among these religions.\u201d <em>(Fellowship of Humanity v. Co. Alameda, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d at p. 684; accord, <em>Citizens For Parental Rights </em>v. <em>San Mateo Bd. of Education </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 1, 21, fn. 22 [124 Cal.Rptr. 68, 82 A.L.R.3d 544] [\u201creligious liberty is not limited to theistic beliefs\u201d].) Presiding Justice Peters found that dictionary definitions, decisional authority, and the views of scholars were not particularly helpful in resolving the issue before the court. <em>(Fellowship of Humanity </em>v. <em>Co. Alameda, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d at pp. 684-691.) Presiding Justice Peters noted that in <em>United States v. Ballard </em>(1944) 322 U.S. 78, 86 [64 S.Ct. 882, 886, 88 L.Ed. 1148], the United States Supreme Court established the concept that \u201cthe state has no power to decide the validity of the beliefs held by the group involved.\u201d <em>(Fellowship of Humanity v. Co. Alameda, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d at p. 692.) Presiding Justice Peters then reasoned: \u201c[T]he only [proper] inquiry ... is the objective one of whether or not the belief occupies the same place in the lives of its holders that the orthodox beliefs occupy in the lives of believing majorities, and whether a given group that claims the exemption conducts itself the way groups conceded to be religious conduct themselves. The content of the belief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>under such test, is not a matter of governmental concern. [If] Under this test the belief or nonbelief in a Supreme Being is a false factor. The only way the state can determine the existence or nonexistence of \u2018religious worship\u2019 is to approach the problem objectively. It is not permitted to test validity of, or to compare beliefs. This simply means that \u2018religion\u2019 fills a void that exists in the lives of most men. Regardless of why a particular belief suffices, as long as it serves this purpose, it must be accorded the same status of an orthodox religious belief.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 692-693; see <em>Saint Germain Foundation v. County of Siskiyou </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 911, 916 [28 Cal.Rptr. 393].)  Presiding Justice Peters concluded: \u201c[T]he proper interpretation of the terms \u2018religion\u2019 or \u2018religious\u2019 in tax exemption laws should not include any reference to whether the beliefs involved are theistic or nontheistic. Religion simply includes: (1) a belief, not necessarily referring to supernatural powers; (2) a cult, involving a gregarious association openly expressing the belief; (3) a system of moral practice directly resulting from an adherence to the belief; and (4) an organization within the cult designed to observe the tenets of belief.\u201d <em>(Fellowship of Humanity v. Co. Alameda, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d at p. 693.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In <em>Young Life Campaign </em>v. <em>Patino </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 559, 561 [176 Cal.Rptr. 23], the Court of Appeal for the Third Appellate District considered whether an organization was a \u201cchurch\u201d within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Code. The court adopted an approach used by the Internal Revenue Service to determine what is a \u201cchurch,\u201d which the Court of Appeal described as follows: \u201cRather than defining \u2018church,\u2019 the IRS admits its inability to formulate \u00e1 definition, and applies criteria derived from the forms and practices observed in recognized churches, without giving controlling weight to any. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 574-575, fn. omitted.) The criteria for defining a church applied by the Internal Revenue Service were set forth in a footnote and included: \u201c\u2018(1) a distinct legal existence, (2) a recognized creed and form of worship, (3) a definite and distinct ecclesiastical government, (4) a formal code of doctrine and discipline, (5) a distinct religious history, (6) a membership not associated with any other church or denomination, (7) a complete organization of ordained ministers ministering to their congregants, (8) ordained ministers selected after completing prescribed courses of study, (9) a literature of its own, (10) established places of worship, (11) regular congregations, (12) regular religious services, (13) Sunday schools for the religious instruction of the young, (14) schools for the preparation of its ministers.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 574, fn. 15.) The Court of Appeal observed: \u201cA similar approach to the meaning of \u2018religion\u2019 was recently taken in an illuminating law review note: \u2018Religion can be described and exemplified in ways that disclose \u201ca complicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>network of similarities overlapping and criss crossing.\u201d Unraveled, the various strands do not amount to \u201creligion\u201d for the meaning of the network resides in the interweaving itself. Thus, it is exemplary and not exhaustive to say that religion involves traditional theistic beliefs, or belief in something parallel to an orthodox conception of God, or an ultimate concern, or a set of beliefs that \u201caddress themselves to basic questions about the nature of reality and the meaning of human existence.\u201d A non-analytic understanding of religion is not boundless, for the network of similarities always includes a binding of the individual to something unrelated to individuality, through the intense operation of faith. No one element or set of elements constitutes a necessary and sufficient condition for religion; presence or absence of an element can neither establish a religion, nor prevent a belief from becoming a religion.\u2019 [Fns. omitted.] (Note, <em>\u2018Mind Control\u2019 or Intensity of Faith: The Constitutional Protection of Religious Beliefs </em>(1978) 13 Harv.Civ.Rights\u2014 Civ.Lib.L.Rev. 751, 760-761.)\u201d <em>(Young Life Campaign </em>v. <em>Patino, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d at p. 575, fn. 17, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">These California decisions point away from a strictly theistic definition of religion. A belief in a Supreme Being is not required. <em>(Saint Germain Foundation v. County of Siskiyou, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.2d at p. 916; <em>Fellowship of Humanity v. Co. Alameda, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d at p. 692.) But, something more than a philosophy or way of life is required. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1166.) Moreover, as discussed by then Presiding Justice Peters, the inquiry is \u201ca purely objective one.\u201d <em>(Fellowship of Humanity </em>v. <em>Co. Alameda, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d at p. 692.) Among the factors to be considered are whether the belief system occupies in a person\u2019s life a place <em>parallel </em>to that of God in recognized religions and whether it addresses ultimate concerns thereby filling a void in the individual\u2019s life. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 693.) Notably, in considering the concept of religion, California courts have consistently looked to federal authority. In accordance with that practice, we turn to federal decisions defining religion in varying constitutional, statutory, and regulatory contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">3. <em>United States Supreme Court Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">a. <em>The original theistic view of religion and the development of a broader perspective</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Historically, the United States Supreme Court at first adopted a theistic definition of religion. In the 19th century, for example, in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Beason, supra, </em>133 U.S. at page 342 [10 S.Ct. at page 300], the court stated: \u201cThe term \u2018religion\u2019 has reference to one\u2019s views of his relations to his Creator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>and to the obligations they impose of reverence for his being and character, and of obedience to his will.\u201d (See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Macintosh </em>(1931) 283 U.S. 605, 633-634 [51 S.Ct. 570, 578-579, 75 L.Ed. 1302] (dis. opn. of Hughes, C. J.), overruled, <em>Girouard </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1946) 328 U.S. 61, 69 [66 S.Ct. 826, 829-830, 90 L.Ed. 1084].) Later, however, the United States Supreme Court took a more expansive view of religion. In <em>Torcaso v. Watkins </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 488, 495 [81 S.Ct. 1680, 1683-1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 982], for example, the court noted that neither a state nor the federal government can constitutionally \u201caid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.\u201d In a footnote the court observed, \u201cAmong religions in this country which do not teach what would generally be considered a belief in the existence of God are Buddhism, Taoism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism and others.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 495, In. 11 [81 S.Ct. at p. 1684].)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">b. <em>United States v. Seeger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">As noted above, the concept of religion reflected in regulation 7293.1 is derived in part from language in two United States Supreme Court cases construing statutory language\u2014\u201creligious training and belief\u2019\u2014in the context of conscientious objection to military service. The legal dispute before the Supreme Court in <em>Seeger, </em>decided in 1965, was as follows, \u201cThese cases involve claims of conscientious objectors under [section] 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C.App. [section] 456(j) (1958 ed.), which exempts from combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States those persons who by reason of their religious training and belief are conscientiously opposed to participation in war in. any form.\u201d <em>(United States v. Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at pp. 164-165 [85 S.Ct. at p. 853].) Section 6(j) of the statute in question defined \u201creligious training and belief\u2019 as \u201c \u2018an individual\u2019s belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 165 [85 S.Ct. at pp. 853-854].) The <em>Seeger </em>court framed the dispositive question before it as follows: \u201cOur question ... is the narrow one: Does the term \u2018Supreme Being\u2019 as used in [section] 6(j) mean the orthodox God or the broader concept of a power or being, or a faith, \u2018to which all else is subordinate or upon which all else is ultimately dependent\u2019? Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (Second Edition.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 174 [85 S.Ct. at p. 858].) The court emphasized, \u201cIn considering this question we resolve it <em>solely </em>in relation to the language of [section] 6(j) and not otherwise.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The Supreme Court held, \u201cCongress, in using the expression \u2018Supreme Being\u2019 rather than the designation \u2018God,\u2019 was merely clarifying the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of religious training and belief so as to embrace all religions and to exclude essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views.\u201d <em>(United States v. Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 165 [85 S.Ct. at p. 854].) The Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe believe that under this construction, the test of belief \u2018in a relation to a Supreme Being\u2019 is whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. Where such beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective holders we cannot say that one is \u2018in a relation to a Supreme Being\u2019 and the other is not.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 165-166 [85 S.Ct. at p. 854].) In other words, the court refused to give preference to those who believe in a conventional God as opposed to those who do not. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 175 [85 S.Ct. at pp. 858-859]; <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>398 U.S. at p. 338 [90 S.Ct. at pp. 1795-1796].)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In <em>Seeger, </em>the court concluded Congress intended that to qualify as a conscientious objector, a person needed only to \u201chave a conviction based upon religious training and belief. . . .\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 176 [85 S.Ct. at p. 859].) The court construed that phrase as follows: \u201cWithin that phrase would come all sincere religious beliefs which are based upon a power or being, or upon a faith, to which all else is subordinate or upon which all else is ultimately dependent. The test might be stated in these words: A sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption comes within the statutory definition.\u201d (Ib<em>id.) </em>The Supreme Court concluded, \u201cThis construction avoids imputing to Congress an intent to classify different religious beliefs, exempting some and excluding others, and is in accord with the well-established congressional policy of equal treatment for those whose opposition to service is grounded in their religious tenets.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The United States Supreme Court recognized \u201cthe difficulties that have always faced the trier of fact in these cases.\u201d <em>(United States v. Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 183 [85 S.Ct. at p. 863].) It described the proper test as \u201cessentially objective\u201d and described it as follows, \u201c[N]amely, does the claimed belief occupy the same place in the life of the objector as an orthodox belief in God holds in the life of one clearly qualified for exemption?\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at p. 184 [85 S.Ct. at p. 863].) The court further noted that the task before \u201c[l]ocal [Selective Service] boards and courts\u201d is not to reject incomprehensible beliefs, but \u201cto decide whether the beliefs professed by a registrant are sincerely held and whether they are, in his own scheme of things, religious.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 184-185 [85 S.Ct. at p. 863].)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>In <em>Seeger, </em>the court held that a potential draftee who could not definitively declare that he believed in a Supreme Being, but who strongly concluded, with the strength of a more traditional religious conviction, that killing in war was wrong, immoral, and unethical, qualified as a conscientious objector. The court stated: \u201cIn summary, Seeger professed \u2018religious belief and \u2018religious faith.\u2019 He did not disavow any belief \u2018in a relation to a Supreme Being\u2019; indeed he stated that \u2018the cosmic order does, perhaps, suggest a creative intelligence.\u2019 He decried the tremendous \u2018spiritual\u2019 price man must pay for his willingness to destroy human life. In light of his beliefs and the unquestioned sincerity with which he held them, we think the Board, had it applied the test we propose today, would have granted him the exemption. We think it clear that the beliefs which prompted his objection occupy the same place in his life as the belief in a traditional deity hold in the lives of his friends, the Quakers.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 187 [85 S.Ct. at pp. 864-865].) The Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion as to the two other potential inductees.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">c. <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>United States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act was again discussed by the United States Supreme Court in 1970, in <em>Welsh v. United States, supra, </em>398 U.S. at pages 338-344 [90 S.Ct. at pages 1795-1799]. The <em>Welsh </em>court elaborated on <em>Seeger </em>as follows: \u201cThe <em>[Seeger] </em>Court\u2019s principal statement of its test for determining whether a conscientious objector\u2019s beliefs are religious within the meaning of [section] 6 (j) was as follows: [|] \u2018The test might be stated in these words: A sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption comes within the statutory definition.\u2019 380 U.S., at 176 [85 S.Ct. at p. 859]. [f] The <em>[Seeger] </em>Court made it clear that these sincere and meaningful beliefs that prompt the registrant\u2019s objection to all wars need not be confined in either source or content to traditional or parochial concepts or religion. It held that [section] 6 (j) \u2018does not distinguish between externally and internally derived beliefs,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 186, [85 S.Ct. at p. 864] and also held that \u2018intensely personal\u2019 convictions which some might find \u2018incomprehensible\u2019 or \u2018incorrect\u2019 come within the meaning of \u2018religious belief in the Act. <em>Id., </em>at 184-185 [85 S.Ct. at pp. 863-864], What is necessary under <em>Seeger </em>for a registrant\u2019s conscientious objection to all war to be \u2018religious\u2019 within the meaning of [section] 6 (j) is that this opposition to war stem from the registrant\u2019s moral, ethical, or religious beliefs about what is right and wrong and that these beliefs be held with the strength of traditional religious convictions. Most of the great religions of today and of the past have embodied the idea of a Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Being or a Supreme Reality\u2014a God\u2014who communicates to man in some way a consciousness of what is right and should be done, of what is wrong and therefore should be shunned. If an individual deeply and sincerely holds beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source and content but that nevertheless impose upon him a duty of conscience to refrain from participating in any war at any time, those beliefs certainly occupy in the life of that individual \u2018a place parallel to that filled by . . . God\u2019 in traditionally religious persons. Because his beliefs function as a religion in his life, such an individual is as much entitled to a \u2018religious\u2019 conscientious objector exemption under [section] 6(j) as is someone who derives his conscientious opposition to war from traditional religious convictions.\u201d <em>(Welsh v. United States, supra, </em>398 U.S. at pp. 339-340 [90 S.Ct. at p. 1796].)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In <em>Welsh, </em>the United States Supreme Court also discussed the federal statute\u2019s exclusion of persons with \u201c \u2018essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code\u2019 \u201d from conscientious objector status. <em>(Welsh v. United States, supra, </em>398 U.S. at pp. 342-343 [90 S.Ct. at p. 1798].) The court held: \u201cWe certainly do not think that [section] 60 (j)\u2019s exclusion . . . should be read to exclude those who hold strong beliefs about our domestic and foreign affairs or even those whose conscientious objection to participation in all wars is founded to a substantial extent upon considerations of public policy. The two groups of registrants that obviously do fall within these exclusions from the exemption are those whose beliefs are not deeply held and those whose objection to war does not rest at all upon moral, ethical, or religious principle but instead rests solely upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, or expediency.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded that section 6(j) \u201cexempts from military service all those whose consciences, spurred by deeply held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, would give them no rest or peace if they allowed themselves to become a part of an instrument of war.\u201d <em>(Welsh, </em>at p. 344 [90 S.Ct. at p. 1798].)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The United States Supreme Court reversed the judgment convicting the defendant of refusing to submit to induction into the military. <em>(Welsh v. United States, supra, </em>398 U.S. at p. 344 [90 S.Ct. at pp. 1798-1799].) The defendant in <em>Welsh, </em>like the one in <em>Seeger, </em>could not definitively affirm or deny a belief in a Supreme Being. The defendant in <em>Welsh, </em>like the potential draftee in <em>Seeger, </em>preferred to leave that question open. But, as the United States Supreme Court explained: \u201c[B]oth Seeger and Welsh affirmed on [their] applications [for conscientious objector status] that they held deep conscientious scruples against taking part in wars where people were killed. Both strongly believed that killing in war was wrong, unethical, and immoral, and their consciences forbade them to take part in such an evil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>practice. Their objection to participating in war in any form could not be said to come from a \u2018still, small voice of conscience\u2019; rather, for them that voice was so loud and insistent that both men preferred to go to jail rather than serve in the Armed Forces. There was never any question about the sincerity and depth of Seeger\u2019s convictions as a conscientious objector, and the same is true of Welsh. In this regard the Court of Appeals noted, \u2018[t]he government concedes that [Welsh\u2019s] beliefs are held with the strength of more traditional religious convictions.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 337 [90 S.Ct. at p. 1795].)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">d. <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In 1972, the United States Supreme Court presented a different perspective than it had in the conscientious objector cases discussed above when it decided <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 205, 215-216 [92 S.Ct. 1526, 1533-1534, 32 L.Ed.2d 15] (plur. opn. of Burger, C. J.). At issue in <em>Yoder </em>was whether Amish parents\u2019 objections to sending their children to public school beyond eighth grade were premised simply on a way of life or were rooted in religious belief. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 215 [92 S.Ct. at p. 1533].) In his plurality opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger explained: \u201cIn evaluating [these free exercise of religion claims] we must be careful to determine whether the Amish religious faith and their mode of life are, as they claim, inseparable and interdependent. <em>A way of life, however virtuous and admirable, may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable state regulation of education if it is based on purely secular considerations; to have the protection of the Religion Clauses, the claims must be rooted in religious belief. </em>Although a determination of what is a \u2018religious\u2019 belief or practice entitled to constitutional protection may present a most delicate question, the very concept of ordered liberty precludes allowing every person to make his own standards on matters of conduct in which society as a whole has important interests. <em>Thus, if the Amish asserted their claims because of their subjective evaluation and rejection of the contemporary secular values accepted by the majority, much as Thoreau rejected the social values of his time and isolated himself at Walden Pond, their claims would not rest on a religious basis. </em>Thoreau\u2019s choice was philosophical and personal rather than religious, and such belief does not rise to the demands of the Religion Clause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 215-216 [92 S.Ct. at p. 1533], italics added, fn. omitted.) The plurality then found based on the record: \u201c[T]he traditional way of life of the Amish is not merely a matter of personal preference, but one of deep religious conviction, shared by an organized group, and intimately related to daily living. That the Old Order Amish daily life and religious practice stem from their faith is shown by the fact that it is in response to [a] Biblical injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>. ... As the expert witnesses explained, the Old Order Amish religion pervades and determines virtually their entire way of life, regulating it with detail of the Talmudic diet through the strictly enforced rules of the church community.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 216 [92 S.Ct. at pp. 1533-1534].) Associate Justice Lewis Powell\u2019s concurring opinion concluded religion was the motivating force for the parents\u2019 decision not to send their children to public high schools. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 236-237 [92 S.Ct. at pp. 1543-1544] (cone. opn. of Powell, J.).) As can be noted, the <em>Yoder </em>plurality distinguished those beliefs which are entitled to constitutional free exercise clause protection from viewpoints \u201cbased on purely secular considerations\u201d or a \u201csubjective evaluation and rejection of the contemporary secular values . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 215-216 [92 S.Ct. at p. 1533].)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">4. <em>Federal Employment Discrimination Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"At\">a. <em>Statutory and regulatory authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (title VII) makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s . . . religion . . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l).) Title VII was amended in 1972 to include a definition of religion. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j); <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.

The United States Supreme Court has held, \u201cThe intent and effect of this definition was to make it an unlawful employment practice under [title VII] for an employer not to make reasonable accommodations, short of undue hardship, for the religious practices of his employees and prospective employees.\u201d <em>(Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hardison, supra, </em>432 U.S. at p. 74 [97 S.Ct. at pp. 2271-2272]; see <em>Balint </em>v. <em>Carson City, Nev. </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 180 F.3d 1047, 1052.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Federal law governing \u201creligious practices\u201d discrimination in the employment context is drawn from the United States Supreme Court decisions in <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh. </em>The applicable Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guideline states: \u201c \u2018Religious\u2019 nature of a practice or belief. [^[] In most cases whether or not a practice or belief is religious is not at issue.

This standard was developed in <em>United States v. Seeger, [supra,] </em>380 U.S. 163 . . . and <em>Welsh v. United States, [supra,] </em>398 U.S. 333. . . . The Commission has consistently applied this standard in its decisions.

The first involves the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>application of religious freedom provisions of title VII in cases where a plaintiff is a member of a traditional religious group. The second context involves the application of the title VII religious freedom protections to nontraditional religious organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">i. <em>Traditional religious organizations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In <em>E.E.O.C. </em>v. <em>Union Independiente De La Autoridad </em>(1st Cir. 2002) 279 F.3d 49, 55-56, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit considered whether a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church had a religious belief that prohibited his joining a labor union. The court held: \u201cThe requirement that the employee have a \u2018bona fide religious belief is an essential element of a religious accommodation claim. Title VII does not mandate an employer or labor organization to accommodate what amounts to a \u2018purely personal preference.\u2019 <em>Vetter v. Farmland Indus., Inc., </em>120 F.3d 749, 751 (8th Cir. 1997). In order to satisfy this element, the plaintiff must demonstrate both that the belief or practice is religious and that it is sincerely held. <em>See Redmond v.

The United States District Court explained as follows: \u201c[A] test has emerged to determine whether beliefs are a religion for purposes of Title VII. Rather than define religion according to its content, the test requires courts take a functional approach and ask whether a belief \u2018functions as\u2019 religion in the life of the individual before the court. <em>See Redmond </em>v. <em>GAP Corp., [supra,] 574 </em>F.2d 897, 901 n. 12 . . .

Stated another way, the court should find beliefs to be a religion if they \u2018occupy the same place in the life of the [individual] as an orthodox belief in God holds in the life of one clearly qualified.\u2019 <em>Seeger, </em>380 U.S. at 184 [85 S.Ct. at p. 863]. To satisfy this test, the plaintiff must show that the belief at issue is \u2018 \u201csincerely held\u201d \u2019 and \u2018 \u201creligious\u201d in [his or her] own scheme of things.\u2019 <em>Redmond, </em>574 F.3d at 901 n. 12 (quoting <em>Seeger, </em>380 U.S. at 185 [85 S.Ct. at pp. 863-864]).

Wilmur Communications, Inc., supra, </em>205 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1018-1019.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In <em>Peterson, </em>the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin held, on a summary judgment motion, that the World Church of the Creator, a central tenant of which was white supremacy, was a religion within the meaning of title VIL <em>(Peterson v. Wilmur Communications, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>supra, </em>205 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1021-1023.) The plaintiff sincerely believed in the teachings of the church. He considered his beliefs religious and considered the church his religion. The teachings of the church played a central role in the plaintiffs life. He had been a minister of the church for more than three years. He worked at putting the church\u2019s teachings into everyday practice. The federal district court judge concluded: \u201c[A]ll the evidence conclusively reveals that the teachings of [the church] are \u2018religious\u2019 in plaintiffs \u2018own scheme of things.\u2019 These beliefs occupy for plaintiff a place in his life parallel to that held by a belief in God for believers in more mainstream theistic religions. Thus, [the church] \u2018functions as\u2019 religion for plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1021-1022.) As can be noted, federal courts in construing the title VII religious freedom provision broadly construe the term religion. As will be noted, we do not believe regulation 7293.1 can be so broadly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">5. <em>Other federal religion cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In contexts other than employment, in the last 23 years, the federal courts have articulated a less expansive definition of religion or religious creed than that in title 29 Code of Federal Regulations section 1605.1 (2002) as administratively construed. The key federal cases are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">a. <em>The Concurring Opinion in Malnak v. Yogi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Beginning in 1979, with the filing of the concurring opinion of Third Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Arlin M. Adams, the federal courts began defining religion in a slightly different fashion than that in <em>Seeger </em>and Welsh, which were construing section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act. Judge Adams\u2019s concurring opinion was later adopted by the Third, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals. The question before the court of appeals in <em>Malnak </em>v. <em>Yogi </em>(3d Cir. 1979) 592 F.2d 197, 198, as posited in the <em>per curiam </em>decision, was as follows: \u201cThis appeal requires us to decide whether the district court erred in determining that the teaching of a course called the Science of Creative Intelligence Transcendental Meditation (SCI/TM) in the New Jersey public high schools . . . constituted an establishment of religion in violation of the first amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d The court of appeals, in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Circuit Judge Adams filed a lengthy concurring opinion in which he proposed a modem definition of religion based on three indicia. <em>(Malnak v. Yogi, supra, 592 </em>F.2d at pp. 207-210.) Judge Adams stated the question presented as \u201cwhether a particular belief-system should be considered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>religion for first amendment purposes,\u201d and asked, \u201chow far the constitutional definition of religion extends beyond Theistic formulation . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 203.) In an attempt to determine when a belief \u201coccupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 166 [85 S.Ct. at p. 854]), Judge Adams identified three indicia of religion. Judge Adams identified the first prong of the religion test as follows: \u201cThe first and most important of these indicia is the nature of the ideas in question. This means that a court must, at least to a degree, examine the content of the supposed religion, not to determine its truth or falsity, or whether it is schismatic or orthodox, but to determine whether the subject matter it comprehends is consistent with the assertion that it is, or is not, a religion.\u201d (Malnak, at p. 208, fn. omitted.) The second test was identified by Judge Adams as follows: \u201cThus, the \u2018ultimate\u2019 nature of the ideas presented is the most important and convincing evidence that they should be treated as religious. Certain isolated answers to \u2018ultimate\u2019 questions, however, are not necessarily \u2018religious\u2019 answers, because they lack the element of comprehensiveness, the second of the three indicia. A religion is not generally confined to one question or one moral teaching; it has a broader scope. It lays claim to an ultimate and comprehensive \u2018truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 208-209, fn. omitted.) The final criteria was described by Judge Adams was follows: \u201cA third element to consider in ascertaining whether a set of ideas should be classified as a religion is any formal, external, or surface signs that may be analogized to accepted religions. Such signs might include formal services, ceremonial functions, the existence of clergy, structure and organization, efforts at propagation, observation of holidays and other similar manifestations associated with the traditional religions. Of course, a religion may exist without any of these signs, so they are not determinative, at least by their absence, in resolving a question of definition. But they can be helpful in supporting a conclusion of religious status given the important role such ceremonies play in religious life.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 209, fins, omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Although Judge Adams\u2019s analysis only appeared in a concurring opinion, his discussion immediately began to find direct as well as indirect acceptance with other federal appellate court decisions. (E.g., <em>DeHart v. Horn </em>(3d Cir. 2000) 227 F.d 47, 52, fn. 3; <em>Love v. Reed </em>(8th Cir. 2000) 216 F.3d 682, 687 [adopting analysis based on Third Circuit ruling premised entirely on Judge Adams\u2019s concurring opinion in Malnak]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Meyers </em>(10th Cir. 1996) 95 F.3d 1475, 1483 [analyzing religion issue using in part a Third Circuit ruling premised upon Judge Adams\u2019s <em>Malnak </em>concurring opinion]; <em>Alvarado v.

Com. of Pa. </em>(3d Cir. 1981) 662 F.2d 1025, 1033-1034.) Similarly, district court judges have relied upon Judge Adams\u2019s concurring opinion in whole or in part. <em>(Mitchell v. Angelone </em>(E.D.Va. 1999) 82 F.Supp.2d 485, 492; <em>Altman v. Bedford Cent.

(Needham Pastoral Counseling Center </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Needham </em>(1990) 29 Mass.App. 31 [557 N.E.2d 43, 45]; <em>Christofferson v. Church of Scientology </em>(1982) 57 Or.App. 203 [644 P.2d 577, 601 40 A.L.R.4th 1017].) We have found no court which has explicitly or implicitly rejected Judge Adams\u2019s views expressed in his 1979 concurring opinion in <em>Malnak. </em>Commentators have recognized Judge Adams\u2019s opinion as the most influential judicial opinion in the past several decades in terms of defining religion. (See Note, <em>The Concept of Religion </em>(1997) 107 Yale L.J. 791, 799; Note, <em>Constitutional \u201cReligion \u201d A Survey of First Amendment Definitions of Religion </em>(Summer 2001) Tex. F. on Civ. Liberties &amp; Civ. Rts. 117, 139-144; Feofanov, <em>Defining Religion: An Immodest Proposal </em>(Winter 1994) 23 Hofstra L.Rev. 309, 375-377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">b. <em>Africa v. Com. of Pa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In <em>Africa </em>v. <em>Com. of Pa., supra, </em>662 F.2d at pages 1032-1035, the Third Circuit squarely confronted the question of whether a requirement imposed by a group that only raw foods be ingested by its members was entitled to the protection of a religion under the First Amendment. In <em>Africa, </em>a prisoner claimed it would violate the tenets of his religion\u2014the MOVE organization\u2014to eat anything other than raw foods. The plaintiffs claim was premised on the free exercise clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In <em>Africa, </em>unlike <em>Malnak, </em>where he wrote only a concurring opinion, the unanimous decision was written by Judge Adams. As will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>be noted, he relied on his concurring opinion in <em>Malnak. </em>The court of appeals first observed: \u201cA court\u2019s task is to decide whether the beliefs avowed are (1) sincerely held, and (2) religious in nature, in the claimant\u2019s scheme of things. <em>United States v. Seeger, [supra,] </em>380 U.S. 163, 185 [85 S.Ct. 850, 863-864]; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>658 F.2d 679 (9th Cir. Oct. 5, 1981).\u201d <em>(Africa v. Com. of Pa., supra, </em>662 F.2d at p. 1030.) The court found the plaintiff\u2019s beliefs were sincerely held. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1030-1031.) The Third Circuit panel concluded, however, that the MOVE organization did not satisfy \u201cthe \u2018ultimate\u2019 ideas\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1033), comprehensiveness, or structural characteristics criteria. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1035.) With respect to the ultimate concerns criterion, speaking for his two colleagues, Judge Adams explained: \u201cSave for its preoccupation with living in accord with the dictates of nature, MOVE makes no mention of, much less places any emphasis upon, what might be classified as a fundamental concern. MOVE does not claim to be theistic: indeed it recognizes no Supreme Being and refers to no transcendental or all-controlling force. Moreover, unlike other recognized religions, with which it is to be compared for first amendment purposes, MOVE does not appear to take a position with respect to matters of personal morality, human mortality, or the meaning and purpose of life. The organization, for example, has no functional equivalent of the Ten Commandments, the New Testament Gospels, the Muslim Koran, Hinduism\u2019s Veda, or Transcendental Meditation\u2019s Science of Creative Intelligence. Africa insists that he has discovered a desirable way to conduct his life; he does not contend, however, that his regimen is somehow morally necessary or required. Given this lack of commitment to overarching principles, the MOVE philosophy is not sufficiently analogous to more \u2018traditional\u2019 theologies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1033, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The <em>Africa </em>court explained further why the plaintiffs beliefs were not religious. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals held: \u201cDespite having concluded that MOVE does not deal with \u2018ultimate ideas,\u2019 we concede that the matter is not wholly free from doubt. Appointed counsel for Africa argues that MOVE members do share a fundamental concern, namely, an all-consuming belief in a \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018generating\u2019 way of life\u2014a way of life that ultimately cannot be reconciled with \u2018civilization\u2019 itself. According to counsel, Africa\u2019s insistence on keeping \u2018in touch with life\u2019s vibration\u2019 amounts to a form of pantheism, wherein \u2018the entity of God is the world itself, and God is \u201cswallowed up in that unity which may be designated \u2018nature\u2019 \u201d . . . . [MOVE\u2019s] return to nature is not simply a \u201cpreferred\u201d state. It is the only state. It is the state of being in pure harmony with nature. This, MOVE calls godly. This is pantheism.\u2019 [Citation.] We decline to accept such a characterization of Africa\u2019s views, however. We recognize that, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>certain circumstances, a pantheistic-based philosophy might qualify for protection under the free exercise clause. From the record in this case, though, we are not persuaded that Africa is an adherent of pantheism, as that word is commonly defined. His mindset seems to be far more the product of a secular philosophy than of a religious orientation. His concerns appear personal (e.g., he contends that a raw food diet is \u2018healthy\u2019 and that pollution and other such products are \u2018hazardous\u2019) and social (e.g., he claims that MOVE is a \u2018revolutionary\u2019 organization, \u2018absolutely opposed to all that is wrong\u2019 and unable to accept existing regimes), rather than spiritual or other-worldly. Indeed, if Africa\u2019s statements are deemed sufficient to describe a religion under the Constitution, it might well be necessary to extend first amendment protection to a host of individuals and organizations who espouse personal and secular ideologies, however much those ideologies appear dissimilar to traditional religious dogmas.\u201d <em>(Africa </em>v. <em>Com. of Pa., supra, </em>662 F.2d at pp. 1033-1034, fns. &amp; italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The <em>Africa </em>court further noted: \u201cThe Supreme Court would appear to have foreclosed such an expansive interpretation of the free exercise clause. In <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>the Court concluded that Wisconsin could not require members of the Amish sect to send their children to school beyond the eighth grade, where there was uncontested evidence that such a course was inconsistent with the Amish religion. The Court arrived at this result only after conducting a searching inquiry into the history and customs of the Amish people and into the nature of their religious teachings and practices. In the course of his opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Burger stressed that the objections of the Amish to compulsory secondary education derived from \u2018deep religious conviction(s)\u2019 rather than from a \u2018personal\u2019 or \u2018secular\u2019 philosophy.\u201d <em>(Africa v. Com. of Pa., supra, </em>662 F.2d at p. 1034.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The <em>Africa </em>court concluded: \u201c[I]t is crucial to realize that the free exercise clause does not protect all deeply held beliefs, however \u2018ultimate\u2019 their ends or all-consuming their means. An individual or group may adhere to and profess certain political, economic, or social doctrines, perhaps quite passionately. The first amendment, though, has not been construed, at least as yet, to shelter strongly held ideologies of such a nature, however all-encompassing their scope. As the Supreme Court declared in <em>Yoder, </em>\u2018[a] way of life, however virtuous and admirable, may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable state regulation . . . if it is based on purely <em>secular </em>considerations; to have the protection of the Religion Clauses, the claims must be rooted in <em>religious </em>belief.\u2019 406 U.S. at 215, 92 S.Ct. at 1533 (emphasis added).\u201d <em>(Africa v. Com. of Pa., supra, </em>662 F.2d at p. 1034.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>c. <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Sargent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The analysis in <em>Africa </em>was adopted by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Sargent, supra, </em>753 F.2d at page 666. The question before the court of appeals in <em>Wiggins </em>was whether the Arkansas Department of Correction violated several inmates\u2019 First Amendment rights by prohibiting their receipt of religious literature and correspondence with faith-based leaders. The district court held the inmates\u2019 beliefs were not religious in nature. The court of appeals found the district court may have erred in its conclusion to the contrary and remanded the matter for further consideration. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 666-667.) The court of appeals held: \u201cThe district court was correct in noting that only sincerely held beliefs which are \u2018rooted in religion\u2019 are protected by the free exercise clause. [Citations.] First amendment religious protection is not extended to \u2018so-called religions which tend to mock established institutions and are obviously shams and absurdities and whose members are patently devoid of religious sincerity.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . H[] From a review of the limited evidence presented at the hearing, we believe that the district court may have erred in its conclusion that the inmates\u2019 beliefs are purely secular. Followers of the churches involved here base their beliefs directly on literal interpretations of fundamentalist Christian theology. They believe that the Bible teaches that race mixing is a sin. However \u2018unpalatable\u2019 such ideas are, it is not a court\u2019s prerogative to determine the validity of such beliefs. The belief system here has its own orders of worship and Articles of Faith, not to mention the fact that it has outside-the-prison organization and followers. It has its own religious dogma, hierarchy, and mandated lifestyle. It also appears that the inmates\u2019 religion may be comprehensive and that it may address fundamental and ultimate questions. <em>Cf. Africa v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, [supra,] </em>662 F.2d 1025 . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 666, fn. omitted; see also <em>U.S. v.

City of San Jose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has also adopted the approach discussed in the majority opinion in <em>Africa. </em>In <em>Alvarado v. City of San Jose, supra, </em>94 F.3d at page 1225, the Ninth Circuit held a municipality\u2019s installation and maintenance of a sculpture did not violate the First Amendment establishment clause or the California Constitution. The court held the sculpture had no religious significance because: \u201cThere is no text, creed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>organized group such as the court considered in <em>Malnak II, </em>only a sculpture with which plaintiffs have associated a number of unrelated texts and statements of individual response to the work. Under <em>Africa, </em>the New Age concepts presented by the plaintiffs, while they invoke \u2018ultimate concerns,\u2019 fail to demonstrate any shared or comprehensive doctrine or to display any of the structural characteristics or formal signs associated with traditional religions. <em>See </em>662 F.2d at 1032-36.\u201d <em>(Alvarado </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>94 F.3d at p. 1230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">e. <em>United States v. Meyers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Tenth Circuit analysis closely follows <em>Africa </em>and <em>Alvarado. </em>In <em>US. v. Meyers, supra, 95 </em>F.3d at page 1479, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit considered a defendant\u2019s claim as follows, \u201c[I]t is his sincere belief that his religion commands him to use, possess, grow and distribute marijuana for the good of mankind and the planet earth.\u201d In determining whether the defendant\u2019s beliefs were religious, the Tenth Circuit panel considered the following factors paralleling traditional religions: whether fundamental questions about \u201clife, purpose, and death\u201d were addressed; whether a reality transcending the physical world was addressed; whether a particular manner of acting or way of life was prescribed; whether the beliefs were founded or significantly influenced by a deity, teacher, seer, or prophet; whether seminal, elemental, fundamental, or sacred writings were embraced; whether there were clergy, ministers, priests, monks, or other keepers of knowledge; the existence of ceremonies and rituals; whether holidays were observed; whether physical appearance was addressed; and whether there was any mission work or proselytizing. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1483-1484.) The court of appeals adopted the district court\u2019s analysis: \u201c \u2018Marijuana\u2019s medical, therapeutic, and social effects are secular, not religious .... Here, the Court cannot give Meyers\u2019 \u2018religious\u2019 beliefs much weight because those beliefs appear to be derived entirely from his secular beliefs. In other words, Meyers\u2019 secular and religious beliefs overlap only in the sense that Meyers holds secular beliefs which he believes so deeply that he has transformed them into a \u2018religion.\u2019 ffl] While Meyers may sincerely believe that his beliefs are religious, this Court cannot rely on his sincerity to conclude that his beliefs rise to the level of a \u2018religion\u2019 and therefore trigger [the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\u2019s] protections. Meyers is, of course, absolutely free to think or believe what he wants. If he thinks that his beliefs are a religion then so be it. No one can restrict his beliefs, and no one should begrudge him those beliefs. None of this, however, changes the fact that his beliefs do not constitute a \u2018religion\u2019 as that term is uneasily defined by law. Were the Court to recognize Meyers\u2019 beliefs as religious, it might soon find itself on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>slippery slope where anyone who was cured of an ailment by a \u2018medicine\u2019 that had pleasant side-effects could claim that they had founded a constitutionally or statutorily protected religion based on the beneficial \u2018medicine.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">f. <em>Spies </em>v. <em>Voinovich</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We have found only one case dealing with veganism and religion. In <em>Spies v. Voinovich </em>(6th Cir. 1999) 173 F.3d 398, 407, the court of appeals considered an inmate\u2019s claim that as a Zen Buddhist he was required to maintain a vegan diet. The Sixth Circuit disagreed, holding that Zen Buddhism did not require a vegan diet and the vegetarian diet provided sufficed. The court, however, observed, \u201c[I]n pointing out that veganism is not required of Zen Buddhists, we are not stating that Spies\u2019s veganism is not a sincerely-held religious belief.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">6. <em>Is Veganism a Religious Creed for Purposes of the FEHA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \u201cThe determination of what is a \u2018religious\u2019 belief or practice is more often than not a difficult and delicate task . . . .\u201d <em>(Thomas v. Review Bd., Ind. Empl. Sec. Div., supra, </em>450 U.S. at p. 714 [101 S.Ct. at p. 1430]; accord, <em>Love </em>v. <em>Reed, supra, </em>216 F.3d at p. 687.) The test we apply is that set forth in Judge Adams\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Malnak </em>which has been adopted by the Third, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits. Our review of the authority discussed above leads us to conclude the indicia of religion discussed in Judge Adams\u2019s <em>Malnak </em>concurring opinion, later adopted by the Third, Ninth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals in <em>Africa, Alvarado, </em>and <em>Meyers </em>respectively, presents the best objective method for answering the question whether a belief plays the role of a religion and functions as such in an individual\u2019s life. We premise our conclusion on several observations. We summarize them, before fully discussing our analysis. Regulation 7293.1 adopts by its terms a less expansive definition of religion than that promulgated by the EEOC. Other than in the title VII context, the federal courts have in general moved away from the expansive definition of religion in the early conscientious objector cases, <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh, </em>to a more narrow test\u2014one that compares a belief system to more traditional religions. The indicia of religion discussed in Judge Adams\u2019s concurring <em>Malnak </em>opinion and adopted by the Third, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits presents the best objective test by analogy to mainstream religions for deciding the question before us. Finally, adopting the Third, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits\u2019 analysis is consistent with regulation 7293.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>There is a significant difference between the EEOC\u2019s administrative construction of the term \u201creligion\u201d and the definition of \u201creligious creed\u201d in regulation 7293.1. Regulation 7293.1 mandates a less expansive construction of \u201creligion.\u201d The EEOC definition includes \u201cmoral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.\u201d (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1605.1 (2002); see, e.g., <em>Peterson v. Wilmur Communications, Inc., supra, </em>205 F.Supp.2d at p. 1018 [\u201cPurely \u2018moral and ethical beliefs\u2019 can be religious \u2018so long as they are held with the strength of religious convictions\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d]; <em>Redmond </em>v. <em>GAF Corp., supra, </em>574 F.2d at p. 901, fix. 12 [religion exists where a sincerely held belief \u201cis . . . \u2018religious\u2019 in [the] person\u2019s own scheme of things\u201d].) Regulation 7293.1, on the other hand, defines \u201creligious creed\u201d as \u201cbeliefs, observances, or practices which an individual sincerely holds and which occupy in his or her life <em>a place of importance parallel to that of traditionally recognized religions.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Under regulation 7293.1, purely moral or ethical beliefs that are held with the strength of religious convictions may not qualify for protection under the FEHA. Rather, the express language of regulation 7293.1 requires that the belief, observance, or practice occupy a place in the employee\u2019s life of \u201cimportance parallel to that of traditionally recognized religions.\u201d The \u201cimportance parallel to that of traditionally recognized religions\u201d requirement is not contained in title 29 Code of Federal Regulations part 1605.1. For example, in <em>LaViolette v. Daley, supra, </em>No. 01A01748, the EEOC administratively decided that unconventional beliefs about cold fusion and other technologies were entitled to title VII religion protection. But it is unlikely that beliefs concerning cold fusion would be protected under regulation 7293.1 because they do not have an \u201cimportance parallel to that of traditionally recognized religions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The federal regulation, in our view, goes further than did the United States Supreme Court in <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh. </em>(See, e.g., <em>E.E.O.C. v. Union Independiente De La Autoridad, supra, </em>279 F.3d at pp. 55-56.) In <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh, </em>the high court, while adopting an expansive view of \u201creligion,\u201d also spoke of and applied the notion that a given belief, to qualify as religious, must occupy a place in the life of its possessor \u201cparallel to that <em>filled by the orthodox belief in God </em>of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 166 [85 S.Ct. at p. 854], italics added.) <em>Seeger </em>identified the issue before the court as follows, \u201cOur question, therefore, is the narrow one: Does the term \u2018Supreme Being\u2019 as used in [section] 6(j) mean the orthodox God or <em>the broader concept of a power or being, or a faith, \u2018to which all else is subordinate or upon which all else is ultimately dependent[?] </em>\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 174 [85 S.Ct. at p. 858], italics added.) The <em>Seeger </em>court concluded that the test of a religion is: \u201cA sincere and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel <em>to that filled by God </em>of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 176 [85 S.Ct. at p. 859], italics added; see also pp. 184-188 [85 S.Ct. at pp. 863-865].) The United States Supreme Court emphasized that religion does not include: \u201cessentially political, sociological, or philosophical views\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 165 [85 S.Ct. at p. 854]); \u201cessentially political, sociological or economic considerations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 173 [85 S.Ct. at p. 858]); or a merely personal code, i.e., a personal belief \u201cin no way related to a Supreme Being.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 186 [85 S.Ct. at p. 864].) <em>Welsh </em>is to the same effect. <em>(Welsh v. United States, supra, </em>398 U.S. at p. 340 [90 S.Ct. at pp. 1796-1797] [a purely ethical or moral belief that occupies in the individual\u2019s life <em>a place parallel to that filled by God in traditional </em>religions].) The EEOC regulation, as administratively construed, appears to dispense with the requirement that religion is predicated on something more comprehensive than a personal moral or ethical code, however strongly held. It extends, by its terms, to \u201cmoral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.\u201d Under the EEOC definition, as construed administratively, a strongly held moral or ethical view may qualify as a religious belief, even though the view is essentially political, sociological, or economic and is in \u201cno way related to a Supreme Being.\u201d <em>(United States v. Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at pp. 165, 173, 186 [85 S.Ct. at pp. 853-854, 857-858, 864].) <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh </em>are more restrictive than the EEOC\u2019s administrative construction of title 29 Code of Federal Regulations part 1605.1 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Regulation 7293.1, on the other hand, requires something more than a strongly held view of right and wrong. In order to secure FEHA protection, the \u201cbeliefs, observances, or practices\u201d must occupy in the person\u2019s life <em>\u201ca place of importance parallel to that of traditionally recognized religions.\u201d </em>(Reg. 7293.1, italics added.) The test is objective. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 184 [85 S.Ct. at p. 863]; accord, <em>Fellowship of Humanity v. Co. Alameda, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d at p. 692.) Regulation 7293.1 adopts, by the italicized language, the notion espoused in <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh </em>that the belief system in question, to qualify as a religion, parallel the belief systems of traditional religions. <em>(Welsh v. United States, supra, </em>398 U.S at pp. 339-340 [90 S.Ct. at pp. 1796-1797]; <em>United States v. Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at pp. 165-166 [85 S.Ct. at pp. 853-854].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">But identifying the differences between the federal guideline as administratively construed and regulation 7293.1 does not answer the question before us. The question remains as to what belief systems typify traditionally recognized religions. That question must be answered because in order for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>plaintiffs vegan \u201cbeliefs, observances, or practices\u201d to secure FEHA protection, they must have \u201ca place of importance parallel to that of traditionally recognized religions.\u201d Complicating the answer to this question is that the expansive definition of religion in the pre-1970 conscientious objector cases, <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh, </em>has been narrowed somewhat to a more specific test\u2014one that compares a belief system to recognized, traditional religions\u2014as typified by the plurality opinion in <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra, </em>406 U.S. at pages 215-216 [92 S.Ct. at pages 1533-1534], To further complicate matters, <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh </em>were statutory interpretation cases, while <em>Yoder </em>is a free exercise clause decision. <em>(Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra, </em>406 U.S. at pp. 207, 234-236 [92 S.Ct. at pp. 1529, 1542-1544]; <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>398 U.S. at pp. 335, 343-344 [90 S.Ct. at pp. 1794, 1798-1799]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 174 [85 S.Ct. at p. 858].) Moreover, <em>Malnak </em>and its progeny are efforts to define religion in the context of the free exercise clause. <em>(United States v. Meyers, supra, </em>95 F.3d at p. 1484; <em>Malnak v. Yogi, supra, </em>592 F.2d at p. 198.) Finally, many cases which have attempted to define or discuss religious belief have done so in the context of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was invalidated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>City of Boerne v. Flores </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 507, 515-530 [117 S.Ct. 2157, 2161-2169, 138 L.Ed.2d 624]. <em>(U.S. v. Meyers, supra, </em>95 F.3d at pp. 1479-1484; <em>Smith v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at pp. 1161-1176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We conclude that the best way to assess whether an FEHA claimant\u2019s \u201cbeliefs, observances, or practices\u201d have \u201ca place of importance parallel to that of traditionally recognized religions,\u201d as required by regulation 7293.1, is to utilize the objective analysis enunciated by the Third, Ninth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits in <em>Africa, Wiggins, Alvarado, and Meyers. </em>Flexible application of the objective guidelines identified in those cases will enable courts and administrative agencies to make the sometimes subtle distinction between a religion and a secular belief system. As noted previously, the guidelines are: \u201cFirst, a religion addresses fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters. Second, a religion is comprehensive in nature; it consists of a belief-system as opposed to an isolated teaching. Third, a religion often can be recognized by the presence of certain formal and external signs.\u201d <em>(Africa </em>v. <em>Com. of Pa., supra, 662 </em>F.2d at p. 1032, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We consider plaintiffs allegations in light of these three indicia. We do not question plaintiffs allegation that his beliefs are sincerely held; it is presumed as a matter of law that they are. However, we disregard conclusory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>allegations, for example, that plaintiffs beliefs \u201coccupy a place in [his] life parallel to that filled by God in traditionally religious individuals adhering to the Christian, Jewish or Muslim Faiths.\u201d <em>(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 966-967; <em>Moore v. Regents of University of California </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125 [271 Cal.Rptr. 146, 793 P.2d479].) First, plaintiff believes \u201cthat all living beings must be valued equally and that it is immoral and unethical for humans to kill and exploit animals even for food, clothing and the testing of product safety for humans\u201d; further, it is \u201ca violation of natural law\u201d to transgress this belief. There is no allegation or judicially noticeable evidence plaintiffs belief system addresses fundamental or ultimate questions. There is no claim that veganism speaks to: the meaning of human existence; the purpose of life; theories of humankind\u2019s nature or its place in the universe; matters of human life and death; or the exercise of faith. There is no apparent spiritual or otherworldly component to plaintiffs beliefs. Rather, plaintiff alleges a moral and ethical creed limited to the single subject of highly valuing animal life and ordering one\u2019s life based on that perspective. While veganism compels plaintiff to live in accord with strict dictates of behavior, it reflects a moral and secular, rather than religious, philosophy. <em>(Africa v. Com. of Pa., supra, </em>662 F.2d at p. 1033; <em>Carpenter v. Wilkinson </em>(N.D. Ohio 1996) 946 F.Supp. 522, 526.) Second, while plaintiffs belief system governs his behavior in wide-ranging respects, including the food he eats, the clothes he wears, and the products he uses, it is not sufficiently comprehensive in nature to fall within the provisions of regulation 7293.1. Plaintiff does not assert that his belief system derives from a power or being or faith to, which all else is subordinate or upon which all else depends. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Seeger, supra, </em>380 U.S. at p. 176 [85 S.Ct. at p. 859]; <em>Africa v. Com. of Pa., supra, </em>662 F.2d at p. 1031.) Third, though not determinative, no formal or external signs of a religion are present. There are no: teachers or leaders; services or ceremonies; structure or organization; orders of worship or articles of faith; or holidays. <em>(Alvarado v. City of San Jose, supra, </em>94 F.3d at p. 1230; <em>Africa v. Com. of Pa., supra, </em>662 F.2d at pp. 1035-1036.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Absent a broader, more comprehensive scope, extending to ultimate questions, it cannot be said that plaintiffs veganism falls within the scope of regulation 7293.1. Rather, plaintiffs veganism is a personal philosophy, albeit shared by many others, and a way of life. As Associate Justice Werdegar has aptly noted, religious belief is other than \u201ca philosophy or way of life.\u201d <em>(Smith v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1166.) Therefore, plaintiffs veganism is not a religious creed within the meaning of the FEHA. We quite obviously do not resolve the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>whether a vegan lifestyle that results from a religious belief otherwise meeting the standard in regulation 7293.1 is subject to FEHA coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">7. <em>Leave to Amend</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">D., E.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">III.
