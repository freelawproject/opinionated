We conclude that the causes of action alleged against appellant arise from acts taken by appellant in furtherance of its right to free speech and that respondent failed to show a probability of success on the merits due to appellant\u2019s constitutional defense to the action. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Statement of Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Appellant American Taxpayers Alliance (hereafter ATA or appellant) is a nonprofit corporation which was ostensibly organized to \u201cengage in legislative activities\u201d on \u201cissues that affect the American taxpayer,\u201d primarily revision of the Social Security system. In June of 2001, the ATA financed the production and presentation of a television advertisement that was patently critical of the management of \u201cCalifornia\u2019s energy problems\u201d by Governor Gray Davis, who was then a candidate for reelection in 2002. The advertisement presents blurred film of Governor Davis, and other darkened, obscure visual images. The audio portion consisting of a single voice accuses Governor Davis of \u201cpointing fingers and blaming others\u201d to avoid responsibility for the energy crisis that \u201cleft us powerless,\u201d but points out that the Public Utilities Commission, which is controlled by \u201cDavis appointees,\u201d \u201cblocked long-term cost-saving contracts for electricity.\u201d After attributing to newspapers the assessment that Governor Davis \u201cignored all the warning signals and turned a problem into a crisis,\u201d the advertisement closes with the words, \u201cGray outs from Gray Davis,\u201d as a light bulb is turned off. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Text at the bottom of the ad reads: \u201cPaid for by American Taxpayers Alliance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">On July 20, 2001, The Governor Gray Davis Committee (hereafter respondent), filed a complaint for injunctive relief against the ATA, along with a motion for a preliminary injunction. The complaint alleges the ATA violated the reporting provisions of the Political Reform Act of 1974 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 81000 et seq.). Respondent alleges in the complaint that the \u201ccampaign-style television ad\u201d produced by the ATA \u201chas no purpose other than to denigrate Governor Davis,\u201d and \u201cunambiguously urges\u201d his \u201cdefeat in 2002.\u201d The action seeks to enjoin further violations of the Political Reform Act and compel the ATA\u2019s compliance with the specific statutory obligations to file a statement of organization (Gov. Code, \u00a7 84101) and a semiannual campaign statement disclosing contributors (Gov. Code, \u00a7 84200).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Appellant subsequently filed a special motion to strike the complaint pursuant to section 425.16. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike and granted respondent\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying its special motion to strike, and abused its discretion in granting respondent\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. Appellant maintains that respondent\u2019s lawsuit is a \u201cclassic SLAPP suit,\u201d designed to restrain \u201cconstitutionally protected\u201d speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Since its enactment, section 425.16 has spawned numerous appellate cases arising from various factual contexts that were perhaps never envisioned by George W. Pring and Penelope Canan, the two University of Denver professors who coined the expression \u201cSLAPP suit.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See generally Canan &amp; Pring, <em>Studying Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation: Mixing Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches </em>(1988) 22 Law &amp; Soc\u2019y Rev. 385.) However, the complaint before us clearly raises issues that fall within the ever widening haven of the SLAPP statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Under section 425.16, \u201c[w]hen a lawsuit arises out of the exercise of free speech or petition, a defendant may move to strike the complaint.\u201d <em>(Beilenson v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 944, 949 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 357].) Subdivision (b)(1) of section 425.16 provides in pertinent part: \u201cA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d In order to encourage participation in matters of public significance, section 425.16 specifies in subdivision (a) that the statute \u201cshall be construed broadly.\u201d In <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1121-1122 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564], our high court noted \u201cthat the broad construction expressly called for in subdivision (a) of section 425.16 is desirable from the standpoint of judicial efficiency . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Section 425.16 articulates a \u201ctwo-step process for determining whether an action is a SLAPP.\u201d <em>(Navellier v. Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703]; see also <em>Paul for Council </em>v. <em>Hanyecz </em>(2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1364 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 864].) \u201c \u2018First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold prima facie showing that the defendant\u2019s acts, of which the plaintiff complains, were ones taken in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue. [Citation.] If the court finds that such a showing has been made, then the plaintiff will be required to demonstrate that \u201cthere is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d [Citations.] The defendant has the burden on the first issue, the threshold issue; the plaintiff has the burden on the second issue. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kajima Engineering &amp; Construction, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 921, 928 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 187]; see also <em>Paul v. Friedman </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 853, 862-863 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 82].) \u201cOnly a cause of action that satisfies <em>both </em>prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning <em>and </em>lacks even minimal merit\u2014is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute.\u201d <em>(Navellier v. Sletten, supra, </em>at p. 89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">On appeal we review independently whether the complaint against the appellant arises from appellant\u2019s exercise of a valid right to free speech and petition and if so, whether the respondent established a probability of prevailing on the complaint. <em>(ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 999 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 625].)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>I. <em>The Requirement of an Act in Furtherance of the Right of Free Speech.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"> We first determine if the defendant has met the burden of showing that the causes of action arise from protected activity. <em>(Kajima Engineering &amp; Construction, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th 921, 928; see also <em>Chavez v. Mendoza </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1089 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 825].)  \u201cWhen moving to strike a cause of action under the anti-SLAPP statute, a defendant that satisfies its initial burden of demonstrating the targeted action is one arising from protected activity faces no additional requirement of proving the plaintiffs subjective intent. [Citation.] Nor need a moving defendant demonstrate that the action actually has had a chilling effect on the exercise of such rights.\u201d <em>(Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th 82, 88, citing <em>Equilon Enterprises, LLC v. Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685].)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Section 425.16 applies to a cause of action arising from an act in furtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) Subdivision (e) of section 425.16 defines \u201cact in fiirtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue\u201d to include: \u201c(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest; (4) or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\u201c[T]he statutory phrase \u2018cause of action . . . arising from\u2019 [in section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1),] means simply that the defendant\u2019s act underlying the plaintiffs cause of action must <em>itself </em>have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech. [Citation.] In the antiSLAPP context, the critical point is whether the plaintiffs cause of action itself was <em>based on </em>an act in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s right of petition or free speech.\u201d <em>(City of Cotati </em>v. <em>Cashman </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 78 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 519, 52 P.3d 695]; <em>Kajima Engineering &amp; Construction, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th 921, 928-929; <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1090.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u201cThe Legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish [his or] her actions are constitutionally protected under the First Amendment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. v. Paladino </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 294, 305 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 906].) \u201cInstead, under the statutory scheme, a court must generally presume the validity of the claimed constitutional right in the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, and then permit the parties to address the issue in the second step of the analysis, if necessary. [Citation.] Otherwise, the second step would become superfluous in almost every case, resulting in an improper shifting of the burdens.\u201d <em>(Chavez v. Mendoza, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1089-1090.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Respondent argues that appellant failed to make the necessary \u201cthreshold showing\u201d of actions \u201ctaken in furtherance of ATA\u2019s constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.\u201d Respondent\u2019s position is that the underlying suit was brought to dispute and enjoin appellant\u2019s \u201cfailure to file campaign statements\u201d in violation of the Political Reform Act, not to \u201cchill ATA\u2019s speech\u201d or the \u201cright to sponsor the ad.\u201d Thus, respondent asserts that without any challenge to the right of free speech, \u201cATA\u2019s illegal conduct is not protected by section 425.16.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">To support the argument that \u201csection 425.16 does not protect violations of the Political Reform Act,\u201d respondent directs our attention to <em>Paul for Council v. Hanyecz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1362. There the plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants for violation of the act based upon their acts of \u201claundering campaign money\u201d for one of his opponents in the local election for city council. In support of their SLAPP motion, defendants acknowledged they \u201cin fact did violate the Political Reform Act when they laundered campaign contributions to persons running for local and state offices,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1361) but nevertheless argued that \u201ctheir campaign money laundering activity was taken <em>\u2018in </em>furtherance\u2019 of their constitutional right of free speech, and therefore such activity comes within the parameters of section 425.16\u2019s protection, even though such activity was found to be illegal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The court in <em>Paul </em>proceeded from the premise that, \u201cThe making of a political campaign contribution is a type of political speech. \u2018A contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views . . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Paul for Council v. Hanyecz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1365-1366.) \u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he constitutional guarantee [of free speech] has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Thus, those engaged in political debate are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>entitled not only to speak responsibly but to \u201c. . . speak foolishly and without moderation.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Beilenson v. Superior Court, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 944, 949-950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">However, the <em>Paul </em>court found no need to address the second step of a section 425.16 analysis because it found <em>\u201cas a matter of law, </em>that defendants cannot meet their burden on the first step.\u201d <em>(Paul for Council </em>v. <em>Hanyecz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1365.) Addressing the conceded violations of the Political Reform Act, the court concluded: \u201cUnder the facts demonstrated by this record, we cannot permit defendants to wrap themselves in this vital legislation. Thus, while it is technically true that laundering campaign contributions is an act in furtherance of the giving of such contributions, that is, in furtherance of an act of free speech, we reject the notion that section 425.16 exists to protect such illegal activity. Section 425.16 protects a defendant \u2018from retaliatory action for his or her exercise of legitimate . . . rights . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1366, italics omitted.) However, the court added the caveat: \u201cThis case, as we have emphasized, involves a factual context in which defendants have effectively conceded the illegal nature of their election campaign finance activities for which they claim constitutional protection. Thus, there was no dispute on the point and we have concluded, as a matter of law, that such activities are <em>not </em>a valid exercise of constitutional rights as contemplated by section 425.16. - . . [t] . . . If the plaintiff contests this point, and unlike the case here, cannot demonstrate as a matter of law that the defendant\u2019s acts do not fall under section 425.16\u2019s protection, then the claimed illegitimacy of the defendant\u2019s acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiffs burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiffs case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1367, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Here in contrast, appellant neither has conceded nor does the evidence conclusively establish the illegality of its communications made during the course of debate on political issues. (See <em>Brown v. Hartlage </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 45, 61 [102 S.Ct. 1523, 1533, 71 L.Ed.2d 732]; <em>Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 265, 271-272 [91 S.Ct. 621, 625, 28 L.Ed.2d 35]; <em>Beilenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 944, 950-951.) Appellant claims its advertisement constitutes protected speech that cannot be regulated by the Political Reform Act, and consequently no violation of law occurred. Further, while respondent specifically seeks to enjoin violations of the Political Reform Act, not directly the television spot itself, the action still arises from purported acts in furtherance of the right of free speech associated with campaign contributions. <em>(Paul for Council v. Hanyecz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1365-1366.) Imposition of the disclosure requirements of the Political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Reform Act on appellant\u2019s conduct effects the fundamental right of political communication afforded under the federal and state Constitutions. (See <em>Buckley v. Valeo </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 1, 19, 39-51 [96 S.Ct. 612, 634-635, 644-650, 46 L.Ed.2d 659]; <em>Californians for Political Reform Foundation v. Fair Political Practices Com. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 472, 489 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 606].)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Thus, with the legality of appellant\u2019s exercise of a constitutionally protected right in dispute in the action, the threshold element in a section 425.16 inquiry has been established. <em>(Chavez v. Mendoza, supra, 94 </em>Cal.App.4th 1083, 1089-1090; <em>Matson </em>v. <em>Dvorak </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539, 548 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 880].) The asserted violation of the Political Reform Act by appellant is an issue we must examine in the context of the discharge of the respondent\u2019s burden to construct a prima facie showing of the merits of its case. <em>(Paul for Council v. Hanyecz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1367.)  Finally, although, as respondent points out, appellant\u2019s advertising campaign apparently ran its course before the suit was initiated, \u201c[c]laims that arise from a defendant\u2019s prior free speech or petition activities are subject to an anti-SLAPP motion regardless of whether the protected activities have concluded before the lawsuit was filed.\u201d <em>(Chavez v. Mendoza, supra, </em>at p. 1090.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">II. <em>The Probability That Respondent Will Prevail on the Merits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Our conclusion that appellant has made a prima facie showing that the complaint arises from the exercise of its right to free speech leads us to the second part of the section 425.16 test, which places the burden on respondent to establish that there is a probability that it will prevail on its claims.  \u201cIn order to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim (\u00a7 426.16, subd. (b)(1)), a plaintiff responding to an anti-SLAPP motion must \u2018 \u201cstate[] and substantiate^ a legally sufficient claim.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Put another way, the plaintiff \u2018must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wilson v. Parker, Covert &amp; Chidester </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 811, 821 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733].) \u201c \u2018The burden on the plaintiff is similar to the standard used in determining motions for nonsuit, directed verdict, or summary judgment. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] To make our determination, we consider \u2018the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.\u2019 [Citation.] The motion to strike should be granted if, as a matter of law, \u2018the properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>pleaded facts do not support a claim for relief. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Seelig </em>v. <em>Infinity Broadcasting Corp. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 798, 809 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 108]; see also <em>Kyle v. Carmon </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 901, 907 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 303].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The second step of our anti-SLAPP analysis requires us to examine the merits of respondent\u2019s claim that appellant\u2019s advertisement created an obligation to comply with the disclosure and reporting obligations of the Political Reform Act, particularly Government Code sections 84101 and 84200.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our inquiry forces us to step into the maelstrom created by the clash between one of our most fundamental constitutional rights to freedom of expression, and the public\u2019s right to an electoral process that remains open and free from corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">To facilitate the stated objective of the Political Reform Act under Government Code section 81002, subdivision (a), \u201cthat \u2018[rjeceipts and expenditures in election campaigns should be fully and truthfully disclosed in order that [the] voters may be fully informed and improper practices may be inhibited[,] ... the Act requires political candidates and campaign committees to file written reports of election expenditures made and contributions received.\u201d <em>(McCauley v. BFC Direct Marketing </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1262, 1267 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 498]; see also <em>League of Women Voters v. Countywide Crim. Justice Coordination Com. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 529, 550 [250 Cal.Rptr. 161].)  \u201cThe manifest purpose of the financial disclosure provisions of the Act is to insure a better informed electorate and to prevent corruption of the political process.\u201d <em>(Thirteen Committee v. Weinreb </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 528, 532 [214 Cal.Rptr. 297].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The act mandates that expenditures be reported once specified monetary thresholds are reached. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 82013, subd. (b); <em>Yes on Measure A </em>v. <em>City of Lake Forest </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 620, 623 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 517].) Under Government Code section 82031, an \u201cexpenditure\u201d that compels compliance with reporting provisions of the act \u201cmeans an expenditure made by any person in connection with a communication which <em>expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate </em>or the qualification, passage or defeat of a clearly identified measure, <em>or taken as a whole </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>and in context, unambiguously urges a particular result in an election </em>but which is not made to or at the behest of the affected candidate or committee.\u201d (Italics added.) An expenditure is expressly excluded from the coverage of the Act if \u201cit is clear from the surrounding circumstances that it is not made for political purposes.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 82025.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Although the terms \u201cexpenditures\u201d and \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d are not further defined in the Political Reform Act, California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 18225, adopted by the Fair Political Practices Commission,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> specifies that an expenditure is \u201cany monetary or nonmonetary payment made for political purposes.\u201d (Cal.

The act operates \u201cin an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities. Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution. The First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such political expression in order \u2018to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.\u2019 [Citation.]  Although First Amendment protections are not confined to \u2018the exposition of ideas,\u2019 [citation] \u2018there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs, ... of course including] discussions of candidates . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] This no more than reflects our \u2018profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u2019 [citation]. In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential, for the identities of those who are elected will inevitably shape the course that we follow as a nation. As the Court observed in <em>Monitor Patriot Co. </em>v. <em>Roy, [supra,] </em>401 U. S. 265, 272 [91 S.Ct. 621, 625], \u2018it can hardly be doubted that the constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, supra, </em>424 U.S. 1, 14-15 [96 S.Ct. 612, 632].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u201cThis does not mean that government cannot regulate at all or subject such speech to some amount of scrutiny.

To preserve the constitutionality of an amended Federal Election Campaign Act restriction against corporate contributions or expenditures in connection with a federal election, the court interpreted the statute in a manner consistent with the standard that \u201can expenditure must constitute \u2018express advocacy\u2019 in order to\u201d come within the coverage of the law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 249 [107 S.Ct. at p. 623].) The \u201cmore pointed exhortations to vote for particular persons\u201d that the \u201c \u2018express advocacy\u2019 \u201d standard is designed to encompass, were again distinguished from a \u201cdiscussion of issues and candidates.\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>The court held that the newsletter contained \u201c[j]ust such an exhortation\u201d to vote for particular candidates. <em>(Ibid.) </em>An explicit directive to vote \u201cpro-life\u201d read in conjunction with named \u201cpro-life\u201d candidates, the court reasoned, was only \u201cmarginally less direct\u201d than a specific exhortation to vote for the named candidates. <em>(Ibid) </em>The court appeared to marginally extend the \u201cexpress advocacy\u201d inquiry to include consideration of the logical relationship between an express term advocating election or defeat, and the names of specific candidates identified in the communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The distinctions between the newsletter under consideration in <em>MCFL, supra, </em>479 U.S. 238, and appellant\u2019s advertisement are palpable.

Furgatch </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 807 F.2d 857 <em>(Furgatch), </em>to argue that the publication is not beyond the reach of constitutionally permissible regulation. In <em>Furgatch, </em>the Federal Election Commission (FEC) brought an enforcement action under the Federal Election Campaign Act against the defendant for his failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>report expenditures for political advertisements placed in The New York Times and The Boston Globe the week before the 1980 presidential election, in violation of 2 United States Code section 434(c). <em>(Furgatch, supra, </em>at p. 859.) The advertisements expressed an array of disparaging comments about President Carter,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which culminated with the exhortation, \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t Let Him Do It.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Furgatch </em>at p. 858.) The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declined to \u201cisolate each sentence\u201d of political speech or focus exclusively on \u201cmagic words\u201d without reference to context or external circumstances, and instead articulated a \u201cmore comprehensive approach\u201d to the definition of \u201c \u2018express advocacy\u2019 \u201d under the Federal Election Campaign Act. <em>(Furgatch, supra, </em>at pp. 862-863.) The court concluded that \u201cspeech need not include any of the words listed in <em>Buckley </em>to be express advocacy under the Act, but it must, when read as a whole, and with limited reference to external events, be susceptible of no other reasonable interpretation but as an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate. This standard can be broken into three main components. First, even if it is not presented in the clearest, most explicit language, speech is \u2018express\u2019 for present purposes if its message is unmistakable and unambiguous, suggestive of only one plausible meaning. Second, speech may only be termed \u2018advocacy\u2019 if it presents a clear plea for action, and thus speech that is merely informative is not covered by the Act. Finally, it must be clear what action is advocated. Speech cannot be \u2018express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate\u2019 when reasonable minds could differ as to whether it encourages a vote for or against a candidate or encourages the reader to take some other kind of action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 864.) \u201cApplying this standard to Furgatch\u2019s advertisement,\u201d the Ninth Circuit found \u201c[Reasonable minds could not dispute\u201d that it constituted express advocacy by urging readers \u201cto vote against Jimmy Carter,\u201d and was therefore subject to the strictures of the Federal Election Campaign Act. <em>(Furgatch, supra, </em>at pp. 864-865.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><em>Furgatch </em>thus expanded the definition of \u201cexpress advocacy\u201d to introduce two new components: first, a \u201climited reference\u201d to the context of the communication; and second, a consideration of the reasonable interpretation of the communication.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (See <em>Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v.

Under the bright-line test of <em>Buckley, </em>\u201ccontextual factors are irrelevant to our determination whether the advertisements contain express advocacy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 197.) While \u201cthe examples of express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>advocacy listed in the <em>Buckley </em>footnote are illustrative rather than exhaustive because there are a variety of other words and phrases that convey precisely the same meaning,\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 196-197), the definition of <em>\u201cexpress </em>advocacy necessarily requires the use of language that explicitly and by its own terms advocates the election or defeat of a candidate. If the language of the communication contains no such call to action, the communication cannot be \u2018express advocacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">We must therefore read and construe the scope of the provisions that define reportable expenditures in Government Code sections 82031 and 82025, and California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 18225, narrowly in accordance with First Amendment standards to apply only to those communications that \u201ccontain express language of advocacy with an exhortation to elect or defeat a candidate.\u201d <em>(Iowa Right to Life Committee, Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>187 F.3d 963, 969-970.)  Appellant\u2019s television spot does not contain the express or explicit words of advocacy that are subject to regulation. No campaign or election is mentioned. Nor does the advertisement overtly encourage the viewer to vote against Governor Davis. To be sure, the advertisement criticizes Governor Davis on the issue of the energy crisis, but it fails to associate the condemnation with any express endorsement of defeat of his candidacy for Governor. (Cf. <em>MCFL, supra, </em>479 U.S. 238, 243 [107 S.Ct. 616, 620]; <em>Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Moore, supra, </em>288 F.3d 187, 196.) Although the parties agree that Governor Davis was a clearly identified candidate, no election was. imminent when the advertisement was presented in June of 2001, as in <em>MCFL </em>and <em>Furgatch. </em>The primary and general gubernatorial elections in 2002 were nearly eight months and 18 months away, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Nothing in the explicit language of the advertisement <em>\u201cunambiguously </em>urged Gray Davis\u2019[s] defeat in the gubernatorial election,\u201d as respondent claims. (Italics added.) The criticism of the Governor and his appointments to the Public Utilities Commission, along with the disparaging comment, \u201cGray outs from Gray Davis,\u201d may be subject to other interpretations\u2014for instance, as a solicitation to viewers to advocate appointment of different commissioners by the Governor, or to seek change in energy policy through contact with elected officials. (See <em>Maine Right to Life Committee v. Fed. Elect. Com\u2019n, supra, </em>914 F.Supp. 8, 12.) Appellant\u2019s advertisement focused on the issue of the Governor\u2019s record in dealing with the energy crisis; it did not extend to express advocacy in opposition to a clearly identified candidate. Communications that discuss \u201cthe record and philosophy of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>candidates,\u201d like the one before us, \u201cdo not constitute express advocacy under <em>Buckley </em>and <em>MCFL </em>unless they also contain words that exhort viewers to take specific electoral action for or against the candidates.\u201d <em>(Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Moore, supra, </em>288 F.3d 187, 197.) We conclude based upon the advertisement at issue here that appellant cannot be compelled to comply with the disclosure and reporting obligations of the Political Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We share the concerns expressed by respondent and the quandary discussed in many of the cases that the result reached under this bright-line approach may be counterintuitive to a sensible understanding of the message conveyed by a political advertisement. It easily permits careful selection of language to circumvent the statutory reporting requirements. However, \u201cabsent the bright-line limitation in <em>Buckley, </em>\u2018the distinction between issue discussion (in the context of electoral politics) and candidate advocacy would be sufficiently indistinct that the right of citizens to engage in the vigorous discussion of issues of public interest without fear of official reprisal would be intolerably chilled.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Iowa Right to Life Committee, Inc. v. Williams, supra, </em>187 F.3d 963, 970.) \u201c[T]he result is compelled by the First Amendment, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in its effort to balance the state\u2019s interest in regulating elections with the constitutional right of free speech.\u201d <em>(Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Moore, supra, </em>288 F.3d 187, 199.) <em>Buckley </em>arose from a challenge to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 as amended in 1974, and we have little doubt that the recently enacted Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (Pub.L. No. 107-155 (Mar. 27, 2002) 116 Stat. 81) will again require our Supreme Court to revisit the relationship of the First Amendment and campaign reporting requirements. In the interim, we are required to follow Buckley\u2019s bright-line test.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In view of appellant\u2019s successful First Amendment defense to the action, respondent has failed to establish a likelihood of prevailing on the merits. The section 425.16 motion to dismiss should have been granted. <em>(Beilenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 944, 953.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court with directions to grant appellant\u2019s special motion to strike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>complaint pursuant to section 425.16. Costs on appeal are awarded to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Stein, Acting P.
