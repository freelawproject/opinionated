We affirm the judgment denying the petition and dismissing the complaint by adopting a narrow interpretation of the provision at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">The appellants\u2019 original petition and complaint raised a series of nine challenges to the Policy for Implementation of Toxics Standards for Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed Bays, and Estuaries of California (hereafter Toxics Standards Implementation Policy) adopted by the State Board on March 2, 2000. The trial court entered a judgment for the defendants denying all of appellants\u2019 claims and awarding costs to the defendants. In their opening brief in this appeal, appellants advanced assignments of error related to four separate elements of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">While the appeal was pending, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviewed the request of the State Board for approval of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy. In a letter dated May 1, 2001, the EPA addressed and generally approved three of the four provisions at issue in the appeal. Following the State Board\u2019s response to the letter, appellants filed a partial voluntary dismissal pursuant to a stipulation with the parties in which they abandoned the three assignments of error addressed in the EPA letter, leaving for our review the one remaining assignment of error relating to the \u201cminimum level\u201d provision in section 2.4.5, paragraph 1, of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">A. <em>General Statutory Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">The case arises from an administrative history reflecting the dual role of state agencies in implementing state law relating to water quality and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1452\">*1452</page-number>carrying out a delegated administrative responsibility over the more precise and far-reaching system of federal law. The governing state law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Porter-Cologne Act),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> enacted in 1969, assigns to the Regional Boards the responsibility of developing water quality control plans, or basin plans, which identify \u201cbeneficial uses of water\u201d and set \u201cwater quality objectives.\u201d (Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13241-13242.) The State Board is charged with approving these regional water quality control plans (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13245) and formulating \u201c[sjtate'policy for water quality\u201d that conforms to the requirements of Water Code section 13142. The adoption of the state policy is a quasi-legislative, rulemaking action subject to review by the Office of Administrative Law under the Administrative Procedure Act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11340, 11353 &amp; 11370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">The actual administration of the Porter-Cologne Act rests on the power of the Regional Boards to prescribe waste discharge requirements for all persons discharging waste into inland surface waters, enclosed bays and estuaries within their jurisdiction. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13263.) The waste discharge requirements implement state policy and water quality objectives formulated in basin plans. (Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13241, 13263, subd. (a).) All persons subject to waste discharge requirements must file discharge reports with the Regional Boards containing prescribed information. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13260; see also Wat. Code, \u00a7 13267; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, \u00a7 2200 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">Through the enactment in 1972 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 et seq.), commonly known as the Clean Water Act, Congress delegated to those states with approved water quality programs the authority to issue permits to discharge pollutants under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). In response, the California Legislature amended the Porter-Cologne Act to require the State Board and Regional Boards to issue discharge permits that ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7 13370 et seq.) The EPA subsequently gave the State Board and Regional Boards the required approval to issue NPDES permits. Hence, the waste discharge requirements issued by Regional Boards ordinarily also serve as NPDES permits under federal law. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">In general, the Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant except in compliance with one of several statutory exceptions. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a).) The most important of these exceptions (which largely incorporates by reference the others) applies to discharges subject to an NPDES permit. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342.) NPDES permits \u201cgenerally have five components: technology-based limitations, water quality-based limitations, monitoring and reporting requirements, standard conditions, and special conditions.\u201d (ABA Section of Natural Resources, Energy, and Environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1453\">*1453</page-number>Law, The Clean Water Act Handbook (Evans edit, 1994) p. 14 (hereafter Clean Water Act Handbook).) Only the water quality-based limitations and monitoring and reporting requirements are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">NPDES permits require dischargers to monitor their discharges according to prescribed procedures and to report the results on discharge monitoring reports. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1318(a); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.41(l)(4) (2002).) Monitoring is ordinarily conducted at the point of discharge, though monitoring of internal streams in a facility may occasionally be required. (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.45(h) (2002).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Discharge monitoring reports are admissible in court as admissions of the discharger and thus play a critical evidentiary role in enforcement actions for violation of permit terms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">The Clean Water Act authorizes both a chemical-specific and a whole-effluent approach to regulation of toxic pollutants. The former relies on chemical analysis of discharge samples and the latter on tests of the toxicity of the entire discharge sample. (See Clean Water Act Handbook, <em>supra, </em>pp. 28-32.) Only the chemical-specific approach is at issue here. Three provisions in the Clean Water Act\u2014sections 304, 307 and 303\u2014are of particular importance in the chemical-specific regulation of toxic pollutants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">Section 304(a) of the Clean Water Act directs the EPA to \u201cdevelop and publish . . . criteria for water quality accurately reflecting the latest scientific knowledge ... on the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on health and welfare . . . which may be expected from the presence of pollutants in any body of water . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314(a)(1).) The publications relating to water quality criteria published under section 304 are scientific assessments that lack the force of regulatory law, but, as we will see, they form the basis for state regulation of toxic pollutants under section 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">Section 307(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act requires the EPA to compile a list of toxic pollutants that are to be subject to effluent limitations. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1317; 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 401.15 (2001).) The EPA has interpreted the list to include 126 priority pollutants. (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 423, appen. A (2001); see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 131.36, General Notes 1 (2002).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number>The provision most central to this appeal, section 303(c)(2)(B), was added to the Clean Water Act by the Water Quality Act of 1987. (Pub.L. No. 100-4, \u00a7 1 (Feb. 4, 1987) 101 Stat. 7.) It requires the states to adopt specific numerical criteria for all toxic pollutants listed pursuant to section 307(a)(1), for which the EPA has published water quality criteria pursuant to section 304(a), where the discharge of the pollutants could reasonably be expected to interfere with the uses of the affected waters as designated by the states. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(2)(B).) Upon adoption by the states, the numerical criteria for toxic pollutants are reviewed by the EPA. If the EPA determines that the state standard is not consistent with the requirements of federal law, it must notify the states and specify \u201cthe changes to meet such requirements.\u201d (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(3).) In the default of appropriate state action, the EPA itself must promulgate regulations establishing the required numerical standard for toxic pollutants. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(3) &amp; (4).) The present appeal concerns two such regulations promulgated by the EPA in the absence of state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">To comply with section 303(c)(2)(B) of the Clean Water Act, California adopted an Enclosed Bays and Estuaries Plan and an Inland Surface Waters Plan. On November 6, 1991, the EPA approved both plans with certain exceptions relating particularly to the criteria for selenium.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because EPA approval was not complete, California was included in a regulation known as the National Toxics Rule, intended to remedy noncompliance with the statute, promulgated on December 22, 1992, and later amended.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The preamble to the National Toxics Rule states: \u201cThis rule promulgates for 14 states, the chemical-specific, numeric criteria for priority toxic pollutants necessary to bring all states into compliance with the requirements of section 303(c)(2)(B).\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The rule sets forth a small set of criteria applicable specifically to California. (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.36(d)(10) (2002).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">In July 1994, the Superior Court of Sacramento County upheld a challenge to the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries Plan and the Inland Surface Waters Plan. In compliance with court order, the State Board formally rescinded the plans on September 22, 1994, leaving the state without any comprehensive regulatory compliance with section 303(2)(c)(B) of the Clean Water Act. The only regulatory law complying with section 303(c)(2)(B) consisted of the limited set of regulations in the National Toxics Rule and an unsystematic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>treatment of toxic pollutants in the water-quality objectives of the basin plans of Regional Boards.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">To bring California into compliance with section 303(c)(2)(B) of the Clean Water Act, the EPA published on August 5, 1997, a proposed regulation establishing a comprehensive set of numeric criteria for priority toxic pollutants, known as the California Toxics Rule. After receiving comments, the EPA promulgated a final rule on May 18, 2000. (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.38 (2002).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Federal regulations authorized the State Board to adopt policies, subject to EPA approval, affecting the \u201capplication and implementation\u201d of water quality standards. (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.13 (2002).) Under this authority, the State Board drafted the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy to establish comprehensive, statewide implementation procedures for priority pollutant criteria contained in the California Toxics Rule, the National Toxics Rule as amended, and relevant water quality objectives in the basin plans of the Regional Boards. The draft policy was circulated for public review together with a \u201cFunctional Equivalent Document\u201d (FED) containing a much more detailed technical explanation of the policy. The State Board resolution adopted March 2, 2000, approved both the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy and the accompanying FED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">B. <em>The Minimum Level Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">The issue before us concerns the portion of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy governing the use of the concept of minimum level or ML in compliance determinations. The chemical-specific effluent limitations for priority toxic pollutants are sometimes set at levels that are too low to be detected in discharge samples by routine analytical chemistry methods. As the FED explains, \u201cThis often occurs when the pollutant is highly toxic or has a tendency to bioaccumulate in the environment.\u201d Federal regulations \u201crequire that any discharge that has the \u2018reasonable potential\u2019 to exceed the State water quality objective must contain an effluent limitation for that pollutant. The Clean Water Act makes no exception to this, even when technological limits prevent the quantification of the pollutant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">To deal with the difficult compliance problems arising when effluent limitations for toxic pollutants in discharge samples are below routine analytical chemistry methods of detection, the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy and FED employ the concepts of method detection level and ML for compliance reporting. In general terms, the method detection limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>(MDL) is the minimum concentration of a pollutant in a discharge that can be detected with 99 percent certainty by analysis of a discharge sample.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the amount of a pollutant in a discharge sample decreases toward the MDL, the level of certainty that can be achieved in measuring the concentration of the pollutant decreases. The ML is the lowest level of concentration in a sample that can be accurately quantified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">Though the EPA has used the ML concept for over 10 years, the State Board adopted its own method of determining ML values based on a survey of state-certified analytical laboratories in California in 1997 and 1998. Appendix 4 to the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy sets forth specific ML\u2019s for the entire list of priority toxic pollutants. The FED explains, \u201cThe present list of ML\u2019s represents the 20th percentile of the reported lowest concentrations of a pollutant that can be quantitatively measured given the current state of performance in analytical chemistry methods in California. [The State Board] staff intend to update this list as existing methods are improved and as new methods are promulgated.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">The Toxics Standards Implementation Policy provides that the State Board \u201cshall require in the permit that the discharger shall report with each sample result\u201d the applicable ML and MDL. Dischargers are required to report as measured only sample results equal to or greater than the ML. If the sample results are less than the reported ML but greater than or equal to the MDL, they must report the results as \u201c \u2018Detected, but Not Quantified\u2019 or DNQ\u201d and provide an estimate of the chemical concentration with a numerical evaluation of the data quality (e.g., an estimated accuracy plus or minus a given percentage of the reported value). If the sample results are less than the MDL, dischargers may report the results as \u201c \u2018Not Detected\u2019 or ND.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Where there is evidence that the priority toxic pollutant is present in the effluent above the effluent limitation and the sample results yield a DNQ or ND value, the Regional Boards have discretion to order dischargers to adopt a Pollutant Minimization Program directed at preventing or minimizing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>occurrence of the toxic pollutant in processes preceding the actual discharge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This goal of pollutant prevention may, for example, be pursued by \u201cinput change, operational improvement, production process change, and product reformulation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">C. <em>Use of ML\u2019s in Permits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">While appellants raise no objection to the use of ML\u2019s in the reporting of or as a trigger for adoption of Pollutant Minimization Programs, they challenge inclusion of specific ML values in the permit itself and, in particular, attack the role of ML\u2019s in compliance determinations under paragraph 1 of section 2.4.5 of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy, which provides: \u201cDischargers shall be deemed out of compliance with an effluent limitation if the concentration of the priority pollutant in the monitoring sample is greater than the effluent limitation <em>and </em>greater than or equal to the reported ML.\u201d (Italics added.) They claim that section 2.4.5 effectively employs the ML value as a substitute, or alternative, for the effluent limitation in compliance determinations, thereby causing the ML to supplant the effluent limitation where the effluent limitation is lower than the ML. They express the fear that, by including ML\u2019s in the permit, the provision \u201clocks in for the life of the permit ... the level of detection technology available on the date the permit was issued,\u201d and blocks the enforcement of those effluent limitations that are lower than the specified ML level, both in administrative enforcement proceedings and citizens\u2019 suits, even though the effluent limitations may be mandated by statute and properly promulgated regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">The state respondents maintain that the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy is entitled to the deferential standard of review accorded to quasi-legislative rules since the Legislature has given the State Board rulemaking power under Water Code section 13140. They cite <em>Industrial Welfare Com. v. Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 690, 702 [166 Cal.Rptr. 331, 613 P.2d 579], where the California Supreme Court observed, \u201c \u2018A reviewing court does not superimpose its own policy judgment upon a quasi-legislative agency in the absence of an arbitrary decision; ... in these technical matters requiring the assistance of experts and the collection and study of statistical data, courts let administrative boards and officers work out their problems with as little judicial interference as possible.\u2019 \u201d (See also <em>Yamaha Corp. of America </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 10-11 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031]; <em>Western Oil &amp; Gas Assn. v. Air Resources Board </em>(1984) 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>Cal.3d 502, 509 [208 Cal.Rptr. 850, 691 P.2d 606].) Moreover, they note that under the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Chevron U. S. A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 837, 843 [104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694], the courts should not impose their own construction on an ambiguous statute that has been subject to administrative interpretation but rather should inquire \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">On the present record, however, we do not find the principle of judicial deference to quasi-legislative acts to be helpful in resolving the issues on appeal. First, as discussed more fully later in this opinion, we find section 2.4.5 of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy to be ambiguous. Since the record discloses no history of administrative interpretation of this newly enacted provision, the <em>Chevron </em>principle of deference to administrative interpretation finds no application to resolution of the ambiguity presented by the language of the provision. Second, in their reply brief appellants question the authority under the Porter-Cologne Act for an expansive interpretation of section 2.4.5. This is an issue that we must review de novo.  As stated in <em>Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at page 11, footnote 4, \u201cA court does not. . . defer to an agency\u2019s view when deciding whether a regulation lies within the scope of the authority delegated by the Legislature. The court, not the agency, has \u2018final responsibility for the interpretation of the law\u2019 under which the regulation was issued. [Citations.]\u201d (See also <em>California Assn. of Psychology Providers v. Rank </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1, 11-12 [270 Cal.Rptr. 796, 793 P.2d 2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">Third, while we recognize that the EPA\u2019s administrative interpretation is relevant to interpretation of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy in light of the State Board\u2019s obligation to carry out the objectives of federal law (e.g., Wat. Code, \u00a7 13372), the EPA\u2019s failure to address the ML provision in its letter of May 1, 2001, does not provide any clear indication of its administrative interpretation, though it may perhaps be regarded as signifying an absence of objections. Turning to the administrative history, we find a history of administrative interpretation that has shifted from a position supporting the respondents to a position closer to that of the appellants, without providing any clear and controlling guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">As noted in the FED, an EPA technical study issued in March 1991, entitled \u201cTechnical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control,\u201d recommends reliance on the ML in compliance determinations where the ML exceeds the effluent limitation. The study was issued under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>304 of the Clean Water Act and lacks the status of a regulation. The pertinent language of the EPA study states at page 111: \u201cFor most NPDES permitting situations, EPA recommends that the compliance level be defined in the permit as the minimum level (ML). The ML is the level at which the entire analytical system gives recognizable mass spectra and acceptable calibration points.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">Four years later, the EPA revisited the ML concept in Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Great Lakes Guidance) and the accompanying supplementary information document included in the administrative record for this appeal. The supplementary information document explained that \u201cthe WQBEL [water quality-based effluent limits] as actually calculated is the enforceable permit limit even if it is below the minimum quantification level.\u201d Nevertheless \u201cthe analytical method and minimum quantification level is to be specified in the permit\u201d for the purpose of assuring consistency in \u201creporting monitoring information.\u201d The regulation itself states that the permitting authority \u201cshall designate as the limit in the NPDES permit the WQBEL exactly as calculated\u201d but shall specify the analytical method to be used for monitoring and \u201cthe quantification level that can be achieved by use of the specified analytical method.\u201d The regulation continues: \u201cThe permit shall state that, for the purpose of compliance assessment, the analytical method specified in the permit shall be used to monitor the amount of pollutant in an effluent down to the quantification level.\u201d (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 132, appen. F, procedure 8 (2002).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">Following the Great Lakes Guidance, the preamble to the California Toxics Rule states: \u201cEPA is aware that the criteria promulgated today for some of the priority toxic pollutants are at concentrations less than EPA\u2019s current analytical detection limits. Analytical detection limits have never been an acceptable basis for setting water quality criteria since they are not related to actual environmental impacts.\u201d The preamble notes, however, the utility of analytical detection limits in assessing compliance: \u201cEPA does believe . . . that the use of analytical detection limits are <em>[sic] </em>appropriate for assessing <em>compliance </em>with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit limits. . . . EPA . . . recommends the use of the \u2018minimum level\u2019 or ML for reporting sample results to assess compliance with WQBELs [citation].\u201d (65 Fed.Reg. 31682, 31701 (May 18, 2000).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">We are unable to distill any useful guidance from this administrative history. Any inference favoring the use of ML\u2019s in compliance determinations that might be drawn from the EPA\u2019s letter of May 1, 2001, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>1991 technical study must be balanced against the discussion of the subject in the Great Lakes Guidance and the preamble to the California Toxics Rule. Accordingly, we will conduct an independent review of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">We begin by observing that paragraph 1 of section 2.4.5 of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy is ambiguous. Viewed in isolation, the provision appears to give ML\u2019s the same legal effect as the effluent limitations in the permit where the ML is higher than the effluent limitation. We see compelling reasons, however, to construe the provision more narrowly in order to give ML\u2019s effect only for the purpose of defining reporting requirements and providing a guideline for enforcement by the Regional Boards. As so construed, the provision may be read as implicitly containing the qualification \u201cfor purpose of reporting and administrative enforcement\u201d after the introductory phrase \u201c[djischargers shall be deemed out of compliance with an effluent limitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">This narrow interpretation is favored, first, by the context of the provision in the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy. The State Board adopted the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy pursuant to its statutory role of overseeing the activities of the Regional Boards. For example, the Regional Boards must secure the approval of the State Board for adoption of basin plans or guidelines (Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13245 &amp; 13245.5), and the State Board may not adopt state policy for water quality control unless it gives the Regional Boards notice and an opportunity to submit recommendations. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13147.) The stated purpose of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy was \u201cto establish a standardized approach for permitting discharges of toxic pollutants . . . that promotes statewide consistency\u201d and therefore the policy \u201csupercedes basin plan provisions.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In light of the supervisory relationship of the State Board to the Regional Boards, it is reasonable to suppose that the State Board intended the provision to apply to compliance determinations by the Regional Boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">It is also significant that section 2.4.5, paragraph 1, is found in a part of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy described as containing \u201creporting requirements including compliance determinations\u201d and under the subheading \u201cReporting Levels.\u201d Though the ML\u2019s are to be included in the permit, the requirement appears in the context of reporting requirements: the Regional Board \u201cshall require in the permit that the discharger shall report with each sample result [the ML level].\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Again, it is reasonable to read the provision as referring to compliance determinations by the agencies receiving the reports, that is, the Regional Boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>Second, the principle that \u201ccourts should construe statutes where possible in favor of validity\u201d also supports a narrow interpretation of paragraph 1, section 2.4.5 of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy. <em>(Turner v. Board of Trustees </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 818, 827 [129 Cal.Rptr. 443, 548 P.2d 1115].) As applied to administrative regulations or other quasi-legislative administrative rules or policies, the principle dictates that \u201c[a] court is to interpret a regulation as it would a statute and is to construe it in light of the enabling statute\u2019s intendment.\u201d <em>(Blumenfeld v. San Francisco Bay Conservation etc. Com. </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 50, 59 [117 Cal.Rptr. 327].)  The State Board clearly possesses authority under the Porter-Cologne Act to oversee the reporting procedures and administrative enforcement guidelines employed by the Regional Boards. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13245.5.) The authority of the Regional Boards to impose reporting requirements implies authority to regulate the content of the reports. (Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13260, 13267 &amp; 13376.) And their discretionary authority to initiate enforcement actions implies authority to adopt guidelines for the exercise of that discretion. (Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13301, 13305, 13308; see also \u00a7\u00a7 13385, subds. (b) &amp; (h), 13386 [upon request of a regional board].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">We find no statutory authority, however, that would give the State Board power to frame effluent requirements to reflect the technological limits for detection in discharge samples. Under Water Code section 13142, state policy for water quality control shall consist of \u201c[w]ater quality principles and guidelines,\u201d \u201c[w]ater quality objectives,\u201d and other principles \u201cdeemed essential ... for water quality control.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 13142, subds. (a), (b), (c).) Similarly, under Water Code section 13241, the Regional Boards are directed to establish \u201cwater quality objectives [to] ensure the reasonable protection of beneficial uses and the prevention of nuisance,\u201d which includes a series of factors relating to \u201cbeneficial uses,\u201d \u201c[e]nvironmental characteristics,\u201d \u201c[w]ater quality conditions,\u201d \u201c[e]conomic considerations,\u201d housing, and recycling. The reference to economic considerations may perhaps authorize technology-based limitations, such as those in the Clean Water Act, but it is less plausible to construe it to refer to detection limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">Third, it is elementary that \u201c[a] statute should be interpreted with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part.\u201d <em>(People v. Comingore </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 142, 147 [141 Cal.Rptr. 542, 570 P.2d 723]; <em>In re Michael G. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 283, 296 [243 Cal.Rptr. 224, 747 P.2d 1152].) We think that a narrow interpretation of paragraph 1 of section 2.4.5 of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy is most consistent with other provisions in the interlocking state and federal regulatory schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>The question at issue in the interpretation of section 2.4.5\u2014whether ML\u2019s should be included generally in permit-compliance determinations or limited to reporting and administrative enforcement\u2014will affect the legal context for resolving issues in two areas of some practical importance: the procedural requirements for modification of ML provisions in permits<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the defense of permit compliance (commonly known as the \u201cpermit shield\u201d) in citizen suits under the Clean Water Act.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Since neither of these matters has been briefed, we offer no opinion as to how they should be resolved. We note, however, that the use of ML\u2019s in compliance determinations would raise at least the appearance of a novel concept previously unknown in the federal and state regulatory scheme\u2014a compliance-based effluent limitation. In contrast, if the use of ML\u2019s is confined to reporting and a guideline for administrative enforcement, the issue may be resolved in terms of existing categories of regulatory law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">D. <em>Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">Our interpretation of section 2.4.5 of the Toxics Standards Implementation Policy as requiring the use of ML\u2019s only for purposes of reporting and administrative enforcement precludes the necessity of a writ of mandate or injunctive relief. As so interpreted, we see no basis for invalidating the provision as lying beyond the scope of enabling legislation or enjoining its enforcement and therefore affirm the judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief. The complaint for declaratory relief, however, presents a separate issue. The objective of the complaint for declaratory relief was to avoid in anticipated future proceedings an application of section 2.4.5, paragraph 1 that would result in administrative rigidity and an expanded defense of permit compliance. Our decision narrowly interpreting the provision partially satisfies the appellants\u2019 objectives. Nevertheless, we consider that it would be an idle act to remand the case for a declaration conforming to this opinion since this decision offers appellants the substantive equivalent of a declaratory judgment.
