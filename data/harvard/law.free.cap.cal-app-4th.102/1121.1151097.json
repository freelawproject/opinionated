The petitioner seeks a writ of mandate vacating the trial court\u2019s order granting the Medicare plan\u2019s petition to compel arbitration. Because we agree with the petitioner that neither the Federal Arbitration Act nor federal Medicare provisions preempt California\u2019s mandatory disclosure requirements, we grant the writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Factual and Procedural Synopsis</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">In 1995, Johnnie Pagarigan enrolled in a Medicare HMO plan offered by Aetna U.S. Healthcare of California, Inc. Pursuant to a contract with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the federal entity that administers the Medicare program, Aetna offered replacement Medicare coverage to Medicare beneficiaries such as Pagarigan under the Senior Choice plan (later renamed the Golden Medicare plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">Under Health and Safety Code section 1363.1 (in effect at the time of Pagarigan\u2019s enrollment to the present), any health care service plan that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>requires binding arbitration to settle disputes must provide a disclosure meeting certain specified conditions. (All statutory references are to the Health and Safety Code unless otherwise indicated.) More particularly, the statutorily mandated disclosure language \u201cshall be prominently displayed on the enrollment form signed by each . . . enrollee\u201d and shall appear \u201cimmediately before the signature line provided for the individual enrolling in the health care service plan.\u201d (\u00a7 1363.1.) The Aetna enrollment form Pagarigan signed did not include any mention of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Each year of Pagarigan\u2019s enrollment, Aetna published a new \u201cEvidence of Coverage\u201d (EOC), setting forth Aetna\u2019s agreement with its members. The 1995 member handbook and EOC included something of an arbitration provision, but, in 1996, Aetna made a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d to delete that provision from the EOC\u2019s for 1996 through 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Aetna later decid\u00e9d to reinsert an arbitration provision in the 2000 EOC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The provision appeared as an unpaginated amendment located about 75 pages into a document of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>more than 100 pages (the EOC itself with pages numbered to 68 with a corresponding table of contents, followed by numerous unpaginated or separately-paginated amendments with no directory).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Pagarigan died in June 2000. Thereafter, her adult children (Teri Pagarigan, Mary Pagarigan and John Pagarigan) filed suit against Aetna (and a number of codefendants not involved in this writ proceeding), alleging that Pagarigan was denied timely and proper treatment for her condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They asserted causes of action for negligence, willful misconduct, intentional infliction of emotional distress, elder abuse, tort per se (based on statutory violations of Pen. Code, \u00a7 368 and Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 15656, which prohibit willfully subjecting elders to unjustifiable pain and suffering), constructive fraud, various additional fraud claims and wrongful death, arising out of the medical care Pagarigan received from February 23, 2000, until her death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In May 2001, Aetna filed a petition to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision approved by the HCFA for the 2000 EOC, arguing that <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Aetna Health Plans of California, Inc. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 646 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>[84 Cal.Rptr.2d 76] <em>(Erickson), </em>was \u201cdispositive\u201d of the issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After determining that section 1363.1 and its mandatory disclosure requirements were preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), the <em>Erickson </em>court enforced Aetna\u2019s arbitration provision in the 1995 version of the same plan in which Pagarigan had enrolled. <em>(Erickson, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at pp. 649, 652.) Over opposition from Pagarigan\u2019s children, the trial court granted Aetna\u2019s petition in September, concluding (among other things) that the \u201cagreement to arbitrate is governed by federal law, specifically the . . . FAA[ ] and thus state law requirements with respect to the form and substance of arbitration provisions are preempted <em>(see Erickson[, supra,] </em>71 Cal.App.4th [at p.] 651).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Pagarigan\u2019s children later moved for reconsideration of the court\u2019s arbitration order, asserting that Division Three\u2019s decision in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>PacifiCare Behavioral Health of Cal., Inc. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 139 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 140] <em>(Smith) </em>(rendered after the arbitration order) \u201cconstituted a change in the law.\u201d The <em>Smith </em>court held that section 1363.1 is <em>not </em>preempted by the FAA because of federal legislation the <em>Erickson </em>court did not consider (the McCarran-Ferguson Act). <em>(Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 162.) After awaiting finality of the <em>Smith </em>decision, the trial court granted reconsideration but again ordered arbitration, including the following findings in its May 2002 order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-6\">\u201c The health plan before the Court is a Medicare health plan[,] specifically a Medicare+Choice health plan entitled the Aetna U.S. Health Care Golden Medicare Plan, formerly known as the Senior Choice Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-7\">\u201c. . . Smith[, <em>supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th 139] did not consider a Medicare health plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-8\">\u201c. . . EricksonF. <em>supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th 646] did uphold federal preemption with respect to a Medicare health plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-9\">\u201c. . . Federal regulation of the Medicare program, including Medicare health plans, is extensive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-10\">\u201c. . . Based on federal law and Erickson, <em>[supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th 646], Smith[, <em>supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th 139] is distinguishable and provides no basis for disturbing the Court\u2019s prior Order granting [Aetna\u2019s] Petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>In June, Pagarigan\u2019s children filed this writ petition, arguing (among other things) that Aetna cannot enforce its arbitration provision because it failed to comply with section 1363.1, a provision they say is not preempted by either the FAA or the Medicare scheme. After receiving Aetna\u2019s preliminary opposition, we issued an order to show cause why the trial court should not be compelled to vacate its order granting Aetna\u2019s petition to compel arbitration and to issue an order denying that petition instead. In response, Aetna filed its return, urging that the trial court correctly concluded that \u201cunder both <em>Erickson </em>and <em>Smith, </em>under both the Federal Arbitration Act and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, arbitration must be compelled and all state laws applicable to arbitration provisions are preempted.\u201d Pagarigan\u2019s children filed a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">As noted, Pagarigan\u2019s children contend that section 1363.1 is not preempted by either the FAA or Medicare and therefore Aetna cannot enforce its arbitration provision because it does not comply with this state\u2019s mandatory disclosure requirements under section 1363.1. In Aetna\u2019s view, even if the FAA does not preempt state law requirements applicable to arbitration provisions in now-Medicare health care service plans under <em>Smith, </em>\u201csuch state laws are nonetheless preempted here under the McCarran-Ferguson Act by the pervasive federal regulatory scheme governing the Medicare program and the Medicare+Choice health care service plans.\u201d The law of preemption supports Pagarigan\u2019s children, not Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">I. <em>General Preemption Principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">\u201c \u2018It will not be presumed that a federal statute was intended to supersede the exercise of the power of the state unless there is a clear manifestation of intention to do so. The exercise of federal supremacy is not lightly to be presumed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(New York Dept. of Social Services v. Dublino </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 405, 413 [93 S.Ct. 2507, 2513, 37 L.Ed.2d 688]; <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 470, 485 [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250, 135 L.Ed.2d 700] <em>(Medtronic); Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>De la Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141, 153 [102 S.Ct. 3014, 3022, 73 L.Ed.2d 664].) Where (as here) Congress regulates a field historically within the police powers of the states (public health), we proceed from the assumption that state law is <em>not </em>superseded unless there is a \u201cclear and manifest purpose of Congress\u201d to foreclose a particular field to state legislation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 485 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2250]; <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. v.

Rath Packing Co. </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 519, 525 [97 S.Ct. 1305, 1309, 51 L.Ed.2d 604].) In the absence of explicit preemptive language, the Supreme Court has recognized two types of implied preemption: \u201cfield pre-emption, where the scheme of federal regulation is \u2018 \u201cso pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it,\u201d \u2019 [citation], and conflict pre-emption, where \u2018compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\u2019 [citation], or where state law \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u2019 [citations].\u201d <em>(Gade </em>v. <em>National Solid Wastes Management Assn. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 88, 98 [112 S.Ct. 2374, 2383, 120 L.Ed.2d 73] <em>(Gade).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">II. <em>Section 1363.1, Erickson, Smith and Other Undisputed Matters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Section 1363.1 provides: \u201cAny health care service plan that includes terms that require binding arbitration to settle disputes and that restrict, or provide for a waiver of, the right to a jury trial <em>shall include, </em>in clear and understandable language, <em>a disclosure that meets all of the following conditions-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">\u201c(a) The disclosure shall clearly state whether the plan uses binding arbitration to settle disputes, including specifically whether the plan uses binding arbitration to settle claims of medical malpractice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-9\">\u201c(b) <em>The disclosure </em>shall appear as a separate article in the agreement issued to the employer group or individual subscriber and <em>shall be prominently displayed on the enrollment form signed by each subscriber or enrollee.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-10\">\u201c(c) The disclosure shall clearly state whether the subscriber or enrollee is waiving his or her right to a jury trial for medical malpractice, other disputes relating to the delivery of service under the plan, or both, and <em>shall be substantially expressed in the wording provided in subdivision (a) of Section 1295 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>\u201c(d) In any contract or enrollment agreement for a health care service plan, <em>the disclosure required by this section shall be displayed </em>immediately before the signature line provided for the representative of the group contracting with a health care service plan and <em>immediately before the sisnature line provided for the individual enrolling in the health care service plan.\u201d </em>(Underscoring and italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The reference to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure section 1295 means that the disclosure mandated by section 1363.1 is to be \u201csubstantially expressed\u201d as follows: \u201c \u2018It is understood that any dispute as to medical malpractice, <em>that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, neslieentlv or incompetently rendered, </em>will be determined by submission to arbitration <em>as provided by California law, </em>and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process <em>except as California law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. Both parties </em>to this contract, by entering into it, are giving up their constitutional right to have any such dispute decided in a court of law before a jury, and instead are accepting the use of arbitration.\u2019 \u201d (Underscoring and italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">There is no dispute that the enrollment form Pagarigan signed made no mention whatsoever of arbitration, let alone a disclosure satisfying all of the foregoing requirements of section 1363.1. The question is whether section 1363.1 applies or is preempted in this case. Aetna argues that <em>Erickson </em>(finding preemption under the FAA) controls and <em>Smith </em>(finding no FAA preemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act) is inapplicable because <em>Erickson </em>involved a Medicare plan and <em>Smith </em>did not. Accordingly, we must first discuss what these cases did (and did not) determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The <em>Erickson </em>court analyzed the issue of whether section 1363.1 was preempted by the FAA in the following manner. The FAA (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq.) applies to any \u201ccontract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\u201d which contains an arbitration clause. (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.) Section 2 of the FAA further provides that arbitration provisions \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d <em>(Erickson, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">In <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casarotto </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 681, 687 [116 S.Ct. 1652, 1656, 134 L.Ed.2d 902] (Casarotto), the United States Supreme Court held that the FAA preempted a Montana statute that required an arbitration clause to be typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of a contract to be enforceable. <em>(Erickson, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at pp. 651-652.) Stating that section 2 of the FAA precluded states from \u201c \u2018singling out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>arbitration provisions for suspect status,\u2019 \u201d the Supreme Court in <em>Casarotto </em>found the Montana law in direct conflict with section 2 because it conditioned the enforceability of an arbitration agreement \u201c \u2018on compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Erickson, </em>at p. 652.)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Citing <em>Casarotto, </em>the <em>Erickson </em>court concluded that section 1363.1 similarly conflicted with section 2 of the FAA because it too imposes on health care plan arbitration clauses \u201c \u2018a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Erickson, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 652.) Although the plan at issue was a Medicare plan, the <em>Erickson </em>court made mention of this fact in its preemption analysis for the sole purpose of assessing whether the contract at issue involved interstate commerce as required for the FAA to apply.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Erickson, </em>at p. 651.) There was no discussion whatsoever of whether section 1363.1 was independently preempted under the Medicare scheme.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">In <em>Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th 139, another health care plan (PacifiCare) sought to compel arbitration, asserting FAA preemption of section 1363.1 under <em>Erickson </em>(just as Aetna urges here). The difference in <em>Smith, </em>however, was that the plaintiffs responded with an argument never considered in <em>Erickson. </em>They asserted that the FAA <em>could not </em>preempt section 1363.1 because the McCarran-Ferguson Act foreclosed application of the FAA. (93 Cal.App.4th at p. 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">After reviewing the analysis under <em>Erickson, </em>Division Three turned to the McCarran-Ferguson Act, enacted by Congress in 1945, which \u201csets forth a policy declaration that <em>it is in the public interest that the primary regulation of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number><em>the business of insurance be in the states, not in the national government </em><footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011.) It was passed in response to a United States Supreme Court decision <em>(United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn. </em>(1944) 322 U.S. 533 [64 S.Ct. 1162, 88 L.Ed. 1440]), which held that the business of insurance was \u2018commerce\u2019 within the meaning of the commerce clause and therefore the business of insurance was subject to all federal laws, including those relating to antitrust. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 553 [64 S.Ct. at pp. 1173-1174].) This was a major change in the law. In 1869, the Supreme Court had held <em>(Paul v. Virginia </em>(1868) 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168, 183 [19 L.Ed. 357, 361]) that insurance was not \u2018commerce\u2019 and therefore was not subject to federal commerce clause statutes.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 152-153, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">\u201cThe clear purpose of McCarran-Ferguson was to abrogate this change and to ensure that the states would continue to enjoy broad authority in regulating the dealings between insurers and their policyholders. . . .\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 153, citation omitted.) \u201cThe mandate of McCarran-Ferguson appears to be both plain and clear. An act of Congress may not be construed to \u2018invalidate, impair, or supersede\u2019 a state law enacted <em>for the purpose of regulating the business of </em>insurance\u2019 unless the federal act \u2018specifically relates to the business of insurance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 154, citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012(b) and adding italics.) Noting that there was no dispute that application of the FAA would supersede the application of section 1363.1 nor any dispute that the FAA is a statute of <em>general application </em>that does <em>not specifically relate </em>to the business of insurance, the <em>Smith </em>court turned to examine the \u201cintegrally related questions as to whether health care service plans ... are engaged in the business of insurance and whether section 1363.1 is a statute enacted \u2018for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">After carefully examining both factors, Division Three determined that health care service plans <em>\u201care </em>engaged in the business of insurance when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>they offer health coverage to their members, and section 1363.1 clearly regulates this aspect of their endeavor.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 162.) The court concluded \u201c[therefore, [that] the FAA, a federal statute of general application, which does not \u2018specifically relate\u2019 to insurance, is foreclosed from application to prevent the operation of section 1363.1.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As a result, PacifiCare\u2019s arbitration provision could not be enforced for its failure to satisfy the \u201cspecific and unambiguous disclosure requirements imposed by section 1363.1.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">III. <em>Section 1363.1 Is Not Preempted by the FAA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">\u201cIn <em>[Smith],\u201d </em>Aetna says, \u201cthe court explained that the \u2018clear purpose of the McCarran-F erguson Act. . . [is] to insure that the states would continue to enjoy broad authority in regulating the dealings between insurers and their policyholders.\u2019 <em>[(Smith, supra,] </em>93 Cal.App.4th at [p.] 153.)] Here, however, the \u2018dealings\u2019 are not between an insurer and its policyholder, but rather, between Medicare (the federal government) and Medicare beneficiaries through the intermediary of Medicare health care service plans contracted with the federal government to provide Medicare benefits.<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> Neither <em>[Smith] </em>nor the cases on which it relies, address the intensive federal regulation of the Medicare program, itself a creature of federal statute, or the preemption of state regulation over Medicare health care service plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">\u201cConsequently, <em>the McCarran-F erguson Act had no application in [Erickson], and has no application here, because there is in place a specifically related and all encompassing federal regulatory scheme governing the Medicare program and its contracted Medicare health care service plans, including federal supervision over the form and substance of arbitration provisions. </em>See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.80 .... Thus, <em>[Erickson], </em>upon which [the trial court] relied in granting [Aetna\u2019s] petition to compel arbitration, is still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>good law and controls this case. Section 1363.1 is therefore preempted here, not only on the basis of <em>[Erickson], </em>but also, on the basis of specific federal laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The main problem is that Aetna seems to lose sight of whether it is addressing the FAA or the Medicare scheme in its preemption analysis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In arguing that <em>Smith </em>did not consider <em>Medicare </em>and that the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not apply to <em>Medicare, </em>Aetna says nothing at all to undermine the vitality of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>holding with respect to the <em>FAA. </em>The FAA makes no mention of Medicare or Medicare health care service plans. If Aetna means to argue in the passage quoted above that the <em>McCarran-Ferguson Act </em>is inapplicable to the federal Medicare provisions on which Aetna relies, we agree as we explain in part IV, <em>post </em>(although this conclusion does not yield the result Aetna says it does). In any case, as Division Three determined in <em>Smith, </em>the McCarran-Ferguson Act <em>does </em>apply to the FAA, with the result that \u201cthe FAA, a federal statute of general application, which does not \u2018specifically relate\u2019 to insurance, is foreclosed from application to prevent the operation of section 1363.1.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Thus, Aetna\u2019s unsupported claims that <em>Smith </em>\u201cdoes not apply\u201d and that <em>Erickson, in which the court never discussed either the McCarran-Ferguson Act or </em>Medicare, \u201ccontrols this case\u201d cannot withstand scrutiny. To the contrary, we find that <em>Smith </em>does apply in this case\u2014as far as it goes. More particularly, we agree with Division Three in <em>Smith </em>that <em>Erickson\u2019s </em>analysis of whether the FAA preempts section 1363.1 does not hold up when the McCarran-Ferguson Act is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">IV. <em>The McCarran-Ferguson Act Does Not Apply to Medicare.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">At another point in its brief, Aetna argues that \u201c[sjection 1363.1 is preempted here because there are \u2018specifically relat[ed]\u2019 federal statutes and regulations governing the Medicare program and the health care service plans participating thereunder, <em>even under </em>[Smith\u2019s] McCarran-Ferguson analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Italics added.) \u201cUnder the McCarran-Ferguson Act,\u201d Aetna says, <em>\u201cfederal laws which specifically relate to insurance preempt state laws </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number><em>purporting to regulate insurance, </em>while federal laws of general applicability and unrelated to insurance, have no preclusive effect.\u201d (Italics added.) In other words, in Aetna\u2019s view, if there is any federal legislation \u201cspecifically related\u201d to insurance (such as Medicare), the preemption question is resolved. That is not how the McCarran-Ferguson Act or preemption analysis operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">\u201cIn the field of insurance regulation, ... the McCarran-Ferguson Act [(]15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1011-1015[)] may preclude the application of <em>normal federal preemption principles </em>provided three conditions are met.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Rhode Island Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, supra, </em>80 F.3d at p. 619, italics added.) This act preserves a state statute from federal preemption where: \u201c(1) the state statute has been enacted \u2018for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance;\u2019 (2) application of the relevant federal statute would \u2018invalidate, impair, or supersede\u2019 that state statute; and (3) the federal statute does not itself \u2018specifically relate to the business of insurance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ruthardt v.

In <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. 470, the United States Supreme Court specified the proper approach in analyzing a statute that includes <em>explicit </em>preemption language.  Although an express preemption provision may indicate congressional intent to preempt \u201cat least some state law,\u201d a court must nevertheless \u201c \u2018identify the domain expressly pre-empted\u2019 by that language.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 484 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2250].)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Two presumptions guide the process of determining the scope of an express preemption provision. First, as in answering the threshold question of whether Congress intended preemption to occur, the assumption that preemption will not lie absent evidence of a clear and manifest congressional purpose must also be applied in measuring the <em>\u201cscope </em>of [Congress\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>intended invalidation of state law.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 485 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2250].)

However, section 1876 requirements could preempt a State law or standard based on general constitutional Federal preemption principles, consistent with the provisions of Executive Order 12612 on Federalism. Under the guidelines of the Executive Order, section 1876 requirements did not preempt a State law or standard unless the law or standard was <em>in direct conflict with </em>the Federal law, or it <em>prevented the organization from complying with the Federal law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">\u201cPut another way, <em>if Federal law permitted the HMO to do what State law required, there was no preemption. In practice, rarely, if ever, did Federal law preempt State laws affecting Medicare prepaid plans. </em>For example, Medicare risk plans operating in States with mandated benefit laws were generally required to comply with such State laws. Compliance with the State mandated benefit law was not viewed as interfering with the ability of plans to function as Medicare risk contractors under Federal standards. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">\u201cGeneral preemption: The general preemption provision of the BBA will be applied in the same way that the Executive Order has been applied, in that <em>State laws or standards will be preempted only when they are inconsistent with [Medicare+Choice] standards, as clearly indicated in the statute. </em>Because the BBA requires that [certain Medicare+Choice organizations] operating under a waiver of the State licensure requirement must comply with State quality and consumer protection standards, it seems clear that the Congress expected States, in some cases, to have more rigorous or more comprehensive standards for quality and consumer protection which would enhance, rather than duplicate or be subsumed under, the [Medicare+Choice] standards for quality and consumer protection. Thus, unless one of the <em>specific </em>preemptions . . . applies, <em>State laws </em>or standards <em>that are more strict </em>than the [Medicare+Choice] standards would <em>not </em>be preempted <em>unless they prevented compliance with the </em>[Medicare+Choice] <em>requirements. . . . </em>[T]here are <em>likely </em>to be quality and <em>consumer protection standards </em>imposed by States that all [Medicare+Choice] plans must comply with, and <em>for which there is no Federal preemption.\u201d </em>(63 Fed.Reg. 34968, 35012 (June 26, 1998), italics added; <em>McCall, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 423-424.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">F. <em>Section 1363.1 and the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Section 1363.1, the California statute mandating certain disclosures on the enrollment form of <em>any </em>health care service plan requiring binding arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>(disclosures Aetna failed to provide), is part of the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975.

Detailed provisions address standards for plan solicitations, advertising and disclosure forms. (\u00a7\u00a7 1359-1363; <em>Solorzano, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1144-1145 &amp; fn. 11.) Each plan is required to make specified disclosures regarding plan benefits, services and contract terms (including the fact that the plan uses arbitration to settle disputes if it does) \u201cso as to afford the public, subscribers and enrollees with a full and fair disclosure of the provisions of the plan in readily understood language and in a clearly organized manner.\u201d (\u00a7 1363, subd.

Not only does this argument ignore the <em>limited express </em>preemption provision at issue here, but it ignores the Medicare scheme overall. Because the \u201cfirst section of the Medicare Act explicitly states [Congress\u2019s] intent to minimize federal intrusion in the area\u201d and because the Medicare Act specifically requires that Medicare HMO\u2019s be state-licensed, our Supreme Court in <em>McCall </em>observed that, \u201c[b]y clear implication,\u201d even before the BBA\u2019s enactment, <em>\u201cCongress left open a wide field for the operation of state law </em>pertaining to standards for the practice of medicine and the manner in which medical services are delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.\u201d <em>(McCall, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 422-423, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">In fact, a decade ago, before the introduction of Medicare+Choice and its express preemption provisions, Division One considered whether federal Medicare statutes regulating HMO\u2019s preempted the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for injunctive relief under Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. based on their dissatisfaction with the marketing practices an HMO employed to solicit and enroll Medicare recipients. <em>(Solorzano, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 1135.) By congressional mandate as stated in section 1395w-26 of 42 of the United States Code, the statutes and regulations we consider here are \u201cbased on\u201d (and are virtually indistinguishable from) the \u201canalogous\u201d provisions considered in <em>Solorzano </em>(with the obvious exception of the express preemption provision added to the Medicare+Choice framework). (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(2); <em>Solorzano, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1141-1143.) Because the <em>Solorzano </em>court thoroughly and thoughtfully examined Medicare provisions pertaining to marketing practices <em>which directly parallel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number><em>the provisions we consider here </em>(as well as various provisions of the KnoxKeene Health Care Service Plan Act (\u00a7 1340 et seq.)), we find the opinion particularly instructive. (Solorzano, at pp. 1139-1149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">In finding that Congress had not occupied the field to displace state regulation of marketing practices, the <em>Solorzano </em>court commented, \u201cEven if the federal Medicare statute is viewed as \u2018comprehensive,\u2019 that fact does not persuade in favor of preemption [citation] where, as here, Congress has expressed an intent to minimize federal intrusion into the administration of the Medicare program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395) and where, as here, the subject of regulation (public health) is a matter traditionally left to the police powers of the states.\u201d <em>(Solorzano, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1146-1147, citing <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc. v. Dukakis, supra, </em>815 F.2d at p. 795 [\u201ca state is ordinarily as concerned as the federal government to see that its elderly citizens enjoy medical care\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Moreover, as our Supreme Court emphasized in <em>McCall: </em>\u201cBy its terms, Medicare now [upon the enactment of the BBA and the introduction of the Medicare+Choice program] preempts state laws mandating benefits to be covered, mandating inclusion of providers and suppliers, and coverage determinations. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3).) . . . <em>All other types of state laws not inconsistent with Medicare standards are permitted.\u201d (McCall, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 423, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">H. <em>State Law Is Not \u201cInconsistent\u201d with Federal Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">Because (at the relevant time) \u201cmarketing material\u201d was not one of the three areas of state regulation \u201cspecifically superseded,\u201d the only remaining question is whether section 1363.1 is consistent or inconsistent with the pertinent federal regulations promulgated by the Secretary \u201cto carry out\u201d the Medicare+Choice program. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3)(B).) As Congress has expressly stated, state standards regarding matters outside the specified areas are superseded <em>only </em>to the extent any state regulation is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with such federal regulations. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3)(A), italics added.) Aetna maintains that it is inconsistent for section 1363.1 to apply to the arbitration provision within Aetna\u2019s EOC because EOC\u2019s are submitted to HCFA for approval. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Historically, the inconsistency requiring preemption has meant the conflict that arises when \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility\u201d <em>(Florida Avocado Growers </em>v. <em>Paul </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 132, 142-143 [83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217, 10 L.Ed.2d 248]) or when, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>circumstances of the particular case, state law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>(Hines v.

A state\u2019s imposition of a stiffer penalty or a higher standard of care than mandated by federal law does not preclude state regulation. <em>(Solorzano, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1147-1148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Further, contrary to Aetna\u2019s position, Congress\u2019s imposition of a state licensing requirement for Medicare+Choice organizations is significant, as our Supreme Court observed in <em>McCall.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> (McCall, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 423.) In fact, Congress expressly conditioned any waiver from the state licensing requirement on the Medicare+Choice organization\u2019s compliance with \u201call consumer protection . . . standards\u201d that <em>\u201cwould </em>apply in the State to the organization if it <em>were </em>licensed under State law\u201d as long as such standards were also generally applicable in the state and \u201cconsistent with\u201d standards established for the Medicare+Choice program.

On this record, we see no reason why a Medicare health care service plan could not comply with both schemes; moreover, rather than \u201cstanding] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u201d section 1363.1 serves to advance the same goals.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 507 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2261]; <em>Gade, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 98 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2383]; <em>Hines v.

(42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3)(B)(iv) (2002).) There is no dispute that the EOC satisfies the federal definition of \u201cmarketing material.\u201d However, as Aetna necessarily admits, this legislation was enacted on December 21, <em>2000\u2014after </em>Aetna\u2019s EOC received HCFA approval (in Jan. 2000) and, indeed, <em>after </em>Pagarigan\u2019s death (the following June).

While in the care of this facility and the health care providers with whom Aetna had contracted, Pagarigan developed a large, \u201cparticularly severe pressure sore on her lower back . . . , lost significant weight, became malnourished, dehydrated, and developed a severe infection at the site of her G-Tube inserted in her abdomen.\u201d These problems were not promptly assessed, Pagarigan\u2019s family members were not informed as to her condition and, when the need for acute care was recognized, Aetna (and its codefendants) \u201cstill failed to arrange for [Pagarigan\u2019s] transfer to a hospital where she could obtain more (and more expensive) care.\u201d \u201c[F]inancial motivation was the incentive.\u201d As a result, Pagarigan died.

Plan coverage is available only to Medicare beneficiaries, who pay monthly premiums through Social Security deductions or payments to Medicare.
