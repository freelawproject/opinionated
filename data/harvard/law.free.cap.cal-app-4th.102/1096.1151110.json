He contends there was insufficient evidence that he lacked control of his sexually violent behavior. Alternatively, he contends that, if there was any such evidence, it was elicited by his counsel on cross-examination, and therefore his counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Finally, he contends the deputy district attorney committed misconduct in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>In the published portion of this opinion, we will hold that the People, on direct examination, elicited sufficient evidence of lack of control. We therefore do not reach defendant\u2019s alternative contention regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we will hold that the deputy district attorney\u2019s remarks did not constitute misconduct; that defendant waived his claim to the contrary; and that, in any event, the supposed misconduct was not prejudicial. Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">A. <em>Defendant\u2019s Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Defendant had borderline mental retardation, with an IQ of 65 to 70, and a hearing impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">When he was 10 or 11 years old, defendant had a juvenile adjudication for \u201cessentially a rape\u201d of an eight- or nine-year-old girl. He was placed on probation. When he was 13 or 14, he had another juvenile adjudication for \u201ca similar offense.\u201d Once again, he was placed on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s Qualifying Offenses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">1. <em>Rape of C.L.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">In July 1981, C.L. was home alone with her 16-month-old daughter when there was a knock at the door. When she opened the door, she found defendant, wearing a ski mask and holding a gun and a screwdriver. He \u201cpushed himself inside the door . . . .\u201d He told her to shut up or he was going to kill her. After a struggle, during which he poked her with the screwdriver, he pushed her to the floor and raped her. When he was done, he asked her for money. She gave him $5 in cash, which was all she had. Before leaving, he told her \u201cnot [to] tell anybody or he would come back and get [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">2. <em>Attempted Rape.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">In August 1981, defendant knocked on another woman\u2019s door, then forced his way in. He was armed with a screwdriver. He was in the process of forcing the woman into the bedroom when her husband arrived. Defendant then fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">3. <em>Rape of S.M.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">In October 1981, S.M. was walking to her car in a school parking lot at night when defendant \u201cattacked [her] from behind.\u201d He held a knife up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>against her stomach. He asked her where her car was. She tried to grab the knife, but it cut her thumb \u201cto the bone.\u201d She screamed. Defendant \u201cput his hand over [her] mouth,\u201d \u201cbrought the knife up to [her] throat\u201d and \u201ctold [her] not to scream again and not to do anything because if [she] did, he would shut [her] up.\u201d Defendant forced her to walk to some bleachers. Once there, he told her to take off her clothes. After she did so, he put down the knife, got undressed, and raped her. When he left, he told her, \u201cYou stay right there and don\u2019t you move.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">4. <em>Conviction and Imprisonment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In July 1981, based on the incident involving C.L., defendant was charged with rape, robbery, and burglary. While these charges were pending, he committed the attempted rape. In September 1981, he pleaded guilty to the rape of C.L.; the robbery and burglary charges were dismissed. While awaiting sentencing, he committed the rape of S.M. In October 1981, based on the incident involving S.M., he was charged with rape. In February 1982, he pleaded guilty to the rape of S.M.; he was sentenced on the two rapes to a total of six years in prison. Charges arising out the attempted rape were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Defendant displayed \u201ca constant pattern of conflict with the prison rules.\u201d Within about a month, he received his first prison disciplinary citation; he continued to receive such citations throughout his time in prison. Most of them were for violent and/or gang-related behavior, including participation in a stabbing, attempted assault on a correctional official, possession of a weapon, possession of opiates, theft, destruction of state property, refusing orders, being out of bounds, improper use of food and \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior.\u201d In one incident, while facing a female correctional officer, he grabbed his genitals and \u201cmassagfed] them.\u201d While in prison, defendant was convicted of possession of a weapon and sentenced to an additional three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">In 1991, defendant was paroled. He violated his parole by stealing a car and by failing to register as a sex offender and was returned to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">In April 1993, defendant was paroled again. In November 1993, he lured a seven-year-old girl into his house, then took off her clothes, undressed himself, \u201cand tried to put his private into her private.\u201d In May 1994, based on this incident, he was charged with lewd and lascivious conduct, a felony, and child molestation, a misdemeanor; he was also charged with possession of a firearm by an ex-felon. In July 1994, he pleaded guilty to firearm possession and to child molestation; the lewd and lascivious conduct charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>was dropped. He was sentenced to a total of six years in prison. Had he been convicted of the lewd and lascivious conduct charge, it would have constituted a third qualifying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">C. <em>Testimony of Dr. Kania.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Dr. Michael Kania, a clinical psychologist, had done some 25 to 30 sexually violent predator evaluations. In a little over half of these, he had concluded that the subject was a sexually violent predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">In March 1997, Dr. Kania had evaluated defendant. As part of this evaluation, he had interviewed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Defendant claimed the girl he had raped as a juvenile was not nine years old; rather, she was in the ninth grade. He also said, \u201cI didn\u2019t rape her. I talked her into it.\u201d He said this girl was his girlfriend, and she appeared to be 12 or 13 years old. He claimed he only kissed the second girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Defendant was age 18 when he committed the 1981 rapes. Regarding the July 1981 rape of C.L., defendant said the rape was actually committed by another person who was with him. Regarding the October 1981 rape of S.M., defendant told Dr. Kania that \u201cbecause he was young, he did a stupid thing . . . .\u201d He had previously told another doctor he had seen <em>Roots, </em>a television mini-series based on the book by Alex Haley, in which a White man raped a Black woman, and it made him want to rape a White woman. He also said he had reneged on a promise to pay both victims in exchange for sex, and they had retaliated by falsely accusing him of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Regarding the 1993 sexual molestation, defendant told Dr. Kania the victim was 15 years old and had a child of her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">These explanations indicated \u201cunderlying dishonesty.\u201d Defendant was trying to deny or minimize his involvement. He did not show any remorse or any awareness that what he did was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">Dr. Kania diagnosed defendant as having a paraphilia, defined as a deviant sexual attraction. In defendant\u2019s case, his paraphilia involved girls younger than he as well as rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">Defendant also had an antisocial personality disorder. Dr. Kania defined this as \u201ca pattern that continues past the age of 15 that . . . involves . . . illegal or antisocial behavior,\u201d such as robbery or \u201csexual misconduct.\u201d He testified that an antisocial personality disorder tends to be \u201centrenched\u201d\u2014a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>\u201cpattern of behavior that doesn\u2019t change even though the person may get in trouble with the law or may have some counseling and [be] told they are doing things the wrong way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Defendant had no reasonable plan for the future. While on parole, he had not worked, except as a pimp. He did not feel he had any psychological problems, so he saw no need for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Dr. Kania concluded that defendant was likely to engage in sexually violent behavior if released. His opinion was based on the fact that defendant\u2019s history of \u201csexual acting[-]out\u201d was \u201cwell[-]entrenched,\u201d having begun when he was age 10 or 11. There was no indication that he had ever had a successful sexual relationship; he had never been married or had a long-term relationship. Dr. Kama\u2019s opinion was also based on defendant\u2019s antisocial personality disorder. Defendant\u2019s lack of remorse indicated that he did not see his behavior as a problem. His failure to hold down a steady job indicated an increased likelihood of reoffending. His lack of long-term goals meant he was more likely \u201cto act out impulsively,\u201d without considering the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">D. <em>Dr. Kama\u2019s Testimony on Cross-examination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Dr. Kania gave the following testimony on cross-examination and/or redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">A paraphilia affects volitional capacity because the person is likely to engage in inappropriate behavior as a result of his or her deviant sexual attraction. In Dr. Kama\u2019s opinion, defendant was unable to control his behavior due to his paraphilia. His opinion was based on the \u201crepeated incidents where [defendant] engaged in that behavior, he was apprehended and punished and yet continued in that behavior.\u201d By contrast, a psychologically healthy person learns from experience and changes behavior which gets him or her in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">An antisocial personality disorder which coexists with a paraphilia can lead to sexual recidivism because it involves a disregard for the law and a tendency to act impulsively. A meta-analysis of over 100 studies, however, had found only \u201ca slight correlation\u201d between antisocial personality disorder and sexual recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Mental retardation may or may not affect impulse control. Dr. Kania felt defendant\u2019s inability to learn from past mistakes was due to his antisocial personality disorder rather than to his mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>E. <em>Testimony of Dr. Miccio-Fonseca.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Dr. L.C. Miccio-Fonseca, a \u201cforensic sexologist,\u201d had done a sexually violent predator evaluation of defendant in March 1997. In connection with her evaluation, she had interviewed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In discussing the 1981 rapes, defendant told Dr. Miccio-Fonseca, \u201cI was young and stupid. ... I know I did it, but I don\u2019t know why. Maybe hostility toward women. I didn\u2019t pick them. It was just a woman there. . . . I didn\u2019t need no weapon. I used force with my physical strength .... I pushed her onto the ground. I didn\u2019t beat her, you know, how serial killers ... cut their arms off. I didn\u2019t do that. I just forced them. That\u2019s all.\u201d This led Dr. Miccio-Fonseca to suspect that defendant fantasized about killing his victims. Defendant did not appreciate the seriousness of his behavior or the impact that behavior had on his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Like Dr. Kania, Dr. Miccio-Fonseca diagnosed defendant as having a paraphilia involving rape and an antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">She concluded that defendant \u201cwould\u201d engage in sexually violent behavior if released. Her opinion was based on his history of juvenile sexual offenses, his history of sexual offenses involving the use of a weapon and threats to kill the victim, his disciplinary violations while in prison, his gang membership, his history of drug use and abuse, his history of auditory hallucinations, his antisocial personality disorder, physical abuse in his family, and his probation and parole violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">She testified that a rapist with defendant\u2019s history who is incarcerated and then released will reoffend within five years. Also, a person who is arrested for a sexual offense as a juvenile is likely to be arrested again.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">F. <em>Dr. Miccio-Fonseca\u2019s Testimony on Cross-examination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Dr. Miccio-Fonseca gave the following testimony on cross-examination and/or redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">She had evaluated defendant using the rapid risk assessment for sex offense recidivism, or \u201cRRASOR.\u201d He had scored a four. This meant he had a 32.7 percent risk of reoffending within five years and a 48.6 percent risk of reoffending within 10 years. However, she felt these figures were an underestimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">Defendant\u2019s antisocial personality disorder was \u201cunchangeable.\u201d A person with a paraphilia can try to manage it, through treatment, medication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>education or otherwise. For example, if defendant had rape fantasies, he could either choose to act them out or choose to prevent himself from acting them out.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">G. <em>Testimony of Dr. Donaldson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Dr. Theodore Donaldson, a clinical and forensic psychologist, testified for the defense. He had been a member of the sexually violent predator panel for about three months; however, he had been terminated because \u201c[his] views were not consistent with other people\u2019s views.\u201d Since then, he had done sexually violent predator evaluations exclusively for defense attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">He agreed that \u201cit is almost a certainty that [defendant] will continue to rape in the future.\u201d One study showed that, over a 25-year period, the average rapist had a 25 to 39 percent chance of being charged with a new offense and a 24 percent chance of being convicted. Dr. Donaldson agreed that defendant\u2019s RRASOR score was a four, indicating a 48.7 percent chance of reoffending within 10 years. Defendant\u2019s actual likelihood of reoffending was probably higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Dr. Donaldson disagreed, however, that defendant had a \u201cmental disorder\u201d within the meaning of Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600. The definition of \u201cmental disorder\u201d required an inability to control behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Dr. Donaldson defined volitional control as the ability to make a choice. A person is volitionally impaired when a \u201cdriving force\u201d overcomes his or her ability to make choices. \u201cMost people who are compelled to behavior . . . go through some sort of concern afterwards. . . . [T]hey look pretty tormented about it.\u201d Such a person would feel remorse. The fact that a person repeats criminal behavior after being punished does not show volitional impairment; it shows only \u201crisk-taking behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">According to Dr. Donaldson, defendant was not unable to control his behavior. Rather, defendant chose not to control himself. \u201cHe acts out whenever he wants to. . . .He has a strong sense of entitlement. He is angry. A lot of his crimes involve . . . a lot of anger and aggression.\u201d He was impulsive, but not compulsive. The fact that he had no qualms about his behavior meant that his volition was not impaired. An antisocial personality disorder was the antithesis of a volitional impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">The Sufficiency of the Evidence of Lack of Control</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence that he lacked control of his sexually violent behavior. He asserts this contention in two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>alternative forms. First, he argues that there was insufficient evidence of lack of control anywhere in the record. Second, he argues that the People\u2019s direct examination of their witnesses provided insufficient evidence of lack of control; accordingly, to the extent that his trial counsel elicited such evidence on cross-examination, defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">\u201c[T]he Sexually Violent Predators Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq. (Act)) . . . provides for civil commitment of criminal defendants who, after serving their prison terms, are found to be \u2018sexually violent predator[s].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Torres </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 680, 682 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, 22 P.3d 871], fn. omitted, quoting Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">To prove that defendant was a sexually violent predator, the People had to prove that: (1) he had been convicted of at least two sexually violent offenses against different victims, (2) he had a \u201cdiagnosed mental disorder\u201d as defined in the Sexually Violent Predators Act (the Act), and (3) his mental disorder made it likely that, if released, he would commit sexually violent predatory crimes. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600, subds. (a)(1), (c); <em>People v. Hurtado </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1179, 187-188 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 186, 52 P.3d 116]; <em>Hubbart </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1138, 1144-1145 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492, 969 P.2d 584].) \u201c \u2018Diagnosed mental disorder\u2019 includes a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">As a matter of substantive due process, the federal Constitution does not permit the civil commitment of a recidivist violent sexual offender unless he lacks control of his sexually violent behavior. This \u201clack of control\u201d requirement stems from <em>Kansas v. Hendricks </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 346 [117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501]. There, the United States Supreme Court stated: \u201cA finding of dangerousness, standing alone, is ordinarily not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntary commitment. We have sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor, such as a \u2018mental illness\u2019 or \u2018mental abnormality.\u2019 [Citations.] These added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from a <em>volitional impairment </em>rendering them dangerous <em>beyond their </em>control.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 358 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2080], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">The court then held that Kansas\u2019s sexually violent predator law met this standard: \u201cThe Kansas Act is plainly of a kind with these other civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>commitment statutes: It requires a finding of future dangerousness, and then links that finding to the existence of a \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 or \u2018personality disorder\u2019 that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the person to control his dangerous behavior. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 358 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2080].)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The court further held that Hendricks himself met this standard. He had pedophilia, \u201ca serious mental disorder,\u201d and he admitted he could not control his urge to molest children. <em>(Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 360 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2081].) \u201cThis admitted lack of volitional control, coupled with a prediction of future dangerousness, adequately distinguishes Hendricks from other dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In <em>Kansas v. Crane </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 407 [122 S.Ct. 867, 151 L.Ed.2d 856], the Supreme Court further refined the \u201clack of control\u201d requirement. It stated that <em>Hendricks </em>had not required <em>\u201ctotal </em>or <em>complete </em>lack of control. <em>Hendricks </em>referred to the Kansas act as requiring a \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 or \u2018personality disorder\u2019 that makes it \u2018difficult, if not impossible, for the [dangerous] person to control his dangerous behavior.\u2019 [Citation.] The word \u2018difficult\u2019 indicates that the lack of control to which this Court referred was not absolute.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 411 [122 S.Ct. at p. 870], quoting <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 358 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2080].)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">\u201cWe do not agree . . . , however, . . . that the Constitution permits commitment of the type of dangerous sexual offender considered in <em>Hendricks </em>without <em>any </em>lack-of-control determination.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 412 [122 S.Ct. at p. 870].) \u201cIn <em>[Hendricks], </em>we did not give to the phrase Tack of control\u2019 a particularly narrow or technical meaning. . . . [I]n cases where lack of control is at issue, \u2018inability to control behavior\u2019 will not be demonstrable with mathematical precision. It is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior. And this, when viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis, and the severity of the mental abnormality itself, must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The California Supreme Court has held that the California act meets the standard stated in Hendricks: \u201c[T]he [Act] tracks the Kansas scheme verbatim in describing the requisite mental disorder as a \u2018congenital or acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others.\u2019 [Citation.] Through this language, the Act targets sexual offenders who suffer from a diagnosed \u2018volitional impairment\u2019 making them \u2018dangerous beyond their control.\u2019 [Citation.] ....</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">\u201cThe [Act] also establishes the requisite connection between impaired volitional control and the danger posed to the public. Much like the Kansas law at issue in <em>Hendricks, </em>our statute defines a[] [sexually violent predator] as a person who has committed sexually violent crimes and who currently suffers from \u2018a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u2019 [Citation.] Through this language, the [Act] plainly requires a finding of dangerousness. The statute then \u2018links that finding\u2019 to a currently diagnosed mental disorder characterized by the inability to control dangerous sexual behavior. [Citation.] This formula permissibly circumscribes the class of persons eligible for commitment under the Act.\u201d <em>(Hubbart v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 1157-1158, fn. omitted, quoting <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 358 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2080].)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">In this appeal, defendant urges essentially the same interpretation of the Act as Dr. Donaldson urged in his testimony below. That is, defendant argues that reoffending impulsively or without considering the consequences is distinguishable from reoffending due to lack of control. \u201cLack of control,\u201d he argues, \u201cis more consistent with someone who knows and considers the consequences but is unable to stop . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">We believe this is precisely the sort of \u201cnarrow or technical meaning\u201d which the United States Supreme Court has specifically refused to give to \u201clack of control.\u201d The court focused on lack of control because this factor serves to distinguish those recidivist violent sexual offenders who should be dealt with civilly from those who should be dealt with criminally. As the court observed, \u201c[T]he two primary objectives of criminal punishment [are] retribution or deterrence. The Act\u2019s purpose is not retributive because it does not affix culpability for prior criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at pp. 361-362 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2082].) \u201cNor can it be said that the legislature intended the Act to function as a deterrent. Those persons committed under the Act are, by definition, suffering from a \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 or a \u2018personality disorder\u2019 that prevents them from exercising adequate control over their behavior.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 362 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2082].)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">It follows that a recidivist violent sexual offender who, due to a mental disorder, is unlikely to be deterred by the risk of criminal punishment lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>control in the requisite sense. The criminal law is ill-equipped to deal with such an offender. First, it cannot act until he commits a new offense\u2014which he must be expected to do, precisely because he is predisposed to offend and cannot be deterred. It cannot operate preventively; it is triggered only after he has imposed the costs of a new violent sexual offense on a new victim and on society. Second, it can act only through incarceration. As long as the offender is incarcerated, he is unlikely to seek or to receive treatment. Then, when he is released, the cycle of waiting for him to commit a new offense must start all over again. The civil law, by contrast, can operate prospectively and preventively. Moreover, a civil committee has an incentive to seek treatment, and the committing authorities have an incentive\u2014indeed, an obligation\u2014to provide it. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6606, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Certainly a person who does not want to rape, feels remorse after raping, yet continues to rape anyway, \u201clacks control.\u201d But a person who <em>does </em>want to rape, feels <em>no </em>remorse after raping, and continues to rape despite having been criminally punished for prior rapes, <em>also </em>\u201clacks control.\u201d This is so because neither offender is likely to be deterred by the risk of criminal punishment; thus, both should be dealt with civilly.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Defendant\u2019s proposed distinction between these two types of offenders poses certain practical problems. It depends almost entirely on expert witnesses\u2019 opinions regarding the offender\u2019s expressed subjective feelings. Thus, it is peculiarly subject to manipulation and mistake. It can be reduced to a philosophical debate about free will: Is an offender who expresses no remorse acting out of his own free will, whereas one who does express remorse is acting out of compulsion? (And what does this even mean, given that the mental disorder causing the compulsion is a part of the offender, not some outside force?) Or are both offenders acting out of their own free will, with the only real difference being in their subsequent feelings about their acts? An expert\u2019s testimony that there is (or is not) a distinction between these two types of offenders is likely to be dictated, not by the expert\u2019s evaluation of the particular offender in light of his or her education, training, and experience, but by his or her preexisting position on this philosophical issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">In <em>Crane, </em>the Supreme Court held that the federal Constitution does not require an <em>absolute </em>lack of control precisely because this distinction is so difficult to draw: \u201c[A]n absolutist approach is unworkable. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 411 [122 S.Ct. at p. 870].) The court quoted psychological authority stating that \u201c ' \u201c[t]he line between an irresistible impulse and an impulse not resisted is probably no sharper than that between twilight and dusk[.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting American Psychiatric Association, Statement on the Insanity Defense (1982) 11, reprinted in Melton et <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>al., Psychological Evaluations for the Courts (2d ed. 1997) 200.) It added: \u201c[M]ost severely ill people\u2014even those commonly termed \u2018psychopaths\u2019\u2014 retain some ability to control their behavior. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Crane, supra, </em>at p. 412 [122 S.Ct. at p. 870.)</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The court also declined to decide whether civil confinement based solely on an \u201cemotional\u201d impairment, with no \u201cvolitional\u201d impairment, would be constitutional. <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 415 [122 S.Ct. at p. 872].) It commented, however, that: \u201c . . . <em>Hendricks . </em>. . did not draw a clear distinction between the purely \u2018emotional\u2019 sexually related mental abnormality and the \u2018volitional.\u2019 Here, as in other areas of psychiatry, there may be \u2018considerable overlap between a . . . defective understanding or appreciation and . . . [an] ability to control. . . behavior.\u2019 [Citation.] Nor, when considering civil commitment, have we ordinarily distinguished for constitutional purposes among volitional, emotional, and cognitive impairments. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid. </em>[122 S.Ct. at pp. 871-872], quoting American Psychiatric Association Statement on the Insanity Defense (1983) 140 Am. J. Psychiatry 681, 685.) This strongly suggests that, in the court\u2019s view, an offender who chooses to reoffend because, emotionally or cognitively, he has a \u201cdefective understanding or appreciation\u201d of the consequences also \u201clacks control\u201d in the requisite sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Finally, the court stated: \u201c[0]ur cases suggest that civil commitment of dangerous sexual offenders will normally involve individuals who find it particularly difficult to control their behavior\u2014in the general sense described above. Cf. <em>Seling </em>v. <em>Young, </em>531 U.S. 250, 256 [121 S.Ct. 727, 731, 148 L.Ed.2d 734] (2001). . . .\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 414 [122 S.Ct. at p. 871].) In the cited portion of <em>Seling v. Young, </em>the court described the defendant there as follows: \u201c. . . Young suffered from a severe personality disorder not otherwise specified with primarily paranoid and antisocial features, and a severe paraphilia, which would be classified as either paraphilia sexual sadism or paraphilia not otherwise specified (rape). [Citation.] In the state expert\u2019s opinion, severe paraphilia constituted a mental abnormality under the Act. The State\u2019s expert concluded that Young\u2019s condition, in combination with the personality disorder, the span of time during which Young committed his crimes, his recidivism, his persistent denial, and his lack of empathy or remorse, made it more likely than not that he would commit further sexually violent acts. . . . The jury unanimously concluded that Young was a sexually violent predator.\u201d <em>(Seling v. Young, supra, </em>531 U.S. at p. 256 [121 S.Ct. at p. 731].) We can only conclude that the Supreme Court believed an offender can lack control even if he has an antisocial personality disorder and lacks remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Defendant also argues that an antisocial personality disorder is not a \u201cmental disorder\u201d within the meaning of the Act. He points out that, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>the Act was originally introduced, it required a sexually violent predator to have either a \u201cmental abnormality\u201d or a \u201cpersonality disorder.\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 888 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 3, as introduced Feb. 25, 1995.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It defined \u201cmental abnormality\u201d essentially the same way as the Act now defines \u201cmental disorder\u201d; it did not define \u201cpersonality disorder.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Senate then amended the Act so as to change \u201cmental abnormality\u201d to \u201cmental disorder\u201d and to delete \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d entirely. (Sen. Amend. to Assem. Bill No. 888 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 3, July 17, 1995.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">This particular amendment, however, was viewed as merely a \u201ctechnical and clarifying change[]. . . .\u201d (Assem. Floor Analysis, Concurrence in Sen. Amends, to Assem. Bill No. 888 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 12, 1995, p. 5.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It seems most likely that it was intended to eliminate the anomaly that \u201cmental abnormality\u201d was defined but \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d was not. Thus, it was not intended to prevent a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d from qualifying as a \u201cmental disorder\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Defendant also argues that, if an antisocial personality disorder qualifies as a \u201cmental disorder,\u201d the Act permits bootstrapping. His concern is that a defendant\u2019s prior sexual offenses may be the only basis for an expert\u2019s opinion that he has an antisocial personality disorder; this opinion, in turn, may be the only basis for the expert\u2019s further opinion that he lacks control. Defendant relies on Justice Werdegar\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Hubbart </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1138, in which she expressed a similar concern. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1179-1181.) She concluded, however, that the case then before the court did not present any such issue. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1181.) It therefore suffices to note that this case, likewise, does not involve any such arguably unconstitutional bootstrapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">We turn, then, to the evidence in this case. While defendant was awaiting trial for the rape of C.L., he attempted to rape an unnamed victim. Thereafter, while awaiting sentencing for the rape of C.L., he committed the rape of S.M. While in prison, he persistently committed prison rule violations. One of these, possession of a weapon, also drew him an additional three-year sentence. Each time he was released on parole, he violated parole and was returned to prison; one of these parole violations was a new sexual offense. Even without expert testimony, this was substantial evidence of lack of control. Expert testimony, however, was still necessary to establish that defendant\u2019s lack of control was due to a diagnosed mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>Dr. Kania testified on direct that defendant had both an antisocial personality disorder and a paraphilia involving rape. An antisocial personality disorder causes a pattern of illegal or antisocial behavior, including \u201csexual misconduct,\u201d and this pattern is \u201centrenched,\u201d i.e., highly resistant to change. He added that defendant\u2019s particular pattern of forcible rapes was \u201cwell[-]entrenched,\u201d having begun when he was age 10 or 11 and continued at least until he was 30 or 31. Defendant\u2019s history of breaking laws and rules\u2014even when charged with a crime, in prison, or on parole\u2014was also part of this pattern. Finally, Dr. Kania testified that another psychologist had previously diagnosed defendant as having an antisocial personality disorder, noting that he had \u201cimpulse problems, difficulty in stopping himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">According to her testimony on direct, Dr. Miccio-Fonseca likewise diagnosed defendant as having an antisocial personality disorder and a paraphilia involving rape. She testified that defendant \u201cwould\u201d engage in sexually violent behavior if released. She also testified that a rapist with defendant\u2019s history will reoffend within five years. Her opinion, like Dr. Kama\u2019s, was based, in part, on defendant\u2019s antisocial personality disorder; his history of sexual offenses, beginning when he was a juvenile; and his probation and parole violations. She believed defendant did not appreciate the seriousness of rape or the impact that rape had had on his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Defendant would argue that this evidence showed only \u201cdangerousness,\u201d i.e., a likelihood of reoffending, and therefore it failed to show the independent element of \u201clack of control.\u201d We do not agree, however, that these elements are entirely independent. Admittedly, in <em>Hendricks, </em>the Supreme Court stated: \u201cA finding of dangerousness, standing alone, is ordinarily not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntary commitment.\u201d <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 358 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2080].) It added, however:.\u201cWe have sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor, such as a \u2018mental illness\u2019 or \u2018mental abnormality.\u2019 [Citations.] These added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond their control.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, either \u201cdangerousness\u201d alone, or a \u201cmental abnormality\u201d alone, is insufficient to prove lack of control. The trier of fact, however, may infer the necessary lack of control from proof of both a \u201cmental abnormality\u201d and \u201cdangerousness,\u201d plus proof of a causal link between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">We conclude that, considering only the evidence the People presented on direct examination, there was sufficient evidence that defendant had a mental illness which made him unlikely to be deterred by the threat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>criminal punishment, and hence likely to reoffend. This amounted to sufficient evidence of lack of control. We therefore need not, and do not, consider defendant\u2019s alternative contention that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by eliciting the only evidence of lack of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">\u201cProsecutorial\u201d Misconduct in Closing Argument<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">McKinster, Acting P.
