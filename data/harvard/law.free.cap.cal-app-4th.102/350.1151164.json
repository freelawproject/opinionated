Fleishman (petitioner), an attorney for Sunterra Corporation (hereafter Sunterra), seeks extraordinary writ review of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>court\u2019s order denying his motion for judgment on the pleadings in a malicious prosecution action filed against him. Chester Salisbury (Salisbury), a former Sunterra employee, alleges that petitioner maliciously prosecuted an earlier action (hereafter Sunterra\u2019s action) against him. In that action, the trial court granted Sunterra\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction. Petitioner contends that the issuance of the preliminary injunction conclusively establishes that Sunterra\u2019s entire action was brought with probable cause. We agree and order the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Petitioner filed the Sunterra action in July 1999. The complaint alleged as follows: Salisbury was employed by Sunterra to sell time-share interests in the San Luis Bay Inn (hereafter the Inn). In April 1999 Sunterra terminated his employment. Salisbury thereafter \u201csolicited owners of timeshare interests [in] the . . . Inn ... to sell their timeshare interests using [Salisbury] as broker[] and salesperson[] in the transaction.\u201d He induced Craig and Anne Swanson (hereafter the Swansons) to terminate a contract with Sunterra for the purchase of a time-share interest in the Inn. In addition, Salisbury misappropriated Sunterra\u2019s trade secrets, falsely advertised that he was affiliated with the Inn, and conducted his brokerage activities under unlicensed fictitious business names.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The Sunterra complaint contained six causes of action: (1) intentional interference with Sunterra\u2019s contractual relationship with the Swansons; (2) unfair competition; (3) false advertising; (4) conducting real estate brokerage activities under unlicensed fictitious business names (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, \u00a7 2731); (5) misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3426 et seq.); (6) common law misappropriation of trade secrets. Sunterra sought damages under the first and sixth causes of action, injunctive relief under the second, third, and fourth causes of action, and both damages and injunctive relief under the fifth cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The trial court granted Sunterra\u2019s application for a temporary restraining order. It subsequently issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Salisbury from: (1) destroying documents memorializing Sunterra\u2019s trade secrets; (2) disclosing or using Sunterra\u2019s trade secrets; (3) \u201csoliciting any customers of [Sunterra] whose identities or product preferences became known to Salisbury during his employment with [Sunterra];\u201d (4) making false or misleading statements concerning his affiliation with Sunterra, the Inn, or his provision of real estate sales services; and (5) \u201cconducting real estate sales and brokerage activities under [fictitious] business names without possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of a real estate license for such fictitious business names, unless working under a licensed broker[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In November 2000 Sunterra voluntarily dismissed its action without prejudice. In November 2001 Salisbury filed the within malicious prosecution action against petitioner. The complaint consisted of a single cause of action. The trial court overruled petitioner\u2019s demurrer and denied his motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u201cA motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.

Proc., \u00a7 425.16). In <em>Wilson </em>our Supreme Court held: \u201c[A] trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to strike under section 425.16, on the ground that the plaintiff has established the requisite probability of success, establishes probable cause to bring the action, and precludes the maintenance of a subsequent malicious prosecution action, unless the prior ruling is shown to have been obtained by fraud or perjury.\u201d <em>(Wilson, </em>at p. 820.) The court reasoned: \u201cThe rights of litigants and attorneys to bring nonfrivolous civil actions, \u2018 \u201ceven if it is extremely unlikely that they will win\u201d \u2019 [citation], would be unduly burdened were they exposed to tort liability for malicious prosecution for actions that had been found potentially meritorious under section 425.16.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>On the other hand, \u201cdenial of the motion solely on technical or procedural grounds, . . . rather than because the plaintiff has shown a probability of success, would say nothing about the action\u2019s potential merit and would not establish probable cause.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 823-824.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">To defeat an anti-SLAPP motion by establishing a probability of success on the merits, \u201cthe plaintiff \u2018must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 821.) \u201cA claim that is legally sufficient and can be substantiated by competent evidence is . . . one that a \u2018reasonable attorney would have thought . . . tenable.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">If the denial of an anti-SLAPP motion based on the action\u2019s potential merit conclusively establishes probable cause for the action, the issuance of a preliminary injunction must have the same effect. \u201c \u2018 \u201cTo issue an injunction is the exercise of a delicate power, requiring great caution and sound discretion, and rarely, if ever, should [it] be exercised in a doubtful case. . . .\u2019\u201d [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ancora-Citronelle Corp. v. Green </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 148 [115 Cal.Rptr. 879].)  \u201cIn deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction, a trial court must evaluate two interrelated factors: (i) the likelihood that the party seeking the injunction will ultimately prevail on the merits of his claim, and (ii) the balance of harm presented, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the comparative consequences of the issuance and nonissuance of the injunction.

The plaintiff bears the burden of presenting facts establishing the requisite reasonable probability: \u201c[T]he drastic remedy of an injunction pendente lite may not be permitted except upon a sufficient factual showing, by someone having knowledge thereof, made under oath or by declaration under penalty of perjury.\u201d <em>(Ancora-Citronelle Corp. v.

Superior Court </em>(1979) 26 Cal.3d 60, 66 [160 Cal.Rptr. 745, 603 P.2d 1341].) The court evaluates the credibility of witnesses and makes factual findings on disputed evidence. <em>(People v. Landlords Professional Services, Inc. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 68, 71 [223 Cal.Rptr. 483].) A less strict standard applies to an anti-SLAPP motion.  In considering such a motion, the trial court \u201cdoes not <em>weigh </em>the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence . . . .\u201d <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 821.) Nor does it \u201cdecide disputed questions of fact. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 822.) An anti-SLAPP motion must be denied \u201cif the plaintiff presents evidence establishing a prima facie case which, if believed by the trier of fact, will result in a judgment for the plaintiff. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Mattel, Inc. v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1188 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 794].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Salisbury contends that the issuance of a preliminary injunction conclusively establishes probable cause only if the trial court has conducted \u201ca full and fair evidentiary hearing on the merits.\u201d Along with his return to the alternative writ of mandate, Salisbury submitted a declaration under penalty of perjury alleging that \u201cno real hearing took place\u201d because the trial court erroneously precluded him from presenting evidence at the hearing. Salisbury claims that the basis for the court\u2019s preclusion ruling was that he \u201chad not filed a responsive pleading or opposition within the specified time period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201c \u2018A judgment or order of the lower court is <em>presumed correct. </em>All intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and error must be affirmatively shown.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Denham v. Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193].) There is no reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing on the preliminary injunction, and the minutes show that no reporter was present. On this silent record, we must presume that the trial court conducted the hearing in a procedurally correct manner. Furthermore, Salisbury\u2019s own declaration discloses that he was given the opportunity for a \u201cfoil and fair evidentiary hearing on the merits.\u201d That he did not timely file a responsive pleading or opposition is attributable solely to himself. We must also presume that the trial court did not issue the preliminary injunction because of Salisbury\u2019s procedural default. Sunterra was required to \u201cdemonstrate a reasonable probability of success on the merits.\u201d <em>(Tyler v. County of Alameda </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 777, 783 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In any event, for our purposes it is inconsequential whether the trial court committed procedural error at the hearing on the preliminary injunction. The trial court credited the verified complaint and a declaration by an officer of Sunterra that substantiated legally cognizable claims. Pursuant to our Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Wilson, </em>this prima facie showing was <em>alone </em>sufficient to establish probable cause irrespective of whether Salisbury was erroneously precluded from presenting evidence to the contrary: \u201cA litigant or attorney who possesses competent evidence to substantiate a legally cognizable claim for relief does not act tortiously by bringing the claim, even if also aware of evidence that will weigh against the claim. Plaintiffs and their attorneys are not required, on penalty of tort liability, to attempt to predict how a trier of fact will weigh the competing evidence, or to abandon their claim if they think it likely the evidence will ultimately weigh against them. They have the right to bring a claim they think unlikely to succeed, so long as it is arguably meritorious. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wilson, </em>supra, 28 Cal.4th a p. 822, fn. omitted.) \u201cIndeed, a plaintiff or his or her attorney may <em>not </em>be aware, when initiating the action, of evidence in the defendant\u2019s possession that weighs against the claim. Considering the plaintiffs prima facie case alone is appropriate for this reason as well, for probable cause to bring an action depends on the facts known to the litigant or attorney at the time the action is brought. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 822, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">No evidence has been presented that the trial court\u2019s ruling was obtained by fraud or peijury. The issuance of the preliminary injunction was based upon \u201ca hearing on the merits\u201d and not \u201csolely on technical or procedural grounds.\u201d <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 823.) Its issuance, therefore, conclusively establishes probable cause for bringing the underlying causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\n<em>To Preclude a Claim of Malicious Prosecution, the Preliminary Injunction Must Reasonably Relate to All Causes of Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u201cTo preclude a later claim of malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must have probable cause for each cause of action it alleges against a defendant. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Videotape Plus, Inc. v. Lyons </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 156, 161 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 1]; accord, <em>Crowley v. Katleman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 671 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 881 P.2d 1083]; <em>Bertero </em>v. <em>National General Corp. </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 43, 57, fn. 5 [118 Cal.Rptr. 184, 529 P.2d 608, 65 A.L.R.3d 878].) Consequently, if the issuance of the preliminary injunction establishes probable cause for some but not all of Sunterra\u2019s six causes of action, the trial court properly denied petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. We hold that where, as here, all causes of action are reasonably related to the preliminary injunction, the granting of injunctive relief conclusively establishes that each cause of action was brought with probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Salisbury contends that the preliminary injunction was unrelated to the first, fifth, and sixth causes of action. His contention is clearly without merit as to the fifth and sixth causes of action, which sought damages and injunctive relief for statutory and common law misappropriation of trade secrets. The preliminary injunction prohibited Salisbury from destroying documents memorializing Sunterra\u2019s trade secrets and from disclosing or using its trade secrets. The trial court would not have prohibited these actions unless it had concluded that there was a reasonable probability Sunterra would prevail on the merits on the causes of action for misappropriation of trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The first cause of action, intentional interference with a contractual relationship, presents a closer question. It alleged that the Swansons and Sunterra had entered into a written contract whereby the Swansons agreed to purchase a timeshare interest in the Inn. Salisbury induced the Swansons to terminate the contract by offering to resell them a time-share interest in the Inn at a much lower price. This cause of action sought only damages, and the preliminary injunction did not prohibit Salisbury from intentionally interfering with Sunterra\u2019s contractual relationships. It prohibited him from soliciting Sunterra\u2019s customers \u201cwhose identities or product preferences became known to [him] during his employment with [Sunterra].\u201d No evidence was presented that Salisbury had obtained information about the Swansons while so employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">But the first cause of action must not be viewed in a vacuum. The preliminary injunction was reasonably related to the first cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>because it sought to prevent sales activities engaged in by Salisbury during the Swansons transaction. For example, the injunction prohibited Salisbury from using Sunterra\u2019s \u201ctrade secrets or confidential and proprietary information.\u201d The verified complaint alleged that this information included \u201c[d]e-tails as to the types of timeshare interests sold to [Sunterra\u2019s] customers; [f] [Sunterra\u2019s] strategies and plans as to the pricing of timeshare interests . . . ; [*|[] [and] [d]etails of the techniques used in the sale of Sunterra\u2019s timeshare interests[.]\u201d The complaint could have been drafted with more precision. It could have expressly alleged that Salisbury had used this confidential information to his advantage in the transaction with the Swan-sons. The complaint did allege that Salisbury had used the information \u201cin the course of competing with [Sunterra],\u201d giving him \u201ca substantial competitive advantage to which [he was] not entitled.\u201d The fair import of this allegation is that Salisbury did use confidential information in the Swanson transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Thus, all causes of action were reasonably related to the preliminary injunction. All arose out of Salisbury\u2019s brokerage activities concerning the resale of timeshare interests in the Inn, and these activities involved conduct prohibited by the preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the issuance of the preliminary injunction conclusively establishes that Sunterra\u2019s entire action was brought with probable cause. Since the absence of probable cause is an element of a malicious prosecution action, the trial court erred in denying petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"AD0\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent court to vacate its order denying petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and to enter a new and different order granting the motion. Costs in this proceeding are awarded to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Gilbert, P. J., and Coffee, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 18, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The rule makes it clear that events subsequent to a hearing on the merits are inapposite. Here Salisbury has lodged the Swansons\u2019 depositions taken after the injunction issued to show that the first cause of action was without factual basis. This is an attempt to impeach the injunction. Such information should have been timely presented to the trial court before the injunction issued. (See <em>People v. Superior Court </em>(Lavli) (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1164, 1173-1174, fn. 5 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 815, 847 P.2d 1031].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
