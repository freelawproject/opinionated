Appellant assigns error to that determination, arguing that the state failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that she was unable to provide for her basic personal needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Appellant has not requested <em>de novo </em>review, and we decline to review the facts in this case under that standard. ORS 19.415(3)(b); <em>see also State v. B. B., </em>240 Or App 75, 77 n 2, 245 P3d 697 (2010) (adhering to \u201c \u2018presumption against the exercise of discretion\u2019 to engage in <em>de novo </em>review\u201d without request and justification to do so (quoting ORAP 5.40(8)(c))). Therefore, we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if there is any evidence to support them and review the court\u2019s legal conclusions for legal error. <em>Id. </em>at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">A discussion of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. The trial court appears to have based its determination that appellant was unable to provide for her basic personal needs on a medical examiner\u2019s conclusion that appellant lacked \u201cskills to handle homelessness\u201d and access to financial resources, which made appellant\u2019s future plans to care for herself \u201cnot very realistic.\u201d However, even drawing all inferences consistently with the trial court\u2019s findings, the evidence in this case is legally insufficient to support a finding that appellant\u2019s mental disorder created a serious and \u201cnonspeculative threat to [appellant\u2019s] near-term survival.\u201d <em>See State v. D. M., </em>245 Or App 466, 473, 263 P3d 1086 (2011) (stating principle); <em>see also State v. A. M. M., </em>236 Or App 598, 604, 238 P3d 407 (2010) (\u201cAlthough it seems plausible that [the] appellant will not have housing services available on release, * * * homelessness is not adequate justification for involuntary commitment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
