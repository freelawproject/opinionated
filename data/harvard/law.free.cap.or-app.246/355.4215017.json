The date of injury determines the applicable rate of compensation that claimant receives for permanent partial disability (PPD) under ORS 656.214. ORS 656.202(2). We conclude that the board did not err and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">For his entire adult life, claimant\u2019s work has involved physical labor and strain on the knees. In 1987 and 1988, while working for a Washington employer, claimant underwent arthroscopic surgeries on his left and right knees, respectively. The surgeries revealed multiple loose cartilaginous bodies and degenerative changes in both knees. Claimant did not seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits for those surgeries.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In 2000, claimant began working for SAIF\u2019s insured, loading and unloading furniture and appliances. In 2002, claimant consulted his primary care physician about various problems, including knee stiffness in the morning. Claimant\u2019s knee pain continued, and in August 2005, he saw Dr. Blackstone, who took x-rays that revealed bilateral advanced degenerative joint disease. On October 3, 2005, claimant saw Dr. Slattery, an orthopedic surgeon, who recommended bilateral total knee replacement. Claimant filed a claim for a bilateral knee condition on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">SAIF denied the claim, but in December 2007, the board set aside SAIF\u2019s denial after determining under the last injurious exposure rule that, as opined by Dr. Bowman, an orthopedic surgeon, \u201cclaimant\u2019s lifetime of employment conditions was the major contributing cause of his claimed bilateral knee condition.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s order, adopted by the board, stated that Bowman \u201cexplained that although claimant\u2019s history was consistent with his initial osteoarthritis being idiopathic, his work activity accelerated the osteoarthritic changes to the point that work became the major contributing cause of his current condition.\u201d Bowman identified claimant\u2019s current condition as \u201cend-stage osteoarthritis.\u201d Based on Bowman\u2019s opinion, the ALJ found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201c[claimant\u2019s occupational exposure was the major contributing cause of his bilateral condition diagnosed as osteoarthritis.\u201d The board, in affirming the ALJ, found that claimant had established the compensability of his bilateral knee condition and ordered that SAIF\u2019s denial be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Thereafter, SAIF accepted a claim for \u201cbilateral knee osteoarthritis,\u201d with a \u201cdate of injury\u201d of October 3, 2005, which was the date that the claim had been filed. On October 22, 2008, SAIF issued a notice closing the claim, stating a \u201cdate of injury\u201d of August 1, 2000, but calculating claimant\u2019s benefits for PPD based on a \u201cdate of injury\u201d of February 29, 1988.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Claimant requested reconsideration, contending that the correct date of injury was October 3, 2005, when claimant first sought treatment with Slattery and filed his claim for benefits. The Appellate Review Unit agreed with claimant that October 3, 2005, was the appropriate date of injury and calculated claimant\u2019s PPD award accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">SAIF requested a hearing, contending that the date of injury stated in the notice of closure was correct under ORS 656.202(2), because the occupational disease for which claimant received compensation was first treated in 1987 and 1988. SAIF asserted, and continues to assert, that claimant has only one condition \u2014 knee osteoarthritis \u2014 and that its \u201cend stage\u201d is not a separate condition but is simply a more advanced stage of the same condition. Thus, in SAIF\u2019s view, it is not appropriate to treat the end stage of claimant\u2019s condition as separate from the entire osteoarthritis. Accordingly, SAIF contends that in determining the date of injury for purpose of ORS 656.202(2), one must simply refer to when claimant first sought treatment or became disabled as a result of his knee osteoarthritis, and that clearly occurred by 1988, when claimant underwent his second knee surgery. The ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>agreed with SAIF and reinstated the notice of closure, determining that, under <em>Reynoldson v. Multnomah County, </em>189 Or App 327, 75 P3d 477, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 192 (2003), the proper date of injury was the date that claimant had first sought treatment for his bilateral osteoarthritic knee condition, February 29,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">On appeal to the board, the parties agreed that <em>Reynoldson </em>controls and that the \u201cdate of injury\u201d is the date of disability from the disease or the date of the first medical treatment, whichever is earlier. <em>See </em>189 Or App at 332. They also agreed that the \u201cdate of injury\u201d determines the PPD rate for claimant\u2019s bilateral knee condition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Claimant continued to assert that October 3, 2005, was the date of injury, and SAIF continued to assert that the proper date was February 29,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In reversing the ALJ\u2019s order and holding that the correct date of injury was October 3, 2005, the board emphasized that, under ORS 656.202(2) and <em>Reynoldson, </em>the rate of PPD is to be determined by the laws \u201cin force at the time that <em>the injury giving rise to the right to compensation </em>occurs.\u201d The board quoted Reynoldson\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]n occupational disease cases, the injury to which the statute refers is <em>the occupational disease for which compensation is sought.\u201d </em>189 Or App at 331 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The board then proceeded to \u201cdetermine the occupational disease that forms the basis for claimant\u2019s PPD award.\u201d The board explained that Bowman, on whose opinion the board had relied, had concluded that, although claimant\u2019s work activities throughout his lifetime had contributed to the osteoarthritic condition, claimant\u2019s condition did not become <em>compensable </em>\u2014 i.e., the work did not become its major contributing cause \u2014 until his work exposure with SAIF\u2019s insured from 2000 to 2005, during which time his knee osteoarthritis advanced to \u201cend-stage.\u201d Thus, as the board interpreted Bowman\u2019s opinion, it was not until after claimant began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>working for SAIF\u2019s insured that the work exposure of claimant\u2019s entire work experience gave rise to an occupational disease, \u201cend-stage osteoarthritis.\u201d Accordingly, the board determined that the \u201cdate of injury\u201d was October 3,2005, the date when claimant had filed his claim and first sought treatment for his osteoarthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">SAIF contends on review that the board has unlawfully \u201credetermined the compensable condition different from what was found compensable,\u201d disregarding the preclusive effect of its previous order, and has disregarded this court\u2019s decision in <em>Reynoldson. </em>We address first SAIF\u2019s contention that the board is precluded from characterizing claimant\u2019s compensable occupational disease as \u201cend-stage osteoarthritis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">SAIF contends that issue preclusion applies, citing <em>Drews v. EBI Companies, </em>310 Or 134, 795 P2d 531 (1989), and its rule that, when an issue has been formerly adjudicated between two parties and the determination was essential to the final decision reached, future litigation on the issue is precluded. 310 Or at 139-40. In SAIF\u2019s view, claimant has but one condition, osteoarthritis, and the description of claimant\u2019s condition in the December 2007 board order as \u201cbilateral knee osteoarthritis\u201d actually determined a litigated issue \u2014 that claimant\u2019s compensable occupational disease was the entire osteoarthritis condition, not just the \u201cend-stage\u201d portion. SAIF asserts that the board now errs in redefining the nature of the occupational disease and thereby limiting it to a condition that is more specific than the condition initially found to be compensable. Further, SAIF contends, the notice of acceptance also described claimant\u2019s condition as bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and claimant did not challenge the notice of acceptance, as he could have, under ORS 656.262(2). Thus, SAIF contends, claimant\u2019s <em>entire </em>condition must be compensated, and the board was precluded from subsequently redefining claimant\u2019s condition as something less than the <em>entire </em>osteoarthritis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>There are two flaws in SAIF\u2019s reasoning. First, SAIF misunderstands the board\u2019s order. The board did not attempt to distinguish claimant\u2019s \u201cend-stage\u201d osteoarthritis as a separate condition from the bilateral osteoarthritis or to redefine the condition. The board simply clarified that, based on Bowman\u2019s opinion, claimant\u2019s bilateral osteoarthritis did not become <em>compensable </em>\u2014 i.e., the work did not become its major contributing cause \u2014 until during claimant\u2019s employment with SAIF\u2019s insured, when the condition advanced to \u201cend-stage.\u201d Thus, the board characterized the compensable condition as \u201cend-stage osteoarthritis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Furthermore, up until the date SAIF issued its notice of closure, the parties had been in agreement that the date of injury was October 3, 2005. On its denial form, SAIF had listed the date of injury as October 3, 2005, and that was also the date of injury stated in the ALJ\u2019s order of March 3, 2007, and the board\u2019s order of December 4, 2007. SAIF\u2019s notice of acceptance also listed a date of injury of October 3, 2005. There was no reason for claimant to believe that there was any dispute as to the date of injury; thus, there was no reason for claimant to argue for a more particularized characterization of the osteoarthritic condition. It was not until the notice of closure, which identified the date of injury as August 1, 2000, that the date of injury \u2014 and, hence, the precise characterization of claimant\u2019s bilateral osteoarthritis\u2014 became disputed. Those issues were not actually litigated in the earlier hearing. We conclude that the board was not precluded by its 2007 order from clarifying in 2010 that claimant\u2019s condition did not become compensable until it was \u201cend-stage.\u201d The board then declined to assign to the claim a date of injury for purposes of PPD in 1988, some 17 years before the condition had developed into a compensable occupational disease for which claimant sought treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">On the merits of the board\u2019s order, SAIF next contends that the order clashes with this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Reynoldson, </em>a case in which we addressed the determination of the date of injury under ORS 656.202(2) in the context of an occupational disease claim. Because of its centrality to the resolution of this case, we examine <em>Reynoldson </em>in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>In <em>Reynoldson, </em>the claimant was employed by the same employer for 25 years. Thirteen years after his employment ended, he filed a claim for hearing loss. The employer accepted the claim and paid the claimant benefits based on the PPD rate that had been in effect when the claimant left his employment in 1987. The claimant requested a hearing, seeking to have his benefits for PPD calculated based on the rates in effect in 2000, when he first sought treatment for his hearing loss. The ALJ and the board upheld the notice of closure. 189 Or App at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">On the claimant\u2019s petition for judicial review, we reversed the board. We explained, quoting from <em>Papen v. Willamina Lumber Co., </em>123 Or App 249, 254, 859 P2d 1166 (1993), that under ORS 656.202(2), \u201c[t]he date of injury in an occupational disease case is either the date of disability or the date when medical treatment is first sought.\u201d <em>Reynoldson, </em>189 Or App at 329-30. We explained, further, that \u201c[i]n occupational disease cases, the injury to which the statute refers is <em>the occupational disease for which compensation is sought.\u201d Id. </em>at 331 (emphasis added). We rejected the employer\u2019s contention that the date of injury was the date of the last disease-causing exposure, stating that ORS 656.202(2) \u201cnecessarily refers to the point at which the <em>diseases </em>occur[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). In explaining why it makes sense to interpret the statute to require that the \u201cdate of injury\u201d be the date of disability or first medical treatment, rather than the date of last exposure, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\u201cThe level of compensation that the legislature sets for compensable injuries is intended to address the needs of employees when they become injured and disabled. As in this case, occupational diseases can have long latency periods. Claimant was last exposed to noise at work in 1987, but he apparently did not suffer any noticeable effect from that exposure until he sought treatment for his hearing loss in 2000. That means that, to the extent that claimant suffers disability from his hearing loss, he first suffered that disability in 2000. An interpretation of the statute that makes the date of disability the date of injury means that claimant will be compensated for his disability at the rate that applied when he suffered the disability rather than at the rate that applied 13 years before he suffered it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>In SAIF\u2019s view, under <em>Reynoldson, </em>claimant\u2019s \u201cdate of injur/\u2019 is the date he first sought treatment for his osteoarthritis, in 1987 or 1988. In claimant\u2019s view, because the board determined, based on Bowman\u2019s opinion, that claimant\u2019s osteoarthritis did not become a compensable occupational disease until it was \u201cend-stage,\u201d the \u201cdate of injur/\u2019 is the date he became disabled or first sought treatment for what constituted a compensable condition, which the board found was October 3, 2005. <em>Reynoldson </em>supports claimant\u2019s view and the board\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In <em>Reynoldson, </em>we emphasized that, in the occupational disease context, the \u201cinjur/\u2019 to which ORS 656.202(2) refers is \u201cthe occupational disease for which compensation is sought\u201d and \u201cnecessarily refers to the point at which the <em>diseases </em>occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331 (emphasis in original). Here, the board has determined, based on the medical evidence, that claimant\u2019s osteoarthritis did not become a compensable occupational disease until it was \u201cend-stage,\u201d during claimant\u2019s employment with SAIF\u2019s insured. Under <em>Reynoldson, </em>claimant\u2019s PPD benefits should be calculated based on a date of injury as of the time claimant had an occupational disease\u2014 when claimant\u2019s work was the major contributing cause of the condition. It would make no sense, as SAIF asserts, to calculate claimant\u2019s PPD benefits based on prevailing rates of compensation close to two decades before he had a compensable occupational disease in light of the legislature\u2019s intent to provide a level of workers\u2019 compensation benefits that addresses \u201cthe needs of employees when they become injured and disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332. The board did not err in concluding that the date of injury occurred in 2005, when claimant both had an occupational disease and sought treatment for it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\"> SAIF acknowledges that the \u201cdate of injury\u201d of August 1, 2000, listed at the top of the notice of closure did not bear any relationship to claimant\u2019s injury, but rather was the earliest date that its computer system would accept. SAIF asserts, however, that the actual date of injury is February 29,1988, when claimant had his second knee surgery and, thus, had a condition in both knees. We note that \u201cwork disability\u201d benefits under ORS 656.214 are available only to workers injured on or after January 1, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\"> ORS 656.202(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, payment of benefits for injuries or deaths under this chapter shall be continued as authorized, and in the amounts provided for, by the law in force at the time the injury giving rise to the right to compensation occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-6\"> We note the irony of SAIF\u2019s contention that claimant\u2019s <em>entire </em>condition must be \u201ccompensated,\u201d when the practical effect of the argument is a dramatic reduction in claimant\u2019s benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\"> We decline to consider SAIF\u2019s argument, made for the first time on judicial review, that if this court agrees with the board that claimant\u2019s injury did not occur in 1988, then the correct date of injury is in August 2005, when claimant saw Blaekstone, rather than October 3, 2005, when he consulted Slattery, as found by the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
