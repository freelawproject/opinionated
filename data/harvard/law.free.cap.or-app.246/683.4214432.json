Defendant argues that because contempt is not a crime, <em>see State v. Reynolds, </em>239 Or App 313, 243 P3d 496 (2010), the trial court erred, initially, in denying his motion to dismiss the charging instrument and, later, in convicting him of a misdemeanor. The state, for its part, concedes that contempt is not a crime but argues that the appropriate remedy was not dismissal of the indictment but rather \u201centry of a judgment that does not characterize contempt of court as a criminal conviction.\u201d We agree with the state\u2019s concession and its proposed disposition. <em>See id. </em>at 316 (reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction for contempt and remanding \u201cfor entry of a judgment in that case finding defendant in contempt of court\u201d); <em>see also </em>ORS 33.065(5) (contempt proceeding for punitive sanctions may be initiated by a charging instrument \u201csubject to the same requirements and laws applicable to an accusatory instrument in a criminal proceeding, and all proceedings on the accusatory instrument shall be in the manner prescribed for criminal proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment finding defendant in contempt of court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
