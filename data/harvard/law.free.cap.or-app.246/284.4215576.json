As explained below, because the juvenile court appears to have relied, at least in part, on facts not fairly encompassed within the grounds for jurisdiction in reaching its conclusion under ORS 419B.476 that a change in plan was warranted, we reverse and remand.

Therefore, we are bound by the juvenile court\u2019s findings of historical fact as long as there is evidence to support them, and we review the court\u2019s rulings for legal error. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 442, 236 P3d 791 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We briefly summarize the court\u2019s findings from its letter opinion. In November 2009, the three children \u2014 F, R, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>and T \u2014 were removed from mother\u2019s home after T sustained bruises on his face and bottom.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the time, T was one year old, R was three, and F was six. Based on that incident, DHS filed a petition in December 2009 for jurisdiction over all three children. Mother ultimately admitted that \u201cthe child, [T,] presented with unexplained physical injuries deemed by medical professionals to have been non-accidental.\u201d Father was incarcerated at the time, with an earliest release date of June 2017; he admitted that his incarceration makes him unavailable to assume care and custody of F. Based on those admitted facts, the court ordered that each of the children was within the jurisdiction of the court because each \u201cward\u2019s conditions, behavior and circumstances are such as to endanger his/her own welfare or the welfare of others.\u201d The jurisdictional judgments were entered on January 12, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The permanency hearing that resulted in the judgment that is the subject of this appeal took place approximately one year later, on January 4 and 5, 2011; at that hearing, the court considered mother\u2019s motion to terminate foster care placement and DHS\u2019s request for implementation of the concurrent plan of adoption for the children. At the time of the permanency hearing, R and T were placed together in foster care; F was in a separate placement because of her sexual aggression.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Focusing on the two issues under the statutory framework of ORS 419B.476(2)(a) \u2014 applicable when, as in this case, the case plan at the time of the hearing is to reunify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the family \u2014 the juvenile court concluded that (1) DHS had made reasonable efforts toward reunification but (2) mother had not made sufficient progress to enable the children\u2019s safe return.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court agreed with mother that, under the statutory scheme, it was required to consider both DHS\u2019s efforts and mother\u2019s progress \u201cin relationship to the allegation for the need for dependency in the [jurisdictional] petition.\u201d However, the court disagreed with mother\u2019s suggestion that jurisdiction in the case was limited to \u201cnon-accidental injuries.\u201d The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">\u201cThe basis for dependency in this case is mother\u2019s allowance of the abuse of [T] who had severe bruising on his face and his bottom. These bruises demonstrated impressions of adult sized fingers. As one or both caregivers (either [mother] or [mother\u2019s boyfriend]) behaved in an impulsive fashion, all three children were at risk in an unsafe environment. The risk to the children was the impulsivity of the adults with which they lived and the unsafe environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201c* * * Impulsivity could just as easily result in accidental injury, neglect, or intentionally inflicted injuries such as those previously exacted upon [F], The jurisdiction of DHS and this court was based on the unsafe environment demonstrated by a non-accidental injury but was not limited only to non-accidental injuries. <em>The limitation on jurisdiction is the limitation of unsafe and detrimental conduct of a parent which necessarily impacted the best interests of the children.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Proceeding within that framework, the court found, with regard to the first <em>issue </em>\u2014 viz., reasonable efforts by DHS \u2014 that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">\u201cDHS made a myriad of services available to [mother]. Those services included but were not limited to family counseling, assistance in finding and treating with a psychiatrist, personal coaching for household cleanliness, personal coaching with regard to her own behavior, supervision and guidance during parenting time, and parental coaching.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The court concluded that the evidence thus demonstrated that \u201creasonable efforts were made to give [mother] every opportunity to succeed\u201d and that \u201cthe efforts of DHS aimed at making the home safe and modifying or mitigating [mother\u2019s] lapses in judgment were reasonable and appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Regarding the second issue, the court found that mother was cooperative with DHS, attended all of her hearings, participated in case planning, psychological evaluations, and supervised visitation, \u201cactively engaged in Intensive Family Services\u201d for up to six hours each week, and successfully completed therapeutic drug court and drug treatment. Nonetheless, the court found that she \u201cshowed little progress in her ability to protect her children, in her knowledge of care-giving responsibilities, and in her execution of the mundane and day-to-day tasks associated with parenting.\u201d The court found that mother\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201chygiene and parenting skills improved for a brief period of time, however, the unanimous testimony of all counselors, trainers, psychologists, and other social service professionals was that <em>her progress in hygiene, parenting skills, and her overall judgment was minimal </em>and the prognosis was not good for return of the children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The court noted that, despite one-on-one guidance with housekeeping, mother\u2019s home was \u201cconsistently filthy.\u201d The court also found that mother had \u201ccontinued to exercise extremely poor judgment and decision making,\u201d stating that she had \u201cunnecessarily quit her job\u201d; the court also pointed to an incident in November 2010 in which mother allowed a homeless family to occupy her apartment and, while they were there, a \u201cdrunken brawl\u201d broke out in and around her home when children were present. Noting that the police had been called to mother\u2019s residence for at least eight other incidents, the court found that the November incident \u201csimply illustrates the likelihood\u201d that mother\u2019s \u201cpattern of poor judgment and neglect\u201d continues. Further, the court credited the opinion of Dr. Basham, a psychologist who evaluated mother; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>in the court\u2019s view, Basham \u201cdemonstrated that [mother] suffers from the combined effects of a paranoid personality disorder and a dependent personality disorder * * * [t]he combined effects of [which] are an enduring pattern of behavior that deviates markedly from her parental responsibilities\u201d and for which the prospects for mitigation were \u201cnot good and would require years of therapy.\u201d Based on those findings, the court concluded that mother \u201cha[d] not made meaningful progress toward the goals of creating a safe and secure home for her children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Accordingly, the court denied mother\u2019s motion to return the children, granted the state\u2019s motion to change the plan to adoption, and entered a permanency judgment implementing the concurrent plan of adoption for all three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On appeal of that judgment, mother argues that the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion that it was authorized to change the permanency plans based on any \u201cunsafe and detrimental conduct of a parent which necessarily impacted the best interests of the children\u201d is erroneous under <em>Dept. of Human Services v. G. E., </em>243 Or App 471, 260 P3d 516, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>246 Or App 136, 265 P3d 53 (2011).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In mother\u2019s view, that error requires us to reverse and remand for the juvenile court to determine whether DHS\u2019s efforts \u201cat assisting mother in ameliorating <em>the single jurisdictional basis </em>were reasonable and, if so, whether mother\u2019s progress toward ameliorating <em>that basis </em>was sufficient.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The state advances two arguments in response: first, that <em>G. E. </em>is inapposite, and, second, that, even assuming G. <em>E. </em>applies in this case, reversal is not required because mother had \u201cactual notice from DHS as to what she needed to do to address her parental deficiencies.\u201d As explained below, we agree with mother that the trial court\u2019s reasoning was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>flawed under <em>G. E., </em>and we reverse and remand for that reason. However, we disagree that the scope of the court\u2019s inquiry on remand is as narrow as mother contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We begin with a discussion of the applicable legal framework, starting with the statutory provisions governing jurisdiction. The stated policies underlying dependency jurisdiction in Oregon include \u201csafeguarding] and promoting] each child\u2019s right to safety, stability and well-being,\u201d ORS 419B.090(3); \u201cguarding] the liberty interest of parents protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,\u201d ORS 419B.090(4); and, other than in cases of extreme conduct under ORS 419B.502, \u201coffering] appropriate reunification services to parents and guardians to allow them the opportunity to adjust their circumstances, conduct or conditions to make it possible for the child to safely return home within a reasonable time,\u201d ORS 419B.090(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The specific bases for dependency jurisdiction are set out in ORS 419B.100(1); as relevant here, the court has exclusive original jurisdiction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">\u201cin any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">\u201c(b) Whose behavior is such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">\u201c(c) Whose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">\u201c(e) Whose parents or any other person or persons having custody of the person have:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">\u201c(C) Subjected the person to cruelty, depravity or unexplained physical injury[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">We pause to note that, in this case, the court appears to have asserted jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100(l)(b) and (c) \u2014 that the children\u2019s conditions, circumstances, and behavior are such as to endanger their welfare or the welfare of others \u2014 and not on the basis of \u201cunexplained physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>injury\u201d under ORS 419B.100(l)(e)(C). However, the latter, that is, mother\u2019s admission that there had been an unexplained (yet nonaccidental) physical injury to one of the children, was the specific \u201cfact\u201d that the court relied on to establish jurisdiction under the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Under ORS 419B.809(4)(b), a petition alleging jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100 \u201cmust set forth in ordinary and concise language\u201d \u201cthe facts that bring the child within the jurisdiction of the court, including sufficient information to put the parties on notice of the issues in the proceeding.\u201d The court\u2019s task is to determine whether the facts, if proved or admitted, would be sufficient to establish jurisdiction under ORS 419B.100. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. D. D., </em>238 Or App 134, 139, 241 P3d 1177 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 602 (2011); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Froats, </em>117 Or App 467, 470-71, 844 P2d 917 (1992). The court may direct that the petition be amended at any time on the motion of an interested party or on its own motion. ORS 419B.809(6). \u201cIf the amendment results in a substantial departure from the facts originally alleged, the court shall grant such continuance as the interests of justice may require.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, petitions \u201cmust be liberally construed with a view of substantial justice between the parties,\u201d ORS 419B.857(1), and the court must disregard an error or defect in a petition \u201cthat does not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party,\u201d ORS 419B.857(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We turn next to the permanency process. Generally, a juvenile court must conduct a permanency hearing within 12 months after a child is found within the court\u2019s jurisdiction or within 14 months after the child is placed in substitute care, whichever is earlier. ORS 419B.470(2). When the case plan for the child at the time of the hearing is, as in this case, to reunify the family, the court must, among other requirements,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u201cdetermine whether the Department of Human Services has made reasonable efforts * * * to make it possible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ward to safely return home and whether the parent has made sufficient progress to make it possible for the ward to safely return home. In making its determination, the court shall consider the ward\u2019s health and safety the paramount concerns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">ORS 419B.476(2)(a). As we explained in <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. K. D., </em>228 Or App 506, 515, 209 P3d 810 (2009), \u201c[t]hat assessment is made on the basis of the case plan in effect at the time of the permanency hearing and the particular issues of parental unfitness alleged in the dependency petition.\u201d Specifically, DHS\u2019s \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement is \u201cbased on the circumstances existing during the period prior to the permanency hearing and that period must be sufficient in length to afford a good opportunity to assess parental progress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Parental progress is measured in terms of the parent\u2019s efforts \u201ctoward remedying the barrier to reunification <em>* * * </em>identified in the dependency petition and the applicable case plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In <em>K. D., </em>the basis for jurisdiction was the mother\u2019s allowance of continued association between the child and his father, a convicted sex offender who had not completed treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 509. Following a second permanency hearing, the juvenile court ordered implementation of the concurrent plan of adoption, finding that there was \u201c \u2018no reasonable possibility\u2019 of reunification\u201d and that moving to adoption was in the best interest of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 513. On appeal, we reversed, concluding that the mother\u2019s efforts \u2014 including divorcing the father and not allowing any interaction between the child and the father in one and one-half years\u2014 demonstrated sufficient progress toward amelioration of the only barrier to reunification identified in the dependency petition and that continuing efforts toward reunification were therefore required. <em>Id. </em>at 515-16. Thus, we made clear in <em>K. D. </em>that a parent\u2019s progress under ORS 419B.476(2)(a) must be assessed in relation to the facts of the jurisdictional petition. We also suggested, but did not decide, that parental deficits <em>fairly implied </em>by the jurisdictional allegations and identified in the case plan may properly be considered in the analysis. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cEven assuming that implicit deficiencies in mother\u2019s parental qualities are identified in the dependency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>petition by the sex offender association allegation, mother also had made sufficient progress with respect to other aspects of the initial case plan.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">That takes us to <em>G. E., </em>which was decided after the trial court entered the judgment at issue in this case. In <em>G. E., </em>the mother appealed a judgment denying her motion to dismiss jurisdiction and wardship over her daughter and establishing adoption as the permanency plan. 243 Or App at 473. She argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the juvenile court had erred in denying her motion to dismiss because it based its decision on different factual circumstances from those identified in the jurisdictional judgment, which circumstances, she contended, had been ameliorated. <em>Id. </em>at 478. We agreed with the mother\u2019s arguments, to a point, noting, first, that it is \u201caxiomatic that a juvenile court may not continue a wardship based on facts that have never been alleged in a jurisdictional petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479. Explaining, however, that \u201c Tacts\u2019 come in many levels of specificity,\u201d we rejected the view, implicit in the \u201chighly specific\u201d approach advanced by the mother, that \u201cthe court\u2019s authority to assert jurisdiction is based on specific facts and <em>not on the conditions or characteristics that those facts demonstrate or </em>exemplify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). On the other hand, we also rejected the very general approach advanced by the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201cSome of the statutory \u2018factual\u2019 grounds for the assertion of jurisdiction \u2014 a child\u2019s \u2018condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others,\u2019 ORS 419B.100(l)(c), for example \u2014 are so elastic or formless that the department could start the process based on one set of events or conditions (for example, the child is in a home with multiple fire hazards) and ultimately litigate the case based on entirely unrelated ones (parent associates with drug dealers), thereby depriving the parent of constitutionally adequate notice as to what, exactly, he or she is supposed to be doing in order to terminate the authority of the state to act as the child\u2019s surrogate parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Confronting that dilemma, we concluded, referencing ORS 419B.857, <em>see </em>246 Or App at 293, that the appropriate distinction is whether the difference between the facts on which the court bases continuing jurisdiction and those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>embodied in the jurisdictional judgment \u201caffect the substantial rights of the parent.\u201d <em>G. E., </em>243 Or App at 481 (internal quotation marks omitted). That question, we held, is to be determined according to the following principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">\u201cThe proven facts depart from the petition so as to substantially affect a parent\u2019s rights if a reasonable parent would not have had notice from the petition or the jurisdictional judgment as to what he or she must do in order to prevent the state from assuming or continuing jurisdiction over the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Applying those principles to the circumstances in <em>G. E., </em>we concluded that some of the facts on which the trial court had based its permanency judgment were so \u201cdifferent in kind\u201d from those relied on in the jurisdictional judgment that the mother would not have had notice that failure to address them could lead to continued jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 483. Among other things, the jurisdictional judgment recited an incident in which the child was present and in the line of fire when a person with whom the mother and child were living threatened people with a shotgun. <em>Id. </em>at 482. It also alleged that the home where they were living was \u201cbelow minimum community standards\u201d and that the mother had a history of substance abuse and had agreed to participate in treatment. <em>Id. </em>In denying the mother\u2019s motion to dismiss and establishing adoption as the permanency plan, the court found that the mother had not made sufficient progress toward providing a safe home for the child \u2014 citing, for example, the mother\u2019s failure to properly secure a child seat, failure to prevent the child from getting too close to stairs or into garbage or the litter box, and conduct of allowing the child to attend school with wet diapers, a diaper rash, and no shoes \u2014 and that she had not addressed her \u201c \u2018mental health problems that caused her to neglect her child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482-83. We held that the original jurisdictional judgment fairly \u201cshould have alerted mother that she needed to find safe housing where dangerous people did not live or visit and that was not below community standards of sanitation, and that she needed to participate in recommended substance abuse treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482. The judgment would not, however, have alerted her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the \u201cnewly specified safety concerns\u201d upon which the permanency judgment was, at least partially, based. <em>Id. </em>at 483 (\u201cIn the original judgment, mother was faulted for recklessly exposing [the child] to deadly weapons; here, mother is faulted for inattention.\u201d). Moreover, on reconsideration, we concluded that the only remaining ground for jurisdiction\u2014 that is, the mother\u2019s substance abuse problem \u2014 no longer existed. Thus, we reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment dismissing jurisdiction. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. G. E., </em>246 Or App 136, 265 P3d 53 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Turning back to the present case, mother argues that, similarly to the mother in <em>G. E., </em>she \u201ccould not have inferred from the adjudicated basis for jurisdiction that her \u2018personality disorder\u2019 or her ability to maintain a chaos-free home that satisfies community standards of cleanliness would support ongoing jurisdiction, much less support a change in the children\u2019s permanency plans.\u201d As a result, mother contends, the case must be reversed and remanded for application of the \u201cproper test.\u201d Before analyzing that question, however, we first must dispose of the state\u2019s argument that G. <em>E. </em>is inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The state contends that G. <em>E. </em>is inapposite because it involved a motion to dismiss jurisdiction rather than, as in this case, a permanency decision under ORS 419B.476(2)(a). In the state\u2019s view, because the court is required to \u201cconsider the ward\u2019s health and safety the paramount concerns\u201d in making its determination whether it is possible for the child to return home under that statute, \u201cthe juvenile court is not limited solely to the facts relied upon in the jurisdictional judgment.\u201d (Emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.) We are not persuaded. The state does not explain why the latter necessarily follows from the former. Moreover, the state\u2019s contention that the reasoning of G. <em>E. </em>does not apply in the context of a permanency judgment is illogical in any event \u2014 if the facts have been determined to be insufficient to support continued jurisdiction, the court lacks authority to act, let alone to decide that adoption is an appropriate plan for a child. Moreover, <em>K. D., </em>228 Or App at 515-16, discussed in detail above, essentially forecloses the notion that a permanency judgment is not circumscribed by the jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>judgment. Finally, the state\u2019s concern that the juvenile court \u201ccannot simply ignore\u201d serious parental deficiencies (such as mental health issues) that are apparent at the time of the permanency hearing, but that were not the basis for jurisdiction, misses the point of <em>G. E. G. E. </em>does not require the court to ignore such deficiencies; rather, it envisions amendment of the jurisdictional petition in those circumstances. 243 Or App at 481 (when the substantial rights of a parent are affected by a change in \u201cfacts,\u201d \u201cthe court must direct that the petition be amended and grant such continuance as the interests of justice may require\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We proceed, then, to the question raised by mother\u2019s argument: What is the scope of the jurisdictional basis established in this case and did the juvenile court exceed it in rendering its permanency decision? Again, the sole fact on which the jurisdictional judgment relied was mother\u2019s admission that \u201cthe child, [T,] presented with unexplained physical injuries deemed by medical professionals to have been non-accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">As an initial matter, we agree with mother that the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion that the jurisdictional basis properly encompassed any \u201cunsafe and detrimental conduct of a parent which necessarily impacted the best interests of the children\u201d is erroneous under <em>G. E. </em>As in <em>G. E., </em>such a \u201cformless\u201d standard would allow DHS to continually shift the goalpost during a dependency proceeding, \u201cthereby depriving the parent of constitutionally adequate notice as to what, exactly, he or she is supposed to be doing in order to terminate the authority of the state to act as the child\u2019s surrogate parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We disagree, however, with mother\u2019s contention that, under the reasoning of G. <em>E., </em>she was only on notice \u201cthat she needed to participate in services to prevent any future non-accidental injury to her children\u201d and, therefore, that the court\u2019s assessment of the services provided and her progress was similarly confined. First, mother\u2019s argument would preclude consideration of \u201cconditions or characteristics\u201d that the specific facts described in the jurisdictional petition or judgment \u201cdemonstrate or exemplify,\u201d a result that we rejected in G. <em>E., id. </em>at 479-80. We concluded that such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>approach would pose \u201cinsurmountable practical difficulties\u201d; in <em>G. E., </em>for example, we pointed out that acceptance of that view would require dismissal (or amendment) of jurisdiction if \u201cthe shotgun-wielding person had been evicted, [but] had been replaced by a different shotgun-wielding person or by a wanted violent felon,\u201d or, if the mother had moved, but \u201cnow lives down the block with armed methamphetamine cooks,\u201d a result the legislature could not have intended. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Moreover, without any explanation of the potential causes for the nonaccidental injury that precipitated jurisdiction, mother\u2019s assertion that she was only fairly warned that she needed to participate in services to \u201cprevent future non-accidental injury\u2019 is essentially without content. Mother acknowledged the problem at oral argument, asserting that \u201cunexplained injury\u2019 is a unique allegation that generally <em>requires </em>the petition to be amended after DHS investigates and determines whether there is a condition of the parent that placed the child at risk for such an injury. That is so, in mother\u2019s view, because the allegation is so broad and because it is not tied, in any coherent way, to a condition of the parent at the time of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We disagree. In G. <em>E., </em>as noted, we concluded that \u201c[s]ome of the statutory \u2018factual\u2019 grounds for the assertion of jurisdiction,\u201d in particular, ORS 419B.100(l)(c) (condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the child), are \u201cso elastic or formless\u201d that they are insufficient to provide a parent with constitutionally adequate notice as to what he or she needs to do to eliminate the need for jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 480. We do not consider the circumstances of this case to be analogous. First, among the \u201cstatutory \u2018factual\u2019 grounds\u201d for jurisdiction, that the child was subjected to \u201cunexplained physical injury\u2019 is unique in that it is, by its very nature, incapable of further precision. An unexplained injury is just <em>that </em>\u2014 unexplained. Notwithstanding that imprecision, however, the legislature has seen fit to establish it as an independent and sufficient basis for jurisdiction. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>this case, moreover, we have additional content: mother\u2019s admission that the unexplained injury was deemed to be nonaccidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Based on those considerations, we conclude that, in this context \u2014 that is, where the jurisdictional judgment is based on an unexplained, nonaccidental injury \u2014 the basis for jurisdiction includes those \u201cconditions or characteristics\u201d potentially demonstrated by the specific facts alleged. In other words, it properly encompasses those conditions or characteristics that could have caused the nonaccidental injury. <em>See id. </em>at 479. That universe is admittedly broad- \u2014 it may, for example, point to physical abuse, substance abuse, mental health issues, domestic violence, failure to protect, or other conditions. The universe, however, will narrow as DHS identifies possible explanations for the injury and develops a case plan based on that knowledge. <em>See K. D., </em>228 Or App at 516 (a parent\u2019s progress is assessed with reference to the \u201cbarrier to reunification * * * identified in the dependency petition and the applicable case plan\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">However, if the parental condition or characteristic is <em>not </em>one that fairly can be implied from the facts found in the jurisdictional judgment, then it is outside the scope of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and that deficit cannot be remedied by claims of \u201cactual notice\u201d through case plans or, as the state suggests in this case, letters of expectation. That is so because, as we held in <em>G.E., </em>a petition or jurisdictional judgment must provide a parent with reasonable notice of the deficiencies that he or she must address in order to prevent continued jurisdiction; if it does not, it affects a \u201csubstantial right\u201d of the <em>parent </em>\u2014 viz., the right to constitutionally adequate notice \u2014 and the petition or judgment must be amended before the court can rely on such \u201cextrinsic facts\u201d in its permanency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The juvenile court here determined that its jurisdiction encompassed any \u201cunsafe and detrimental conduct\u201d that affected the best interests of the children and based its permanency decision on concerns about mother\u2019s hygiene, parenting skills, and overall poor judgment. The court also relied on mother\u2019s mental health problems, which, the court found, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>affected her ability to carry out her \u201cparental responsibilities.\u201d Although the latter characteristics and conditions\u2014 poor judgment and mental health <em>problems </em>\u2014 may conceivably be implicated in an allegation of unexplained, nonaccidental injury, concerns about hygiene and general parenting skills are not. Thus, although mother was on notice from the jurisdictional judgment that she needed to address any condition that <em>could have caused the risk of nonaccidental injury </em>to her children, such conditions would not, in any event, include general parenting skills or poor housekeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Because the court\u2019s analysis that DHS had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family and that mother\u2019s progress toward that goal was insufficient was based, at least in part, on an erroneous understanding of the scope of the jurisdictional judgment, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> In the juvenile court, there was a separate case number for each child, and a separate judgment was entered in each of those cases. However, the judgments are identical and include all three children; therefore, we consider them as a single judgment on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\"> The father of the other two children, R and T, did not appear below and is not a party to this appeal. For convenience, when we refer to \u201cparents\u201d in this opinion, we mean mother and the father of F.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\"> That statutory provision is set out below. <em>See </em>246 Or App at 293-94.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\"> As an alternative argument, mother contends that the court erred under ORS 419B.498(2)(b)(B) in failing to determine whether each child was adoptable and, if any child was not, to determine whether another plan was better suited to maintaining sibling relationships. Father advances the alternative argument that the court erred in finding that the change in plan was in F\u2019s best interests given mother\u2019s progress and F\u2019s \u201cquestionable adoptability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\"> The family\u2019s history with DHS antedates that time. As the trial court related in its letter opinion, DHS removed F and R from mother\u2019s home in April 2008, and the children were placed in foster care as the result of mother\u2019s neglect. At the time, mother was \u201cin the midst of her addiction and treatment\u201d for an ongoing drug and alcohol habit. F was later moved to a separate foster home after initiating some sexual contact with R. T was born in November 2008 and remained with mother. In February 2009, F and R were returned to mother, but all three children were then removed one month later when mother, in violation of the safety agreement with DHS then in place, allowed the father of R and T \u2014 an untreated sex offender who had engaged in inappropriate sexual activity with F \u2014 to resume living with the family. In May 2009, mother ended that relationship, and the children were returned to her. Jurisdiction was terminated in October 2009 with regard to F and R and in December 2009 for T. Mother also has another child, J, who lives with his maternal grandmother and is not involved in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> As noted, during an earlier placement in 2008, F had initiated some sexual contact with R when the two were in foster care together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\"> The court also found that father had not made sufficient progress; that determination is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> Father, to some.extent, tracks mother\u2019s arguments; he also appears to argue, somewhat inconsistently, that, under the correct test, DHS\u2019s efforts were not reasonable because the evidence indicates that the services that DHS provided did not address the physical abuse allegations that formed the basis for jurisdiction, but that mother had made sufficient progress in the services that she received so that the children could be safely returned to her within a reasonable time and, thus, that the judgments should be reversed and remanded \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with returning the child to mother.\u201d We reject father\u2019s separate argument without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> For example, if the court determines that the permanency plan should be adoption, the court must determine whether one of the circumstances in ORS 419B.498(2) is applicable. ORS 419B.498(5)(d). ORS 419B.498(2), in turn, sets forth the circumstances that negate the requirement that DHS file a petition to terminate parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"> As noted, here, the juvenile court did not assert \u201cunexplained physical injury\u201d as the statutory basis for jurisdiction, <em>see </em>ORS 419B.100(l)(e)(C); rather, the unexplained (yet nonaccidental) injury was the fact supporting jurisdiction under other statutory bases, specifically, ORS419B.100(l)(b) and(c). For purposes of our analysis here, that distinction makes no difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
