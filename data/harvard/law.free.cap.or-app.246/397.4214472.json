J.</author>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Defendant, who was convicted of first-degree theft and attempted first-degree theft, argues that the trial court erred in imposing restitution. The judgment of conviction was entered on December 15, 2008, a judgment imposing $851.15 in restitution was entered on February 3, 2009, and ultimately, the court determined the proper amount of restitution to be imposed \u2014 $2,570.13\u2014on August 31, 2009, and later entered an amended judgment to that effect. Defendant asserts that the court erred in determing that there was \u201cgood cause\u201d to impose restitution beyond the 90-day time-line established by ORS 137.106(l)(b). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The procedural facts are somewhat complicated, but we recount them in detail in order to demonstrate how the trial court ultimately reached the correct conclusion here regarding good cause. On December 15, 2008, defendant pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and the court indicated that restitution would be imposed. A judgment was entered on that date indicating that restitution was to be determined pursuant to ORS 137.106. On January 21, 2009, the state moved for an amended judgment awarding restitution to the victim in the amount of $851.15. The trial court entered a restitution judgment awarding that amount on February 3, 2009. On February 13, 2009, defense counsel filed a motion requesting a restitution hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court scheduled the hearing for April 13,2009, but defense counsel moved to postpone the hearing until May 11, 2009, due to a scheduling conflict. On May 11, 2009, the prosecutor moved to postpone the hearing \u201cfor the reason that more time is needed by the parties to reach an agreement regarding the amount of restitution.\u201d Defendant did not object to that motion, which the court granted. On July 3 and again on July 20, the hearing was postponed at the request of defense counsel, once due to scheduling conflicts and once because \u201cadditional time is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>needed for further investigation.\u201d On July 21, the state filed a motion for an amended restitution judgment, seeking a greater amount than originally sought, stating that it reflected <em>\u201ca </em>change in the amount of restitution based on additional information recently provided to the state.\u201d On August 14, 2009, defendant filed a motion to withdraw his request for a hearing, implicitly acknowledging that the $851.15 restitution ordered in the February 3 judgment was proper. The court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The court scheduled the hearing for August 24, 2009, and defense counsel requested an additional set-over due to defendant being ill. The hearing finally was held on August 31, 2009, at which point the court determined $2,570.13 to be the correct amount of restitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">At the hearing, the prosecutor explained that, after the initial restitution judgment was entered, the victim had contacted the district attorney\u2019s office and explained that $851.15 was \u201cnot the right amount,\u201d and that he kept trying to convey that information until \u201cat least mid-spring\u201d and tried to offer supplemental information on the proper amount. The prosecutor explained that both she and defense counsel had initially believed that the victim had recovered some of the stolen goods, but the victim later communicated-that the goods were not returned or were not usable. The prosecutor further indicated that the victim had conveyed this information to the state\u2019s restitution specialist who had been assigned to the case but that the restitution specialist had become terminally ill with a brain tumor, and, by April 2009, \u201cshe was making errors\u201d and \u201cshe was not getting everything done.\u201d The trial court found that the restitution specialist\u2019s impairment of health constituted \u201cgood cause\u201d for the state\u2019s delay in seeking the increased amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On appeal, defendant asserts that the delay in concluding these restitution proceedings was not for \u201cgood cause,\u201d arguing that, at the time the state made its initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>request for $851.15 in restitution, the state\u2019s restitution specialist \u201cwas not evidently suffering any obvious effects from her brain tumor.\u201d He goes on to assert that, by the time the restitution specialist\u2019s illness became apparent, it was April and \u201cthe [90-day] deadline had passed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Defendant asserts that the restitution specialist\u2019s illness here was equivalent to the situation in <em>State v. Biscotti, </em>219 Or App 296, 298, 182 P3d 269 (2008), in which the prosecutor who was handling the case \u201cleft the office, the case did not get placed in the \u2018pile of pending matters,\u2019 and ended up being ignored.\u201d Defendant misunderstands <em>Biscotti.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In <em>Biscotti, </em>no restitution request was filed until approximately four months after the judgment of conviction was entered, and the state acknowledged that that was because, due to personnel issues, the case had been \u201cignored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298. There, we noted that \u201cgood cause\u201d does <em>\u201cnot </em>include prosecutorial inadvertence or neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 (emphasis added). We concluded that \u201cthe only cause for the delay in this case was the state\u2019s carelessness.\u201d Id at 304. <em>See also State v. Murrell, </em>242 Or App 178, 255 P3d 574 (2011) (where prosecutor left the office after trial and case was ignored until the ninetieth day after the entry of judgment of conviction, no \u201cgood cause\u201d was shown for delayed entry of a judgment imposing restitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">This case stands in stark contrast to <em>Biscotti </em>and <em>Murrell. </em>Here, at no point was the case neglected by the prosecutor\u2019s office. The initial motion for entry of a restitution judgment was filed a month after the entry of judgment (and, in fact, as noted above, restitution was actually awarded in under two months). After that, defendant raised an issue concerning the amount of restitution by filing a motion requesting a hearing, and, as noted above, the court initially scheduled a hearing for April, which was later postponed at defendant\u2019s request. Defendant insists that, because the hearing was scheduled for April, outside of the 90-day period, there was no \u201cgood cause\u201d in this case. We disagree with defendant\u2019s assertion that the illness of the restitution specialist is akin to prosecutorial neglect or carelessness. The record supports an inference that, although the problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>with the restitution specialist\u2019s work did not become apparent to the prosecutor\u2019s office until April, she was, in fact, having difficulties caused by her condition before that time, as shown by the victim\u2019s failed attempts to explain to her that the amount of restitution originally requested (and the court subsequently awarded) was incorrect. Given those circumstances, we agree with the trial court that the delay in determining the proper amount of restitution in this case was for \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Finally, we note that the vast majority of the delay that occurred after April was either requested by or consented to by defendant <em>(e.g., </em>the prosecutor\u2019s unopposed request for a continuance while the parties attempted to reach an agreement as to the restitution amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In sum, resolving the restitution issues in this case took longer than usual. However, this is not a case of prosecutorial neglect. At every point after the entry of the judgment of conviction, the restitution issue was being actively litigated by both parties. The 90-day timeline established by ORS 137.106(l)(b) does not establish a bright-line rule that negates the possibility of a restitution determination more than 90 days after judgment is entered. Rather, as we recognized in <em>Biscotti, </em>the 2003 amendments to ORS 137.106 altered the statute from a general provision requiring that the court order \u201cprompt payment\u201d of restitution \u201cwhenever possible,\u201d to a firm requirement that the court impose restitution in the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages and do so within a specific time, unless \u201cgood cause\u201d was shown to extend that timeline. <em>Biscotti, </em>219 Or App at 300-01. Given the legislature\u2019s apparent intent to provide crime victims with a timely remedy, we reject defendant\u2019s suggestion that we should interpret \u201cgood cause\u201d in such a narrow manner as to undermine the legislative goals and provide the victim here with less than what he is entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\"> Although it is not clear from the record, it appears that the trial court treated defendant\u2019s motion as a motion to amend the February 3 judgment, <em>see </em>ORS 138.083, and to hold a hearing to determine the proper amount of restitution. The parties do not argue that the existence of that judgment is pertinent to the issue presented here, and we express no opinion as to that.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\"> The second amended judgment imposing restitution was not entered until October 5,2009. The focus, however, is on when the restitution was \u201cdetermined by the court,\u201d ORS 137.106(l)(b), and defendant acknowledges that that was done at the restitution hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
