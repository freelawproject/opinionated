J.</author>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Defendant, who entered a conditional plea of guilty, ORS 135.335(3), for possession of a controlled substance (marijuana), ORS 475.864, appeals the resulting judgment. He assigns error to the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of his residence pursuant to a warrant. Defendant contends, specifically, that essential averments of the affidavit on which the warrant was predicated were \u201cstale\u201d and, thus, the affidavit did not establish probable cause. As amplified below, we conclude, consistently with the standard of review prescribed and amplified in <em>State v. Castilleja, </em>345 Or 255, 264-66, 192 P3d 1283, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>345 Or 473, 198 P3d 937 (2008), that the magistrate did not err in issuing the search warrant. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The facts material to our review are undisputed. On February 8, 2008, members of the Jackson County Narcotics Enforcement Team (JACNET) executed a warrant to search defendant\u2019s residence in Ashland and discovered evidence of marijuana cultivation, including four growing marijuana plants and two grow lights, as well as various implements. The warrant was, in turn, based on an application, including an affidavit by Jackson County Sheriffs Detective Donald Adams, which Adams had written and submitted earlier that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In his affidavit, Adams recounted the following circumstances: On January 27, 2008,11 days before the search warrant issued and was executed, defendant\u2019s former companion, Ammann, had sent a \u201ccomputer generated complaint\u201d to JACNET about a \u201cpossible marijuana growing operation\u201d at defendant\u2019s residence. Ammann reported that she and defendant had two children, 11-year-old twins, E and M, who sometimes stayed at defendant\u2019s residence. According to Ammann, her son, E, had told her \u201cabout a month ago\u201d that he had seen marijuana plants and \u201cgrow lights\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a shed at defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>On January 31, responding to that complaint, Adams interviewed Ammann and both E and M. Ammann told Adams that she and defendant had lived together in the mid-1990s and that she had suspected during that time that defendant might be dealing marijuana because he used marijuana and he \u201cwould have several people over to the house for short periods of time.\u201d Although defendant always denied engaging in drug activity, while Ammann was pregnant with the twins, she found \u201ca large amount of marijuana and money in the residence.\u201d She broke off her relationship with defendant within a year of that discovery \u2014 somewhere between 11 and 12 years before the search at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">E told Adams that his younger half-brother had taken him to a shed at defendant\u2019s residence and inside he had seen \u201cat least three plants and a heat lamp.\u201d E, who was \u201cvery sure\u201d that the plants were marijuana plants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not describe the size or development of the plants he saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">M told Adams that she had not seen marijuana at defendant\u2019s house \u201cbut did know kind of what it smells like\u201d from having once smelled what her mother told her was marijuana smoke \u2014 and that \u201cshe has smelled [that] different [from cigarette smoke] smell\u201d at defendant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, M did not specify when that had occurred. M also told Adams that sometimes, \u201cwhile at [defendant\u2019s] house[,] some people will come in and go into [defendant\u2019s] bedroom with [defendant]\u201d and that \u201cthe people would sometimes be in there for a while, and at times * * * would come out in just a short period of time.\u201d M said that she would go into her father\u2019s bedroom \u201conly to brush her teeth\u201d and that, before she did so, \u201c[defendant] goes in first[,] shuts the door, and she can hear what sounds like glasses being put up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In the affidavit, Adams also recounted that he had confirmed with the Department of Human Services that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>defendant did not have a medical marijuana card and that a records check had disclosed that, in 2004, defendant had been arrested and charged with endangering the welfare of a child and possession of less than an ounce of marijuana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Finally, in the balance of his affidavit, Adams included averments based on his training and experience in drug-enforcement efforts. Many of those averments pertained to common practices by persons engaged in outdoor cultivation of marijuana at \u201cremote\u201d sites. For example, Adams stated that \u201can outdoor marijuana grow takes approximately three months\u201d and that \u201c[o]ften the marijuana seeds are germinated indoors, within the drug trafficker\u2019s residence or other buildings on the premises.\u201d Adams\u2019s affidavit did not include any information about the growing cycle of an indoor marijuana cultivation operation. In addition, Adams included more general averments pertaining to people who \u201csell and possess controlled substances,\u201d including that such persons \u201coften keep their controlled substances, [transactional] records and paraphernalia in[, <em>inter </em>alia,] their residences and in outbuildings.\u201d Adams stated that the execution of prior search warrants involving other persons had yielded not only marijuana plants and transactional records but also a variety of durable implements and equipment, including fans, timers, and myriad heating and lighting systems.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Adams\u2019s averments in that regard are similar to those typically made in connection with investigations of commercial controlled substance manufacture and distribution operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">As noted, based on Adams\u2019s affidavit, the court issued a search warrant on February 8, which was executed later the same day, yielding inculpatory evidence. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>was charged with, as pertinent here, possession of a controlled substance (marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Thereafter, he filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the warranted search, as well as derivative evidence. The gravamen of defendant\u2019s position, as expressed by his counsel during the hearing on the suppression motion, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201cIn this case, you have six weeks between the sighting of three marijuana plants and [the] search warrant affidavit. We\u2019re not talking about a large scale grow. The child [E] thinks it\u2019s three plants. There\u2019s nothing in the affidavit [that] would allow the magistrate to conclude that the evidence would still be there six weeks later. In fact * * * although there\u2019s something in the affidavit talking about the length of an outdoor grow cycle, this is an indoor situation, and there\u2019s nothing in [the] affidavit talking about the length of the indoor grow cycle. There\u2019s no information where in the cycle the plants were at the time of this reported sighting. So we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re huge and harvested, if they\u2019re tiny and moved; there is just not sufficient information * * * to let a magistrate conclude that they would still be there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u00ab\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u201c* * * [I]n the affidavit in this case, the detective is discussing commercial drug type offenses, and there\u2019s no evidence that that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with for [defendant]. It doesn\u2019t \u2014 it doesn\u2019t apply to him. There\u2019s stuff about people who possess large quantities of marijuana. Well there\u2019s nothing in the affidavit that would let the magistrate conclude that he possessed a large quantity of marijuana. There\u2019s information about drug trafficker[s]. There\u2019s nothing in the affidavit that would allow the magistrate to conclude that he\u2019s a drug trafficker. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201c* * * I don\u2019t think the State can say, we have three marijuana plants, therefore it\u2019s a commercial operation. And in commercial operations we expect to find all this [paraphernalia and equipment]. * * * [That is,] [i]f it was commercial, somehow that means that there\u2019s probable cause to believe these durable items are going to be there in [defendant\u2019s] situation. I just \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s there[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201cThe only durable item that was described in the affidavit was some sort of lamp[.] * * * [T]he only thing [in this case] that the Court could reasonably conclude would be there, would be \u2014 that\u2019s durable, would be this heat lamp, that might be there. And that, in and of itself, is not evidence of any crime[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Thus, in moving to suppress, defendant argued only that there was no probable cause to believe that <em>any </em>inculpatory evidence could still be found at defendant\u2019s residence, given the interval of roughly six weeks between E\u2019s observations (a month before Ammann\u2019s initial report on January 28) and the issuance and execution of the search warrant 11 days later on February 8. In that regard, defendant\u2019s sole argument regarding the grow light that E had seen was that that light \u201cin and of itself is not evidence of any crime.\u201d Defendant did not argue alternatively that, even if a magistrate could reasonably infer that the grow light that E saw at defendant\u2019s residence would still be there six weeks later, the lapse of time rendered it improbable that the marijuana plants would still be there \u2014 and thus, at least, even if there was probable cause to search for the former, the latter should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The trial court, after noting correctly that \u201cwe are to give deference to the search warrant process,\u201d rejected defendant\u2019s staleness argument. In doing so, the court referred to E\u2019s observation of the heat lamp and reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">\u201c[T]here was probable cause justifying the issuance of the search warrant. * * * I think that there is an issue on the growing; whether it\u2019s growing, whether it\u2019s going to be there a longer period of time. And that also that contrary to counsel\u2019s indication that grow lamps aren\u2019t evidence, I think they are evidence of manufacture. And I think that if you have an indoor grow, you figure there\u2019s going to be others there, that there\u2019s probably going to be some watering system, or something. There\u2019s going to be other things that are going to be evidence of this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201cSo, I think that the [magistrate] did[,] in fact, appropriately issue the search warrant based upon the affidavit that the information contained in there was not so stale that they would not expect to find evidence of the crime of marijuana at that location.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>On appeal, defendant reiterates his arguments in support of suppression. In assessing those arguments, we employ the standard of review prescribed in <em>Castillejo, </em>345 Or at 264-66. In <em>State v. Duarte/Knull-Dunagan, </em>237 Or App 13, 21-22, 238 P3d 411, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 370 (2010), we summarized that standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">\u201c[W]hen a defendant seeks to suppress evidence from a search authorized by warrant, contending that the information in the predicate warrant did not establish probable cause, the court\u2019s function is limited to determining whether, given the uncontroverted facts in the affidavit and reasonably derived inferences, the issuing magistrate reasonably \u2018could have concluded that the affidavit (excluding the excised parts) established probable cause to search * * *.\u2019 <em>[Castillejo, </em>345 Or] at 265. That is so regardless of whether the reviewing court \u2014 whether a trial court, this court, or the Supreme Court \u2014 might have drawn different inferences yielding a different determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201cFurther, in exercising that discrete review function, the court is to view the predicate affidavit in a \u2018commonsense, nontechnical and realistic fashion,\u2019 with \u2018doubtful cases * * * to be resolved by deferring to an issuing magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause.\u2019 <em>State v. Wilson, </em>178 Or App 163, 167, 35 P3d 1111 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). That deferential standard comports with \u2018the preference for warranted searches over those conducted without prior judicial authorization.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Applying that standard, we conclude that the issuing magistrate could reasonably infer that, notwithstanding the interval of six weeks, it was probable that some inculpatory evidence of unlawful marijuana cultivation \u2014 specifically, the heat lamp that E observed with the marijuana plants \u2014 could still be found at defendant\u2019s residence. Accordingly, the trial court correctly denied suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary is, as noted, predicated on notions of \u201cstaleness.\u201d In <em>State v. Young, </em>108 Or App 196, 204, 816 P2d 612 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 392 (1992), we summarized the essential principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">\u201cOf course, information is never stale; that phrase is a shorthand description of the analysis about whether or not the evidence sought will be there after the length of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>since the event described in the affidavit occurred. The purpose of the analysis is to determine whether, given the time between the event described and issuance of the warrant, there is a reasonable inference that the evidence will be where the affidavit suggests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In explaining and addressing whether the passage of time precludes probable cause, we have identified and applied a variety of considerations. <em>See generally State v. Kirkpatrick, </em>45 Or App 899, 903, 609 P2d 433, <em>rev den, </em>289 Or 337 (1980) (\u201cThe question of whether the lapse of time involved is too long to justify a finding of probable cause depends upon all the circumstances.\u201d). Specifically, we and the Supreme Court have considered the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">(1) the length of time (a factor that is addressed in all discussions of \u201cstaleness\u201d by Oregon courts);</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">(2) the \u201cperishability\u201d versus the durability of the putative item, <em>compare, e.g., State v. Henderson, </em>341 Or 219, 225, 142 P3d 58 (2006) (noting that two stolen diamond rings were \u201cnonperishable items of high value\u201d in rejecting staleness challenge), <em>with State v. Corpus-Ruiz, </em>127 Or App 666, 670, 874 P2d 90 (1994) (reversing denial of suppression based, in part, on determination that informant\u2019s statements pertaining to a heroin transaction six months earlier were impermissibly stale because \u201c[h]eroin is a substance that has a relatively long shelf life, but can be consumed in a short period of time and is easily moved\u201d);</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">(3) the mobility of the putative evidence, <em>see, e.g., Corpus-Ruiz, </em>127 Or App at 670; <em>State v. Bice, </em>115 Or App 482, 485-86, 839 P2d 244 (1992), <em>rev den, </em>315 Or 312 (1993) (reversing suppression of evidence of residential marijuana growing operation because detailed information about the operation was not rendered \u201cstale\u201d by the passage of two months, but noting that \u201c[t]he information was not about a quantity of marijuana that may be consumed or moved, but about a marijuana growing operation\u201d);</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">(4) the nonexplicitly inculpatory character of the putative evidence, <em>see, e.g., Kirkpatrick, </em>45 Or App at 902-03 (reversing allowance of suppression and rejecting staleness argument based on interval of at least one year between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>defendant\u2019s display of sexually explicit pictures to child complainants and the issuance of search warrant for those pictures, noting, in part, that \u201cthe photographs for which the warrant was issued were not illegal in themselves,\u201d supporting a reasonable inference that the defendant would have retained those photographs); <em>State v. Veley, </em>37 Or App 235, 238, 586 P2d 1130 (1978), <em>rev den, </em>285 Or 1 (1979) (reversing suppression of fruits of warranted search in a prosecution for contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor where the warrant issued approximately 90 days after the purported conduct; noting that condoms, which were one of the items identified in the warrant, \u201care not contraband, but rather articles the continued possession of which is not illegal or unlikely\u201d); and</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">(5) the propensity of an individual suspect or general class of offenders to maintain and retain possession of such evidence, <em>see, e.g., State v. Daniels, </em>234 Or App 533, 539-43, 228 P3d 695, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 171 (2010) (addressing sufficiency of affiant officer\u2019s \u201ctraining and experience\u201d-based averments regarding pedophiles\u2019 purported retention of sexually explicit material over a period of several years).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Applying those considerations here, as pertinent, we have no difficulty in concluding that Adams\u2019s affidavit, reviewed consistently with <em>Castilleja, </em>did not establish probable cause to search for marijuana, including growing marijuana plants, at defendant\u2019s residence. That is so for two related, but distinct, reasons. First, as to the three plants that E observed six weeks before the issuance of the warrant, Adams\u2019s affidavit provided no information as to the maturity of those plants, the typical indoor growth cycle for marijuana plants, or the projected yield from such plants, which, arguably, could pertain to the likelihood that harvested marijuana would still be in defendant\u2019s possession. <em>Compare, e.g., Young, </em>108 Or App at 198 (noting confidential informant\u2019s statement that he had seen \u201crows of plants with lots of\u2018bud\u2019 on them\u201d), <em>and id. </em>at 205 (noting affiant officer\u2019s statement that, with respect to indoor marijuana growing operation, it \u201ctakes months of cultivation before a marijuana plant produces buds\u201d). Further, similarly to the heroin in <em>Corpus-Ruiz, </em>marijuana plants, at least in small numbers, are eminently perishable \u2014 or, when harvested, consumable \u2014 and mobile. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Cf. Bice, </em>115 Or App at 485 (noting that the supposedly stale information \u201cwas not about a quantity of marijuana that may be consumed or moved\u201d). Nothing in the affidavit provides any basis to determine that those plants that E saw probably were still in defendant\u2019s possession six weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Second, Adams\u2019s affidavit did not include facts from which a magistrate could reasonably infer and find that defendant was involved in a continuing cultivation operation, of the sort that we addressed in, e.g., <em>Duarte/Knull-Dunagan, Bice, </em>or <em>Young, </em>so that it was probable that other plants could be found at defendant\u2019s residence. <em>See Duarte</em>/<em>Knull-Dunagan, </em>237 Or App at 22-23, 25 (noting that search warrant affidavit included information about purported hydroponic marijuana growing operation in the basement of the defendants\u2019 residence, including evidence of structural modifications of the basement and substantial increases in the defendants\u2019 water and electrical consumption; further noting officer affiant\u2019s averment that persons engaged in indoor marijuana growing operations \u201cmaintain a continuous supply of plants,\u201d so as to ensure \u201can ongoing and uninterrupted source of marijuana for harvest and sale\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Bice, </em>115 Or App at 484-85 (warrant affidavit included informant\u2019s description of observations, two months before, of, <em>inter alia, </em>a closet in the defendant\u2019s home having been converted for marijuana growing operation, with \u201cseveral ounces to pounds of marijuana being dried\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). There was no evidence of defendant\u2019s use or possession of marijuana in the intervening six weeks.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was no evidence that, with the exception of the single heat lamp, defendant possessed any of the materials and implements necessary for a continuing indoor marijuana cultivation enterprise. Finally, there was no nonspeculative evidence as to any distribution activity; although M described visitors going into her father\u2019s bedroom for varying lengths of time, she (apparently) did not witness or overhear conversations about any transactions or see any marijuana in defendant\u2019s bedroom or otherwise in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The staleness analysis with respect to the heat lamp stands in stark contrast to that for marijuana, including growing marijuana plants. Indeed, as defense counsel implicitly acknowledged at the suppression hearing, <em>see </em>246 Or App at 436, the issuing magistrate \u201ccould reasonably conclude\u201d that the heat lamp \u201cmight be there\u201d <em>(viz., </em>at defendant\u2019s residence). The heat lamp is durable, not \u201cperishable\u201d or \u201cconsumable.\u201d It is not inculpatory <em>per se, </em>so defendant would have had no obvious or compelling motivation to discard it, move it, or transfer it to a third person in the intervening six weeks. Although Adams here, unlike the officer affiant in <em>Duarte/Knull-Dunagan, </em>237 Or App at 25, offered no \u201ctraining and experience\u201d-based averment regarding the likelihood of retention of that item, given the relatively brief interval of several weeks and the nature of the item, we conclude, consistently with <em>Castilleja\u2019s </em>standard of review, that the magistrate could determine that there was probable cause with respect to the heat lamp. <em>Cf. Daniels, </em>234 Or App at 541-42 (noting that some \u201ccommon[sensical]\u201d propositions \u201cneed not be justified by <em>any </em>reference to training and experience\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">As noted, 246 Or App at 436, defendant\u2019s sole response regarding the heat lamp was, and is, that the heat lamp was not \u201cin and of itself\u2019 evidence of any crime. With due respect, that is a <em>non sequitur. </em>The fact that an item is not explicitly inculpatory does not mean that it is not evidence of a crime properly subject to a search warrant. <em>See, e.g., Kirkpatrick, </em>45 Or App at 903 (noting that sexually explicit photographs that were the object of the search warrant, and which the defendant allegedly showed the child complainants, \u201cwere not illegal in themselves\u201d); <em>Veley, </em>37 Or App at 238 (condoms that were among the items identified in warrant to search for evidence of contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor were themselves \u201cnot contraband, but rather articles the continued possession of which is not illegal or unlikely\u201d). Specifically, here, the heat lamp, if discovered in defendant\u2019s possession, would, or could, corroborate E\u2019s account of seeing the three marijuana plants and the heat lamp, even if the plants no longer existed. Thus, the heat lamp was evidence of criminal activity, and the magistrate, in issuing the warrant, could properly determine that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>was probable cause to believe that the lamp was still at defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">That conclusion, in turn, returns us to the precise nature of defendant\u2019s argument to the trial court (and renewed on appeal) in support of his suppression motion. As set out above, 246 Or App at 436, defendant argued that Adams\u2019s affidavit did not establish probable cause that any evidence of unlawful manufacture, possession, or delivery of controlled substances could be found at defendant\u2019s residence, because of two <em>conjunctive </em>reasons: (1) The passage of time \u2014 and the lack of evidence of an ongoing operation \u2014 rendered the likelihood of finding marijuana, including growing plants, improbable; <em>and </em>(2) the heat lamp that E saw was not \u201cin and of itself\u2019 evidence of a crime. Defendant never contended before the trial court, and has never asserted on appeal, that, regardless of the correctness of the second proposition, suppression of the marijuana plants was nevertheless required because Adams\u2019s affidavit failed to establish probable cause to search for and seize <em>that </em>evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Our deconstruction of defendant\u2019s argument is not some mere academic exercise, some form-over-substance endeavor to \u201cslice[ ] too thinly\u201d the \u201cpreservation onion.\u201d <em>State v. Amaya, </em>336 Or 616, 629, 89 P3d 1163 (2004). Rather, it implicates, and partakes of, very real practical concerns. If, for example, defendant had advanced such an alternative argument before the trial court, it is entirely possible that the state would have responded \u2014 and could have shown \u2014 that the marijuana plants would inevitably have been discovered, in plain view, during the lawfully authorized search for the heat lamp. Further, as recounted above, <em>see </em>246 Or App at 436, the trial court\u2019s ruling on the suppression motion was based substantially \u2014 and, apparently, disjunctively \u2014 on its rejection of defendant\u2019s erroneous premise that the heat lamp was not \u201cevidence of a crime.\u201d Even at that point, defendant did not assert, or clarify, that he was seeking to advance some sort of alternative analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In sum, the trial court, in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, correctly concluded that the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>could have found that evidence of unlawful possession, manufacture, or delivery of marijuana could be found at defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> As described below, <em>see </em>246 Or App at 433, when Adams subsequently spoke to E, E clarified that he had seen only a single \u201cheat lamp.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> Ammann had educated both E and M about the appearance of marijuana, including showing them photographs and videos about drug awareness. In addition, E identified the lamp that he saw as a \u201cheat lamp\u201d from photographs Adams showed him. Defendant does not challenge E\u2019s identification of those items as unreliable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> Although Ammann\u2019s computerized complaint stated that her twin children were 11 years old, Adams\u2019s affidavit states that M was 12.

Duarte/Knull-Dunagan, </em>237 Or App 13, 25, 238 P3d 411, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 370 (2010), or the likelihood of retention over time of grow-related equipment. <em>Cf id. </em>(rejecting \u201cstaleness\u201d challenge to warranted search where affidavit in support of warrant application stated, in part, that the \u201cequipment used in the manufacture of marijuana plants is expensive and is normally used for more than one initial grow operation\u201d and \u201c[tjhe equipment is not normally thrown away after being used to grow marijuana based on the grower\u2019s capital investment\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b464-5\"> As noted, 246 Or App at 433, M\u2019s statement about smelling the \u201cdifferent smell,\u201d which she believed was marijuana smoke, did not identify when that had occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b467-5\">EDMONDS, S. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Azq\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">I write separately in this case because I would hold that the trial court correctly concluded that the affidavit provided probable cause for a reasonable magistrate to issue a search warrant for the search of defendant\u2019s residence for evidence of the manufacture of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Some general rules provide the legal framework for my conclusion. ORS 133.545(4) provides, in part, that an application for a search warrant \u201cshall be supported by one or more affidavits particularly setting forth the facts and circumstances tending to show that the objects of the search are in the places, or in the possession of the individuals, to be searched.\u201d Probable cause to issue a search warrant \u201cexists when the facts set out in the affidavit would lead a reasonable person to believe that seizable things will probably be found in the location to be searched.\u201d <em>State v. Castilleja, </em>345 Or 255, 264, 192 P3d 1283 (2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\u201cA reviewing court asks whether, based on the facts shown by the affidavit, a neutral and detached magistrate could conclude (1) that there is reason to believe that the facts stated are true; and (2) that the facts and circumstances disclosed by the affidavit are sufficient to establish probable cause to justify the search requested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-9\"><em>Id. </em>Reviewing courts \u201care to construe the supporting affidavit in a commonsense and realistic fashion.\u201d <em>State v. Villagran, </em>294 Or 404, 408, 657 P2d 1223 (1983). \u201cThus, to uphold the warrant, the reviewing court need only conclude that the issuing magistrate reasonably could conclude that the facts alleged, together with the reasonable inferences that fairly may be drawn from those facts, establish that seizable things <em>probably </em>will be found at the location to be searched.\u201d <em>Castilleja, </em>345 Or at 270-71 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">I would hold in this case that the issuing magistrate reasonably could have concluded that evidence of growing marijuana could be found at defendant\u2019s residence at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>time of the issuance of the search warrant. Defendant argues that \u201c[t]he information in the affidavit was stale because there was a six week period of time between the sighting of the three marijuana plants and a grow lamp and the preparation of the affidavit.\u201d When a defendant argues that the information in an affidavit is \u201cstale,\u201d that argument is essentially an argument that the affidavit fails to demonstrate that it is probable that the items sought under the warrant are still at the location to be searched at the time that the application for the warrant is made. However, when an affidavit provides a reasonable inference that the location to be searched is a place of drug production or manufacture, it is reasonable to infer from those facts that the operation is ongoing and that evidence of drugs and drug-manufacturing equipment are likely to be found there. <em>See, e.g., State v. Wilson, </em>120 Or App 382, 387, 852 P2d 910, <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 584 (1993) (affidavit information held not stale when an affiant spoke with an unnamed informant on March 5, 1990, regarding an allegation that a drug operation had occurred during the previous seven to eight months at a residence and an application for a warrant was made on April 23,1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In this case, Detective Adams made an application for a search of defendant\u2019s premises on February 8, 2008. In support of that application, Adams submitted an affidavit that contained the following information that is pertinent to the issue of \u201cstaleness\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u201cOn 01-27-08, Lisa Ammann made a computer generated complaint to JACNET regarding a possible marijuana growing operation in an out building at [defendant\u2019s residence],</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u201cLisa Ammann reported [that, defendant,] the father of her twin son and daughter[,] * * * lives at [the specified] address. Lisa stated that their twelve year old son [E] told her (Lisa) he saw marijuana plants approximately one month ago in the shed belonging to [defendant]. Lisa advised she has told her children if they ever see marijuana at their father\u2019s house, they are to let her know.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\u201cLisa reported that she was told by [E] that he had seen the marijuana plants and growing lights when she picked him up about one month ago. [E] pointed out the shed in which the marijuana was growing. Lisa\u2019s report indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>that she did not come forward sooner due to a fear of [defendant] and that her son asked her not to tell on his dad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">According to his affidavit, Adams thereafter contacted Ammann, her son, E, and her daughter, M, on January 31, 2008. Adams averred that on that occasion E told him that \u201che saw what he thinks is at least three plants and a heat lamp.\u201d E was \u201cvery sure\u201d that the plants were marijuana plants. Ammann also told Adams that E had pointed out to her the shed in which he had observed the plants and the grow lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Adams also interviewed M. According to his affidavit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201c[M] also told me that while at her dad\u2019s house some people will come in and go into his bedroom with her dad. She told me the people would sometimes be in there for a while, and at times would come out in just a short period of time. I asked [M] if she goes into her dad[\u2019]s room, and she said \u2018only to brush her teeth.\u2019 [M] said [that] when they do have to go into brush their teeth, their dad goes in first[,] shuts the door, and she can hear what sounds like glasses being put up. Shortly after hearing these sounds, her dad would let them brush their teeth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The police executed the search warrant on February 8, 2008, and found four growing marijuana plants, two lights, and other drugs and drug-manufacturing objects. All of the information in the affidavit pertinent to the issue of probable cause occurred within a period that does not exceed 42 days\u2014 approximately a month lapsed between when E told Ammann that he had seen marijuana plants and when she made her initial report to the police, and the issuance of the search warrant occurred within 12 days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Consequently, the proper focus is on the totality of the circumstances that occur within the time period in light of the information contained within the four corners of the affidavit. It may be that a single fact in the affidavit, by itself, is insufficient to afford probable cause. However, the proper test requires us to assess the cumulative effect of all relative facts. Those facts include E\u2019s observation of growing marijuana plants and growing lights, the information that M gave to the police, and the affiant\u2019s experience and training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>regarding seizure of marijuana-growing operations. In addition, the state is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable inference that flows from those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">For the reasons that follow, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusions that a reasonable magistrate could not infer that it was more likely than not that <em>evidence </em>of growing marijuana plants could be in defendant\u2019s possession on February 8, 2008.1 further disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion with regard to whether defendant was involved in a continuing cultivation operation. To begin with, this case is, for purposes of reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the core facts, a cultivation case and not a possession case. In light of the fact that E observed <em>growing </em>marijuana plants and grow lights, a maximum of 42 days between E\u2019s observation and the execution of the warrant is a relatively short period of time when the illegal cultivation of plants is the subject of the investigation. Also, cultivation cases, by their nature, give rise to an inference of ongoing activity over a period of time because it is ordinarily expected that the process of growing plants requires preparation of plant beds, planting, cultivating, and harvesting. Indeed, it is reasonably inferable from the nature of the cultivation process itself that some evidence of the cultivation process may remain in the place of cultivation for a significant period of time after harvest occurs. Adams\u2019s affidavit supports those inferences. He averred in his affidavit that, in his experience, \u201cillegal cultivation and distribution of controlled substances, such as marijuana, is frequently a continuing activity over months and years.\u201d This combination of facts and inferences is all part of the legal equation for probable cause in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Additionally, Adams stated in his affidavit, \u201cWith respect to marijuana cultivation, I am aware that an outdoor marijuana grow takes approximately three months (ninety-days) from the time the marijuana plant is planted in the soil until it is cultivated at the end of its season.\u201d The majority is not persuaded by that averment because this growing operation occurred indoors. One would ordinarily expect that plants grown under grow lights could mature more quickly if they are subject to a more continual light and heat source than plants grown outdoors, but the growth rate of particular plants depends necessarily on the extent to which the grow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>lights are actually used. Adams\u2019s averment is not without relevance. It defines for purposes of the affidavit an inferential timeline for the ordinary growth cycle of a marijuana plant. Its importance to the issue in this case is that it demonstrates by comparison, albeit inexact, the relatively short 42-day time period within which E\u2019s observation and the execution of the search warrant occurred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, the inference from M\u2019s observations of the activities connected with her father\u2019s bedroom is a relevant consideration. First, M\u2019s report does not suggest that the activities she described happened only on one occasion. Rather, they imply reoccurring activities, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cpeople would sometimes be in there for a while, and at times would come out in just a short period of time.\u201d Moreover, statements regarding her father\u2019s practice of not permitting her to brush her teeth without first entering the room and shutting the door farther reinforce the inference that his actions to hide certain contents in the room occurred on more than one occasion. It is correct that nothing in the affidavit expressly ties these observations to the 42-day time period, but nothing in their nature excludes them from that time period either. Because those activities appear to be in the nature of habitual practices, they are inferentially further evidence of ongoing drug activity on the part of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In sima, the assessment of the sufficiency of an affidavit to determine whether it provides probable cause to search is a \u201cfour corners\u201d analysis that must take into account the totality of the circumstances found by the magistrate to be true. Here, defendant does not contravene any of Adams\u2019s averments. The remaining question is whether those facts and the reasonable inferences available from them, when considered in combination with each other, make it more likely than not that evidence of marijuana cultivation would be found on defendant\u2019s premises on the date of the issuance of the search warrant. The issuing magistrate may or may not have drawn the above inferences or other inferences in support of his determination of probable cause. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>point is that he reasonably could have drawn the above inferences, and that conclusion suffices to satisfy the standard of review imposed by <em>Castillejo,.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">For these reasons, I would reach the same result as the majority but based on different reasoning.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-5\"> Again, in assessing the weight to be given that inference along with other available inferences, it is important to be mindful that the standard of review is not what weight I or the majority would give to a particular inference if we were the issuing magistrate, but what weight a magistrate would be legally entitled to give to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-5\"> The majority reaches the same conclusion based solely on the observation of the grow light. My quarrel with the majority is not its lack of reliance on that fact but on its failure to rely on the other facts in the affidavit in combination with that fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
