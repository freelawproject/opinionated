The trial court entered a judgment in defendant\u2019s favor, holding that the lease agreement did not incorporate the occupancy rule. Plaintiff appeals, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We begin with the relevant facts. In October 2009, plaintiff leased an apartment to defendant. On August 22, 2010, police were dispatched to the apartment in response to a noise complaint from a neighbor. Defendant was arrested for possession of methamphetamine. On August 27, 2010, plaintiff issued a termination notice to defendant, giving him until September 30, 2010, to vacate his apartment. The notice informed defendant that his lease was being terminated for violation of an occupancy rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cThis notice is being given for the following breach of and noncompliance with your rental agreement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cLease/Occupancy Rule Violated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u201cOccupancy Rules-Section 4: Conduct: Tenants and their guests are not permitted to make loud disturbing noise, or to disturb your neighbors\u2019 peaceful enjoyment of their unit or premises. Loud talking or music, unnecessary noise, boisterous conduct, or loud television ^sets are not allowed. Noise should not carry outside your own unit or be heard in a neighboring unit. * * * Tenants and their guests will not engage in any illegal activity, or other activity that impairs the physical or social environment of the apartments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">(Boldface in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Defendant did not vacate the apartment, and, on October 6, 2010, plaintiff filed this FED action to evict him. Plaintiffs complaint sought possession based on the August 27, 2010, notice to terminate. Defendant filed an answer asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that nothing in the parties\u2019 lease agreement authorized termination based upon his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>On November 5, 2010, the case was tried. Plaintiffs employee, who managed the apartment complex where defendant lived, testified that defendant had signed a copy of the occupancy rules at the same time that he had signed the lease agreement. He further testified that defendant had violated an occupancy rule, as alleged in the notice of termination, and that the occupancy rules \u201care part of the Lease Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The trial court found that defendant had violated the occupancy rule as plaintiff had alleged, but questioned whether the occupancy rules had been incorporated into the parties\u2019 lease agreement. Ultimately, the court held that the occupancy rules had not been incorporated into the lease agreement and, therefore, plaintiff had failed to prove that defendant had violated the lease agreement. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cThe Lease Agreement simply says, attached hereto is a bunch of stuff including the occupancy rules. I am not finding anywhere in the Lease Agreement where it incorporates that and makes it a part of the Lease Agreement, and so I strongly encourage the Plaintiff to take a look at their Lease Agreements to make sure if that is what you intended to have happen. * * * [If the attachments are] supposed to be part of the lease it needs to somehow be incorporated and not simply attached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Plaintiff appeals, asserting that the trial court \u201cerred in its determination that [the occupancy] rules were not incorporated\u201d into the lease agreement. We review a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a lease agreement, like any contract, for errors of law. <em>See Yogman v. Parrott, </em>325 Or 358, 937 P2d 1019 (1997) (prescribing method of contract interpretation). We first examine the text and context of the contract as a whole to determine if the provision at issue is ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 361. If it is not, our analysis ends. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we turn to the terms of the lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Paragraph 14 of the lease agreement provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cOwner/Agent may terminate this Lease and evict Tenant for any of the following reasons: (1) material noncompliance with the Lease.\u201d Paragraph 20F, the penultimate paragraph of the lease agreement, provides, \u201cENTIRE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>AGREEMENT: * * * The terms set out above, together with the attachments noted below[,] represents the entire agreement between the parties.\u201d At the end of the lease agreement are the parties\u2019 signatures and a list of \u201cAttachments to [the] Rental Agreement,\u201d the first of which is \u201cOccupancy Rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u201cWhere a written instrument refers in specific terms to another writing, the other writing is a part of the contract.\u201d <em>NW Pac. Indem. v. Junction City Water Dist., </em>295 Or 553, 558, 668 P2d 1206 (1983), <em>modified, </em>296 Or 365, 677 P2d 671 (1984). Here, the lease agreement specifically refers to the attachments, including the occupancy rules, as part of the entire agreement between the parties. Thus, the trial court erred in holding that the lease agreement did not incorporate the occupancy rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
