Defendant raises eight assignments of error. We write at length only to address defendant\u2019s first and fifth assignments of error. In those assignments, defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding evidence that the victim had previously falsely accused her stepbrothers of rape and her stepfather of sexual abuse. Under <em>State v. </em>LeClair, 83 Or App 121, 130-31, 730 P2d 609 (1986), <em>rev den, </em>303 Or 74 (1987), if there is some evidence from which the court could find that the victim had made a false accusation of past sexual abuse, the court must balance whether the probative value of that evidence is \u201csubstantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice, confusion, embarrassment or delay.\u201d Because it is not clear that the court performed that balancing test in deciding to exclude evidence about the victim\u2019s prior false accusations, we vacate and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Because the trial resulted in convictions on all counts, we state the background facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Haugen, </em>349 Or 174, 176, 243 P3d 31 (2010). In 2000, when the victim was 13 years old, she went to live with her grandparents. Defendant is the victim\u2019s grandfather. In late July 2002, when the victim was a sophomore in high school, the victim\u2019s grandmother, defendant\u2019s wife, left defendant and moved out of the house. Beginning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>March or May 2004, when the victim was 17 years old, defendant told the victim to model naked for him and instructed her on how to pose. Defendant also bought lingerie for the victim to wear while she posed for him. Defendant showed the victim a book of pin-up paintings and a pornographic magazine. The victim told defendant that she was uncomfortable posing for him, and, instead, he had her dance to music for him. Defendant told the victim that, if she continued to dance for him, he would let her be in marching band her senior year, which the victim wanted to do. The victim usually wore only lingerie or underwear when dancing for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Sometimes after the victim had danced for him, defendant would rub her shoulders, back, and legs, explaining that he did not want her muscles to get sore. Defendant told the victim to take off her bra so that the bra straps would not get in the way. Defendant used a vibrating hand massager to rub the victim\u2019s back and legs. Defendant also touched the victim\u2019s vagina with the hand massager and with his bare hand. All of the dancing, posing, and modeling occurred between March or May and October 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The victim told her boyfriend and two other friends about the dancing while it was happening, but told them not to tell because she did not want to create legal problems or \u201ca big scene.\u201d The victim planned to wait until she turned 18 and then move out of defendant\u2019s house. She moved out of the house three days after her eighteenth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The victim testified that she decided to tell her school principal what had happened because she was afraid that the same thing would happen to her nine-year-old female cousin. A detective investigating the allegations had the victim make a pretext phone call to defendant to try to get him to confess. During the phone call, the victim said she wanted to visit defendant, but she was worried about coming by herself. She also said that she did not want the modeling, touching, and nudity to start again. Defendant said, \u2018You don\u2019t have to worry about that. That\u2019s not something you have to concern yourself about or think about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The grand jury indictment charged defendant with six counts of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, ORS 163.670, and one count of sexual abuse in the third degree, ORS 163.415.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>After defendant was indicted, he filed a motion entitled \u201cMOTION TO OFFER OEC 412 EVIDENCE\u201d (uppercase in original), in which he sought a ruling allowing certain evidence concerning the victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He made 14 offers of proof in a memorandum in support of the motion. In the first proffer, he sought to introduce evidence that the victim had previously accused her stepbrothers of raping her, that her accusation was investigated but did not result in prosecution, and that her stepbrothers denied the accusation. In the ninth proffer, defendant also sought to introduce evidence that the victim had told her mother that her stepfather had sexually abused her, and that she had since recanted. Defendant stated that he anticipated that the state would object to admission of those proffers under OEC 412,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which generally bars evidence of a victim\u2019s past sexual behavior in certain sex offense cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">With respect to the first proffer, defendant asserted in his memorandum that the evidence was not barred by OEC 412 for three reasons. First, he argued that OEC 412 applies only to prosecutions under ORS 163.355 to 163.427; in other words, it applied only to the misdemeanor count of third-degree sexual abuse (ORS 163.415) and not to the six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>felony counts of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct (ORS 163.670). Second, he contended that OEC 412 bars only evidence of an alleged victim\u2019s prior sexual behavior and the evidence that the victim had falsely accused her stepbrothers of rape did not constitute sexual behavior. Third, he asserted that, even if OEC 412 were to apply, the rule permits the use of evidence of an alleged victim\u2019s past sexual behavior that relates to the motive or bias of the alleged victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Defendant made a combined argument in support of the eighth and ninth proffers in the memorandum. The eighth proffer is not at issue on appeal; it concerned evidence that the victim was aware that her father and stepfather had accused each other of abusing the victim. As part of his argument in support of the ninth proffer, which concerned sexual abuse by the victim\u2019s stepfather, defendant asserted, \u201cThe evidence is relevant to show the general environment of false abuse accusation, the fact that the victim was exposed to it, and that she has in the past presented conflicting reports of the truth or falsity of such allegations.\u201d Defendant further argued that the evidence \u201cis relevant to demonstrate a pattern of false accusation and the victim\u2019s knowledge of how to report abuse as a tool of vengeance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The state filed a memorandum in response to defendant\u2019s motion. With respect to the first proffer, the state acknowledged that evidence of prior false accusations is not excluded by OEC 412, but it contended that there was no evidence that the victim\u2019s accusation against her stepbrothers was false. The state also relied on <em>LeClair </em>to argue that the court should exclude the evidence on the grounds of delay and likely jury confusion. The state responded to defendant\u2019s combined argument on the eighth and ninth proffers in part by saying that \u201cthe wrongs of other parties are not properly used against the victim in a case.\u201d The state also asserted that it could not \u201cadequately be prepared to argue the validity or admissibility of a so-called \u2018false accusation\u2019 without information regarding such an accusation or alleged recantations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, the court stated, \u201cI have read the Defendant\u2019s Motion over carefully, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>received the State\u2019s Response last night, and have had a chance to review that, very closely.\u201d The trial court ruled on defendant\u2019s proffers in sequence, starting with the first proffer, regarding evidence that the victim had falsely accused her stepbrothers of rape:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\">\u201cAnd in charges \u2014 not the first six counts against [defendant], but on count 7, the Sex Abuse, I believe it\u2019s in the third degree, <em>the Rape Shield Law would apply. Because of that, the fact that the victim, previously accused her stepbrothers of rape would seem to me could not come in under 412 in this case, </em>because we can\u2019t separate count 7 from the first 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201cOtherwise, the fact of that accusation I think would be relevant for the jury to consider, and the fact that there was no prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cI would not want, even if I\u2019d allowed it in, anybody to get into whether we think she was telling the truth or not, but just that there was no prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201cBut unless counsel can point me to some exception, I see no way that that can come in, and therefore it is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">(Emphasis added.) Defense counsel did not respond orally and the court did not address defendant\u2019s argument that OEC 412 does not apply because false accusations do not constitute sexual behavior. Nor did the prosecutor respond orally to inform the court that the prosecutor disagreed with the court\u2019s interpretation of OEC 412. The court moved on to the subsequent proffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">When the court reached the eighth and ninth proffers, it addressed them together, as the parties had: \u201cI have trouble with 8 and 9 in that they are allegations about bad acts of other people. And I tend to agree with the State on both of those and that that evidence will not be allowed to be \u2014 be introduced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">After the hearing, the case went to trial. At trial, the victim testified consistently with the facts as set forth above. The state admitted evidence of the pin-up book, the pornographic magazine, the vibrating hand massager, a handwritten list of types of lingerie in defendant\u2019s handwriting, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the recording of the phone call that the victim made to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Defendant testified and denied that he had ever had the victim pose or dance for him. He also denied purchasing lingerie for her. Defendant said that the list of lingerie items was in his handwriting, but said he had written the list for his wife in 2001. Defendant said that he used the hand mas-sager on the victim\u2019s neck because she had a knot in her muscle. Defendant testified that he had a hard time hearing the victim during the phone call and he did not hear her say the words \u201cnude,\u201d \u201cmodeling,\u201d or \u201ctouching.\u201d The jury found defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to admit the evidence he offered before trial of the victim\u2019s false accusations against her stepbrothers (proffer 1) and stepfather (proffer 9). Defendant renews his argument that OEC 412 does not apply to evidence of false accusations and relies on <em>LeClair </em>to argue that the court erred in excluding that evidence. Whether evidence qualifies for admission under the rules of evidence is a question of law that we review for errors of law. <em>State v. Arellano, </em>149 Or App 86, 90, 941 P2d 1089 (1997), <em>rev dismissed, </em>327 Or 555 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Initially, the state contends that defendant\u2019s arguments are not preserved because he failed to make an adequate offer of proof of the evidence he sought to offer. However, an offer of proof is not a \u201cmini-trial\u201d; it is sufficient for the defense counsel to tell the judge what evidence is expected to be presented. <em>State v. McClure, </em>298 Or 336, 341, 692 P2d 579 (1984). In other words, it is an acceptable offer of proof \u201cfor a party\u2019s counsel to state what the proposed evidence is expected to be,\u201d as defendant\u2019s counsel did here. <em>State v. Philips, </em>314 Or 460, 466, 840 P2d 666 (1992). Accordingly, we reject the state\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s offer of proof was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The state next asserts that defendant failed to sufficiently preserve his argument that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to admit the proferred evidence of the victim\u2019s false accusations against her stepbrothers and stepfather. To preserve an issue for appeal, \u201ca party must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). An argument is adequately preserved if it is \u201cclear from the record that the opposing party had had a meaningful opportunity to address the issue, and the trial court had had an opportunity to resolve it.\u201d <em>Hagler v. Coastal Farm Holdings, Inc., </em>244 Or App 675, 686, 260 P3d 764 (2011). Here, the record establishes that the state had a meaningful opportunity to address the issue. In its memorandum in response to defendant\u2019s motion, the state acknowledged that evidence of prior false accusations is not excluded by OEC 412 and cited <em>LeClair </em>to argue that the court should exclude the evidence on the grounds of delay and likely jury confusion. And although the court did not specifically rule on defendant\u2019s argument, the court had an opportunity to resolve it in the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The fact that defendant made his OEC 412 argument in his memorandum but did not orally repeat that argument at the hearing does not demonstrate that the argument was either waived or not preserved. As the Supreme Court recently reiterated, \u201cThis court has never required that each and every argument that has been asserted in writing must be repeated orally in court in order for the argument to be preserved.\u201d <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 550, 258 P3d 1228 (2011). Nor was defendant required to take issue with the trial court\u2019s failure to address his argument. \u201cOnce a court has ruled, a party is generally not obligated to renew his or her contentions in order to preserve them for the purposes of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, defendant\u2019s argument that OEC 412 does not bar evidence of false accusations, proffers 1 and 9, is preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We therefore turn to the merits of defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in failing to admit evidence that the victim had falsely accused her stepbrothers of rape and her stepfather of sexual abuse. As defendant argues, in <em>LeClair, </em>83 Or App at 126-27, we stated that \u201c[e]vidence of previous false accusations by an alleged victim is not evidence of past sexual behavior within the meaning of the Rape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Shield Law and, therefore, is not inadmissible under OEC 412.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) But we noted that OEC 608(2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cforbids any inquiry or cross-examination into specific incidents of conduct for impeachment purposes. Specific instances of conduct include false statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127 (footnote and citations omitted). The defendant in <em>LeClair </em>argued that the court\u2019s ruling excluding prior false accusations deprived him of his confrontation rights under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the federal constitution. <em>Id. </em>We observed that \u201c[e]vidence of prior accusations by a complainant is certainly probative on the issue of credibility,\u201d and concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">\u201cregardless of the prohibitions of OEC 608, the Confrontation Clause of Article I, section 11, requires that the court permit a defendant to cross-examine the complaining witness in front of the jury concerning other accusations she has made if 1) she has recanted them; 2) the defendant demonstrates to the court that those accusations were false; or 3) there is some evidence that the victim has made prior accusations that were false, unless the probative value of the evidence which the defendant seeks to elicit on the cross-examination (including the probability that false accusations were in fact made) is substantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice, confusion, embarrassment or delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 129-30. Thus, under the third category, if there is some evidence from which the court could find that the complaining witness had made a false accusation, the court must balance whether the probative value of the evidence which the defendant seeks to elicit on cross-examination is \u201csubstantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice, confusion, embarrassment or delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131. For evidence that falls within the third category of <em>LeClair, </em>we review the court\u2019s decision whether to admit the evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>Arellano, </em>149 Or App at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Here, there is some evidence that the victim had made prior false accusations of sex abuse against her stepbrothers and stepfather. Accordingly, we review the court\u2019s decision whether to admit the evidence for abuse of discretion. In the first proffer, defendant relied on interviews with the victim\u2019s stepbrothers saying that the accusations against them were false and defendant asserted that he \u201cwould like to introduce the pertinent incident reports\u201d about those accusations. The state responded that there was no evidence that the victim\u2019s allegations against her stepbrothers were false. The state also relied on <em>LeClair </em>to argue that the court should exclude this evidence \u201con grounds of delay and likely jury confusion.\u201d In the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, the court stated that it had read defendant\u2019s motion and the state\u2019s response very carefully, but it also stated that it was excluding the evidence under OEC 412, with no mention of balancing. Rather than guess as to whether the court conducted the requisite balancing test, we remand for the court to clarify its ruling; we consider that the most prudent course, in part, because the case must be remanded with respect to the ninth proffer, as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">In the ninth proffer, defendant sought to offer evidence regarding the victim\u2019s inconsistent allegations of abuse by her stepfather. Defendant represented that the victim had told her mother and the police that she had been abused by her stepfather and later \u201calternately denied or affirmed\u201d the allegations on various occasions. The state responded that defendant\u2019s proffer \u201creferences police reports, affidavits and interviews regarding this accusation that the state has not been provided,\u201d and without more information, the state was not adequately prepared to argue the validity or admissibility of the so-called false accusation. The record establishes that the court did not engage in balancing that evidence in determining that the evidence was admissible. Instead, the court combined the ruling excluding the eighth and ninth proffers and denied defendant\u2019s request to admit the evidence because it involved \u201callegations about bad acts of other people.\u201d It seems as though the trial court decided that the evidence of a false accusation against the victim\u2019s stepfather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>was not relevant, <em>see </em>OEC 412(4)(c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and did not balance the evidence as required by <em>LeClair. </em>We conclude that the trial court erred in failing to separate its rulings on proffers 8 and 9 and in failing to balance the evidence as required by <em>LeClair. </em>Accordingly, we must remand the case to the trial court for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In doing so, however, we emphasize that, if, after conducting the balancing, the court determines that the evidence is admissible, the evidence would be admissible only to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility on cross-examination; defendant would not be allowed to introduce extrinsic evidence of the allegations. <em>See State v. Driver, </em>192 Or App 395, 398-99, 86 P3d 53, <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 248 (2004), <em>cert den, </em>543 US 1126 (2005) (\u201c[T]he constitutional exception announced in <em>LeClair </em>simply does not encompass extrinsic evidence, and the Confrontation Clause does not otherwise require admission of such evidence.\u201d); <em>State v. Gilliland, </em>136 Or App 580, 586, 902 P2d 616 (1995) (\u201cIf the trial court intended to admit the evidence to impeach the complaining witness\u2019 credibility, the trial court was required to make the findings set out in our holding in <em>LeClair </em>and should have limited defendant\u2019s evidence to an inquiry addressed to the complaining witness on cross-examination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Finally, the state asserts that, even if it was error for the court to exclude this evidence, the error was harmless. In determining whether error was harmless, \u201cthe question is whether, after we review the record, we can say that there was little likelihood that the erroneous exclusion of the witness statements affected the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Here, although there was some evidence to corroborate the victim\u2019s account of defendant\u2019s alleged conduct, whether the victim was credible was a central issue at trial. We cannot say with certainty that there was little likelihood that excluding the victim\u2019s statements on cross-examination affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Vacated and remanded with instructions to clarify the ruling on whether the court performed the balancing test on the evidence of victim\u2019s false accusations of her abuse by her stepbrothers, and to balance probative value of evidence of victim\u2019s false accusation of abuse by her stepfather against the risk of prejudice, confusion, embarrassment, or delay. If the trial court determines that evidence should have been admitted, it shall order a new trial; otherwise, it shall reinstate the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\"> In five other assignments, defendant challenges the exclusion of evidence that the victim made false claims or engaged in other conduct that bore on her credibility as a witness. Defendant contends that he was entitled to cross-examine the victim on those matters under the same reasoning that led us to conclude in <em>LeClair, </em>83 Or App at 126-27, that a defendant is entitled to cross-examine a victim about prior false accusations of sex offenses. We conclude that <em>LeClair </em>does not extend beyond false accusations of sex offenses, and we reject those five assignments of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In his final assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court committed plain error in failing to give a jury concurrence instruction. We reject that assignment as well. <em>See State v.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACD\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Defendant was presented with a perfect opportunity to alert the trial court to the error in its ruling as to the victim\u2019s accusation against her stepbrothers: In ruling that the proffered evidence was excluded under OEC 412, the court noted that the evidence was \u201crelevant for the jury to consider\u201d and said, \u201cBut unless counsel can point me to some exception, I see no way that that can come in, and therefore it is denied.\u201d Defendant stood silent and let the error remain uncorrected. Defendant made no objection whatsoever to the court\u2019s ruling on the victim\u2019s accusation against her stepfather. Thus, in my view, defendant failed to preserve either of the two assignments of error that the majority addresses at length. Because I would not address those assignments on their merits, I would not vacate defendant\u2019s convictions. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that, because evidence that a complainant has previously made false accusations of sexual offenses is not evidence of the complainant\u2019s \u201cpast sexual behavior,\u201d the trial court erred in excluding the proffered evidence under OEC 412. Although he raised that point in his motion to allow the evidence, he did not reiterate it at the hearing. I agree with the majority that, as a general matter, a party is not required to repeat orally every argument that has been asserted in writing in order for those arguments to be preserved. Under some circumstances, however, asserting an argument in a written submission is not enough. Here, defendant submitted a written motion with multiple grounds in support of his position that evidence concerning the victim\u2019s accusation against her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>stepbrother was admissible. The court ruled that the evidence was inadmissible on one of the grounds and invited defendant to point out exceptions that would allow the evidence to come in. Defendant remained silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Under the circumstances, as a matter of judicial economy \u2014 one of the primary policies underlying the preservation rule, <em>see State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 340, 211 P3d 262 (2009) \u2014 I would require a party to point out to the court that it had raised other grounds in the written submission that would lead to a different result notwithstanding the court\u2019s ruling on the first ground and ask the court to address them. Because defendant did not respond to the court\u2019s invitation to point out exceptions that would allow the evidence to come in, I would not address the merits of the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Defendant\u2019s failure to preserve the other issue that the majority addresses at length is even more obvious. The court ruled that evidence concerning the victim\u2019s accusation against her stepfather could not come in because it involved \u201callegations about bad acts of other people.\u201d Defendant made no objection whatsoever to that reasoning, either when the state advanced it in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion or when the court adopted the state\u2019s position. In spite of those opportunities to raise the issue, he argues for the first time on appeal that there is no rule prohibiting evidence of prior bad acts of other people. I would not review that assignment of error either.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
