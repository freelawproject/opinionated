J.</author>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Defendant, who was convicted of several drug-related offenses, raises various challenges to his convictions, most of which we reject without discussion. We write to briefly discuss defendant\u2019s argument that his right to confront witnesses under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution was violated by the admission into evidence of a laboratory report indicating that a substance seized from defendant was cocaine. <em>See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 US 305, 129 S Ct 2527, 174 L Ed 2d 314 (2009) (explaining the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses who prepare laboratory reports for use in criminal prosecutions).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In this case, the state gave defendant timely notice before trial that it intended to introduce the laboratory report. It is undisputed that defendant did not utilize the provisions of ORS 475.235 to object to the admissibility of that report. ORS 475.235(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">\u201cIf the defendant intends to object at trial to the admission of a certified copy of an analytical report as provided in subsection (4) of this section, not less than 15 days prior to trial the defendant shall file written notice of the objection with the court and serve a copy on the district attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Further, ORS 475.235(4) provides, in pertinent part, that a certified copy of an analytical report regarding the analysis of a controlled substance \u201cshall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the results of the analytical findings unless the defendant has provided notice of an objection in accordance with subsection (5) of this section.\u201d Thus, if a defendant raises a timely objection to the admission of the report, the prosecutor may then arrange for the testimony of the report\u2019s author to be presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Defendant argued in the trial court, and asserts on appeal, that the provisions of ORS 475.235(4) and (5) unconstitutionally shift the burden to defendant by requiring defendant, rather than the state, to secure the testimony of a state\u2019s witness. That argument was addressed \u2014 and rejected \u2014 by the Court in <em>Melendez-Diaz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>As noted, in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the Court concluded that a criminal defendant had the right to confront an analyst who prepared a laboratory report concerning drugs. In doing so, the Court rejected the State of Massachusetts\u2019 argument that there was no Confrontation Clause violation because, should the defendant wish to subpoena the author of the report, he had the ability to do so. The Court noted that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses into court.\u201d 557 US at_, 129 S Ct at 2540.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Relying on that statement, defendant argues that ORS 475.235 relieves the state of its burden and thus runs afoul of the rule of law announced in <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>The Court, however, did not end its discussion of the matter at that point. It continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">\u201c[T]he dissent believes that those state statutes \u2018requiring the defendant to give early notice of his intent to confront the analyst,\u2019 are \u2018burden-shifting statutes [that] may be invalidated by the Court\u2019s reasoning.\u2019 [557 US at_, 129 S Ct at 2554,2556-58 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)]. That is not so. In their simplest form, notice-and-demand statutes require the prosecution to provide notice to the defendant of its intent to use an analyst\u2019s report as evidence at trial, after which the defendant is given a period of time in which he may object to the admission of the evidence absent the analyst\u2019s appearance live at trial. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s perception, these statutes shift no burden whatever. The defendant <em>always </em>has the burden of raising his Confrontation Clause objection; notice-and-demand statutes simply govern the <em>time </em>within which he must do so. States are free to adopt procedural rules governing objections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-10\"><em>Id. </em>at_, 129 S Ct at 2541 (emphases in original; some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">ORS 475.235 is precisely the type of notice-and-demand statute of which the Court explicitly approved in <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>Accordingly, defendant is incorrect that its requirement that he raise his objection before trial violates the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
