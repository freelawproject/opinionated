The key dispute is whether petitioner owns four lots and may adjust the property lines between them (as petitioner argues) or whether petitioner merely owns a parcel containing the area of those lots (as the county decided and LUBA affirmed at the urging of the county and a number of intervenors). We review to determine whether LUBA\u2019s order was \u201cunlawful in substance or procedure\u201d or unsupported by substantial evidence. ORS 197.850(9)(a), (c). Because we conclude that the lots at issue were vacated by operation of a partition approved by the county and recorded in 1983, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We understand that the parties agree on the underlying facts. In 2010, petitioner applied for property line adjustments for an area of land that it owns and that it identifies as four lots \u2014 Lots 10, 11, 12, and 13 \u2014 in the Sheridan View Acres Subdivision. Those lots were lawfully created when the plat of the subdivision was recorded in 1911.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The current status of Lots 10,11,12, and 13 depends on the effect of certain actions initiated by petitioner\u2019s predecessors in interest during the 1980s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In late 1982, there was an application for a \u201cspecial exception\u201d \u201c[t]o separate three (3) parcels of 60 \u00b1, 70 \u00b1 and 120 \u00b1 acres from a total holding of 250 \u00b1 acres in the F/F (Farm Forest) Zone.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The applicant sought a \u201cland division\u201d under a county zoning ordinance to divide the approximately 250-acre parcel into the three smaller ones. After notice and a public hearing, the application was approved by the board of county commissioners \u201con the basis of Section 138.100 (g) of the Zoning Ordinance,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>which addressed divisions of farm or forest land.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As part of that approval, the board of county commissioners noted that a survey of the property was required to be filed with the county clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In early 1983, one of petitioner\u2019s predecessors in interest filed a \u201csurvey map of major/minor partition,\u201d which was approved by the county planning director, the county roadmaster, and the county surveyor. The description on the survey map states, in part, \u201cThis Survey was done in order to divide one large parcel into 3 smaller parcels as shown on Map.\u201d Those three parcels encompassed an area of land that originally had been platted into over 20 lots, in the 1911 subdivision. Parcel 1 \u2014 which petitioner now owns \u2014 included the area occupied by Lots 10, 11, and 12, as well as two other adjacent lots, Lots 8 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The 1983 partition survey map, though, does not show any lot lines from the 1911 subdivision plat. It describes Parcels 1, 2, and 3 by metes and bounds, with some references to the 1911 plat, such as calling out the southeast corner of Lot 12, Block 2 Sheridan View Acres. The survey map <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>was recorded. No notation appears to have been made on the original 1911 plat to indicate the vacation of any lots encompassed in the new parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">A few days after the partition survey map was recorded, the same predecessor in interest filed a \u201csurvey map of lot line adjustment\u201d between the recently created Parcels 1 and 2. The property line adjustment moved the area of Lot 13 from Parcel 2 to Parcel 1 and moved the area of Lots 8 and 9 from Parcel 1 to Parcel 2. Within the area of Parcel 1, the line adjustment survey map depicts, with dashed lines, the internal boundaries between Lots 10,11,12, and 13. The map depicts the lines of Parcels 1, 2, and 3 (as adjusted) with solid lines. The solid lines, but not the dashed lines, show the metes and bounds of the area depicted. There is no indication on that map of approval by the county board of commissioners, surveyor, planning director, or other staff. The county found \u2014 and petitioner does not challenge the finding \u2014 that the county \u201cdid not have a formal property line adjustment process in 1983; therefore, a planning application would not have been needed to execute the adjustment.\u201d The narrative on the map states that the survey\u2019s purpose was \u201cto adjust partitioning\u201d and that the \u201csurveys used were the above partitioning and original plat of Sheridan View Acres.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Some subsequent recorded documents refer to Lots 10,11,12, and 13. In April 1983, one of petitioner\u2019s predecessors in interest sold Parcel 1. The deed describes the property conveyed both as Lots 10,11,12, and 13 and by the metes and bounds of Parcel 1. In 1991, the county vacated some of the roads dedicated in the 1911 subdivision plat. The resolution vacating the roads describes the roads with references to, among other lots in the subdivision, Lots 10 and 12. A notation concerning the road vacation was made on the clerk\u2019s original of the Sheridan View Acres plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In 2010, petitioner applied for property line adjustments to Lots 10, 11, 12, and 13. The county concluded that the 1983 partition effectively vacated the lots as discrete lots and consolidated them into new parcels, and it therefore denied petitioner\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Petitioner appealed to LUBA, which affirmed the county\u2019s decision. LUBA reasoned as follows. Property lines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>can be eliminated in a variety of ways, including through local regulations concerning vacation or consolidation of lots or parcels, and \u201cthe county presumably approved the 1983 partition plat pursuant to its local partition procedures.\u201d As ORS 92.234(4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> suggests, and under earlier LUBA decisions, <em>Van Veldhuizen v. Marion County, </em>26 Or LUBA 468 (1994), and <em>Koo v. Polk County, </em>33 Or LUBA 487 (1997), a partition to replat a subdivision with local government approval vacates or consolidates subdivision lots. Even if it were possible to have lots \u201cnested\u201d within a parcel, the 1983 partition did not preserve any lots. Nor did the 1983 property line adjustment reestablish the lots; the property line adjustment was not approved by the county, as required for a partition or subdivision, and the purpose of the adjustment was merely \u201cto adjust partitioning,\u201d not to reestablish lots. Although the county did not, in its order on petitioner\u2019s application, directly address the 1991 road vacation order, that order had no bearing on the effect of the 1983 partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Petitioner seeks judicial review. In its first assignment of error, petitioner argues that LUBA misconstrued the applicable law by concluding that the 1983 partition vacated the lots. Petitioner contends that LUBA\u2019s analysis is inconsistent with ORS 92.017, which currently provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201cA lot or parcel lawfully created shall remain a discrete lot or parcel, unless the lot or parcel lines are vacated or the lot or parcel is further divided, as provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Petitioner argues that ORS 92.017 does not recognize a partition as a method to eliminate a lot\u2019s status as a discrete lot and that the county never undertook any process to vacate or redivide Lots 10,11,12, and 13. In petitioner\u2019s view, although undeveloped subdivisions may be vacated under a review process in ORS 92.234 and individual lots may be vacated under the replat process of ORS 92.180 to 92.190, no statute authorizes vacation of lots by partitioning. Petitioner argues that the only method of vacating subdivision lots in 1983 was through proceedings under ORS 92.234. Petitioner further argues that the 1983 partition did not \u201cfurther divide[ ]\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>lots for purposes of ORS 92.017. In petitioner\u2019s view, ORS 92.234(4) does not authorize local governments to provide a different process for vacating lots, and, in any event, no evidence in the record shows that the county established such procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\">Respondents argue that a partition plat, such as the 1983 partition, can be used to redivide property and vacate lots. Respondents also point out that ORS 92.017 was enacted in 1985, after the recording of the 1983 partition. They further contend that LUBA correctly applied its earlier decisions in <em>Van Veldhuizen </em>and <em>Koo </em>to conclude that ORS 92.234 did not provide the sole method of vacating lot lines and that recording a partition plat has the effect of vacating previous lot lines and creating new parcels. Finally, respondents argue, post-1983 references to lots in Parcel 1 do not show that the lots maintained any discrete legal status.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Although the parties focus on the effect of the 1983 partition, their arguments do not track the statutes governing the division of tracts of land in effect at that time, ORS 92.010 to 92.160 (1981), or the various statutes that then addressed the vacation of subdivisions. We begin our analysis with the then-applicable statutory definitions of some pertinent terms. In part, ORS 92.010 (1981) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cAs used in ORS 92.025 to 92.160, unless the context requires otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201c(1) \u2018Lot\u2019 means a unit of land that is created by a subdivision of land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201c(2) \u2018Major partition\u2019 means a partition which includes the creation of a road or street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">\u201c(3) \u2018Map\u2019 means a final diagram, drawing or other writing concerning a major partition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201c(4) \u2018Minor partition\u2019 means a partition that is subject to approval by a city or county under a regulation or ordinance adopted pursuant to ORS 92.046 and that does not include the creation of a road or street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">\u201c(6) \u2018Parcel\u2019 means a unit of land that is created by a partitioning of land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u201c(7) \u2018Partition\u2019 means either an act of partitioning land or an area or tract of land partitioned as defined in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">\u201c(8) \u2018Partition land\u2019 means to divide an area or tract of land into two or three parcels within a calendar year when such area or tract of land exists as a unit or contiguous units of land under single ownership at the beginning of such year. \u2018Partition land\u2019 does not include divisions of land resulting from lien foreclosures, divisions of land resulting from foreclosure of recorded contracts for the sale of real property and divisions of land resulting from the creation of cemetery lots; and \u2018partition land\u2019 does not include any adjustment of a lot line by the relocation of a common boundary where an additional parcel is not created and where the existing parcel reduced in size by the adjustment is not reduced below the minimum lot size established by any applicable zoning ordinance. \u2018Partition land\u2019 does not include the sale of a lot in a recorded subdivision, even though the lot may have been acquired prior to the sale with other contiguous lots or property by a single owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201c(9) \u2018Plat\u2019 includes a final map, diagram, drawing, replat or other writing containing all the descriptions, locations, specifications, dedications, provisions and information concerning a subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">\u201c(12) \u2018Subdivide land\u2019 means to divide an area or tract of land into four or more lots within a calendar year when such area or tract of land exists as a unit or contiguous units of land under a single ownership at the beginning of such year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">We note that, in 1983, several statutes gave counties authority to vacate subdivisions or parts of subdivisions, <em>i.e., </em>tracts of land containing four or more lots as described in ORS 92.010(12) (1981). First, ORS 92.205 to 92.245 (1981) provided a process for vacating undeveloped subdivisions, which could be initiated by a local government or by a landowner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, ORS 368.326 to 368.366 (1981) provided a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>vacation method, not limited to undeveloped subdivisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, under ORS 368.011 (1981), counties could supersede, by ordinance, the vacation provisions of ORS chapter 368 and establish an alternative process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ORS 275.105 (1981) provided for vacation if a county had acquired all of the lots in an addition, subdivision, or plat. We do not understand the 1983 partition to have constituted an effort to invoke any of those methods for vacation of lots within a subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">We turn to the effect of the provisions of ORS chapter 92 (1981) governing subdivisions and partitions on Lots 10, 11, 12, and 13. All subdivisions and partitions were required to comply with ORS 92.010 to 92.160. ORS 92.012 (1981). Under those statutes, counties had significant authority over subdivisions and partitions. <em>See Ogan v. Ellison, </em>297 Or 25, 32, 682 P2d 760 (1984) (stating that purposes of ORS 92.044 and ORS 92.046 \u201care numerous, but all relate to providing counties and cities with effective tools for the prevention of undesirable partitioning of land\u201d). Counties had authority to approve plans, maps, and plats for subdivisions and major partitions of land. ORS 92.042(2) (1981). Counties were required to adopt ordinances regarding tentative plans and plats of subdivisions and tentative plans and maps of major partitions, ORS 92.044(1) (1981), including establishment of \u201cthe form and contents of maps of major partitions for filing upon approval with the county recording officer,\u201d ORS 92.044(l)(b) (1981). Counties also could adopt ordinances regarding minor partitions. ORS 92.046(1) (1981). All such ordinances were required to implement the county\u2019s comprehensive plan. ORS 215.050(2) (1981) (\u201cZoning, subdivision or other ordinances or regulations and any revisions or amendments thereof shall be designed to implement the adopted county comprehensive plan.\u201d). Before a plat or a map of a major partition could be made and recorded, the applicant had to make a written application, accompanied by a tentative plan; the county had to approve a tentative plan before it could consider approving a plat or map. ORS 92.040 (1981); <em>see also </em>ORS 205.130(1) (1981) (providing that county clerk shall have custody of and safely keep and preserve \u201call maps, plats, contracts and powers of attorney affecting the title to real property\u2019); ORS 209.070(2) (1981) (providing that county surveyor shall \u201c[n]umber progressively all surveys received and state by whom and for whom made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>The issue here is whether, under those statutes, a county\u2019s approval of a partition application and the subsequent recording of a partition map had the effect of reconfiguring units of land and vacating lot lines that were previously created by a recorded plat. Concluding that the 1983 partition did have that effect, LUBA cited its <em>Van Veldhuizen </em>decision, in which it determined that recording a county-approved partition plat effectively vacated the lines between two previous parcels. Respondents contend that LUBA\u2019s analysis was correct. As noted, petitioner argues that LUBA erred, because ORS 92.017, enacted in 1985, preserves lots as discrete units of land and because the lots were not vacated pursuant to the process described in ORS 92.234 for undeveloped subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\">We conclude that, under the statutes applicable at the time of the 1983 partition, a partition had the effect of vacating previous lot lines, at least where, as here, the partition map does not indicate the continued existence of the lots that were partitioned. Under those statutes, a parcel and a lot were each \u201ca unit of land,\u201d created by either a partition (parcels) or a subdivision (lots). ORS 92.010(1), (6) (1981). To \u201cpartition land\u201d was to divide \u201can area or tract of land\u201d that \u201cexists as a unit or contiguous units of land under single ownership\u201d into two or three new units, or parcels. ORS 92.010(8) (1981). A partition, then, could divide an owner\u2019s single existing parcel or lot, or it could divide an owner\u2019s multiple contiguous parcels or lots, into two or three parcels. As examples, under the statutes, a single lot could be partitioned into two parcels, or five lots could be partitioned into three parcels. If multiple lots were redivided into parcels, there was no requirement that the partition of the lots preserve the lines of the previous lots in any way. It is also difficult to imagine that the legislature intended the previous lot lines to survive such a process, creating a spider web of overlapping lots and parcels. Given the authority that counties had in 1983 to approve divisions of land and given that the processes of dividing land were intended to create new units of land, we conclude that the legislature did not intend to require counties to go through a separate, additional process to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>vacate lots when approving a partition of those lots into new parcels.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\">Here, the 1983 partition consolidated multiple lots into three parcels, as shown on the recorded partition survey map. Although the partition apparently did not cut through the previous lot lines, nothing in the partition survey map indicates that any of the lots were intended to be preserved. When Parcels 1, 2, and 3 were approved by the county and recorded, the new legal descriptions of those parcels effectively replaced the lines of the previous units of land. Thus, the 1983 partition vacated the lots contained in Parcels 1, 2, and 3. Although the subsequent 1983 lot line adjustment changed the configuration of Parcel 1 and depicted Lots 10, 11, 12, and 13 within Parcel 1, those lots already had been vacated as a result of the 1983 partition. A lot line adjustment could not restore the lots, even if the then-owner of Parcels 1 and 2 intended the adjustment to have that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">We next consider whether, as petitioner contends, ORS 92.017 prevents the 1983 partition from vacating Lots 10,11,12, and 13. Because ORS 92.017 was enacted after the 1983 partition was approved and recorded, thereby vacating the lots, we must determine whether the legislature intended ORS 92.017 (1985) to restore the lots\u2019 status as discrete lots after they were vacated by the 1983 partition. As noted, that statute provided that a lot shall remain a discrete lot unless the lot lines \u201care <em>changed or </em>vacated\u201d or the lot \u201cis further divided, as provided by law.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">During the same session in which ORS 92.017 was enacted, the legislature enacted new provisions regarding replatting of land. Under ORS 92.180 (1985), counties were authorized to approve a replat. As defined in ORS 92.010(10) (1985), a \u201creplat\u201d includes \u201ca final map, diagram, drawing of the reconfiguration of lots and easements of a recorded plat and other writings containing all the descriptions, location, specifications, dedications and provisions and information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>concerning a recorded subdivision.\u201d Pursuant to ORS 92.185 (1985), once the replat was approved by the appropriate reviewing agency or body, it \u201cwill act to vacate the platted lots and easements within the replat area with the following conditions[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The legislature appears to have understood the replat statutes to resolve conflicting interpretations of previous laws concerning the vacation of lot lines \u2014 namely, whether approval of a replat automatically vacated lot lines or whether an additional vacation process was required in conjunction with a replat. <em>See </em>Staff Measure Analysis, Senate Committee on Government Operations and Elections, HB 2547 (1985) (stating that jurisdictions had been split regarding whether replatting automatically vacated lot lines or whether separate vacation process was required); Testimony, House Committee on Housing and Urban Development, HB 2547, Mar 26, 1985, Ex C (statement of Dennis Fantz) (supporting bill on behalf of Oregon Association of County Engineers and Surveyors and on behalf of Multnomah County; stating that bill \u201cwould cause a consistent state-wide application for replatting recorded subdivisions unlike the now varied interpretation of the statutes\u201d). Speaking on behalf of the Oregon Association of County Engineers and Surveyors, which had requested the bill, one witness stated that the bill would clarify the effect of a replat on lot lines; explaining the need for the bill, he stated that there was disagreement about whether replatting would eliminate lot lines when, for example, a landowner owned three lots and wanted to reconfigure the property into two larger units. Tape Recording, House Committee on Housing and Urban Development, HB 2547, Mar 26,1985, Tape 61 (statement of Fritz Ingram). In response to a question about the nature of a replat, the same witness explained that to combine two lots and get rid of a lot line, a replat process would be needed to provide a new legal description of the combined unit of land. <em>Id. </em>at Tape 62 (statement of Fritz Ingram). Another witness concurred that lots could be combined by replat. <em>Id. </em>(statement of Osburn Shaw).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In 1985, then, the legislature understood that, by enacting the replat statutes, it was approving a process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>already in use by some local governments, whereby combining lots to redivide land into parcels would vacate prior lot lines. In light of that legislative approval, it seems highly unlikely that the legislature simultaneously intended the adoption of ORS 92.017 (1985) to restore lots that had been vacated when the lots were consolidated by a partition. LUBA did not err by rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that ORS 92.017 (1985) prevented the 1983 partition from having the effect of vacating Lots 10, 11, 12, and 13. Given that under the governing statutes in 1983, a partition had the effect of vacating previous lot lines, LUBA also correctly determined that the review process for undeveloped subdivisions in ORS 92.234 did not provide the sole method by which lot lines could be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">In its second assignment of error, petitioner argues that LUBA erred by failing to remand for the county to consider and address evidence regarding the 1991 road vacation order. LUBA concluded that there was no need to remand for findings addressing that order. Petitioner argues that the 1991 road vacation order is evidence that the lots were not vacated in 1983, because the order would have been unnecessary had the Sheridan View Acres subdivision been vacated under the review process in ORS 92.234, which also provides for the vacation of land dedicated to public use within an undeveloped subdivision pursuant to ORS 92.234(3). As explained above, however, the lots were vacated by the 1983 partition, not by the ORS 92.234 review process. Petitioner further argues that the 1991 road order\u2019s reference to Lot 10 establishes that Lot 10 must still have existed after the 1983 partition.
