He appeals those convictions, contending that the trial court erred in admitting, in the absence of any physical signs of abuse, a medical expert\u2019s diagnosis that the victim had been sexually abused. <em>See State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Although defendant acknowledges that, before the trial court, he did not challenge the admission of the diagnosis, he contends that the admission of that evidence was plain error under <em>Southard.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> See State v. Clay, </em>235 Or App 26, 30, 230 P3d 72 (2010) (following <em>Southard, </em>a trial court\u2019s admission of a medical expert\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence constitutes plain error); <em>see also State v. Potts, </em>242 Or App 352, 353, 255 P3d 614 (2011) (same). We agree with defendant that admission of the diagnosis in this case was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The state nonetheless asserts that \u201cthe overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, including his own admissions, make it highly unlikely that [the] diagnosis\u201d affected the verdict. We agree that the admission of the diagnosis did not likely affect the court\u2019s verdict in this case and, accordingly, we decline to affirmatively exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (the appellate court must exercise its discretion to consider or not consider plain error, \u201cand if the court chooses to consider the error, the court must articulate its reasons for doing so\u201d); <em>State v. Childs, </em>243 Or App 129, 131-32, 259 P3d 77, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 573 (2011) (declining to exercise discretion to correct plain error in admitting a sexual abuse diagnosis where the error did not likely affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>court\u2019s verdict); <em>see also Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6 (in deciding whether to exercise discretion, court may consider, among other things \u201cthe gravity of the error\u201d and \u201cthe ends of justice in the particular case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">As was the case in <em>Childs, </em>this case did not amount to merely a \u201cswearing match\u201d between the victim, who was 18 years old at the time of trial, and defendant. 243 Or App at 131-32. Instead, here, defendant, who was the victim\u2019s stepfather, admitted to sexually abusing the victim. In a recorded interview with police, which was admitted into evidence at trial, defendant extensively detailed the sexual acts that he had engaged in with the victim. By defendant\u2019s own account, the sexual contacts had begun when the victim was about eight years old and had continued regularly \u2014 about twice a month while the victim\u2019s mother was at work \u2014 until she was approximately 14 or 15 years old. He discussed the locations where the sexual contacts generally occurred and stated that the victim would perform sexual acts on him rather than doing chores. That evidence was uncontroverted at trial and was consistent with the victim\u2019s testimony regarding the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In addition to defendant\u2019s own statements, photographic evidence also substantiated the abuse. Specifically, several sexually explicit photographs of the victim were admitted at trial and corroborated her account. The court noted that defendant\u2019s own statements supported the verdict and described the evidence in the case as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d Given the circumstances presented here, we are convinced that the admission of the diagnosis did not likely affect the court\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In light of that determination, we conclude that it would not be appropriate for us to affirmatively exercise our discretion to correct the error in admitting the diagnosis of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\"> Under ORAP 5.45(1), \u201c[n]o matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
