J.</author>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for first-degree sexual abuse. ORS 163.427. On appeal, defendant contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment in this case because it violated the double jeopardy provisions of the state and federal constitutions and (2) under <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), the trial court erred in admitting a physician\u2019s expert diagnosis, in the absence of physical evidence, that complainant had been sexually abused. We reject defendant\u2019s first contention without discussion. However, with regard to the second, we conclude that the trial court erred in admitting the expert\u2019s diagnosis; further, we cannot say that there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the erroneously admitted evidence affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Accordingly, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The evolution of this case is quite complicated. Defendant was indicted in Case Number 04-1330 on 22 counts of first-degree sexual abuse that allegedly occurred between January 1, 2003 and August 30, 2004. Those counts concerned three children whose family lived in defendant\u2019s <em>house </em>\u2014 viz., complainant, who was approximately five or six years old at the time of the alleged conduct, and her two siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">At defendant\u2019s initial trial in 2005, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal and dismissed 19 of those counts. Ultimately, the jury considered three counts \u2014 that is, Counts 13 and 14, which alleged that defendant subjected complainant to sexual contact by touching her vagina, and Count 1, which alleged that defendant subjected complainant to sexual contact by causing her to touch his penis. During the course of the trial, complainant was asked whether she had touched defendant\u2019s penis. She responded negatively. The jury returned a guilty verdict on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Count 13 and a not guilty verdict on Count 14 but was unable to return a verdict on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Defendant appealed. <em>State v. Olsen, </em>220 Or App 85, 185 P3d 467 (2008). On appeal, the state conceded that it had not complied with the statutory prerequisites for admitting complainant\u2019s hearsay statements. <em>Id. </em>at 89. We accepted that concession and concluded that admitting the hearsay was not harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 89-92. Accordingly, we reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case to the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Following our remand, the state filed a new indictment against defendant designated as Case Number OS-1396, and the trial court, on the state\u2019s motion, dismissed Case Number 04-1330. The new indictment in Case Number 08-1396 alleged two counts of first-degree sexual abuse that were identical to Counts 1 and 13 in Case Number 04-1330. Specifically, Count 1 of the new indictment alleged that defendant subjected complainant to sexual contact by causing her to touch his penis, and Count 2 alleged that defendant subjected complainant to sexual contact by touching her vagina. Before trial, the court dismissed Count 2 for reasons immaterial to our analysis of defendant\u2019s Southard-based challenge, and defendant proceeded to a jury trial on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">During its case-in-chief, complainant\u2019s mother testified about complainant\u2019s disclosure that defendant had touched her. Additionally, the state offered evidence that defendant had been previously convicted of sexual abuse based on an incident in 1986 in which defendant put the hand of an eight-year-old girl on his penis. Further, the state played for the jury a recording of defendant\u2019s interview with an Oregon State Police detective in 2004. In that interview, defendant stated that complainant had followed him to the bathroom and grabbed his penis as he was trying to pull up his pants and had touched his penis on other occasions. However, defendant denied that he had ever grabbed complainant\u2019s hand and put it on his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In light of defendant\u2019s statements, the state\u2019s case turned on complainant\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s alleged conduct. Complainant testified that she sometimes slept in the same bed as defendant and that defendant touched her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u201cprivate\u201d on numerous occasions. Specifically, with regard to the alleged conduct, complainant testified that, on one occasion, defendant, who was naked and ejaculating, called her to the bathroom and \u201cgrabbed [her] hand and touched \u2014 made [her] touch\u201d his penis. However, complainant acknowledged that her testimony in that regard was inconsistent with her earlier statements to the clinical social worker who investigated her allegations in 2003 and with her prior sworn testimony in which she had denied that she had touched defendant\u2019s penis. According to complainant, she had been not been truthful in her earlier statements because she was \u201cnervous and scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The state offered no eyewitness testimony or forensic evidence to corroborate the alleged abuse. Instead, over defendant\u2019s objection, the state offered the testimony of Dr. Roy Little, the physician who examined complainant following her disclosure of the alleged abuse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Little testified that the purpose of examining and interviewing a child who has disclosed abuse, is \u201cto find out what happened to the child, in other words, to establish \u2014 either validate or disprove the allegation, the disclosures that brought the child to our facility. We\u2019re trying to make a medical diagnosis.\u201d In this case, although, as Little acknowledged, \u201cthere were no physical findings specific to the abuse allegations that [complainant] made,\u201d Little diagnosed complainant with sexual abuse. According to Little, that diagnosis was predicated on what complainant\u2019s mother told him as well as complainant\u2019s statements during the interview, which were, he testified, \u201cconsistent, clear, and responsive, appropriate for her age and condition.\u201d Little testified that, even if complainant had lied during the interview about touching defendant\u2019s penis, he would not change his diagnosis of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">With the evidence so developed, the pivotal issue at trial was complainant\u2019s credibility, especially in light of her inconsistent statements about touching defendant\u2019s penis. Accordingly, the state\u2019s closing argument focused substantially on that question. In particular, the prosecutor explained why it was understandable for complainant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>have lied in her earlier statements and urged the jury to credit complainant\u2019s testimony that defendant had caused her to touch his penis. Further, to buttress complainant\u2019s credibility, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider other evidence that the alleged conduct occurred in this case including \u201cthe medical diagnosis of Dr. Roy Little that [complainant] was sexually abused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The jury found defendant guilty. Defendant appeals the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that, under <em>Southard, </em>the trial court erred in admitting Little\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence. Further, defendant contends that the admission of that evidence was not harmless because \u201c[complainant\u2019s] allegations of abuse were unsubstantiated by physical evidence or eyewitness testimony\u201d and \u201c[t]he erroneously admitted scientific evidence directly bolstered * * * [complainant\u2019s] credibility,\u201d on which the state\u2019s case \u201chinged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In response, the state concedes that the trial court erred in admitting Little\u2019s diagnosis. However, the state contends that the admission of that evidence was harmless because \u201cthe victim\u2019s credibility was not an important issue during defendant\u2019s second trial because defendant admitted the facts from the victim\u2019s testimony\u201d and, consequently, \u201cthe diagnosis played an insignificant role in defendant\u2019s prosecution in light of the other overwhelming evidence of his guilt.\u201d Specifically, according to the state, \u201c[t]hat evidence included <em>defendant\u2019s admission </em>that the victim touched his erect penis * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The state\u2019s concession of error is well founded, and we accept it. Under <em>Southard, </em>which the Supreme Court issued approximately five months after the trial in this case, the court erred in admitting Little\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical findings. <em>See Southard, </em>347 Or at 142 (holding that, generally, a diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence of abuse is not admissible under OEC 403). Accordingly, our inquiry reduces to whether the erroneous admission of that evidence was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court explained the proper inquiry under Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">\u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error consists of a single inquiry: Is there little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict? The correct focus of the inquiry regarding affirmance despite error is on the possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as a factfinder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial and compelling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">336 Or at 32. Further, in <em>State v. Perkins, </em>221 Or App 136, 143, 188 P3d 482 (2008), we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201ca variety of considerations may properly inform that single inquiry, including the nature of the error that occurred below, and the context of the legal error. The court [in Davis] noted, for example, that the erroneous exclusion or admission of evidence would be harmless if the particular issue to which the error pertains has no relationship to the jury\u2019s determination of its verdict or if the jury would have regarded the * * * evidence as duplicative or unhelpful to its deliberations. Ultimately, the Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>concluded that the erroneous exclusion was not harmless, because it could not say that the excluded statements were merely cumulative of admitted evidence \u2014 and, indeed, were qualitatively different than the evidence that the jury heard \u2014 and because the excluded evidence goes directly to the heart of defendant\u2019s factual theory of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">(Internal quotation marks and citations omitted; omission in <em>Perkins.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">This case turned on the jury\u2019s determination of complainant\u2019s credibility. Although the state offered evidence that, in 1986, defendant had caused another young girl to touch his penis, the court instructed the jury that it could not consider the \u201cprior incident as evidence that the defendant is guilty of sexual abuse in this case\u201d but could consider the evidence only as \u201cevidence of defendant\u2019s sexual intent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Similarly, the jury was instructed that it could consider the evidence of uncharged sexual contacts between complainant and defendant only \u201cas evidence of the sexual predisposition defendant had for this particular victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Thus, the lynchpin of the state\u2019s case was complainant\u2019s testimony that, on one occasion, defendant, who was naked and ejaculating, called her to the bathroom and \u201cgrabbed [her] hand and touched \u2014 made [her] touch\u201d his penis. Although defendant admitted that complainant had touched his penis, he did <em>not </em>state or \u201cadmit\u201d that he caused complainant to come to the bathroom and touch his penis. Thus, defendant\u2019s statements during the police interview do not \u201cadmit\u201d the conduct to which complainant testified at trial and for which he was convicted. In sum, the state\u2019s \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d proposition rests on an admission that never occurred. <em>Cf. State v. </em>Pickett, 246 Or App 62, 264 P3d 209 (2011) (declining to exercise our discretion to correct plainly erroneous admission of a diagnosis of sexual abuse where the defendant provided an extensively detailed admission of the abuse, which was uncontroverted at trial and consistent with the victim\u2019s account).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Given that circumstance, the admission of Little\u2019s diagnosis \u2014 which, again, the prosecutor explicitly invoked to bolster complainant\u2019s credibility \u2014 cannot be deemed harmless. We cannot say that there was little likelihood that the erroneously admitted evidence affected the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, the error was not harmless, and defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"> Our disposition in that regard obviates the need to address defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error concerning the trial court\u2019s admission of other evidence in the case as well as the court\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance as a sanction for the state\u2019s discovery violation and his motion to exclude complainant\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s alleged conduct as a sanction for that violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\"> Before trial defendant moved to exclude Little\u2019s diagnosis. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> Article VII (Amended), section 3, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">\u201cIf the supreme court shall be of opinion, after consideration of all the matters thus submitted, that the judgment of the court appealed from was such as should have heen rendered in the case, such judgment shall be affirmed, notwithstanding any error committed during the trial[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
