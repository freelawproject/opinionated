J.</author>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Defendant, who entered a conditional guilty plea, ORS 135.335(3), for trademark counterfeiting in the second degree, ORS 647.145, appeals. She assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress evidence, including inculpatory statements that she made during an interview with FBI agents. Defendant contends that suppression is required because the agents failed to give her <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the interview either (a) evinced \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d for purposes of Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or (b) constituted \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d for purposes of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rejected both of these contentions, and so do we. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In denying suppression, the trial court rendered comprehensive findings. Reviewed consistently with those findings, <em>see State v. Shaff, </em>343 Or 639, 641, 175 P3d 454 (2007), the record discloses the following material facts. In October 2008, defendant planned and advertised a \u201cpurse party,\u201d at which she intended to sell purses, shoes, and clothes that bore designer trademarks without authorization. The event was to be held at a motel secured by an associate of defendant \u2014 who, unbeknownst to defendant, was an FBI informant. The informant, who \u201chosted\u201d the event, invited FBI agents to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">On the day of the party, the first two agents, who were in plain clothes, entered the suite with the informant\u2019s permission. Upon entering, the agents identified themselves as FBI agents and showed defendant their credentials. The agents saw purses, shoes, and clothes on display in both the front room of the suite and the back bedroom,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>credit card machine. Shortly after the first agents entered the suite, they were joined by four to five more agents and one local police detective. All of the law enforcement personnel wore \u201csoft or casual\u201d clothing, and none displayed a gun or handcuffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The agents did not arrest defendant. Nor did they inform defendant of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, either initially or at any time during the ensuing encounter. Rather, one agent asked defendant to go into the bedroom so that two other agents, Grubb and Swansinger, could ask her some questions while the other agents inventoried the merchandise in the front room. The agents did not tell defendant that she was not required to answer their questions or that she was free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Defendant went into the bedroom, and Grubb and Swansinger followed. Defendant and both agents sat down, with Swansinger taking notes from a stool near the door to the bedroom and Grubb asking most of the questions from a chair closer to defendant. The bedroom door was closed during the questioning, except when agents involved in inventorying the merchandise in the living room would enter the bedroom to speak with Grubb and Swansinger.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the agents in the front room were generally not visible to defendant as she responded to Grubb\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The questioning lasted approximately one and one-half hours. During that time, defendant did not ask to leave or attempt to leave. At the outset, Grubb explained to defendant that selling counterfeit items is an offense and that the agents were investigating defendant\u2019s conduct in that regard. In response, defendant immediately admitted that she had offered the merchandise for sale and that she \u201cunderstood it is illegal to sell counterfeit merchandise.\u201d During the balance of the interview, defendant answered questions about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>details other business, including the identities other suppliers and other individuals who sold similar merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">According to Grubb, \u201c[o]ur attitude and tone was very polite, very friendly. We were very cordial.\u201d Defendant agreed: \u201c[W]hen they were questioning me, they were very cordial, very nice.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For her part, defendant was emotional, remorseful, and \u201con the border of tearful\u201d at times. However, she never asked to take a break from the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">After the agents completed their questioning, they told defendant that she was free to go. When defendant entered the living room, one of the agents there asked her to \u201cstick around\u201d the suite to sign an inventory receipt for the seized items. Defendant complied, which took another 20 to 30 minutes. Thus, the entire encounter lasted approximately two hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Defendant was charged with second-degree trademark counterfeiting, ORS 647.145.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She subsequently moved to suppress evidence obtained during the encounter at the motel, including her statements to the agents and derivative evidence. Defendant contended that the agents\u2019 entry was an unlawful warrantless search and that her statements were involuntary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, defendant raised the <em>Miranda-</em>based contention that is the focus of this appeal. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>defendant asserted that her statements must be suppressed because, without having been advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, she was questioned \u201cbehind a closed door, with numerous FBI agents on the premises\u201d under circumstances that \u201cmade it clear she was suspected of a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">At the hearing on the motion, evidence of the circumstances recounted above was presented. Regarding the events at the motel, defendant testified, \u201cI thought it was a raid. I thought it was a bust.\u201d She stated that, as soon as the agents entered the motel, she immediately realized that she was \u201cin danger of criminal prosecution\u201d and that she did not feel free to leave during the encounter. Conversely, the agents testified that defendant was free to leave at any time during the encounter and that they did not intend to arrest her at that time and place. When asked by her attorney why she confessed, defendant stated, \u201cAs funny as it may sound, doing an illegal activity, I\u2019m still an honest person.\u201d When the state clarified on cross-examination, \u201c[Y]ou confessed because you felt guilty about having committed the crime?\u201d defendant responded, \u2018Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The trial court denied suppression. Addressing defendant\u2019s compelling circumstances argument, the court stated that \u201cthe circumstances that even merit consideration as compelling [are] the number of officers and the layout of the room with the defendant\u2019s understandable expectation that she was being interrogated.\u201d Although the court made no explicit finding regarding defendant\u2019s actual freedom to leave, it did find that the agents \u201ccould have arrested her\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and further determined that defendant reasonably believed that she was not free to leave. Nevertheless, the court ultimately concluded that the circumstances were not compelling because \u201calmost all [of] the evidence in this case supports the State\u2019s view of a * * * low-pressure environment.\u201d Accordingly \u2014 and, presumably, implicitly rejecting defendant\u2019s custodial interrogation argument under the Fifth Amendment for similar reasons \u2014 the trial court denied defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>motion to suppress. Defendant then entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving an appellate challenge to that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">On appeal, defendant renews her contentions that the failure to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings compels suppression under either Article I, section 12, or the Fifth Amendment. With respect to the former, she posits that the circumstances of the interview were compelling because of the length of the encounter, her reasonable belief that she was unable to terminate the encounter, the number of agents involved, the physical layout of the participants during the interview, and Grubb\u2019s explicit reference to defendant\u2019s guilt. For the same reasons, defendant asserts that she was subject to custodial interrogation for Fifth Amendment purposes. The state responds that the circumstances were not compelling \u2014 -and there was no custodial interrogation \u2014 because the agents were cordial, the questioning was noncoercive and occurred in a low-pressure environment, and defendant was, in fact, free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The principles that frame our review are ostensibly simple. Under Article I, section 12, <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required prior to a custodial interrogation <em>and </em>when a suspect is under \u201ccompelling\u201d circumstances that do not rise to the level of full custody. <em>State v. Magee, </em>304 Or 261, 265, 744 P2d 250 (1987). Under the Fifth Amendment, <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings must be given when a person is \u2018in custody,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>when a person\u2019s freedom has been \u2018significantly restrained[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>310 Or 1, 8, 791 P2d 836 (1990) (citations omitted). Whether the totality of the circumstances, as found by the trial court, was \u201ccompelling\u201d or constituted custodial interrogation is a question of law. <em>State v. Bush, </em>203 Or App 605, 608, 126 P3d 705 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We begin with the \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d inquiry. <em>See Sterling v. Cupp, </em>290 Or 611, 614, 625 P2d 123 (1981) (\u201cThe proper sequence is to analyze the state\u2019s law, including its constitutional law, before reaching a federal constitutional claim.\u201d). In assessing whether compelling circumstances existed, our \u201coverarching inquiry is whether the officers created the sort of police-dominated atmosphere that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were intended to counteract.\u201d <em>State v. Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or 631, 641, 136 P3d 22 (2006). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>inquiry, in turn, refers to a variety of nonexclusive factors, including: (1) \u201cthe location of the encounter\u201d \u2014 that is, whether the venue was \u201cfamiliar\u201d to the suspect or subject to police control; (2) \u201cthe length of the encounter\u201d; (3) \u201cthe amount of pressure exerted on the defendant,\u201d including, <em>e.g., </em>officers\u2019 affect and whether officers confronted the suspect with evidence of guilt in a \u201ccoercive\u201d manner; and (4) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s ability to terminate the encounter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640.-41 (citations omitted). Consistently with that construct, predicated on a mix-and-match assessment of the totality of the circumstances, no single factor will \u2014 except in the most extreme case \u2014 be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><em>Roble-Baker </em>and <em>Shaff </em>are exemplary \u2014 and, as will become apparent, especially inform our analysis. In <em>RobleBaker, </em>the remains of the defendant\u2019s husband were discovered buried in the backyard of one of the defendant\u2019s former residences. Police detectives went to the defendant\u2019s place of work to ask if she would be willing to answer their questions. 340 Or at 633. The defendant agreed to be interviewed and accepted a ride to police headquarters, which was a 20- to 25-minute drive. The detectives did not warn the defendant of her <em>Miranda </em>rights either during the drive or during the ensuing nearly six hours of questioning that culminated in the defendant\u2019s confession. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The tenor of the police station interview was (at least initially) \u201crelaxed,\u201d with the defendant taking multiple bathroom and cigarette breaks. <em>Id. </em>at 634. Two and one-half hours into the interview, a detective told the defendant that \u201cshe\u2019d always been free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635. Approximately four hours into the interview, the defendant indicated that she wanted to go home, but the detectives disregarded her request and continued questioning her. <em>Id. </em>at 635-36. At that point, as a practical matter, the defendant could not leave because her car was still at her workplace and her elementary school-aged son was also being interviewed by police detectives. <em>Id. </em>at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Approximately five hours into the interview, the defendant, emotional and exasperated, stood up and said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just take me out and hang me?\u201d and then went outside to smoke another cigarette. <em>Id. </em>at 636 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>(internal quotation marks omitted). One of the detectives followed her outside and \u201ctold her to tell him why she had killed her husband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The detective persisted in asking the defendant guilt-assuming questions, such as, \u201cDid he deserve that?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637 (internal quotation marks omitted). Between five and six hours into the interview, the defendant said, \u201cI hope I\u2019m doing the right thing\u201d and then confessed to killing her husband. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress her inculpatory statements, arguing that her confession was involuntary and violated her right against self-incrimination under both the Oregon and United States constitutions. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and, in reviewing the defendant\u2019s subsequent conviction for manslaughter, we affirmed that ruling. <em>State v. Roble-Baker, </em>195 Or App 415, 99 P3d 1239 (2004), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>340 Or 631, 136 P3d 22 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Supreme Court reversed. <em>Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 644. In so holding, the court assessed the factors summarized above, <em>see </em>246 Or App at 245, and determined that the circumstances of the interrogation became compelling only at the point, more than five hours into the police station interview, when the detective asked, \u201cDid he deserve that?\u201d <em>RobleBaker, </em>340 Or at 643-44. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s statements after that point \u2014 but not those elicited during the preceding (approximately) five hours \u2014 must be suppressed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The court\u2019s disposition depended on the <em>cumulative </em>effect of a variety of factors, with the detective\u2019s persistent questioning that \u201cassumed her guilt\u201d finally tipping the circumstances from noncompelling to compelling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\u201c[Dlefendant had spent five to six hours at police headquarters. She had asked to suspend the interview twice, both times without success. For all practical purposes she could not leave police headquarters, * * * and Newell had continued to press defendant by asking questions that assumed her guilt. * * * [A]t the point Newell asked defendant, \u2018Did he deserve that,\u2019 the detectives had created the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>sort of police-dominated atmosphere that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were intended to counteract. Because the circumstances then became compelling and because the detectives failed to advise defendant of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, all defendant\u2019s statements after Newell asked her, \u2018Did he deserve that,\u2019 should have been suppressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><em>Id. </em>Necessarily implicit in Roble-Baker\u2019s analysis and disposition \u2014 and of particular pertinence to our consideration \u2014 is the conclusion that the circumstances of police questioning over a five-hour period, even in a custodial setting from which the suspect was not, as a practical matter, able to leave, were not \u201ccompelling\u201d until the interviewing officers failed to honor the suspect\u2019s efforts to suspend or end the encounter and, instead, engaged in coercive interrogation techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In <em>Shaff, </em>the Supreme Court, with substantial reference to <em>Roble-Baker, </em>focused on the proper content of the third of the <em>Roble-Baker </em>compelling circumstances factors, <em>viz., </em>\u201cthe amount of pressure exerted on the defendant.\u201d 340 Or at 640. There, two officers, Crompton and Savage, went to the defendant\u2019s home to complete a welfare check in response to a phone call. <em>Shaff, </em>343 Or at 641. When the officers entered the defendant\u2019s home, Savage went into the bedroom to check on a woman who was present while Crompton instructed the defendant to take a seat on the couch in the living room and questioned the defendant about his interaction with the woman. <em>Id. </em>at 642. The defendant admitted to arguing with the woman, but he denied having physically assaulted her. After approximately 10 minutes, Savage and the woman, who displayed visible injuries, walked through the living room on their way outside. Crompton then again asked the suspect whether the argument had been physical, noting that the woman \u201cobviously [had] been assaulted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643 (brackets in original). Although Crompton knew from Savage that the woman maintained that her injuries had occurred when a dog knocked her down, he asked the defendant \u201cif he knew why she would say now that she had been assaulted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In response to those questions, the defendant admitted to hitting the woman, at which point Crompton advised the suspect of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and, after further questioning, placed him under arrest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements antedating the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and the defendant was subsequently convicted of fourth-degree assault. On appeal, we reversed, concluding that the circumstances of the questioning were compelling. <em>State v. Shaff, </em>209 Or App 68, 146 P3d 389 (2006), <em>rev'd in part, </em>343 Or 639, 175 P3d 454 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The Supreme Court, on review, disagreed. Although the Supreme Court referred to other <em>factors </em>\u2014 e.g., that the questioning occurred at the defendant\u2019s house, not the police station, <em>Shaff, </em>343 Or at 646, and that, although the defendant was not free to leave, \u201cthe detention was no more coercive or lengthy than a typical traffic stop,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 647 \u2014 it primarily addressed the allegedly \u201ccoercive\u201d character of the questioning. Specifically, the court highlighted the distinction between \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt [and] an officer\u2019s coercive use of that evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649. In that regard, the court contrasted the circumstances in <em>Shaff </em>with those in <em>Roble-Baker, </em>emphasizing that the critical feature in the latter was \u201cthe detective\u2019s repeated use of questions that assumed the suspect\u2019s guilt[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650. In contrast, in <em>Shaff, </em>the officer\u2019s questions and remarks to the defendant\u2014 including his references to the victim\u2019s visible injuries, his statement that the victim had \u201cobviously been assaulted,\u201d and his false representations that the victim had acknowledged that she had been assaulted \u2014 \u201cwere not coercive, aggressive, or repetitive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, <em>Shaff </em>s teaching, as we understand it, is, at least, that mere reference to evidence of a suspect\u2019s guilt in the course of nonaggressive questioning that does not \u201cassume the suspect\u2019s guilt\u201d is not sufficiently coercive to give rise to compelling circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We return to the circumstances of this case. Defendant acknowledges, correctly, that the first <em>Roble-Baker </em>factor, location, is \u201cneutral.\u201d To be sure, the motel suite may not have been \u201cfamiliar\u201d to defendant in the sense that a residence would be, but neither was it akin to a police station or custodial facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">With respect to the second, durational factor, the total time between the beginning of the encounter and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>end of the agents\u2019 questioning of defendant was approximately an hour and a half.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although that may be longer than the duration of many encounters between police and citizens, no Oregon court has held that the mere passage of time is sufficient to demonstrate compelling circumstances. Indeed, as noted above in <em>Roble-Baker, </em>a duration of over five hours in an explicitly police-controlled venue did not, without more, give rise to compelling circumstances. Rather, any consideration of the durational factor is necessarily dependent on the character or quality of the interaction. A very short, but extremely coercive, encounter will be deemed \u201ccompelling,\u201d <em>see, e.g., State v. Shirley, </em>223 Or App 45, 50-51, 195 P3d 457 (2008) (officer-dominated one-minute interview on a public sidewalk deemed compelling); conversely, as is evident from the court\u2019s treatment of the first one to five hours of the questioning in <em>Roble-Baker, </em>a relatively long and benign encounter will not be so characterized. Except in an otherwise close case in which duration may serve as a sort of tiebreaker, the principal emphasis is properly on the qualitative dynamics addressed in the third and fourth of the <em>RobleBaker </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">As illuminated in <em>Shaff, </em>the gravamen of the third <em>Roble-Baker </em>factor is the use of aggressive and coercive police interrogation practices, especially including, but not limited to, those explicitly predicated on assumptions of a suspect\u2019s guilt or calculated to contradict a suspect\u2019s assertions of innocence. Here, nothing of that sort occurred. There is no suggestion in the record that defendant ever denied her guilt. Instead, prompted by her own sense of guilt, defendant readily confessed at the outset. Thus, the agents did not insist upon defendant\u2019s guilt in the face of any initial, much less persistent, denial on her part. Nor did they engage in coercive, aggressive, or repetitive questioning, challenging defendant\u2019s statements. Rather, by defendant\u2019s own admission, the agents were \u201cvery cordial, very nice\u201d throughout. Thus, the third factor militates strongly against suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><em>State v. Machain, </em>233 Or App 65, 68, 225 P3d 75 (2009), which defendant invokes, corroborates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>understanding of the essential quality of a \u201ccoercive\u201d encounter. In <em>Machain, </em>as pertinent here, the defendant had previously provided detectives with a statement regarding the death of her nephew. She subsequently agreed to another interview, which lasted about two and one-half hours. <em>Id. </em>at 68. At the outset, the interviewing detective\u2019s affect was \u201cfatherly and friendly\u201d but, especially after the first detective was joined by a second detective, triggering a sort of \u201ctag-team\u201d approach, the detectives accused the defendant of being untruthful, with the second detective telling the defendant, \u201cI hear you lying [in the initial interview]. So, now it\u2019s time to tell the truth\u201d and telling the defendant that the district attorney\u2019s office \u201cknow[s] you lied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 69. In the ensuing colloquy, the detectives \u201crepeatedly told [the] defendant that they would be able to disprove any falsehood\u201d (including through fingerprint evidence) and \u201crepeatedly asked questions that assumed [the] defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75-76. Our reversal in <em>Machain </em>was predicated on that coercive dynamic. Again, nothing of that sort occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The fourth <em>Roble-Baker </em>factor \u2014 \u201cthe suspect\u2019s ability to terminate the encounter\u201d \u2014 is less clear-cut. The agents, as noted, testified that defendant was, in fact, free to leave at any time, <em>see </em>246 Or App at 244, but the trial court expressly determined that defendant reasonably believed that she was not free to leave. <em>Id. </em>It is undisputed that the agents never told defendant (before the end of the interview) that she was free to leave and that defendant did not, in fact, attempt to leave.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Assuming, without deciding, that the fourth <em>RobleBaker </em>factor pertains to a suspect\u2019s objectively reasonable belief, and not to law enforcement officers\u2019 undisclosed intentions, that factor supports a determination that the circumstances were compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Notwithstanding that application of the fourth <em>Roble-Baker </em>factor, we agree with the trial court that the circumstances, viewed in their totality, did not produce \u201cthe sort of police-dominated atmosphere that <em>Miranda </em>warnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>were intended to counteract.\u201d <em>Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 641. That is so because of the complete lack of any sort of aggressive, overbearing, or coercive questioning, including (especially) with respect to defendant\u2019s damning admission of guilt at the very outset of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Finally, defendant offers no reason why, in these circumstances, she could prevail under the Fifth Amendment if not under Article I, section 12, and we perceive none. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\"> Article I, section 12, provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o person shall * * * be compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against himself.\u201d Article I, section 12, \u201cis an independent source for warnings similar to those required under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as described in <em>Miranda v.
