Speer, </em>244 Or App 392, 261 P3d 1259 (2011), concerning proof of loss in the context of a UIM claim. In <em>Hall, </em>we rejected Allstate\u2019s contention that an insurer cannot have proof of loss and enough information to estimate its obligation in a UIM case until it knows that the at-fault driver\u2019s liability insurance is inadequate to cover the insured\u2019s compensable expenses. Relying on <em>Dockins v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>329 Or 20, 29, 985 P2d 796 (1999), and <em>Scott v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins., </em>345 Or 146, 155, 190 P3d 372 (2008), we held in <em>Hall </em>that, when the record shows that an insurer has submissions from the insured sufficient to allow the insurer an adequate opportunity to investigate its UIM obligation, the insurer has proof of loss. <em>Hall, </em>244 Or App at 399. We adhere to that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">It is undisputed by Allstate that, in this case, plaintiff provided Allstate with the facts of the accident and her injuries by December 2007, information sufficient to trigger a duty to investigate, more than six months before Allstate accepted coverage and consented to submit the claim to binding arbitration on September 26,2008. Allstate contends that this case is distinguishable from <em>Hall, </em>however, because here, unlike in <em>Hall, </em>Allstate actually inquired of plaintiffs attorney concerning the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits and, despite reasonable inquiry, could not obtain information from which it could have estimated its obligation for UIM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Assuming without deciding that the results of an insurer\u2019s reasonable investigation during the six-month window could bear on whether the insured\u2019s submissions constituted proof of loss, <em>cf. Hall, </em>244 Or App at 399 (rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>insurer\u2019s contention that duty to investigate was vitiated by fact that any investigation would not have provided insurer with the information it needed, noting that insurer had not conducted <em>any </em>investigation), plaintiff correctly points out that Allstate\u2019s investigation occurred on October 3, 2008, <em>after </em>Allstate had sent plaintiff its \u201csafe harbor\u201d letter of September 26, 2008. Thus, that evidence has little if any bearing on what Allstate would have been able to discern had it actually discharged its obligation to conduct a reasonable investigation within six months of plaintiffs submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
