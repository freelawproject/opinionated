J.</author>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Defendant was convicted of unauthorized use of a vehicle, ORS 164.135, and, as part of his sentence, was required to pay $1,196.49 in restitution. On appeal, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in imposing restitution because, pursuant to ORS 137.106(l)(b), the court was required to determine restitution within 90 days of entry of the judgment of conviction and lacked \u201cgood cause\u201d to extend the time beyond 90 days. In this case, the court held the restitution hearing 98 days after the entry of the judgment of conviction. Defendant also makes several other arguments concerning the imposition of restitution; we reject those arguments without discussion. As explained below, we conclude that the trial court properly extended the time beyond 90 days for \u201cgood cause.\u201d Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The pertinent facts are procedural and not in dispute. Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge, and a judgment of conviction was entered on April 20, 2009. At that time, the parties and the court discussed the fact that, although the parties had attempted to reach an agreement on the amount of restitution, they had not, and a restitution hearing would be needed. The court indicated that it would be set within 90 days. On July 8, 2009, the prosecutor filed a motion for an amended judgment imposing restitution, indicating that the victim would testify to the amount of economic damages incurred. The trial court held a hearing on the motion on July 27, which was continued to August 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the hearing was completed, the court entered the amended judgment imposing restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">At the beginning of the hearing on July 27, defendant argued that, because the hearing was on the ninety-eighth day after judgment had been entered, no restitution should be imposed. The prosecutor responded that the court had authority to extend the 90-day timeline set forth in ORS 137.106(l)(b) for \u201cgood cause,\u201d and further stated that the motion had not been filed earlier because the victim had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>recently diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s Disease, had been undergoing treatment, and had been hospitalized, and that the motion for the amended judgment had been filed in July because \u201cit was just a matter of getting together with [the victim] and completing this restitution investigation.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cgood cause\u201d had been shown for determining restitution beyond the ninetieth day, noted that the hearing had been set for July 27 \u201cbecause of scheduling with the court,\u201d and proceeded to take evidence on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">On appeal, defendant makes what we understand to be two arguments relating to ORS 137.106(1). First, defendant appears to be asserting that, under the statute, the court had no authority to even consider the matter of restitution after the ninetieth day beyond the date of the judgment because the court had not, at that point, made a determination of \u201cgood cause\u201d to permit the issue to be decided after 90 days. We find no support for defendant\u2019s argument in the text of the statute-.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s determination of \u201cgood cause\u201d for errors of law. <em>State v. Biscotti, </em>219 Or App 296, 299, 182 P3d 269 (2008). ORS 137.106(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201cWhen a person is convicted of a crime * * * that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, prior to the time of sentencing, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall include one of the following in the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">\u201c(b) A requirement that the defendant pay the victim restitution, and that the specific amount of restitution will be established by a supplemental judgment based upon a determination made by the court within 90 days of entry of the judgment. In the supplemental judgment, the court shall establish a specific amount of restitution that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court. The court may extend the time within which the determination and supplemental judgment may be completed for good cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Defendant suggests that the prosecutor was required to file a written motion seeking a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination, or that the court was required to make such a determination, within 90 days of entry of the judgment of conviction. Nothing in the text or context of the statute imposes either such requirement. <em>See </em>ORS 174.010 (in construing a statute, the court is not to insert what has been omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Defendant next argues that the record does not support the court\u2019s determination that there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for extending beyond 90 days the time for imposing restitution. Defendant posits that delay due to \u201cscheduling with the court\u201d does not constitute \u201cgood cause,\u201d citing as persuasive authority cases construing other statutes that contain \u201cgood cause\u201d requirements for extending deadlines. We do not reach that argument because we do not understand the court in this case to have based its good cause determination on its own scheduling needs. Rather, immediately after the prosecutor described the victim\u2019s illness, the trial court stated, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to find that there\u2019s a good cause to extend the time.\u201d The court subsequently remarked that the prosecutor\u2019s motion was filed within the 90 days and that the hearing was set when it was due to \u201cscheduling with the court.\u201d In context, we understand the court\u2019s statements to mean that the prosecutor had \u201cgood cause\u201d to file the motion in early July \u2014 more than two months into the 90-day period \u2014 due to the victim\u2019s illness and that, in that circumstance, there was good cause to hold the restitution hearing outside of the 90-day period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Defendant makes several arguments in support of his position that the delay in this case was due to \u201cprosecutorial inadvertence or neglect.\u201d <em>Biscotti, </em>219 Or App at 301. First, defendant notes that the amount requested by the prosecutor in the July motion was, in fact, the same amount that the prosecutor had stated would be sought at the April hearing. From that, we understand defendant to be suggesting that the prosecutor did not need any time after the April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>hearing to determine the proper amount of restitution. Knowing the amount of restitution that the victim wants, however, is not the same as having the proof necessary to establish that the victim is entitled to that amount in economic damages. As noted above, we understand the prosecutor\u2019s statements on that matter to indicate that further investigation of the amount of economic damages was required, and that there were some difficulties in concluding that investigation because the victim was in poor health. Particularly in light of the fact that the investigation was completed before the 90-day deadline, we conclude that the timing of the prosecutor\u2019s motion was not due to \u201cinadvertence or neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Defendant further asserts that the prosecutor was inattentive to the approaching 90-day deadline and that \u201cinattentiveness\u201d is not good cause. In making that assertion, defendant relies on <em>Biscotti </em>and on our decision in <em>State v. Murrell, </em>242 Or App 178, 255 P3d 574 (2011). In <em>Biscotti, </em>however, the 90-day deadline was not met because the prosecutor \u201clost track of the file,\u201d and \u201cthe case did not get placed in the \u2018pile of pending matters\u2019and ended up being ignored\u201d until well past the 90-day deadline. 219 Or App at 298. Similarly, in <em>Murrell, </em>shortly after the judgment of conviction was entered, the prosecutor who had handled the case left the district attorney\u2019s office, and the case was ignored until the ninetieth day, when a staff member \u201chappened to notice the file on a coworker\u2019s desk,\u201d and, as a result, a motion for a supplemental judgment was sought on the ninetieth day. 242 Or App at 180-81. There, the state conceded that the case had \u201cfall[en] through the cracks,\u201d because the prosecutor who had been handling it had left the office. <em>Id. </em>at 181. In those circumstances, we concluded that the prosecutorial inattentiveness did not constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d for extending the 90-day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Here, by contrast, there is no suggestion that the case was inadvertently neglected by the prosecutor handling it. Rather, the motion was filed more toward the end of the 90-day period due to the victim\u2019s circumstances. Unlike <em>Murrell, </em>the motion was not filed at the very last minute or, indeed, after the 90 days had passed, as was the case in <em>Biscotti. </em>Rather, the motion was filed slightly more than two-thirds of the way through the period, and the hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>held a few days after the 90-day deadline had passed. In these circumstances, and in light of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation of the victim\u2019s illness, we conclude that the trial court correctly concluded that there was \u201cgood cause\u201d to determine restitution past the ninetieth day.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\"> Defendant\u2019s challenge is to the date on which the hearing began. He does not argue that the court\u2019s continuation of the hearing until August 3 (to give defendant time to subpoena witnesses) was impermissible under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\"> In support of this conclusion, we note, in particular, that the time between when the prosecutor filed the motion and the court held a hearing on it was not unusually long.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
