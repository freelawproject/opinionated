Ko, </em>245 Or App 403, 263 P3d 1082 (2011), in which defendant appealed his convictions for three counts of violating a court\u2019s stalking protective order, ORS 163.750. He assigned error to the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal as to Count 3 and to the failure to give a requested jury instruction as to two other counts. We affirmed as to two of the counts but reversed as to Count 3 and remanded for resentencing. Shortly after we issued our opinion in this case, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>State v. Ryan, </em>350 Or 670, 261 P3d 1189 (2011). In Ryan., the court reversed an earlier opinion of this court that formed the basis for our decision in this case. Under Ryan, our previous disposition in this case is incorrect as to Count 3; the trial court did not err by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified; former disposition withdrawn; affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
