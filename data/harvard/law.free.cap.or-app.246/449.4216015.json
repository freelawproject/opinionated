Husband cross-appeals, also challenging the amount of spousal support. We reject without discussion the parties\u2019 challenges to the spousal support award and write only to address wife\u2019s first two assignments of error. On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415(3) (2007),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we modify the property division and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The parties were married in 1988. At the time of dissolution, husband was 48, wife was 47, and the parties\u2019 two children were ages 13 and 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Husband and his brother, Gary Rodenbeck, are equal owners of Software Solutions Unlimited, Inc., which is organized as a subchapter S corporation under the Internal Revenue Code. The company\u2019s annual income had risen for the five years preceding the dissolution trial, from $791,393 in 2002 to $2,802,805 in 2006, although its year-to-date income as of the end of November 2007 was only $1,840,566.28. The parties acknowledged that wife was entitled to receive in the dissolution one-half of the value of husband\u2019s interest in the company, but they disagreed about the value of the company and husband\u2019s interest in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Gary was asked at the dissolution trial to give his opinion about the income that the company would earn over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the next 12 months. Gary responded that he was not an expert at forecasting but would guess that the company would earn somewhere between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000 in net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Husband and wife each presented expert evidence of the value of husband\u2019s interest in the company. Although the experts disagreed about the value of the company and husband\u2019s interest in it, they both applied a minority and a marketability discount to determine the value of husband\u2019s interest. Wife\u2019s expert, Sickler, used two valuation methods, capitalization of income and comparable sales, to value husband\u2019s interest in the company at $4,125,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Husband\u2019s expert, Gilbert, testified on three separate occasions, providing a different value for the company each time as he took into account new information. In August 2007, he determined the value of husband\u2019s interest in the company to be $4,360,500. In October, he testified that the value of husband\u2019s interest was $3,480,000. He explained that the reduction in value was due to a reduction in the company\u2019s sales and earnings between August and October.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Finally, in his December 19 testimony, Gilbert provided two different values for the company. Using a market approach, income approach, and cost approach, Gilbert determined the value of husband\u2019s interest to be $2,295,000 based on calculations that he had done that afternoon that were based on Gary\u2019s forecast of the company\u2019s income. Although Gilbert acknowledged that Gary had no forecasting or other relevant expertise, Gilbert indicated that he had no other forecast for the company\u2019s future income.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Gilbert further testified that, up until the afternoon of his testimony, he had valued the company in light of the most recent information on its sales and operations without taking Gary\u2019s testimony into account. That analysis valued husband\u2019s interest in the company at $3,519,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Husband argued, and his expert O\u2019Connell testified, that the court should reduce the value of wife\u2019s marital share of husband\u2019s interest in the company to reflect the fact that husband will have to use his after-tax earnings to pay wife for her share. In husband\u2019s view, fairness required wife to share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the tax burden that husband would bear in generating the income with which to pay wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">In determining the value of the business, the court indicated that it had concerns that Sickler\u2019s testimony was misleading and inaccurate, and therefore, it found Gilbert to be a more credible witness on value. Nonetheless, the court did not adopt any of Gilbert\u2019s valuations of the company but instead made its own determination of value. The court forecast that the company\u2019s income for the next 12 months would be $1,500,000 and used that amount to determine the value of husband\u2019s interest in the company to be $2,572,826. It then determined that the value of wife\u2019s share was $1,286,413.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The court decided, based on the testimony of husband\u2019s experts, that an adjustment should be made to the value of wife\u2019s share of husband\u2019s interest in the company to reflect the fact that husband intended to pay the equalizing judgment from income that he earned and on which he would be required to pay taxes. The court determined that husband would pay a combined federal and state tax rate of approximately 37 percent on his earnings. It concluded that equally allocating that tax liability between the parties was just and equitable and, thus, discounted the amount that husband was required to pay wife for her share by 18.5 percent, reducing it from $1,286,413 to $1,048,426.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Taking that amount into consideration in its calculations, the court determined that husband owed wife an equalizing judgment of $688,614.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Wife contends that the trial court erred in finding the value of husband\u2019s interest in the company to be $2,572,826. Although we review <em>de novo </em>in this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>defer to the trial court\u2019s express and implied credibility findings. <em>Olson and Olson, </em>218 Or App 1, 3, 178 P3d 272 (2008) (quoting <em>Tomos and Tomos, </em>165 Or App 82, 87, 995 P2d 576 (2000)). Here, the trial court stated that it found Gilbert\u2019s testimony to be more credible in light of its concerns about the accuracy of Sickler\u2019s testimony, and we thus defer to its finding that Gilbert was a more credible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Reviewing the valuation-related evidence <em>de novo, </em>we conclude that the most persuasive valuation of the company is Gilbert\u2019s December 19 valuation before he factored in Gary\u2019s projected income for the company. We are not persuaded that a valuation based on an off-the-cuff forecast by a nonexpert, who very clearly acknowledged that he was guessing, provides a more accurate value of the company than a value generated exclusively from historical figures. We therefore find that husband\u2019s interest in the company has a value of $3,519,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Wife further contends that the trial court erred by reducing her share of that value to account for the taxes that husband is expected to incur in earning the money with which he will pay her a portion of her share. Husband argues that wife failed to preserve her argument against that reduction. However, because the assignment of error that we have addressed on <em>de novo </em>review concerns the value of husband\u2019s interest in the company and wife\u2019s concomitant share of that value, the question whether to reduce wife\u2019s share is necessarily implicated by wife\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s valuation of husband\u2019s interest in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We readily conclude that it is not just and proper to reduce wife\u2019s share. If husband borrowed the money needed to pay wife, it would not be just and proper to adjust the amount owed to her to reflect the interest that husband would pay on the loan. It would be even less sensible to adjust that amount to reflect the taxes that husband would pay on any income that he earned and used to repay the loan. That husband intends to pay wife from the income that he earns\u2014 rather than borrowing the money to pay wife and repaying the loan out of that income \u2014 does not alter the analysis. Accordingly, we conclude that it is not just and proper to reduce the value of wife\u2019s share of husband\u2019s interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>company to account for taxes husband will owe on the income that he uses to pay wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Wife is entitled to receive $1,759,500, one half of the value of husband\u2019s $3,519,000 interest in the company. The difference between our valuation of wife\u2019s share on <em>de novo </em>review ($1,759,500) and the trial court\u2019s valuation ($1,048,426) is $711,074. Because we alter no other values that the trial court took into account in determining wife\u2019s equalizing judgment, that judgment ($688,614) should be increased by $711,074, for a total equalizing judgment of $1,399,688.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On appeal, dissolution judgment modified to increase the equalizing judgment to $1,399,688; otherwise affirmed. Affirmed on cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> Senior Judge Lewis, acting as a reference judge, issued the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and general judgment that comprise the marital dissolution judgment from which the parties appeal. Judge Maurer, as the presiding judge, ordered that the judgment be entered as the judgment of the court pursuant to ORS 3.315(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> The notice of appeal in this case was filed before June 4, 2009; accordingly, the 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415(3) (which grant us discretion to review facts <em>de novo </em>in most equity cases) do not apply, and our standard of review is governed by the 2007 version of the statute. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> In dividing marital assets pursuant to a dissolution, a court may not consider the tax consequences of the sale of a marital asset unless a sale is contemplated and there is evidence that it is reasonably certain to occur. <em>Bidwell and Bidwell, </em>170 Or App 239, 244, 12 P3d 76 (2000). Although husband argued here that the court \u201cmust also consider the taxes [that] would necessarily be incurred if there were a sale of\u2019 the company, he presented no evidence that a sale was contemplated, and the court\u2019s decision to reduce wife\u2019s share of husband\u2019s interest in the company by one half of husband\u2019s taxes made no reference to a sale of the company. Moreover, such an adjustment would be based on the taxes owed as a result of such a sale, not on the income that a party might earn that would avoid the need to make such a sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\"> <em>See </em>246 Or App at 451 n 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
