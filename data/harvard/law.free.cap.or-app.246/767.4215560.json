Mother acknowledges that she has cognitive deficits that prevent her from parenting independently but contends that, because the undisputed evidence at the jurisdictional hearing was that she was living with another adult who was willing to supervise and support her in her parenting, the children\u2019s circumstances did not justify juvenile court jurisdiction. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We have the discretion to review this case <em>de novo, </em>ORS 19.415(3)(b), but the parties do not ask us to do so, and we decline to do so. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (we exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo </em>only in \u201cexceptional\u201d cases). Therefore, \u201cour task is to review the facts found by the juvenile court to determine whether they are supported by any evidence and then to determine whether, as a matter of law, those facts together with facts implicitly found by the juvenile court provide a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction^]\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 442, 236 P3d 791 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The relevant facts are few and undisputed. In January 2011, the Department of Human Services (DHS) filed dependency petitions on behalf of N and A. Both petitions alleged that mother has cognitive limitations \u201cwhich impair her ability to care for the child.\u201d At the time of the filings, N had recently been surrendered to DHS by his paternal aunt, who had been caring for him, and was in community foster care. A, who was born in late December 2010, was living with mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">In March 2011, when N was three years old and A was three months old, the juvenile court held a hearing on the petitions. DHS presented evidence that mother has \u201cmild mental retardation.\u201d According to the DHS witnesses who worked with mother during parenting classes and supervised visits, mother is loving, patient, and kind. Mother has learned certain parenting skills and can apply them as demonstrated, but she has a limited ability to anticipate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>respond to new situations. She also has a limited understanding of child development. As a result, mother has failed, at times, to respond to N\u2019s needs and recognize potential safety hazards. For example, according to one DHS witness, mother continued to treat Nasa baby when he was more than a year old; she would give him a bottle or rock him when he fussed, even if that was not what he wanted or needed, because she could not read his cues. According to the same witness, mother \u2014 who is easily distracted and eager to please others \u2014 would engage in conversations with other adults and allow N to toddle across a room and put himself in places where he could fall or objects could fall on him. None of the DHS witnesses who evaluated or worked with mother believed that mother could parent N and A on her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">At the jurisdictional hearing, mother did not contend that she could parent N and A independently. Instead, she contended that she could parent the children with the assistance of a family friend, Bingham. At the time of the hearing, mother and A had been living with Bingham and Bingham\u2019s husband for approximately two months. Bingham testified that she and her husband \u201clove\u201d having mother and A in the house. Bingham also testified that she and her husband had discussed having N live with them as well, and they were willing to \u201chave another little one running around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">While living with Bingham, mother was responsible for A\u2019s care. Bingham testified, \u201cI told [mother] the same thing I told my boys, I am not a built in babysitter. You are the mom, you\u2019re responsible. Any questions, any problems, I\u2019m here, but [you are] the mom.\u201d Bingham further testified that she and her husband</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">\u201ctold [mother], We\u2019re willing to teach you and be all the support you need as long as you want it, but you\u2019ve got to,\u2019 you know, * * * she\u2019s got to carry it on herself. Because she\u2019s got to really prove that she wants \u2014 I believe in tough love. I\u2019ve had to do it with two of my kids. So, you know, there is just \u2014 if you want something bad enough you will work for it. And that\u2019s just my philosophy on life, you know. The harder you work for something, you will achieve it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">After the presentation of evidence, DHS\u2019s counsel argued that \u201cthe question here is whether or not [mother] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>able to parent by herself. That\u2019s what the allegation says is that [mother] has cognitive limitations that impair her ability to parent.\u201d Mother\u2019s counsel responded that \u201c[t]here is no requirement by statute or case law that a parent must be able to independently parent their child or children and then they\u2019ll be taken away if they can\u2019t.\u201d Mother\u2019s counsel summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">\u201cSo I don\u2019t think the Court can take jurisdiction even if you find her ability to care for the child is impaired because she is making all the arrangements necessary for the child\u2019s safety and well-being. And we often forget about the prelude to the allegations that the child\u2019s parents are failing to provide them with the care, guidance, and protection necessary. She is making these arrangements and has.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">At the end of the hearing, the juvenile court concluded that the state had proved that mother has cognitive limitations but took under advisement the question of whether those limitations impaired mother\u2019s parenting. Shortly thereafter, the court entered written judgments finding that the state had proved that mother has cognitive delays that impair her ability to parent the children. The court made no findings regarding the nature or adequacy of the supervision and support mother was receiving from Bingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">On appeal, mother argues, as she did below, that \u201cthe juvenile code does not require that a parent be able to <em>personally </em>provide all care for her children, so long as the inability to provide care does not endanger them, <em>i.e., </em>another adult is present and capable of caring for the children.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) She also argues that the possibility \u201cthat [she] might choose to leave her supportive environment <em>at some point in the future </em>does not establish a <em>current </em>threat of serious loss or injury.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">In response, DHS argues that \u201cmother\u2019s cognitive limitations and inability to parent independently in a safe manner represent a current threat of harm to the children.\u201d DHS further argues that, even though mother and A were living with Bingham at the time of the jurisdictional hearing, \u201cthe threat of harm to the children\u2019s welfare was still current\u201d for two reasons. First, according to DHS, \u201cit is questionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>whether Bingham could provide the level of parenting supervision and support that mother and both children need[.]\u201d Second, because of the voluntary nature of mother\u2019s living arrangement with Bingham, \u201cmother is free to leave at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">With the arguments thus framed, we turn to the relevant law. As we explained in <em>State v. S. T. </em>S., 236 Or App 646, 654, 238 P3d 53 (2010):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\u201cUnder Oregon\u2019s juvenile code, a juvenile court has \u2018exclusive original jurisdiction\u2019 in a case involving a child \u2018[w]hose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others,\u2019 ORS 419B.100(l)(c), or whose parents \u2018[flailed to provide the person with the care, guidance and protection necessary for the physical, mental or emotional well-being of the person,\u2019 ORS 419B.100(l)(e)(D). Our cases have established that a child\u2019s \u2018condition or circumstances\u2019 warrant the protection of juvenile court jurisdiction when, \u2018under the totality of the circumstances, there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child.\u2019 <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Vanbuskirk, </em>202 Or App 401, 405, 122 P3d 116 (2005) (citing <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Smith, </em>316 Or 646, 652-53, 853 P2d 282 (1993)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">(Brackets in <em>S. T. </em>S.) The focus of the jurisdictional inquiry is the <em>child\u2019s </em>condition or circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 654. In order for the child\u2019s condition or circumstances to justify juvenile court jurisdiction, they must give rise to a current \u201cthreat of serious loss or injury to the child.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. A. F., </em>243 Or App 379, 386, 259 P3d 957 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">DHS bears the burden of proving facts sufficient to justify jurisdiction. <em>C. Z., </em>236 Or App at 443. Thus, in this case, DHS had to prove that, under the totality of the circumstances, there was a reasonable likelihood of harm to the children\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">It failed to do so. As mentioned, DHS\u2019s argument at the jurisdictional hearing was that the juvenile court could take jurisdiction over the children because mother could not parent them independently. But, as mother correctly argued at the hearing, there is no legal requirement that a parent be able to care for his or her children independently. <em>See State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number><em>rel Dept. of Human Services v. Smith, </em>338 Or 58, 86, 106 P3d 627 (2005) (observing that \u201cthere is no statutory requirement that a parent be able to care for the child \u2018independently.\u2019 All that [the juvenile code] requires is that the parent\u2019s inability to parent the child independently not work to the detriment of the child.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Perhaps because DHS believed that the only question in the case was whether mother could parent independently, it failed to present evidence to establish that, <em>\u201cunder the totality of the circumstances, </em>there [was] a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child[ren].\u201d <em>Vanbuskirk, </em>202 Or App at 405 (emphasis added). As described, at the time of the jurisdictional hearing, Bingham and her husband were willing to have mother and N and A live with them and to support mother in her parenting. DHS failed to carry its burden of proving that there was a \u201creasonable likelihood of harm,\u201d <em>id., </em>to the children in such an environment. In other words, DHS failed to prove that the children would be at risk of \u201cserious loss or injury,\u201d A. <em>F., </em>243 Or App at 386, while living with mother in Bingham\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">As mentioned, DHS argues that, even if the children will not be at risk in Bingham\u2019s house, mother might leave Bingham\u2019s house. That is true, but DHS must prove that there is a <em>current </em>risk of harm. <em>S. T. S., </em>236 Or App at 654. Although there may be cases in which a parent\u2019s past conduct provides a basis for concluding that it is reasonably likely that the parent will change his or her children\u2019s circumstances to their detriment, this is not such a case. The record provides no basis for concluding that it is reasonably likely that mother will leave her current supportive environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
