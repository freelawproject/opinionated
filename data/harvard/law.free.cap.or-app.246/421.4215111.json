J.</author>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Youth was adjudicated in this juvenile delinquency proceeding for committing an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute possession of a concealed weapon (a small dagger) at school. <em>See </em>ORS 166.240. He appeals, assigning error to the denial of his motion to suppress evidence, including the dagger, which was discovered after a school official \u201cask[ed]\u201d him to empty his pockets. For the reasons that follow, under the operative standard of review, we sustain the juvenile court\u2019s determination that youth\u2019s response to the school official\u2019s request was consensual. Accordingly, and without determining whether the school official\u2019s actions in this case comported with the requisites of <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. M. A. D., </em>348 Or 381, 233 P3d 437 (2010), we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We recount the material facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s findings, including its explicit determination that the testimony of the school official, Stiles, was credible and that, with one critical exception, youth\u2019s account was not credible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 24, 2008, youth, a student at Ashland High School, was sent to the office of the Dean of Students, Stiles, because he had made an \u201cinappropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>comment\u201d in a morning class and because his teacher suspected that he was under the influence of marijuana. Stiles noticed that youth\u2019s eyes were \u201ckind of red and droopy,\u201d \u201csquinty and * * * bloodshot,\u201d that \u201che was having some trouble forming answers,\u201d and that he was \u201ckind of slumped down\u201d as he sat during their conversation. Based on her experience with students who had been under the influence of illicit substances, her observations, and what Stiles described as \u201ca great difference in [youth\u2019s] demeanor and how he was interacting\u201d in contrast to previous conversations with youth when he had been (she believed) \u201ccompletely sober,\u201d Stiles \u201csuspected that [youth] had been smoking pot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Stiles asked youth if he had been smoking marijuana, and youth replied that he \u201chad not been smoking that morning, but he had been smoking the night before.\u201d At that point, Stiles told youth, \u201cI am going to have to ask you to empty your pockets.\u201d Youth then placed the contents of his pockets \u2014 including \u201ca lighter, an Altoid tin [with] a few marijuana flakes in it, and a double-edged dagger\u201d \u2014 on Stiles\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">As of September 24, 2008, Ashland High School policies prohibited possession of marijuana and weapons at school. Further, as of that time, Ashland School District 5, through its school board, had adopted policies pertaining to \u201cstudent searches.\u201d As pertinent here, those policies provided that district officials who have \u201cindividualized, \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 to believe [that] evidence of a violation of law, Board policy, administrative regulation or school rule\u201d is in a student\u2019s possession may search \u201ca student\u2019s person or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In October 2008, the state filed a delinquency petition alleging, in part, that youth had committed an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute possession of a concealed weapon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Youth moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of his encounter with Stiles, alleging that Stiles had effected a warrantless search of youth\u2019s person in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so contending, youth asserted that he did not consent to the search and that the search was not justified by probable cause with exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">In the ensuing hearing, Stiles testified as to the facts recounted above. Youth also testified, giving apparently evasive responses on some matters and sometimes flatly contradictory testimony as to others. Of particular pertinence to our disposition, youth, on direct examination by his own counsel, testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: * * * How did she request that you empty your pockets out?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u201c[YOUTH]: She told me to empty out my pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Did you feel like you had any choice?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u201c[YOUTH]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You felt like you had a choice? Do you \u2014 so you felt like you didn\u2019t have to?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u201c[YOUTH]: Mm. Hm. (Affirmative.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So you are saying that you voluntarily emptied out your pockets?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u201c[YOUTH]: I did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. So you did not voluntarily empty out your pockets. The question is whether you agreed to that, where you voluntarily consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">\u201c[YOUTH]: Mm. Hm. (Affirmative.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Or whether or not you felt like you had to. That is the question. Which is it?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: But I don\u2019t know what you are not agreeing to.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">\u201c[YOUTH]: I did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: You did not what?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">\u201c[YOUTH]: Did not voluntarily empty out my pockets. I wanted her to call my dad first, but she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So did you feel like you had a choice or not?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">\u201c[YOUTH]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. I think the Courtgets it. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-19\">The court ultimately denied suppression, determining that youth had consented to emptying his pockets and, alternatively, that the search was justified by probable cause and exigent circumstances. In so determining, the court began by rendering findings regarding the witnesses\u2019 credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-20\">\u201c[T]he only credible evidence comes from [Stiles], because the [youth] in this case got up here and changed his story numerous times. I don\u2019t know if he is trying to \u2014 I don\u2019t know what he is doing. I don\u2019t know if he is trying to satisfy everybody by answering the way he thinks they are asking the question or what is going on. Once I asked him \u2014 -I mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>he told his own attorney he thought he had a choice and then he backtracked when he realized that wasn\u2019t the right answer. * * * So I don\u2019t think he is at all credible, and it is too bad, because \u2014 you know \u2014 it is really important to tell the truth, and walking down the lying path doesn\u2019t help anybody very much. So it doesn\u2019t help the case. So that leaves me with * * * Stiles\u2019 testimony. And here is my reasoning. First of all amongst the things that he said was that he thought he had a choice. I sort of tend to believe that, but leaving that aside, I don\u2019t think his will was overborne in this case. I think he did agree to empty his pockets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The court then explained why, in its view, Stiles\u2019s observations, coupled with her experiences, supported probable cause for possession of marijuana.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court concluded its determination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\u201cSo not only am I finding that he consented to the search, I am also finding that she had probable cause, \u2018cause he was clearly under the influence at the time, and there were exigent circumstances as outlined by the prosecution. The administrative issue I think is an interesting one, but I really haven\u2019t been briefed on that enough that I feel very comfortable making a decision in that case. I feel I have enough evidence, so I am not making a finding one way or the other in that regard. I am finding, however, that otherwise the motion is denied based on probable cause \u2014 based on consent, probable cause and exigent circumstances all combined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The court subsequently entered the delinquency judgment challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Youth now reiterates his contentions before the trial court, with the exception of retrofitting his \u201cno probable cause\u201d contention to conform to the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d construct enunciated in <em>M. A. D. See </em>246 Or App at 425 n 5. Youth also, for the first time, invokes <em>New Jersey v. T. L. O., </em>469 US 325, 105 S Ct 733, 83 L Ed 2d 720 (1985), in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of his assertion that the search here violated the Fourth Amendment. The state, for its part, reprises its alternative contentions that youth\u2019s conduct in emptying his pockets was consensual, that Stiles\u2019s actions were lawful as authorized under the district\u2019s administrative search policies, and\u2014 again in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision inM. <em>A. D. </em>\u2014that the circumstances here satisfied <em>M. A. D. </em>\u2019s requisites, as well as those prescribed in <em>T. L. O.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">We affirm because the juvenile court\u2019s determination that youth consented to the search is dispositive. Given that conclusion, we do not reach \u2014 and imply no view as to\u2014 the alternative contentions pertaining to whether the circumstances here established the requisite \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d under the <em>M. A. D. </em>and <em>T. L. O. </em>formulations<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or whether Stiles\u2019s conduct here effected a lawful administrative search.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In so holding, we emphasize that our standard of review is non-cfe <em>novo. See </em>246 Or App at 423 n 2. Accordingly, we are constrained to affirm if there is any evidence in the record supporting the trial court\u2019s explicit, and independently sufficient, finding that \u201c[youth] consented to the search.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State v. B. B., </em>240 Or App 75, 77, 245 P3d 697 (2010). As set out above, when examined by his counsel, youth gave flatly contradictory responses as to whether he felt that he \u201chad a choice\u201d to empty his pockets and whether he did so voluntarily. To be sure, as the colloquy continued, youth\u2019s responses became more ambiguous and ambivalent, and, ultimately, youth flatly denied that he \u201chad a choice.\u201d But the juvenile court \u2014 like any trier of fact \u2014 was free, based on a variety of considerations, including youth\u2019s demeanor, to credit his initial responses. Indeed, in amplifying its credibility determinations, the trial court explained, \u201cI mean he told his own attorney he thought he had a choice and <em>then he backtracked when he realized that wasn\u2019t the right answer.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In sum, the court ultimately credited youth\u2019s initial responses and disbelieved his subsequent recantation as belatedly self-serving. That is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The juvenile court did not err in determining that youth emptied his pockets consensually and, thus, in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\"> Our analysis and disposition obviates any need to determine whether the school official acted in conformity with a lawfully promulgated administrative search policy. <em>Accord State v. B. A. H., </em>245 Or App 203, 206-08, 263 P3d 1046 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\"> Although youth\u2019s brief on appeal asserts that our standard of review is <em>de novo </em>pursuant to ORS 419A.200(6)(b), the operative notice of appeal in this matter was filed after June 4,2009, the effective date of the 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415, which make <em>de novo </em>review discretionary in a case such as this one. Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. Further, we note that, in 2009, the legislature also amended ORS 419A.200(6) to eliminate the reference to a <em>de novo </em>standard of review in juvenile cases. Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 6. That amendment also applies to this case. Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Although this court, \u201cacting in its sole discretion, may try the cause anew upon the record,\u201d ORS 19.415(3)(b), we will exercise our discretion to do so \u201conly in exceptional cases,\u201d ORAP 5.40(8)(c). Further, ORAP 5.40(8)(a) provides that, where an appellant \u201cseeks to have the court exercise\u201d its discretion to review <em>de novo, </em>\u201cthe appellant shall concisely state the reasons why the court should do so.\u201d Here, youth did not do so. Accordingly, and because we do not view this as an \u201cexceptional case,\u201d we decline to exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo </em>and, instead, are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact that are supported by any evidence in the record. <em>State v. B. B., </em>240 Or App 75, 77, 245 P3d 697 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\"> The delinquency petition also alleged that youth had engaged in conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful possession of marijuana (a violation). That allegation was ultimately dismissed and is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> Article I, section 9, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to he secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The Fourth Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Although youth\u2019s motion to suppress included a single reference to the United States Constitution, his supporting memorandum did not refer to any federal constitutional authority, including <em>New Jersey v. T. L. O., </em>469 US 325, 105 S Ct 733, 83 L Ed 2d 720 (1985), and did not purport to advance any analysis distinct from that under the Oregon constitutional authority that he presented. Further, in oral argument on the motion, youth\u2019s counsel referred exclusively to Article I, section 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b449-13\"> The juvenile court\u2019s denial of suppression and the youth\u2019s consequent adjudication antedated the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>M. A. D. </em>by approximately a year. Indeed, the court\u2019s opinion in <em>M. A. D. </em>issued after the filing of youth\u2019s brief on appeal but before oral argument of this matter. Accordingly, youth\u2019s arguments to the trial court in support of suppression, and the trial court\u2019s resolution of those contentions, was not framed in terms of the formulation prescribed by the Supreme Court in <em>M. A. D., viz., </em>that a school search is constitutionally justified under Article I, section 9, \u201cwhen a school official develops a \u2018reasonable suspicion,\u2019 based on \u2018specific and articulable facts,\u2019 that a particular individual on school property either personally poses or is in the possession of some item that poses an \u2018immediate threat\u2019 to the safety of the student, the official, or others at the school!.]\u201d 348 Or at 392-93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\"> As noted previously, at the time the juvenile court ruled on the suppression motion, the Supreme Court had not yet issued its opinion in <em>M.
