J.</author>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Claimant seeks review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board. The order rejected his contention that he had \u201cgood cause\u201d for missing the deadline to request a hearing on employer\u2019s denial of his claim. We conclude that the board did not abuse its discretion, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The facts are undisputed. Claimant is a long-haul truck driver who has worked for employer for 11 years. At one time, claimant lived in Myrtle Point, Oregon, but in November of 2008, he moved to Bandon. On April 19, 2009, claimant injured his fingers while engaging in a martial arts exercise for relaxation while he was waiting for a load. Claimant went to the emergency room for treatment and ultimately underwent surgery on two of his fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Claimant completed and signed a State of Washington claim form, providing his correct address in Bandon. On April 24,2009, employer completed on claimant\u2019s behalf an Oregon notice of injury (an \u201c801 Form\u201d) describing claimant\u2019s hand injury. The form listed claimant\u2019s former Myrtle Point address.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">On May 4, 2009, employer\u2019s insurer denied the claim and mailed a copy of the denial to claimant at the Myrtle Point address. The notice was returned to employer as undeliverable, with no forwarding address. On May 7, employer\u2019s insurer sent a second notice to the Myrtle Point address by certified mail, and that too was returned to employer as not deliverable. Meanwhile, on May 7, 2009, and May 9, 2009, employer\u2019s insurer received medical bills showing claimant\u2019s correct mailing address, but the insurer did not update its records or send a notice of denial to claimant\u2019s correct address.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">A request for hearing on a claim denial must be filed no later than the sixtieth day after the mailing of the denial to the claimant, unless the claimant can establish that he had \u201cgood cause\u201d to miss that deadline, in which case he has 180 days from the mailing. ORS 656.319(1). The board found, and claimant does not dispute, that the day of mailing was May 7. The sixtieth day after that was July 6,2009. Claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>testified that he first received actual notice of the denial at the end of June or the first of July after returning from a work trip<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, on July 7, 2009, the sixty-first day after mailing, he filed his request for hearing. That filing was too late unless claimant could establish \u201cgood cause\u201d for missing the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The \u201cgood cause\u201d standard has been equated with the standard of \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect\u201d recognized under ORCP 71 B(l), <em>Sekermestrovich v. SAIF, </em>280 Or 723, 573 P2d 275 (1977), and the burden of establishing good cause falls on the claimant, <em>Cogswell v. SAIF, </em>74 Or App 234, 237, 702 P2d 81 (1985). \u201cGood cause\u201d as used in ORS 656.319 is considered to be a delegative term, and this court reviews the board\u2019s good cause determination for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ogden Aviation v. Lay, </em>142 Or App 469, 476, 921 P2d 1321 (1996). This court has said that a claimant\u2019s lack of diligence in responding to a denial does not constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Cogswell, </em>74 Or App at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Employer filed a motion to dismiss claimant\u2019s request for hearing, contending that the request was untimely because it had been filed more than 60 days from the date of mailing of the denial. Claimant acknowledged that the hearing request had not been filed within the 60 days, but he asserted that, because employer mailed the notice of denial to the wrong address, through no fault of his own, claimant did not learn of the denial until the end of June or the first of July and, therefore, had good cause for not filing the hearing request within 60 days of the denial. Claimant asserted further that he should not be held responsible for employer\u2019s failure to take note of claimant\u2019s correct address as it came through on medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The ALJ agreed with claimant, but the board did not. The board concluded that claimant had failed to establish good cause for not filing the claim within 60 days. The board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u201cAs noted, a notice of the denial sent by certified mail was returned by the Post Office to the employer as undeliverable at the Myrtle Point address. Claimant acknowledges that he previously lived at that address and he does not contend that he provided the employer with a subsequent mailing address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-3\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s <em>lack of diligence in notifying the employer of his current address </em>does not constitute \u2018good cause\u2019 for his late request for hearing. <em>See Gerardo Ramirez, </em>54 Van Natta 2252, 2254 (2002) (\u2018good cause\u2019 not established where the claimant did not receive the denial because he moved without notifying the insurer of his new address or arranging with the Post Office to have his mail forwarded); <em>Charles R. Fritz, </em>43 Van Natta 403, 404 (1991) (same). Accordingly, because claimant has not established \u2018good cause\u2019 for his late hearing request, his request must be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, citing two of its own cases, the board held that claimant\u2019s failure to provide employer with his new address at the time he moved to Bandon was a \u201clack of diligence\u201d that prevented him from establishing good cause. The board also noted in a footnote that claimant acknowledged having actually received the notice of denial by late June or early July, within the 60-day period, but had not provided any explanation as to why he waited until July 7 to request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">On judicial review, claimant assigns error to the board\u2019s dismissal of his claim as untimely, asserting that he has established good cause for not filing a timely request for hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Claimant acknowledges that the record is silent as to whether he provided an updated address to employer when he moved from Myrtle Point to Bandon, but he contends that, contrary to the two Workers\u2019 Compensation Board cases cited by the board, that silence does not establish a \u201clack of diligence\u201d on claimant\u2019s part with respect to the request for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>We agree with claimant that the board\u2019s \u201clack of diligence\u201d analysis is incorrect. The lack of diligence that will defeat a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d for an untimely request for hearing is a lack of diligence in requesting a hearing on the denial of the claim. <em>Cogswell, </em>74 Or App at 237. Claimant\u2019s apparent failure to provide employer with his most current address before there had been an injury or an injury claim was not a lack of diligence in requesting a hearing on a denied claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">However, as the board also noted, claimant received actual notice of the denial before the 60 days had expired and did not offer any reason for why he did not respond within the 60 days. On that basis, and in consideration of our \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review, we conclude that the board did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\"> The record does not indicate how claimant learned that his claim had been denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> We note that, although claimant argued before the board that he should not be held accountable for employer\u2019s processing errors, he did not contend and does not contend on judicial review that, because the notice of denial was sent to the wrong address, it was ineffective and for that reason did not trigger the 60-day period for requesting a hearing under ORS 656.319(1). His only contention on review is that the circumstances constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
