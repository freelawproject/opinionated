We agree, reject insurer\u2019s cross-assignment of error without discussion, and reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Claimant injured his back while lifting a bin of broken glass at work and filed a claim for compensation. Based on an examination of claimant and the results of an MRI, one of claimant\u2019s treating physicians diagnosed a lumbar strain and a small L5-S1 disc protrusion. After insurer had accepted a claim for the lumbar strain, claimant\u2019s symptoms persisted, and he was examined by two physicians in an insurer-requested medical examination, which led them to a conclusion that claimant\u2019s work injury had not produced an L5-S1 disc bulge. After that examination, claimant was examined by Dr. Kitchel, who opined that claimant had a substantial L5-S1 disc herniation; however, insurer denied the request to treat the L5-S1 disc condition and closed the accepted lumbar strain claim. Claimant then filed a claim for the L5-S1 condition as a new medical condition related to his accepted lumbar strain condition, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Claimant requested a hearing to contest the denial, arguing that the opinions of some of his examining physicians, especially Kitchel, support his contention that the disc herniation is materially related to his work injury. The ALJ upheld the denial based on the medical opinions that are contrary to Kitchel\u2019s, and claimant appealed to the board. The board issued a final order affirming the ALJ because, in large part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201c[i]t appears that Dr. Kitchel considered only his own singular findings. Considering the remainder of the record, we cannot say that he relied on an accurate and complete history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u201cUnder these circumstances, we do [not] find Dr. Kitchel\u2019s causation opinion persuasive. <em>Compare Somers v. SAIF, </em>77 Or App 259, 263[, 712 P2d 179] (1986) (persuasive medical opinions are based on accurate and complete history).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The crux of claimant\u2019s argument on judicial review is that the board erred in failing to explain adequately the reasons for its conclusion that Krtchel\u2019s opinion was not based on a complete and accurate history of claimant\u2019s symptoms. The record in this case indicates that, when claimant\u2019s counsel sought Kitchel\u2019s expert testimony through a letter, claimant\u2019s counsel sent Kitchel \u201ccopies of all of the Hearings Exhibits submitted to the [ALJ].\u201d Those exhibits include all of claimant\u2019s medical examinations relating to his injury. In reply, Kitchel stated that his opinion that claimant\u2019s L5-S1 disc herniation was materially related to his work injury was based on \u201c[claimant\u2019s] history, physical examination, review of the MRI scan, and [claimant\u2019s] clinical course.\u201d Because the board\u2019s order does not adequately explain its conclusion that, despite the indications in the record that Kitchel had claimant\u2019s relevant medical history and based his expert opinion on that history, Kitchel did not rely on an accurate and complete history in rendering his expert opinion, we reverse and remand for reconsideration on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
