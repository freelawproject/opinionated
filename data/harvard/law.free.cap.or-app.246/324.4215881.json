On Count 1, the trial court sentenced defendant to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment and 24 months\u2019 post-prison supervision (PPS), noting that, \u201cif the length of incarceration for this count plus the length of post prison supervision exceeds the statutory maximum indeterminate sentence described in ORS 161.605, then the length of post-prison supervision is hereby reduced to the extent necessary to conform the total sentence length to the statutory maximum.\u201d Defendant did not object to that sentence. On appeal, defendant contends that his sentence on Count 1 is erroneous because his sentence exceeds 60 months and the term of post-prison supervision is indeterminate. We conclude that the PPS term of defendant\u2019s sentence was indeterminate and, thus, constituted plain error, ORAP 5.45(1), in light of our decision in <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>236 Or App 248, 235 P3d 725 (2010). Further, for the reasons explained in <em>State v. Gutierrez, </em>243 Or App 285, 259 P3d 951 (2011), we exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991), to correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Sentence on Count 1 vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
