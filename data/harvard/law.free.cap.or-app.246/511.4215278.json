The court based the increase on what it determined was an increase in father\u2019s gross income. Father appeals, assigning error to two aspects of the court\u2019s calculation of his gross income. First, father assigns error to the court\u2019s inclusion of a $75,000 inheritance in his gross income. Second, father assigns error to the court\u2019s use of father\u2019s average income from 2004 to 2007 to determine his gross income in 2007. On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415(3) (2007),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the court did not err either by including the inheritance or by using the four-year average. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We begin with the relevant facts. Father and mother were married in 1980 and have one child, born in 1993. Their marriage was dissolved in 1998. The trial court ordered father to pay child support. Father receives income from his photography business and rental properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In 2007, father received a $75,000 cash inheritance. He used the full amount to pay down a loan that he and his domestic partner had obtained, in anticipation of the inheritance, to consolidate their debts, some of which were incurred as they built a home. The home, among other things, served as collateral for the loan. Father\u2019s payment of the inheritance toward the loan was a condition of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Shortly after father received the inheritance, the Douglas County District Attorney\u2019s Office moved to increase father\u2019s child support obligation. After a hearing, an administrative law judge increased father\u2019s child support obligation from $181 to $907 per month. Father appealed to the circuit court, which reviewed the case <em>de novo </em>pursuant to ORS 416.427(6). The court found father\u2019s monthly gross income to be $5,822 and entered a supplemental judgment requiring father to pay $633 per month in child support. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>based the $5,822 figure on father\u2019s income from the inheritance, $2,083, and from his business and rental properties, $3,739. The court calculated father\u2019s income from his inheritance by dividing the inheritance over three years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>It calculated father\u2019s income from his business and rental properties by averaging the income that was reflected on father\u2019s tax returns from 2004 to 2007: $41,968 in 2004; $41,506 in 2005; $55,204 in 2006; and $40,776 in 2007. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Under Oregon law, the amount of child support a parent must pay is determined by a procedure established by the Department of Justice pursuant to ORS 25.275.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That procedure is set forth in the Oregon Child Support Guidelines, <em>former </em>OAR 137-050-0320 - 137-050-0490.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under those guidelines, a court uses a formula to determine each parent\u2019s presumptive child support obligation. The gross incomes of the parents are factors in the formula. <em>Former </em>ORS 137-050-0330 (10/1/07). After determining each parent\u2019s presumptive obligation, a court may order a parent to pay a different amount if, in light of certain rebuttal factors established by rule, the presumptive amount is unjust or inappropriate. <em>Former </em>OAR 137-050-0333(1) (10/1/07).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6To order a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>parent to pay an amount other than the presumptive amount, a court must state the presumptive amount and explain its reasons for imposing a different amount. <em>Former </em>OAR 137-050-0333(2) (10/1/07).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">As mentioned, in this case, father argues that the trial court erred in two respects when it calculated his gross income. Specifically, father argues that the court erred by including the inheritance in his gross income and by using a four-year average to calculate his gross income. We address those arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">First, father argues that \u201cgross income\u201d as defined by <em>former </em>OAR, 137-050-0340(1) (10/1/07) does not include inheritances. That provision states that \u201cgross income\u201d includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\"><em>\u201cincome from any source including, but not limited to, </em>salaries, wages, commissions, advances, bonuses, dividends, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>severance pay, pensions, interest, honoraria, trust income, annuities, return on capital, Social Security benefits, workers\u2019 compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, disability insurance benefits, <em>gifts, </em>prizes, including lottery winnings, and alimony or separate maintenance received.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">From the text <em>o\u00ed former </em>OAR 137-050-0340(1) it is apparent that gross income is broadly defined. It includes \u201cincome from any source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The definition of gross income does not specifically include \u201cinheritances,\u201d but it does include \u201cgifts.\u201d An inheritance is a gift given at death. <em>See, e.g.,Finear and Finear, </em>240 Or App 755, 761, 247 P3d 1238, <em>rev allowed, </em>350 Or 716 (2011) (treating an inheritance like \u201cany other gift\u201d for the purposes of spousal support). Therefore, we readily conclude, based on the plain language of <em>former </em>OAR 137-050-0340(1), that gross income includes inheritances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Father argues that to determine whether an inheritance should be included in gross income, we should employ a two-part test created by the Colorado Supreme Court in <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>the Interest of A. M. D., 78 </em>P3d 741 (Colo 2003). The Colorado child support guidelines at issue in A. <em>M. D. </em>provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">\u201c \u2018 <em>\u201cGross income\u201d includes income from any source and includes, </em>but is not limited to, income from salaries; wages ...; bonuses; dividends; severance pay; pensions and retirement benefits . . . ; royalties; rents; <em>interest; </em>trust income; annuities; capital gains . . . ; <em>monetary gifts; </em>monetary prizes ...; and alimony or maintenance received.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 743 (quoting Colo Rev Stat \u00a7 14-10-115(7)(a)(I)(A) (2002)) (emphasis in A. <em>M. D.). </em>Interpreting that definition, the court held that \u201cmonetary inheritances are in fact \u2018monetary gifts\u2019 under the meaning of [the child support guidelines], and are neither future nor speculative events[.] * * * [A] monetary inheritance may be included in gross income for purposes of calculating child support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745. But, the court continued, \u201ccourts should examine the nature and use of an inheritance when deciding how much of the principal to include in gross income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746. Specifically, the court held, courts must employ a two-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cFirst, a court must decide whether an inheritance is monetary. If so, the inheritance is includable in gross income. If not, it does not fit the statutory definition of\u2018monetary gift\u2019 and this ends the analysis. The term \u2018monetary\u2019 refers to cash or \u2018[a]ssets that can be easily converted to cash,\u2019 <em>e.g., </em>money markets, mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1021 (7th ed. 1999) (defining money). * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cIf the court finds that an inheritance is monetary, it must next examine the recipient\u2019s use of the money. If the recipient uses the principal as a source of income either to meet existing living expenses or to increase the recipient\u2019s standard of living, the expended principal should be included in that year\u2019s gross income. If the monetary inheritance is saved or invested, such reserved principal is not included in gross income. As we discuss below, the interest generated by the principal is properly considered income.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\"><em>Id. </em>(brackets in A. <em>M. D.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Father argues that we should adopt Colorado\u2019s two-part test for determining whether an inheritance should be included in a parent\u2019s \u201cgross income\u201d under <em>former </em>OAR 137-050-0340(1). We decline to do so because, under Oregon\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>child support guidelines, whether income received by a parent should be included in the parent\u2019s gross income does not depend on how the income is used or whether it is readily available, although those facts may be relevant to whether the parent\u2019s presumptive child support obligation has been rebutted. <em>Halpert and Leonard, </em>157 Or App 276, 279, 970 P2d 253 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In <em>Halpert, </em>we held that the father\u2019s voluntary contribution to a 401(k) retirement account was gross income, even though it was an investment and the father would suffer adverse tax consequences if he withdrew the money from the account before he reached retirement age. We explained that \u201cOAR 137-050-0340 does not define gross income as gross taxable income; it is \u2018income from <em>any sourceLY </em>The amount of child support that is presumed to be the correct amount is determined from that gross income. It is in rebutting that amount that tax factors may be considered.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>157 Or App at 279 (emphasis and brackets in original; citations and footnote omitted). <em>See also Perlenfein and Perlenfein, </em>316 Or 16, 25, 848 P2d 604 (1993) (a parent\u2019s share of the profits of a closely held corporation constitutes income, for child support purposes, even where the parent is a minority owner and has no control over distributions; if the profits are not actually available, the parent can use that fact to rebut the presumptive child support amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Thus, gross income, as defined by <em>former </em>OAR 137-050-0340, includes \u201cincome from any source,\u201d regardless of how the income is used and how available it is. The use and availability of the income is relevant only to whether the parent\u2019s presumptive child support obligation has been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Relying on <em>Thanhouser and Thanhouser, </em>198 Or App 472, 108 P3d 667, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 407 (2005), father argues that Oregon courts have considered the use of money received by a parent when determining whether to include the money in gross income under <em>former </em>OAR 137-050-0340. In <em>Thanhouser, </em>the trial court ordered the mother to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>child support based on a gross income calculation that included $1,000 that the court found that the mother \u201cwould earn if she converted some of her existing assets into assets that would generate more income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477-78. We reversed, holding that it was error to attribute that income to the mother, at least in the absence of a plan on her part \u201cto alter the nature or form of her assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479 n 5. Father argues that <em>Thanhouser </em>establishes that \u201cwhether [an] asset is or produces gross income\u201d depends on \u201cthe parent\u2019s actual use of the asset.\u201d Father reads too much into <em>Thanhouser. </em>That case establishes only that a court cannot require a parent to convert an asset in order to increase his or her income when the parent has no plans to do so. It relates to income that <em>could be received, </em>not to income that \u2014 like the inheritance in this <em>case </em>\u2014 has <em>been received.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Here, father received a cash inheritance of $75,000 and, contrary to his argument in the trial court and on appeal, the trial court properly included the inheritance when calculating father\u2019s gross income to determine his presumptive child support obligation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject father\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In his second assignment of error, father argues that the trial court erred by averaging his income from 2004 to 2007 to determine his gross income. When determining a parent\u2019s gross income for child support purposes, a trial court must inquire into the parent\u2019s present income. <em>See, e.g., Waterman and Waterman, </em>158 Or App 267, 272, 974 P2d 256 (1999) (\u201c[T]he evidence that [the] husband worked more overtime <em>in the past </em>for a different employer is not germane to the calculation of his present gross income under the rules, in the absence of extenuating circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)). However, the court can consider past income if there is fluctuation or other reason to be concerned that the most recent year\u2019s information alone will not be accurate. <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>Gudmondson and Gudmondson, </em>145 Or App 135, 141, 929 P2d 319 (1996) (finding a three-year historical average of the husband\u2019s earnings appropriate where the husband\u2019s earnings varied from month to month and his testimony about an anticipated drop in income was not entirely credible or fully developed).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Here, father\u2019s business and rental income both vary from year to year, so averaging is appropriate. Father argues that using the average of several years artificially inflated his income because his income was declining. The trial court relied on father\u2019s tax returns from 2004 to 2007, finding his income to be $41,968 in 2004; $41,506 in 2005; $55,204 in 2006; and $40,776 in 2007.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Father does not argue that any of those figures is incorrect, and those figures do not show a downward trend sufficient, in either degree or duration, to invalidate the use of father\u2019s average income to calculate his gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Father argues that other evidence \u2014 specifically, profit and loss statements comparing January and February 2008 to the same months in 2007, and his own testimony that he has reduced his expenditures \u2014 show that his income has declined. However, that evidence is not as comprehensive or reliable as father\u2019s tax returns, and, therefore, the trial court did not err in averaging father\u2019s income, as reported on his last four tax returns, to calculate his gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\"> ORS 19.415 was amended in 2009.

Although the structure of the income provisions has changed, the new term \u201cactual income\u201d includes all the categories but one that previously made up \u201cgross income\u201d under <em>former </em>OAR 137-050-0340, including gifts.

Yrttima, </em>743 NE2d 353, 357-58 (Ind Ct App 2001) (court could \u201cdiscern no appreciable difference between one who receives property by an <em>inter vivos </em>gift and one who receives the same or similar property by testamentary transfer, nor can we discern a logical reason to include one [in gross income] and exclude the other\u201d); <em>Goldhamer v. Cohen, </em>31 Va App 728, 736-37, 525 SE2d 599, 603 (2000) (\u201cany inheritance is a gift, whether by will or intestate succession\u201d and not considering appellee\u2019s inheritance was \u201ccontrary to the express language of the statute\u201d); <em>Forsythe v.

First, it did not include \u201cgifts.\u201d Second, although it included \u201cincome from an interest in an estate or trust,\u201d it \u201cdid not include the principal of an inheritance or trust,\u201d and, therefore, according to the <em>Humphreys </em>court, \u201cit [was] logical to assume that the legislature did not intend to include the principal.\u201d 567 Pa at 620, 790 A2d at 285.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\"> In <em>Halpert, </em>we interpreted the definition of \u201cgross income\u201d in <em>former </em>OAR 137-050-0340(1) (5/1/96), the predecessor to the version of the subsection at issue in this case.

Father\u2019s only argument regarding the inheritance in the trial court and on appeal has been that the trial court erred by including the inheritance in his gross income when calculating his presumptive child support amount.
