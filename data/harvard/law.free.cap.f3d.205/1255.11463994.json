The bankruptcy judge, affirmed by the district court, held that only part of the lien could be avoided and that $24,688<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of that lien could not be avoided. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-26\">This case involves interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code. Although the precise terms of the applicable provision would call for avoidance of the entire lien, the bankruptcy court reasoned that such a reading would produce an absurd result and departed from those precise terms. <em>See In re Lehman, </em>223 B.R. 32, 34-35 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1998). We have held this to be a legitimate approach to statutory interpretation. Although statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute itself, <em>see In re Southeast Banking Corp., </em>156 F.3d 1114, 1120 (11th Cir.1998), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>a court may look beyond the plain language of a statute if applying the plain language would produce an absurd result, <em>see Hughey v. JMS Dev. Corp., </em>78 F.3d 1523, 1529 (11th Cir.1996). There was no error in the decision that a literal application of the language of the statute would violate Congressional intent and would produce an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">Briefly, these are the undisputed facts. On November 13, 1997, Lowell Lehman filed a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. At the time of the filing, VisionSpan had a judgment lien against Lehman\u2019s property in the amount of $53,-878.19. Lehman and his wife, as tenants in common, owned a home in Atlanta, Georgia valued at $225,000. Lehman\u2019s wife is not in bankruptcy and is not a debtor of VisionSpan. Lehman had only an undivided fifty-percent interest in the home. NationsBank held a first-priority mortgage on the entire interest in the home in the amount of $165,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522, sets out a statutory scheme permitting a debtor in bankruptcy to exempt certain property from his or her bankruptcy estate. For property to qualify for an exemption, it must first be part of the bankruptcy estate. If the debtor has mortgaged his or her property, the debtor has retained only an equitable interest in the property. Absent a provision providing otherwise, only that equitable interest would be property of the estate and eligible for an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">Section 522(f), however, provides a special mechanism for the debtor to \u201cavoid\u201d certain liens on property, thereby bringing the whole property within the bankruptcy estate and potentially qualifying it for an exemption. <em>See generally Owen v. Owen, </em>500 U.S. 305, 308-09, 111 S.Ct. 1833, 114 L.Ed.2d 350 (1991). To accomplish this purpose, \u00a7 522(f) provides, in basic part, that a debtor may \u201cavoid\u201d a hen to the extent it \u201cimpairs\u201d an exemption. This amount is calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-7\">(2)(A) For the purposes of this subsection, a lien shall be considered to impair an exemption to the extent that the sum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-9\">(i) the lien;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-10\">(ii) all other hens on the property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-11\">(iii) the amount of the exemption that the debtor could claim if there were no hens on the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-12\">exceeds the value that the debtor\u2019s interest in the property would have in the absence of any hens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-13\">\u00a7 522(f)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-14\">In this case, under the express language of the statute, the following calculation would be made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-15\">\u2022 Add (i) $53,878.19 (the amount of the VisionSpan judgment lien); (ii) $165,-000 (the amount of the mortgage held by NationsBank); and (iii) $5,312 (the amount of the exemption claimed by Lehman). The total of these figures is $224,190.19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-16\">\u2022 The value of Lehman\u2019s \u201cinterest in the property ... in the absence of any hens\u201d is $112,500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-17\">\u2022$224,190.19 \u201cexceeds\u201d $112,500 by $111,690.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-18\">Therefore, VisionSpan\u2019s lien would be \u201cconsidered to impair\u201d Lehman\u2019s exemption by $111,690 and Lehman could avoid it to that extent, which would permit Lehman to avoid- all of VisionSpan\u2019s hen of $53,878.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-19\">This would be the consequence of applying the precise terms of the statute: Lehman, as shown above, would avoid all of VisionSpan\u2019s hen. Lehman, however, would still have equity in the property of $30,000 (derived by subtracting the $165,-000 amount of the NationsBank mortgage from the $225,000 property value and dividing by two, to account for Lehman\u2019s one-half ownership of the property). In effect, Lehman would shield his entire equity of $30,000 from VisionSpan\u2019s hen of $53,878.19, even though Lehman was entitled to a debtor\u2019s exemption of only $5,312.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>Concluding this result would provide Lehman a windfall and would be \u201cabsurd,\u201d the bankruptcy court took the following common sense approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-4\">The value of the entire property is $225,000.00. Deducting the mortgage, $165,000.00, leaves $60,000.00 equity in the property, not accounting for Vision-Span\u2019s lien. The Debtor\u2019s half-interest in the property is therefore worth $30,-000.00. After deducting the debtor\u2019s exemption, $5,312.00, there is remaining in the property $24,688.00. [VisionSpan\u2019s] lien is in the amount of $53,879.00, which clearly impairs the Debtor\u2019s exemption. [VisionSpan] is, however, entitled to retain its lien on the unencumbered, nonexempt portion of the Debtor\u2019s property, in the amount of $24,688.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">In effect, the court was simply substituting, in the statutory formula, the <em>total value </em>of the home ($225,000) in place of Lehman\u2019s <em>interest </em>in the home in the absence of any liens ($112,500). The same outcome would also be produced by substituting the value of the NationsBank mortgage attributable to <em>Lehman\u2019s share </em>of the property ($82,500), in place of the value of the mortgage on the <em>whole </em>property ($165,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">Although a literal reading of the text of \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) would support Lehman\u2019s position, there is clear evidence that a literal interpretation would disserve the legislative intent behind the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">The legislative history demonstrates that in .1978, when Congress adopted the power of avoidance in \u00a7 522(f), its intention was only to entitle the debtor to the debtor\u2019s exemptions provided by \u00a7 522. As explained by the House Judiciary Committee in connection with the adoption of \u00a7 522(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-8\">[T]he bill gives the debtor certain rights not available under current law with respect to exempt property. The debtor may void any judicial lien on exempt property, ... [which] allows the debtor to undo the actions of creditors that bring legal action against the debtor shortly before bankruptcy. Bankruptcy exists to provide relief for an overburdened debtor. If a creditor beats the debtor into court, the debtor is nevertheless entitled to his exemptions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, at 126-27 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6087-88. The Senate Judiciary Committee report supports this interpretation of the purpose of \u00a7 522(f), stating that \u00a7 522(f) \u201cgives the debtor the ability to exempt property that the trustee recovers under one of the trustee\u2019s avoiding powers if the property was involuntarily transferred away from the debtor (such as by the fixing of a judicial lien)....\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-989, at 76 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5862.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-11\">Additional evidence is found in the legislative history to the 1994 amendments, which adopted the \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) formula. The House Judiciary Committee report states that the formula in \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) was \u201cbased upon\u201d <em>In re Brantz, </em>106 B.R. 62 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1989). H.R.Rep. No. 103-835, at 52 (1994), <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3340, 3361. The formula used by the court in <em>Brantz </em>based its calculation on the value of the \u201cproperty\u201d\u2014as opposed to the value of the \u201cdebt- or\u2019s interest in the property,\u201d as appears in \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A). <em>See Brantz, </em>106 B.R. at 68. So, too, the bankruptcy court in this case calculated lien avoidance using the value of the whole property, not the value of the debtor\u2019s interest in the property. Because the bankruptcy court essentially employed the <em>Brantz </em>formula, upon which \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) was \u201cbased,\u201d we are further persuaded that the deviation from the literal language of \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) was consistent with the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-12\">The decision to depart from the statutory language accords with the recent decision of the First Circuit in a comparable case, <em>Nelson v. Scala, </em>192 F.3d 32 (1st Cir.1999). <em>But see In re Cozad, </em>208 B.R. 495 (10th Cir. BAP 1997) (applying literal language of \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) in similar scenario).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>There was no error in declining to follow a literal application of the language of \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) which would produce an absurd result and would violate the Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AiXK\">. The bankruptcy court made a minor arithmetical error in the amount of $10. We have corrected the bankruptcy court\u2019s figures in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
