H. Charles Kanaina, the appellant, was not admissible \u201cto show the reputation among the chiefs -in former times of the claimant\u2019s (appellee\u2019s) paternity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">To this ruling the appellant excepts. We are of opinion that the testimony offered is inadmissible; because the appellant Chas. Kanaina is the real plaintiff of record, and as such, is disqualified by Section 1218 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AAgN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>A.

Stanley for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The appellant, under the Act of 1864 which allows an appeal to a jury in probate cases, made up an issue of fact to be tried, to wit: \u201c Whether Her Highness Ruth Keelikolani was sole heir-at-law of His late Majesty Kamehameha V., deceased intestate,\u201d and undertook to establish before the jury the negative of the proposition, to wit: that Her Highness was not the sole heir of Kamehameha.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">If the jury should hold that she <em>was </em>the <em>sole </em>heir, this would exclude all further claim on the part of the appellant Kanaina,</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Without the appearance of the appellant on this issue, there would be no case for the jury to decide. Mr. Kanaina is therefore a party to the record as plaintiff appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
