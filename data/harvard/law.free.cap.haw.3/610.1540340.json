But before the injunction can be granted the legal light must be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">The jurisdiction in respect to titles of real estate is in courts of common law, which Courts of Equity should hesitate to invade; especially so in the ease at bar, where the plaintiff\u2019s title is alleged to be by prescription, and this is traversed by the answer, and therefore the decision of the case depends upon facts and questions peculiarly suitable for trials at law, where parties can have a jury of the country to pass upon the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-19\">A title by prescription, if well pi-oven, is a good defense at. law, and statutes of limitation are enacted to make certain the length of time of possession which constitutes such a title.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-20\">The statute of limitations relied upon by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel (Acts of 1870, p. 28,) is entitled \u201cAn Act limiting the time within which actions may be brought to recover possession of land;\u201d and as Washburn says in his Real Property, 2 vol., p. 449, \u201c The statute of limitations in respect to lands, operates as the extinguishment of the one, though not as a gift of the estate to the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-21\">The operation of this statute would be to extinguish the remedy of the defendant in obtaining possession of the land in question, unless he brought his action within twenty years, but it does not make a gift of the estate to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-22\">The text-writers treat \u201cprescription \u201d as a plea or defense,* not as a title upon which to base a cause of action in equity.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Adb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>A. S. Hartwell for plaintiff'.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AuHE\">J. K. Unauna for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Story in Ms Equity Jurisprudence, \u00a7894, states the doctrine thus : \u201cA defense cannot be set up as the ground for a bill in equity for an injunction, which has been fully and fairly tried at law, although it may be the opinion of the Court that the defense ought to have been sustained at law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">If, however, the plaintiff in this case had successfully established this defense in \u25a0 a court of law to an action brought by the defendant for the possession of the land, he would have then some ground for asking this Court to enjoin the defendant against bringing further like suits. But it is not certain if one suit would be sufficient as the ground of an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Kerr on Injunctions, p. 184, says that \u201cthe question should depend in all eases upon the fact whether the conscience of th.e court is satisfied as to the result of the trial and not on the number of trials which may have taken place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">In the case before us, however, the only suit which has been had between the parties was the suit in trespass before the magistrate, the gist of which is injury to the possession, and where the title to the real estate could not be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The decision of the case at bar requires adjudication at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">In Great Britain it required a statute (25 and 26 Victoria, c. 42) to authorize courts of chancery to pass upon questions of law and fact, on the determination of which title to relief or remedy in equity depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">In the absence of any such statute in this country, we feel obliged to decline jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Having arrived at this conclusion, it is not necessary to examine and pass upon the proofs offered as to the plaintiff\u2019s title by prescription.
