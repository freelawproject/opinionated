The answer is the general issue. The defendants also moved the Court to dismiss the case on the ground that His Majesty the King, one of the parties plaintiff, can neither sue nor be sued in any court or tribunal of this realm. The question of law raised by this motion is reserved for the consideration of the full Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-10\">The facts in the case I find to be as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-11\">September 5th, 1869, articles of co-partnership were entered into at Honolulu, by John O.

October 8th, 1869, the following agreement was duly executed, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-4\">\u201c This agreement made and entered into this 8th day of October, 1870, by and between a certain association doing business in Lahaina, Island of Maui, Hawaiian Islands, under the name and style of the West Maui Sugar Association, parties of the first part, and Kealo, (k.) of Lahaina, Island of Maui, party of the second part, <em>witnesseth: </em>That the said party of the second part, for the consideration hereinafter mentioned, doth hereby covenant, promise and agree with the parties of the first part, that he will break up, plant and well and faithfully cultivate in sugar cane the following land situate in the District of Lahaina, Island of Maui, Hawaiian Islands, and described as follows, to wit: One parcel of land in the Ahupuaa of Apuuhua, containing 1|- acres, the property of Namaka, (k.) now occupied and cultivated by Kealo, (k.) containing one and one fourth acres or thereabouts.

Kealo was Namaka\u2019s son-in-law, and lived with him on his land directly adjoining the cane lot. Namaka died at Honolulu, October 20th, 1869, leaving a will by which all his property is devised to his widow and children. Kealo cultivated the cane after Namaka\u2019s death, and the crop sold under the agreement of October 8th, 1869, was delivered to the plaintiffs. Kealo continued to occupy and cultivate the land, and November 10th, 1870, made an oral agreement with the plaintiffs, whereby he sold them that year\u2019s crop, receiving ten dollars advance, and giving the following receipt, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-13\">\u201cReceived, Lahaina, Maui, November 10th, 1871, from the West Maui Sugar Association, the sum of ten dollars, the same being an advance upon the crop of sugar cane now being cultivated by me upon the land known as Apuuhua, said crop being hereby sold unto said Association for and at the rate of thirty-five dollars per ton for each ton of sugar produced from the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-14\">Kealo, [his X mark.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-15\">Signed and explained in the presence of E.

Eanui then applied, with Eealo, to the plaintiffs for some money, and failing to obtain this, Eanui, with her husband, proceeds to the plaintiffs and shows them the articles of agreement between Eealo and the plaintiffs. The defendants, not regarding that agreement as in force after Namaka\u2019s death or as binding on his heirs, bought the cane of them, which Eealo had planted and cultivated until a fortnight previous to this last sale; during which fortnight Eealo had not lived on the land, but Eanui and her husband had worked the cane. The defendants paid them $50, and took the following receipt, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-5\">\u201c$50. Received from Messrs.

S. Spalding,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">\n<em>For the YTest Maui Sugar Association.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">On receipt of this letter the defendants offered to make Kanui refund the $50 she had received, and to pay back the $10 which the plaintiffs had advanced to Kealo, which offer was declined. The cane was taken off by the defendants the same day, and contained fully two and one half tons of sugar, worth $250 in the market. Deducting $35 a ton, the price to have been paid Kealo, and the plaintiffs\u2019 loss is $162.50, without reckoning cost of manufacture, of which there is no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">July 15th, 1871, Kanui and her husband executed to the defendants a written lease of said land for the term of five years from April 18th, 1871, for themselves and the minor heirs, of whom they had been appointed guardians. The rent for the entire term was $80.</p>\n<p id=\"AzM\">Under the first agreement with Kealo, the plaintiffs paid him $87 for his crop, of which he paid $10 on debt of Namaka\u2019s. Soon after Namaka\u2019s death, the widow, Kanui, made a short visit at Lahaina, returning immediately to Honolulu, and at no time, until last April, appearing to object to Kealo\u2019s occupation of the premises and cultivation of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"ASE\">The defendants\u2019 counsel objected to the admissibility of the articles of agreement of October 8th, 1869, in favor of the plaintiffs, (1,) because their names do not appear therein, or (2,) to affect Namaka and his heirs, because they are not parties to the agreement. To the ruling of the Court against the first objection, exception was taken and allowed. To the further objection by the defendants\u2019 counsel, to evidence of Namaka\u2019s assent to the said agreement, on the ground that the terms of a written agreement can not be varied or en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>larged by parole, and that tbe owner\u2019s parole license to plant and sell cane for seven years on Ms land is void as within the statute of Frauds, Parts 4 and 5, Section 1053, Civil Code, the Court ruled, that a parole license to execute a written lease would,not be good, but that such license might authorize one to plant and sell a crop, provided the agreement were to be performed within one year.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"AuIJ\">Honolulu, July 25th, 1871.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In accordance with this ruling, the articles of agreement made by the knowledge and consent of Namaka are not to their full extent binding on his heirs. But the fact that Namaka allowed Kealo to occupy and cultivate the land, and assented to the contract for cultivation and sale of cane upon his land, operates to create a tenancy at will, or at least a license to plant, cultivate and sell a cane crop <em>toithin a year </em>from the making of the agreement. In either case, Kealo was entitled to the crop which he planted and worked before Namaka\u2019s death, and which in fact he delivered to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The conduct of Kanui in allowing Kealo to continue to occupy the land, and to cultivate another crop, knowing as she may be presumed to have known, the agreement of October 8th, 1869, places it out of her power either to treat Kealo as a trespasser, or to claim any right in the crop which he had raised under these circumstances. She could not by sending Kealo away from the land acquire any title to that crop, even against him, still less as against the plaintiffs, to whom he had conveyed all his title. Kanui having no legal claim on this crop, conveyed none to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Authorities for the above may be found in Washburn\u2019s Real Prop., (ed. 1868,) Washburn\u2019s Easements, Browne\u2019s Statute of Frauds, Taylor\u2019s Land and Tenant, and Parson\u2019s Contracts, but as I understand that the case will go before the full Court on all these points, I do not review them.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Judgment is ordered for the plaintiffs in the sum of one hundred and six-two dollars and fifty cents (1162.50,) and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Affirmed on Appeal to the full Court, January Term, 1872.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
