The plaintiffs claim to be children of Becky Mellish, adopted daughter of said Lawrence. The following bill of exceptions was presented:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-14\"><em>Be it remembered, </em>that on the trial of the above cause, and after the jury had been impanneled and sworn, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>plaintiffs had closed their testimony in the cause, the defendants, by their attorney, filed the following motion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\">\u201cThe defendants in the above cause, by their attorney, A. F. Judd, move that a non-suit be entered, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-6\">\u201c No written agreement of adoption of Becky by George Lawrence, has been introduced by the plaintiffs, therefore it must be an adoption before the statute of 1841, to avail the plaintiffs anything; but if the connection of Becky with George Lawrence, as an adopted or foster child, before the statute of 1841, be fully established, there is no proof or law that such was an inheriting relation ; <em>i. e., </em>that she, Becky, was the heir-at-law of George Lawrence, the deceased intestate, by virtue of being a keiki hanai,\u2019 or adopted child.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ah7\">Which' said motion being heard on argument, was, by the Court, sustained, and judgment of non-suit entered; to which opinion of the Court the plaintiffs, by their attorneys, excepted. The plaintiffs admit that they introduced no proof of -the law of inheritance before the statute of 1841, but contend that the Court was bound, judicially, to. know the law; that it was a question for the Court and not for the jury, and that if the Court was not fully informed, proper inquiry should have been instituted ; that it was proved that the relations between the parties, which formed the alleged adoption, existed prior to the statutes of 1841. It was denied in argument, by the defendants\u2019 counsel, that the law of adoption and inheritance was as plaintiffs contended ; wherefore, they pray that this, their bill of exceptions, be signed by the Courf, and certified to the Clerk of the Supreme Court, together with all the evidence, papers, and proceedings in the cause, which is done accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-7\">The foregoing bill of exceptions is hereby allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-8\">Alfred S.

This usage is denied by the defendants. The Court said they could not take notice of such a usage without express proof, which the plaintiffs did not offer. <em>*</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-7\">3 \u2014 The usage does not become law, until recognized or affirmed by a formal decision of the Supreme Court on the exact point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-8\">4 \u2014 This Court is not bound to take notice of such a usage. This government is a civilized form ingrafted upon a heathen form. This Court is founded upon statutes adopted from civilized countries; the Judges of this Court are introduced from civilized countries, and so constituted, this Court is not bound to take judicial notice of such a usage unless satisfied of its real character by testimony of persons familiar with the usage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-9\">5 \u2014 In the case of Keelikolani <em>vs. </em>Robinson, [2 Haw. R., 526, <em>et seq.,~\\ </em>the Court heard testimony in order to determine whether a son could inherit real estate from his own father, \u2014the most obvious relation of inheritance, and recognized all over the world.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-10\">6 \u2014 If the Court were bound to take notice of this usage, without proof, on the assertion of the existence of this usage on one side, and a denial of its existence on the other side, then by a similar process, the right of \u201cprimogeniture\u201d might be urged in this Court, or any other absurd custom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-11\">7 \u2014 These ancient usages, the government now being civilized, are nearly allied to \u201cforeign statutes,\u201d which must be strictly proven.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>8 \u2014 It was urged that this usage had the effect of law, and as it was denied by the other side, it became a point for the Court to decide, and was properly a ground for non-suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-5\">9 \u2014 This rule is not ascertained, as yet, and, therefore, has not the effect of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">10 \u2014 How does the Court know whether this may not be a custom peculiar to one Island of this Kingdom ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-7\">W.

Keelikolani <em>vs. </em>Robinson, <em>ubi supra; </em>Lord McKenzie\u2019s Roman Law, 1 Blaekstone\u2019s Com., p. \u2014.]</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b130-16\">Hartwell, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"A4H\">If the usages in regard to the force and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>meaning of adoption prior to 1841, had been uniform, so as to establish a custom having the force of law, in <em>all cases </em>of adoption, this case would present \u00e1 different aspect; for proof of the unwritten law of the land is never required. But no one would claim that every relation of <em>heiki hanai </em>carried the inheritance. No evidence was adduced of the ancient customs of Hawaii, on which either the Court or jury could infer an inheriting relation between L\u00e1wrenee and plaintiffs\u2019 mother. On this ground, on motion, a non-suit was ordered. The offer of evidence on the part of the plaintiffs, was too late after they had rested their case, and the defendants\u2019 motion had been made and the argument was closed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Exceptions overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
