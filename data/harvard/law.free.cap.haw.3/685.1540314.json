Kekauonohi and J. H. S. Haalelea to John Meek. It is agreed that the plaintiff represents the lessors, and the defendant the lessee in said lease. The lease is dated July 15th, 1851; its material parts are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-14\">\u201cAnd John Meek and his heirs and assigns shall occupy this land and enjoy as his own the rights and benefits belonging to it, without his occupation of said land being interfered with, for twenty-five years from this day forward.\u201d * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5s\">\u201c This lease shall commence to count (or run) from the 7th day of March, A. D. 1851, in accordance with a lease made on that day between M. Kekauonohi and John Meek and William Woud, and because William Wond has abandoned it, all of the rights belong to John Meek alone, in accordance with this lease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"A4X\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>E.

Webt <em>vs. </em>Dixon, 9 East., 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">There does not, however, appear to us to be any patent ambiguity in this lease, for although it says that the lease shall commence to run from March 7th, 1851, this may mean that rent was to be paid from that date, or it may have been inserted for the purpose of recognizing the tenancy or possession of Meek from that date, so that he could not be held liable as a trespasser. The lease then commences on the 7th of March, 1851, but it is to continue for twenty-five years from July 15th of that year, and will not therefore expire until the 15th day of July, 1876. Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
