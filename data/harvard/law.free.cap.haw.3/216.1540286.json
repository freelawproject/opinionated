No notice was given of the petition.

F. Judd, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A67\">filed the following printed brief:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">1. The Commissioners had no legal jurisdiction over this case; their powers being created by statute. Civil Code, Sections 996 and 997; Amendments in Session Laws,-I860, p. 12. It must appear that there was a \u201ccontroversy\u201d between Cleghorn and the petitioner<em>s </em>respecting rights of water.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">2. The petition in this case asks the Commissioners to regulate their rights of water; not setting forth any controversy. Cleghorn. appeared before the Commissioners in pursuance of a written notice. When before the Commissioners, there was nothing before them to show he was connected with the case; that is, there was no issue made up between Cleghorn and the petitioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">8. The Commissioners decided to give the petitioners the privilege of using the water from the \u201cKahehuna'auwai,\u201d as they had decided on the 24th of September, 1869. Now, on this 24th of September, Cleghorn was not made a party to the case, and had no notice of any proceedings, being ignorant of what the Commissioners had done, until he received a copy of their decision on the 29th September, in which they informed him, and one Kauhini, that they \u201chad merged their respective water rights, and had given them the right to use the water during the first half of every Friday, from 6 o\u2019clock A. m. till 12 o\u2019clock M.,\u201d and the water for the last half of Fridays they had given to other parties, and had granted them certificates therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-8\">4. The Commissioners have no power to change or affect, and more especially, they have no power to diminish or take away an easement to land, such as the right to use water for irrigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-9\">5. The deduction from this decision of the Commissioners is, that the water <em>belongs </em>to' them, and that they have the right to apportion it out as they please.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-10\">6. The petitioners\u2019 lands, for which they ask the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>sioners to give them water, are all kula land \u2014 dry, and never before cultivated in kalo, or irrigated. They make no pretense that they have a right to water for these lands by prescription. In Peck <em>et al. vs. </em>Bailey, Chief Justice Allen decided that kula land had no right to water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-4\">7. The effect of this decision of the Commissioners is to take the water peaceably enjoyed by Cleghorn\u2019s land for a long period of years, at any rate in his possession, and give it to lands not entitled to water; that is, to take an easement from one land and give it to a land remote from it, and not entitled to it by prescription.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AQQ\">Honolulu, March 2d, 1870.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b222-5\">Hartwell, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AJt\">The statute, as amended by Act of 1860, reads thus: \u201cIt shall be the duty of such Commissioners * * to hear and determine all controversies respecting rights of ways and rights of water between private individuals,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The Commissioners\u2019 duties are of a judicial nature, and require them first to hear, then determine. The appellant being no party to the original controversy, and having no notice thereof, his rights were not affected by the first award. But it does not follow that the subsequent action of the Board, when the appellant became a party of his own accord, was therefore null and void. The award made by the Board after they had jurisdiction of the matter, has force, not as confirming its previous void award, but because jurisdiction had attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">But the evidence, as reported by the Commissioners, fails to sustain, or to tend to sustain, the award. The right to use water is an easement in land, to be gained only by grant or prescription. The evidence merely shows the opinions of witnesses as to the rights of the parties. For this reason without deciding the point made by counsel concerning kula land, the award must be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
