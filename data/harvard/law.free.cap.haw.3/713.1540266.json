B. Dole for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ak_\">A. S. Hartwell for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">It is apparent from the record that the jury did not sustain the deed of the defendants, and as they found for the plaintiffs, it must be inferred that they found as proven all the facts necessary to make out the plaintiffs\u2019 case, and that they did not find the prescription of the defendants as proven, in spite of their disbelieving the witness Keliikanakaole.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">We cannot, on a writ of error, invade the province of the jury and say that they formed wrong conclusions from the testimony, when the testimony upon which they based their conclusions does not come up as a part of the record, and in reviewing the authorities on this point we can find no ease where a writ of error has been allowed for this purpose. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
