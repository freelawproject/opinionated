The said Chung Hoon was absent from Honolulu on the arrival of the schooner, but his clerk requested the defendant to deliver him the money, to which the defendant replied, that the money was deposited with Foster &amp; Co., the agents and owners of the schooner. The clerk went several times to the office of the agents without finding them, and the money was not delivered as agreed. The suit was brought for nondelivery. The defendant\u2019s counsel claimed that the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>action was in the consignee, Chung Hoon, and not in the consignor ; also, that the circumstances show no conversion of the money by the defendant, but show that he had done all that was reasonable in delivering the money to the schooner\u2019s owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-4\">The Court, Allen, C.

There is no inference in the case that the property had passed to the consignee, rather-the contrary, if any presumption were made. The carrier was of the consignor\u2019s choosing, and the money was- not sent on an order by the consigned. Re-delivery, to the Consignor would be a good defense to a suit by the consignee. There is privity of contract between the consignor and the defendant, and an action lies for breach thereof. The declaration is sufficient for an action of contract. \u2014 Smith\u2019s Merc.
