Bailey.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b767-11\">A lease without the words \u201cand to his executors, administrators, &amp;e., is a chattel interest and passes to personal representatives of the lessee deceased.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b767-12\">OPINION BY</p>\n<author id=\"Avn\">JUDD, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">This case comes from the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit, on a point of law reserved at the request of the parties, in substance as follows: \"Whether a lease by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>defendant\u2019s grantor to one Kaiaholokuaau, plaintiff\u2019s deceased intestate, was determined by the death of said intestate, the lease being for nine years, and containing no words of limitation, as \u201chis executors, administrators,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The general doctrine is clear that an estate for years is a chattel interest, and passes to personal representatives. See 1 Washburn, R. P. p. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">In 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Cruise R. P. title YIN., p. 246, it is laid down \u201cthat estates for years do not descend to the heir of the person who died possessed of them; but vest in his executors, or administrators like any other chattel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">See also Id. p. 255. \u201cEstates for years being chattel interests and vesting in executors or administrators, are subject to the payment of simple contract debts, and are also liable to be sold by execution for the payment of debts due by judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">\u201cA lessee may part with his whole term unless restrained by a particular agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Now, if a lease for years containing no covenant not to assign, and not containing words of limitation to executors, administrators or assigns \u2014 were so assigned, such an assignment, if defendant\u2019s position be sound, would be defeated by the death of the assignor, after he had parted with his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">In Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, S. 434, we find it laid down: \u201cSo if a lease be made to a man for twenty years, without naming his executors, administrators or assigns, the executor or administrator shall, notwithstanding, have it during the term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">Shepherd\u2019s Touchstone, 468 is cited to sustain this.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">We find a note in 1 Washburn, R. P. p. 313, as follows: \u201c It is usual in a lease to demise to the lessee his executors and administrators;\u2019 but such words of limitation are unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">We are not aware that this law has ever been disputed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>and accordingly order judgment to be entered on the verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQ6l\">E.
