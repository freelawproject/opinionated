The evidence showed that Kapo and the defendant were co-heirs, and that the defendant had held possession since the ancestor\u2019s death in 1852, whereupon the plaintiffs asked verdict for a moiety only. There was no evidence of rents and profits. A special verdict accordingly was taken, and the plaintiffs now move for judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-8\"><em>W. </em>C. Jones and A. F.

It is also true that the defendant went to trial not on the amended issue but on the issue of the plaintiffs being sole owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Actual ouster is always said to be required before a co-tenant can bring ejectment; but it may be inferred by long occupancy with claim of exclusive ownership. If the demandant claim as sole heir, and the tenant fail to suggest that he claims but a moiety, I think the demandant may treat Mm as claiming the whole, and as a disseizor of whatever portion he may himself be entitled to.

Com. Dig., 36; Booth\u2019s Real Actions, 204, 214, 219; Inglis <em>vs. </em>Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor, 3 Pet.,\u2014and cases there cited; Heyer <em>vs. </em>Dunning, 3 Johns. Cas., 103; Great Falls Co. <em>vs. </em>Wooster, 15 N. H., 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">And further : there are principles of pleading which do not rest on statute on which this matter may safely rest. It is true, as the defendant now admits the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of a moiety, that judgment is only necessary to carry costs. Our statutes also provide for only two kinds of answers, demurrers and general denials, and allow any matters of defence to be given under the latter. But special pleas in bar or in abatement and motions to dismiss are common in practice and frequently serve to avoid expense and. delay, and to present points of law seasonably and with precision. Special pleas may always be made, under our practice, and it is just that if a party fail to plead specially what is peculiarly within his own knowledge, he should pay the costs which he might have avoided. A party is always presumed to know the particulars of his own title and not to know those of his adversary. The presumption rests on the fact that such is usually the case. He can, if he like, set forth those particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>lars, disclaiming or pleading non-tenure of all else; He thereby narrows the issue and enables his adversary to modify or withdraw the claim. The plaintiffs recited their pedigree and the defendant omitted to do so. The plaintiffs\u2019 pedigree is proved as recited, but the additional fact, not presumed to have been known by them and presumably known by the defendant appears, that the defendant is also an heir. I think it is the defendant\u2019s fault that the issue was not narrowed, and a trial thereby avoided.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"AC00\">Honolulu, November 29th, 1871.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Arch.
