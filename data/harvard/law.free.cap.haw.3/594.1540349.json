L. Austin, in cases of affreightment very similar to this, was decisive of the responsibility of the defendant in this matter, and rightly so. And now the question arises as to whether the note of Messrs. Walker &amp; Allen to the plaintiff extinguished any part of the debt of Spencer to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">If the creditor agrees to accept the promissory note of a third party in satisfaction of this debt, it would be an ex-tinguishment of the debt; but the mere taking of the note without such an express agreement is not an extinguishment of the debt. (1 New Hm. p. 281). We\u2019can conceive of cases where persons taking notes of agents of plantations for freights would lose their hold upon the owners of the plantation, as for instance where a proprietor of a plantation had a large credit account with his agent, and was always ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>and willing to pay his freight, and supposing it to be paid, and by the bankruptcy of his agent became a loser, then the note of the agent thus taken would become a satisfaction of the debt by reason of the negligence of the creditor in not presenting his dem\u00e1nd and collecting it from the principal. 1 New Ham. p. 282. Wright <em>vs. </em>First Crockery Ware Co.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AfW\">A. S. Hartwell, for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AiR\">R. H. Stanley, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<otherdate id=\"b600-13\">Honolulu, January 30th, 1875.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"A22\">In Monroe <em>vs. </em>Hoff, 5 Denio, 363, (see likewise Tobey <em>vs. </em>Barker, 5 Johns 72), it is said \u201cthe doctrine now is, that if the note of a third person is taken either for goods sold at the time of making the contract, or for an antecedent debt, it is not considered a payment unless agreed to be taken as a payment.\u201d Many authorities might be quoted to the same effect, and we believe this to be the generally accepted doctrine. In this case it does not appear that there was any agreement by the plaintiffs to take the note of Walker &amp; Allen in satisfaction of Spencer\u2019s debt to them, and therefore we do adjudge that the said note,,is not a legal set off to the plaintiffs\u2019 demand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
