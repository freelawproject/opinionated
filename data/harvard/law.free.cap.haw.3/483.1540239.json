The law does not require impossibilities, but if various statutes are apparently contradictory, that construction should be made which avoids absurdity, or an inference that the Legislature intended to act unconstitutionally. . With one statute requiring that a suit be brought in \u201c the manner required by law,\u201d within six years from the time the right of action accrues, and another which declares that no suit at all could be brought by reason of the debtor being beyond the reach of the law, the correct conclusion is, that until the suit can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>legally be brought, the former statute does not take effect. The statute cannot run unless the cause of action is itself running, or accruing. \u201cAll Statutes of Limitations must proceed on the idea that the party has had an opportunity to try his right in the Courts.\u201d Cooley\u2019s Const. Limits, 866. By any other ruling, the plaintiff\u2019s right of action is taken away \u201c without due process of law,\u201d and he has not the \u201cprotection of property\u201d guaranteed by the Constitution. It was held by this Court that the statute does not run during the time intervening between the death of an intestate and the appointment of his administrator.
