The case was submitted on the following agreed facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-13\">The plaintiff claims under a lease from the Princess Victoria Kamamalu and M. Kekuanaoa, dated January 1st, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>1864, for the term of twenty years from its date, which lease was duly acknowledged, and recorded March 39, 1864.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">The defendants are in possession of the premises, the annual rental and profits of which are five dollars, and have held possession thereof since April 11, 1865, under a deed of conveyance from Charles C. Harris, Trustee of the said Princess Victoria Eamamalu, dated April 11, 1865, which deed was duly acknowledged and recorded on the day of its date. The said Charles C. Harris made and executed the said deed under and by virtue of a deed of trust from the said Princess Victoria Eamamalu to him, dated April 9, 1864, and duly acknowledged and recorded April 11, 1864, which said deed of ti\u2019ust conferred the power to collect and pay debts, but gave no express power of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">The plaintiff made demand upoxx the defendants for possessioxx before the action was bx\u2019ought.

It is unnecessary to consider the validity of the trustee\u2019s conveyance under his power, although it would seem that the defendants received good legal title. See Goodrich <em>vs. </em>Proctor, 1 Cray, 569; Parker <em>vs. </em>Converse, 5 Ib., 336; Baldwin <em>vs. </em>Timmins, 3 <em>Ib., </em>302.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u25a0 But the trustee coxxld coxxvey no better title, and no larger estate, than his beneficiary had, and his deed only purports to convey \u201call her estate, right, title, interest, property, possession, claim and demand. \u201d The estate which remained in the Princess Victoria, or ixx those holding under her, during the continuaxxce of the lease, was an estate in reversion, axxd the defendants, as graxxtees of the reversion, have an estate in remainder, which will entitle them to possession only upoxx the termination of the lease.
