The plaintiff' Paahana, claims that it left this property of Kenao\u2019s to the devisees named as joint-tenants, and that on the decease of Haliata and Ninia the property vested in Paahana as the survivor; the defendant claims that the will of Kenao left the estate to Haliata in fee, with an estate for life in Paahana and Ninia, and that Ninia having died, by the will of Haliata the fee is now in the defendant subject only to the life estate of Paahana.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>At the last term of this Court when this submission was first presented, it was suggested to counsel, that the fact, which appeal\u2019s in the agreed statement, that the real estate, the subject matter of this controversy, was conveyed to 'Kenao and Ilaliata his wife, might be decisive of the rights of the parties in this case. But it is urged by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the submission asked for the construction of Kenao\u2019s will only, and that the Court is limited to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Section 1140 of the Civil Code authorizes parties to a question in difference which might be the question of a civil action in the Supreme Court, to agree upon a ease containing the facts upon which the controversy depends, and present a submission of the same, etc., etc.' The question in difference of course is the rights of the parties to the submission in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Now it seems to us that where the submission of \u201cthe facts of the case\u201d discloses a fundamental question, decisive of the rights of the \u201cparties to the question in difference,\u201d the Court must consider it, notwithstanding it may not be the particular question which the parties have put at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In the submission before us it would be labor uselessly expended for the Court to construe the will of Kenao with the liability of being obliged (as soon as the ease could be brought) to decide that no estate vested in Kenao capable of being devised by will. We consider, therefore, that the title of Kenao in the property is fairly raised by the statement in the submission, that the premises \u201cwere conveyed to Kenao and Ilaliata his wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">In Washburn on Real Property, p. 278, the author says, \u201cin consequence of the theoretic unity and entirety of the ownership of husband and wife in respect to their interest in lands, they cannot take by purchase in moieties, and where laud was conveyed .to hold in common and not in joint tenancy, they were held to take an entirety of estate without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>regard to the intent. They are not properly joint tenants of such lands, since, though there is' a right of survivorship, neither can convey so as to defeat this right in the other. Each takes an entirety of the estate.\u201d (See also Schouler Dom. Rel. p. 288.)</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A2fs\">S. B. Dole for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AAD\">Cecil Brown for defendant.</attorneys>\n<otherdate id=\"b731-9\">Honolulu, November 2d, 1876.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The view that a conveyance of land to husband and wife and their heirs, vests the entirety in each of them and upon the death of one the survivor takes the whole estate, is abundantly supported by Q. Blackstone Cow. 182; Co. Litt. 187; Wight <em>vs. </em>Selden, 20, N. Y. 320; Jackson <em>vs. </em>Stevens, 16, Johnson\u2019s 110; Barber <em>vs. </em>Harrie, 15, Wend. 615; Doc <em>vs. </em>Howland, 8 Cow. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The death of Kenao vested the entire estate in Haliata the survivor, who is now represented by Bila the defendant. Paahana takes nothing by Kenao\u2019s will, for there was nothing for him to devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Judgment for defendant, but costs to be paid by him, as he might have taken this position earlier and saved the plaintiff the expense of an action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
