'</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">It may be a convenience to this Court, in many cases, to have everything before them in a bill of exceptions, ,but it is not made a part of the duty of Circuit Judges to allow or refuse bills of exceptions to their rulings in Chambers. It was \"argued that the appeal allowed by' the statutes applies to cases which have been finally decided, and not to rulings like that in question. But by Section 100T, Civil Code, this very case is provided for : \u201c Provided, always, that where such appeal is taken solely upon exceptions to the decision of the Circuit Judge on points of law, the appeal shall be heard and determined by the Appellate Court <em>in banco.\u201d </em>The same Act restricts the time within which such appeal, whether on the law or merits, shall be made, to ten days. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>This Court can entertain jurisdiction of cases appealed from the rulings or decisions of Circuit Judges in Chambers, only when this provision as to time is strictly complied with. It was not complied with in this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_P\">Attorney General S. H. Phillips for the Crown.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AlZ\">J.
