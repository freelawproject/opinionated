The point made by defendant on the warranty of Palekaluhi, we do not regard as tenable; the jury will however be directed that if Palekaluhi was the only son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>of Maraea, the plaintiff' cannot recover; for even admitting that Xamaha was trustee for Maraea, the trustee or his heirs could not eject Maraea or her heirs or assigns from the occupation of the land, since he held only for her and her heirs.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab9J\">J.
