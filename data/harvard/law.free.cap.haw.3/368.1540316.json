The defendant was adopted by Kahele and Kaumebameha in 1887, as their son and heir, and was always treated by them as such. Kaumehameha died intestate in 1850 or 1860, leaving as her kindred the plaintiff Loe, sister of her father, and the plaintiff Kaawalauole, son of a brother of her father. After Kahele\u2019s death the widow married Kahoinea, who survived her, and left issue the plaintiff Kiaiaina, by a subsequent wife. The defendant has held possession since Kaumehameha\u2019s death, but there was no direct evidence of the receipt of rents and profits.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AlA\">A. F.

And as it appears that he is now in possession of the property, he is entitled to judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Let judgment therefore be ordered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
