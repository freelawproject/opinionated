The client alleges that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>former counsel did not understand him; there is no affidavit here on the part of the former counsel that there was an honest and mutual mistake between them, and that from want of the client\u2019s knowledge of English he (the counsel) failed to understand him. Further, if the client had misgivings that he was not making the counsel comprehend him, while giving his instructions, or during the progress of the trial, it was incumbent upon him to procure an interpreter between them, and the neglect to procure one is negligence the consequences of which we will not relieve.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AtCo\">W.

Hartwell counsel for defendant and for exceptions.</attorneys>\n<otherdate id=\"b594-11\">Honolulu, January 18th, 1875.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\"We do not consider the affidavit of the client alone as sufficient proof of such misunderstanding, and must deny the motion on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">It therefore does not become necessary to consider whether the testimony disclosed in the other affidavits is material and necessary and not cumulative, for it is not contended that it is newly discovered, and it is apparently conceded that it was available, and could have been produced at the former trial had the counsel understood his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">A motion is also made in arrest of judgment on the ground that the verdict is so defective in form, that no judgment can be pronounced upon it. The verdict in favor of the plaintiff was for the sum of $475.00, <em>\u201cand the note of </em>$100,\u201d which must mean the note of $100 upon which testimony had been taken before the jury, and which was decided by them to be the property of the plaintiff. We do not consider such a verdict defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Exceptions overruled and judgment on the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
