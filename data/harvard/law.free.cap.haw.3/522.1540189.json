This certainly would have been for the widow a much better mode of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The account brought up in a little different order from that in which it is presented would stand thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">Cr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">Cash proceeds of real estate at Pauoa, sold at auction............$ \u2022 915 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">Cash from Maikai\u2019s father..................................................... 20 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">Cash from the widow............................................................ 72 25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">Dr. $1,007 25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">Cash paid debts secured by mortgage on the land....................$758 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-12\">Debt Lewers &amp; Dickson........................................................... 13 50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-13\">\u2022Costs of Court incidental to procuring the order of sale............ 21 60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-14\">Advertising notice to creditors, there being only one, for</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-15\">$13.50, in addition to those secured by mortgage................. 2 50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-16\">$795 50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-17\">Credit, brought forward............................................. $1,007 25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-18\">Debt, \u201c \u201c .............................................$795 50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-19\">Gash for registry of a deed of the land and release of mortgage which the widow would not care whether it was released or not under the eircum- ' stances of this case............................................. 6 50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-21\">Administrator\u2019s commissions...........................$91 50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-22\">Fees as a lawyer for his legal services............... 50 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-23\">- Ml 50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-24\">Commissions and expenses of auctioneer in sale of \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-25\">the land.....,........................................................ 63 75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-26\">--$1,007 25</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-27\">If the Court had to review the whole account it is a matter of doubt whether they would allow the auctioneer\u2019s commissions in this case. They would allow some remuneration for an auctioneer in ease the estate appeared to be benefitted by his exertions, but the statute allows the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>trator himself to sell at public auction; and it is most certainly his duty to make all preparations for a sale, such as preparing descriptions of land, examining title and making abstract of it, making the deeds, collecting, and finally paying out the money. One would think that it would be very easy to make a bargain with the auctioneer to \u201ccry the estate\u201d even if his services should appear to be at all necessaiy.</p>\n<p id=\"ATJ\">It is difficult to see why two commissions should be paid, more especially when the statute commission paid to the administrator is so large as it is, by our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AsU\">Certainly the administrator did not receive at any time the gross sum which the land brought, but received it less the $63.75 chai\u2019ged for auctioneer\u2019s commissions and expenses, so there is no reason why he should receive a commission of $6.37 on that sum. But we do not-think ourselves called upon to review items not brought up on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AHs\">The Court would allow professional charges for services rendered to the estate in all. cases where such services are necessary; and would allow them to the administrator if he should be a lawyer, whensoever they would allow them to an administrator who is not a lawyer. With regard to such allowances every case must stand by itself and no fixed- and invariable rule can be laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"A_6\">But in this case it is apparent that the administration was and could be of no benefit to the widow, who must pay these fees. If the creditors applied to counsel for advice they should pay their own counsel fees,</p>\n<p id=\"A0K\">If the widow applied, she should have been advised as set forth above; or to offer creditors to join in the sale; or to allow the mortgage to be foreclosed; and thus avoid these excessive commissions; and in case that foreclosure had been resorted to, the residuum, if there should have been any, might have been paid into Court to await her further action,</p>\n<p id=\"Af1\">The counsel\u2019s fees cannot therefore be allowed in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The administrator may be discharged and his bond cancelled, whenever he shall furnish the receipt of the widow for the said sum of $50.00 and pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AAE\">S.
