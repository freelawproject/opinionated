There was evidence to substantiate the writings above referred to, of the receipt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>$500 rent by George Davis, October 3th, 1870, and of tenders subsequently made to him and refused.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-5\">W. C. JONES, EOR PLAINTIFF.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">I. The first lease is void and conveyed only an estate at will. The only act that gave it even that force was the acceptance of rent and the lessee\u2019s occupancy. Our Statute of Frauds, Section 1053, Civil Code, is but a modification of the English Statute of 29, Car. II. c. 3, and leases in writing not made pursuant to that Statute conveyed a mere estate at will. A tenant under a void lease is a tenant at will. Taylor\u2019s Land, and Ten. Sections 28 60.1. Term, 83. 1. Term, 20.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">There was no power of attorney to George Davis, no consideration in the lease to John Davis, and no satisfaction therein which is binding on him. Green testified that he merely asked John to sign the lease because he was in the habit of doing business for his father. The receipt was evidently signed by John for the same reason. There is no evidence that he received any money as a consideration. His receipt of rent under a void lease only created an estate at will or sufferance. 1. Term, 83.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">H. The fee was in John when the lease was made, June 17th, 1868, and his deed was recorded before the lease. Possession follows ownership and gives a right to maintain trespass. Taylor\u2019s Land, and Ten. Section 86, 785, 11 Johns., 385, <em>lb., </em>86; 184. 13 Me., 236. 7 N.

The plaintiff always had <em>actual </em>possession. His notice by himself or agent was enough to terminate a tenancy at sufferance or will, and amounts to re-entry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-12\">HI. The statute of summary proceedings to recover possession was not intended for leases like this. The landlord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>may re-enter if he can do so peaceably. 4 Allen, 118; 14 Mass., 490; 19 Pick., 82, 575. The acts of the plaintiff\u2019s agent were sufficient to enable him to maintain trespass against the defendant. 1 Pick., 43; 17 Pick., 264. The plaintiff could re-enter on breach of condition. 13 Wend., 535; 6 B &amp; C., 518; Taylor\u2019s Land, and Ten., Section 492; Wirt <em>vs. </em>Phillips, 1 Haw., 16.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">IV. The lease by its terms was forfeited for non-payment of rent, and the plaintiff was remitted to possession on declaring the forfeiture and re-entry, and the defendant became a trespasser from that time. The plaintiff\u2019s acts declaring his intention perfected the forfeiture. 1 Hil., Real Prop., 369; Co. Lit., 202a. No place to pay rent is specified, and it was the lessee\u2019s duty to pay on the land, or on that island. The lessors were not required to hunt up the lessee elsewhere. No further demand for $200 rent first due was needed, as payment was expressly refused, unless on certain conditions. The demands made were sufficient. The nature of a demand must be governed by the circumstances. A horizontal rule requiring an impossibility is absurd. A demand on this wild land, where the lessee did not reside, would only be made to the idle wind. There was a waiver of demand by consent. 43 N. II., 213.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-10\">V. A lessee cannot <em>discharge himself </em>of his obligations. Taylor\u2019s Land, and Ten., 317. There is no privity between the lessor and sub-lessee. Ib., 448. No notice was given to the lessor of the assignment, and he is not affected by it. Ib., Sections 381, 382, 524. The failure to give due notice of the assignment of the lease amounts to a waiver of demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-12\">VI. George Davis\u2019 receipt from the Grazing Company, October 3d, 1870, after the forfeiture declared and re-entry, does not bind the plaintiff, and cannot be construed as a waiver of forfeiture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-13\">VII.

There were three cases of forfeiture for non-payment. Equity would not relieve where there was such gross neglect. Eight hundred dollars was due September 24th, 1870, when a forfeiture was declared, and was not paid until after the forfeiture. Three hundred dollars payable also on that day, was not tendered until after October 3d, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">IX.

The plaintiff had notice Of this lease, and of the possession under it. The lease is therefore good against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-10\">IV. It is clear that the deed from George Davis to John is not <em>bona fide, </em>as appears by the grantor\u2019s receipts of rent and his demands therefor, and appointment of Asegut as agent of the land, also by his letters referring to him elf as well -as John, as still owner. Such acts of ownership would not have been permitted or undertaken if the deed had been understood as a <em>bona fide </em>conveyance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-11\">V. It is claimed that the second lease was substituted for the first. Green testified that it was intended to carry out in a more formal manner the first agreement. If the second lease be void, it can not be substituted. The second lease is good, because on the same day with taking the conveyance, the plaintiff signed a paper assenting to what had been or might thereafter be done, and received rent under the second lease. This is sufficient memorandum in writing within our Statute of Frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>VI.

The plaintiff took the deed of the land from his father with full knowledge of the prior lease then in force. This appears from the testimony of Green and from the evidence that he resided on the land, and jointly with Green and his father, occupied the premises for pasturage during the continuance of the lease, and for several years previous. Such knowledge is alone sufficient in equity to put a person on the inquiry as to the term of the occupancy. Cunningham <em>vs. </em>Potter, 99 Mass., 252. The plaintiff\u2019s written acknowledgment of his father\u2019s authority concerning the lease, made on the same day with the deed, is alone conclusive on the point of knowledge. Our statute of registry provides that leases for more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>than one year shall be recorded, or be \u201c void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration, not having actual notice.\u201d Civil Code, Section 1262. Nothing in the statutes invalidates an unrecorded lease as against a subsequent purchaser with notice. We have not reenacted the third section of the English Statute of Frauds giving to deeds and leases not in writing, signed, &amp;e., the effect of conveying only estates at will, but merely that '\u201cno action shall be brought and maintained,\u201d in such cases. \u201c unless the promise, contract, or agreement upon which such action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing, and be signed by the party to be charged therewith, or by some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\u201d <em>Ib., </em>Section 1053. The consideration need not be expressed in writing, but may be proved by any other legal evidence. <em>Ib., </em>Section 1054. Hence a lease within these statute requirements is good against a purchaser with notice. This construction in equity, and finally in law, was judicially made in England and America, even before the clause excepting this class of purchasers was enacted. Dole <em>vs. </em>Thurlow, 12 Met., 164; Thompson <em>vs. </em>Blanchard, 3 N. Y., 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The rights of the assignees of a reversion to bring an action on the covenants or to claim a forfeiture on the breach of the covenants of a prior lease, and the rights of the lessor to re-enter after assigning the reversion, may not be clear under our statute. The common law did not allow a chose in action, as a right of entry, to be assigned. Hence when the Crown, in the time of Henry VIII, granted away the monasteries, the grantees found that they could sue in the name of the grantors for breach of covenants in the lease, but that neither they nor the grantors who had parted with the estate could re-enter and defeat the leases for breach of conditions. It was only by Statute 32, Henry VIH, c. 24, that grantees of reversions obtained the previous rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>action held by the grantors. It is unnecessary now to pursue this question further. In Brewer <em>vs. </em>Chase, at the July Term, 1869, it was, however, settled that our statute remedy to recover possession of land is cumulative to the previous remedy by ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"A3D\">But the plaintiff claims that if the first lease was good as against himself, the second is not, and that the substitution of the second lease works a surrender of the first, and further, that his consent, indorsed on the second lease, being without consideration, had no other effect, than to make the lessee his tenant at will or sufferance. This view is unsound for several reasons. A prior lease may be regarded as surrendered in law upon the mutual execution of a second, but this is only by reason of the intention of the parties themselves. It is absurd ,to suppose they intended to substitute a void for a valid lease. Schafflin <em>vs. </em>Carpenter, 15 Wend., 400; Flagg <em>vs. </em>Dow, 99 Mass., 98; Van Renssellaer <em>vs. </em>Penniman, 6 Wend., 569; Springstein <em>vs. </em>Schermerhorn, 12 John., 357. \u201cWhere parties enter into a contract which would have the effect of rescinding a previous one, but which can not operate according to their intentions, the new contract shall not operate to affect, the previously existing rights.\u201d Noble <em>vs. </em>Ward, 2 Eng. Exch., (1867) 137. Moreover, the evidence shows a legal agreement between the plaintiff and lessee, on full consideration, that the latter should hold under the terms of the substituted lease. If we admit that no other consideration, such as the plaintiff\u2019s acknowledgment of his father\u2019s power to lease, can be shown for the deed than that which is expressed in the deed, or if shown that it could not affect the subsequent lease, it is a fair inference, and one that we can not avoid, that the plaintiff\u2019s assent to the second lease was given on consideration of the advantages he would receive from its terms, which would give him rights of residence and pasturage not secured by the first lease, and of the receipt, jointly with his father, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u00a71,000, as rent under the second lease, given and accepted on the day it was executed. This was a legal contract, which binds the plaintiff to allow the lessee to hold under the second lease, but it gives him no rights as a lessor, and in no aspect of the case, does it make the lessee a tenant at will or sufferance.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Assuming that the grantor of the reversion could, by our law, take such steps as would defeat this lease for breach of condition to pay rent, so that the plaintiff would be entitled to treat the lessee and those holding under him as trespassers, let us inquire, (1,) whether there was a breach of condition, and (2,) whether legal steps were thereupon taken to work a forfeiture. Rent due and payable in advance September 24th, 1869, and again March 24th, 1870, was not then paid, but no demand therefor was made until the lessor\u2019s letter of August 20th, 1870, delivered to' Green by Berrill previous to September 24th, then following, by his letter of September 19th, 1870, and by his agent Asegut\u2019s letter of September 24th. presented to Green by Lett, October 1st. The second letter of the plaintiff refers to the previous bill sent by Berrill, hence no demand was made for the advance rent of September 24th until October 1st, when demand was made by an agent of whose appointment the lessee had received no notice from the lessor personally. The demands of August 20th and September 19th were certainly not made as the law requires, which insists that the demand be made at some time before sunset on the day the rent is payable. Chapman <em>vs. </em>Harney, 100 Mass., 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Besides, these demands were satisfied by the lessor\u2019s' unconditional acceptance, October 3, of the rent accrued to September 24, which must be held to be a waiver of forfeiture previously claimed. Stuyvesant <em>vs. </em>Davis, 9 Paige, 427. There would be difficulty in holding the demand of October 1st, by letter of Asegut of September 24th, as legal, in point of time, precision, or due notice of Asegut\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>appointment; but if we admit that this demand, under all' the other circumstances of the case, was sufficient, or that the less\u00e9e\u2019s previous refusal to pay on the ground that he had assigned the lease, dispensed with the necessity of further demand, there is no ground on which a notice to quit, or some acts from which such notice can clearly be inferred, can be dispensed with. The estate held under a lease for years with provisions for re-entry and forfeiture on breach of covenant to pay rent, is a conditional limitation, which is defeasible at the lessor\u2019s option, and is not aii estate determinable <em>ipso </em>facto, on such breach. Fifty Associates <em>vs. </em>Howland, 11 Met. 99; Attorney General <em>vs. </em>Merrimack M\u2019l Co., 14 Gray, 584. Such an, estate is forfeited only on the landlord giving the tenant clear notice that he intends to claim the forfeiture, and at what time the tenant must quit, or become a trespasser.

B., (1868,) 573. Would the lessee safely have acted on any notice from Asegut? It must be observed also that there was a joint occupation by the parties, so that there could be no actual entry by the lessor short of evicting the lessee. \u201cWhen the party who is to perform the condition, and the party for whom it is to be performed, are jointly in possession, it is said that the latter must make claim for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>breach by. acts and words, or either such as will distinctly admonish the granter that possession will be retained for the breach and not waived.\u201d 1 Hillard\u2019s Real Pr., 867, and see Rollins <em>vs. </em>Riley, 44 N. H., 13. Was the notice against trespassers posted in public places near the residence of the lessee\u2019s agent or assignee, and published in the newspaper, sufficient to notify the lessee and those holding under him that a forfeiture was claimed? Clearly not. This general warning against trespass was served on no person; it was such a notice as either occupant might give during the tenancy without intending the other. Notice that a forfeiture is claimed should be brought home to the lessee, and we think it should also allow him a reasonable time to remove his property before being treated as a trespasser. See Pratt <em>vs. </em>Farrar, 10 Allen, 520, and besides previous citations,- 1 Am. Law Rev., 271; 1 Washburn\u2019s Real Pr.
