He has recovered a judgment for the value of the coat, from which judgment the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">It appears without contradiction that the defendant had printed upon its bill of fare the words, \u201cNot responsible for personal property unless checked at the desk,\u201d and that signs with these words plainly printed thereon were suspended upon the walls at various places in the room. It was also shown that the defendant had a checking system for the safe-keeping of the coats and hats of its patrons. There was no negligence shown on the part of the defendant, and in the absence of such proof the plaintiff cannot recover. Schneps v. Strum, 25 Misc. Rep. 168, 54 N. Y. Supp. 140; Harris v.
