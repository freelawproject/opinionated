More than a month thereafter an application was made for an order appointing a referee to take the affidavits of certain persons named to be used upon the hearing of another motion by the Esseff Realty Company to be relieved from its bid upon the same grounds which were made the basis of the preceding application. That motion was denied, and from the order of denial this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The order must be affirmed. No permission was given to renew the previous motion. It appears from the moving papers that the evidence sought to be obtained through these affidavits is not of the character of newly discovered evidence, but that an attempt is to be made to retry a question once litigated and decided adversely to the moving party by calling further witnesses to testify as to facts involved in the original controversy and determined therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The order must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
