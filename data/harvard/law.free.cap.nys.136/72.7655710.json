When it had reached Lenox avenue, and was 20 to 30 feet from the south-bound car track of defendants, the chauffeur, looking to the north, saw a car coming south and then about 110 feet north of the automobile. The latter was proceeding at from 3 to 5 miles per hour'; the car, about 15 miles per hour. The chauffeur spoke to his companion, who was sitting to the left of him in the front seat, who thereupon held out his left hand toward the car, while the chauffeur proceeded to cross the track. The car hit the automobile about in the middle, but slightly to the rear, and inflicted damages for Tillich -recovery is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">The learned trial judge seemed to regard the motorman of the car as negligent, but treated the chauffeur\u2019s course as contributory negligence as matter of law, because, as the judge said, he took upon hi$nself \u201ca dangerous attitude\u201d and a \u201cwild and reckless guess at what he might do.\u201d This ruling, however, is not justified by the authorities. The chauffeur had equal right at this crossing with the defendants\u2019 car. From the facts proved, the question whether he was justified in assuming that the car was under control of the motorman, and would be slowed down to enable him to cross without danger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>should have been submitted to the determination of the jury.
