His will evidently controlled his mother, and she was under his influence, and accepted as right whatever he said or did.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> It is evident that the referee has given too much attention to the alleged settlement and the sale of the store about November, 1892. The transaction was evidently in due form; but, considering the relations existing between the defendant and his mother, it rested upon him to satisfy the court that she fully understood her rights and that they were protected and observed. During the copartnership she received as profits from the store about $5,000, and during the same time, when he was engaged in no other business and was drawing $15 per week salary, he deposited to his own credit in the bank $23,000, independent -of discounts. The inference is reason\u00e1ble that he had' received from the business about $18,000 more than she had received. If that is so, the alleged sale was unfair, and evidently was not understood by her. He produces no books showing the business or profits of the copartnership, and it dbes not appear that she had any definite account furnished her. It is apparent that the defendant has not shown that he made a fair and just accounting to his mother on account of the partnership in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">The relations existing between them called upon him to make plain that her rights were observed. The record indicates that the plaintiff is entitled to an accounting with reference to the copartnership matters. The discharge in bankruptcy and the statute of limitations do not shield the defendant. It is unnecessary to consider the rights of the parties with reference to the factory and other matters, as a new trial must be had, and all the facts will more fully appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">The judgment is therefore reversed upon the law and the facts, the referee discharged, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur, except SMITH, P. J., and BETTS, J., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
