The action is brought to recover upon two promissory notes made by defendant to- the order of plaintiff. Under rule 5, \u00a7 2, for the regulation of Trial Terms in this district, such an action is entitled to be placed upon the special calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">The fact that a defense is interposed which seeks equitable relief' does not bar the right of plaintiff to the assignment of his action for trial on such calendar; for, if defendant desires the separate trial of such issue, his remedy is under section 987, Code of Civil Procedure. Nor does the fact that an action has been commenced by defendant against plaintiffs before the commencement of the present action furnish any reason for denying to plaintiffs the speedy trial to which they are entitled under the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to place the cause on the special calendar is granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
