The defendant\u2019s testator gave the plaintiff an undertaking to save harmless and indemnify it \u201cagainst all loss and damage whatever that might at any time thereafter happen or occur to the said plaintiff for or by reason of the suretyship of the said plaintiff upon the said bond.\u201d McFerran abandoned his contract, and thereafter a mechanic\u2019s lien suit was brought in which the city and the plaintiff were made defendants. It is not averred whether the city sustained any loss or made any claim against the plaintiff, but a stipulation is in the record to the effect that no claim was made and no loss was incurred by the city. The two causes of action attempted to be alleged are to recover: (1) The premium which McFerran agreed to pay on the plaintiff\u2019s bond to the city; and (2) the sum of $500 expended by the defendant for legal services in the defense of the mechanic\u2019s lien suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The learned justice at Special Term held the first cause of action insufficient, and it is too obvious to require discussion that the premium due on the. bond is not a loss or damage by reason of the suretyship thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Of course, if the plaintiff was by reason of its undertaking a necessary or even a proper party in the mechanic\u2019s lien suit, the expenses incurred by.it in the employment of counsel would doubtless come within the terms of the bond in suit. But its undertaking was to the city of New York, not- to the lien claimants, who could at best acquire nothing in that suit except what might be left from any-retained percentages after deducting the expenses incurred by the city in completing the contract. For some reason, the plaintiff in the mechanic\u2019s lien suit made the surety company a party defendant; but it is not averred that any claim was asserted against it either by the lien claimants or by the city. The sum, therefore, voluntarily and unnecessarily expended by it, was not a loss or damage \u201cby reason of its suretyship\u201d within the contemplation of the parties to the contract, though doubtless it would not have incurred such-expenses but for the suretyship.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs, with leave to plaintiff to serve an amended complaint on payment of costs in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
