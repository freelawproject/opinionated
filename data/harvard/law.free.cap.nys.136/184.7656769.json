The petition alleges on information and belief that \u201cduring the years 1866 to 1883, inclusive, the said property was owned by a nonresident of the tax district in which said lands were located,\u201d and then points out objections to the assessment and subsequent sale. But if the property was not owned by a nonresident, many of the objections would be without force, and a peremptory writ of mandamus can issue properly only where the legal right is clear and distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The relator has a perfect remedy through an equitable action, where all of the questions can be tried out, and a peremptory writ ought not to issue upon a petition based on information and belief. An alternative writ issued in the first instance in People ex rel. Cooper v. Register of Arrears, 114 N. Y. 19, 20 N. E. 611, and upon the facts being established a peremptory writ was issued; but here the petitioner demands relief upon the facts which he has stated, and these facts are not so certain that a court would be justified in granting the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The order appealed from should be-affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
