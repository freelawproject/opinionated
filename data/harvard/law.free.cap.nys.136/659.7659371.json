The defendants the Friedland-Nelson Company and Albert J. Atchinson did not answer. The other defendants answered separately, and at the trial the complaint was dismissed, and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">The corporation, the Friedland-Nelson Company, was organized in September, 1903, for the purpose of manufacturing store fixtures. Its authorized capital stock was $6,000, divided into 60 shares of the par value of $100 each, of which 30 were issued to defendant Fried-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>land, and 15 to each of the defendants Nelson. Those three defendants from the time of the organization until after July 12, 1906, constituted all of the directors, officers, and stockholders of the corporation. On the 20th of March, 1906, there accrued to the plaintiff a cause of action against the corporation for personal injuries, to enforce which, a few days thereafter, he commenced an action which resulted on the\u2019 18th of May, 1908, in a judgment in his favor of $882.66. Execution was issued upon the judgment, and the same was returned wholly unsatisfied. On July 12, 1906, four months after the cause of action for personal injuries had accrued, Friedland and the two Nelsons, who were at the time the directors and owners of all of the capital stock of the corporation, entered into a contract in writing by which Friedland agreed to purchase of the Nelsons all of their stock, and to pay therefor $40,000. The contract provided that $20,-000 should be paid immediately and the balance by Friedland\u2019s giving his promissory notes, payable on the 13th of August, 1906; that the Nelsons should immediately execute assignments of their stock to him and resign as officers and directors; that the stock was to be held in escrow by a third party until the notes were paid; and that at the end of six months the corporation should be dissolved, or its name changed from the Friedland-Nelson Company to some name not having the word \u201cNelson\u201d in it. The contract was carried out by Friedland paying the amount stipulated and the notes when they matured, and the Nelsons assigning their stock to him and resigning as directors. As soon as this was done, Friedland immediately transferred one share to each of the defendants Atchinson and Levine, and they were thereupon elected directors and officers in place of the Nelsons. Some time thereafter, Friedland and his dummy directors caused the corporation to assign to him all its assets, which were at least of the value of $11,500 for a nominal consideration and the corporation thereupon ceased to do any business. On December 13, 1906, Fried-land and his two dummy directors filed a certificate pursuant to General Corporation Law, \u00a7 21, in the office of the Secretary of State for a dissolution of the corporation, and it was thereupon formally dissolved. No provision, however, was made for the payment of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> Plaintiff offered evidence to establish prima facie all of the foregoing facts, and they were sufficient to entitle him to the relief asked against the directors Friedland and Levine. The corporate assets constituted a trust fund for the payment of the corporate debts, and when those defendants, as directors, transferred all of the corporate property exceeding $11,500 in value to Friedland for a nominal consideration, they committed such a breach of duty to the plaintiff as to make themselves personally liable for his claim. General Corporation Law, \u00a7 90; Darcy v. Brooklyn &amp; N. Y. Ferry Co., 196 N. Y. 99, 89 N. E. 461, <em>26 </em>L. R. A. (N. S.) 267, 134 Am. St. Rep. 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The defendant Friedland is also liable^ on the additional ground that he received, with notice and without consideration, property of the corporation which was impressed with a trust for the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Bartlett v. Drew, 57 N. Y. 587; Cole v. M. I. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Co., 133 N. Y. 164, 30 N. E. 847, 28 Am. St. Rep. 615. The complaint, therefore, as to Eriedland and Levine, was improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> As to the defendants Nelson a different situation is presented. At the time of the assignment of the corporate assets to Eriedl\u00e1nd they had ceased to be directors, and had severed their connections with .the corporation. The plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that the $40,000 which was paid to them by Eriedland for their stock was paid out of corporate funds, and they not only, acquiesced'in the arrangement, but actually took part in obtaining the money from the corporation. The plaintiff offered to show that prior to the payment by Eriedland he and one of the Nelsons, at least, as officers of the corporation, had executed and delivered to Eriedland without consideration corporate checks sufficient in amount to cover the payments made by Eriedland to the Nelsons. The evidence was excluded, but, assuming for the purposes pf this appeal that such fact had been proved, it would not have ai'ded the plaintiff. After the payment to the Nelsons, the capital stock of the corporation was not impaired, and it still had more than sufficient assets, so far as appears, to pay all of its debts. After such payment, the corporation still had assets to the amount of at least $11,500 which was subsequently taken by Eriedland himself; indeed, the complaint alleges that at the time of the\u201edissolution the assets of the corporation \u201camounted to a sum more than sufficient tO' pay all of its liabilities, including the claim and judgment of the plaintiff, with interest thereon from the date of entry of said judgment.\u201d The plaintiff, therefore, was in no way injured by. the payment to the Nelsons. That was a proper and legitimate transaction so far as appears, so long as all of the stockholders consented to it. Stock Cor. Law, \u00a7 28; Williams v. Western Union Tel. Co., 93 N. Y. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The judgment appealed from, therefore, so far as the same affects the defendants Nelson, should be affirmed, with costs to them against the plaintiff, and reversed and a new trial ordered as to the defendants Joseph Eriedland and Levine, with costs to plaintiff to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
