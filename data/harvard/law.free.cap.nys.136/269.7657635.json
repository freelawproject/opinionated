The relator was arrested on a warrant issued by a magistrate upon the complaint of Kracke, assistant commissioner of the department of agriculture, for having in his possession, offering and exposing for sale, and selling oleomargarine, and upon arraignment the defendant demanded an examination, whereupon the testimony of two witnesses was taken, Kracke and Geisler, a chemist. It appears that Kracke did not see the relator, that the latter made no representations to him with reference to the sale of the article, that the relator was not present at the sale, that the witness did not see any sale, and that what was given to the chemist was no part of what was offered for sale. In other words, the defendant is neith\u00e9r directly nor indirectly shown to have been connected with the transaction, or to have been related to it in any form, or to the substance that was given to and analyzed by the chemist.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The order dismissing the proceedings should be reversed, and the relator discharged!.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">BURR, WOODWARD, and RICH, JJ., concur. JENKS, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
