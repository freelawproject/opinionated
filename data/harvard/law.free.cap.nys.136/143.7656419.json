On March 9th the defendant served a notice of motion, returnable on March 12th, to vacate and set aside the judgment, upon the grounds specified in sections 254 and 255 of the Municipal Court Act. The motion was heard on March 12th, and was subsequently decided in favor of the defendant. From the order entered upon that motion the plaintiff appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">The sections of the Municipal Court Act referred to contemplate that the motion can only be made at the close of the trial, or \"within five days from the time the judgment was rendered.\u201d In the present case no motion was made at the close of the case. While the notice of motion was served within five days from the time the judgment was rendered, the motion itself was not made within that time. In Buchsbaum v. Feldman, 43 Misc. Rep. 85, 86 N. Y. Supp. 747, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-16\">\u201cHad the Legislature intended that the <em>notice of motion </em>might be given within five days, the clause \u2018in the latter case (that is, if not made at the close of the trial) two days\u2019 notice must be given\u2019 would not have been inserted, because, unless it was the intention of the Legislature to limit the time to five days within which such motion must be <em>made, </em>there would be no good reason for shortening the time of eight days\u2019 notice of motion to but two days. A notice of motion is distinct from the motion itself. Giving a notice is a mere warning that an order will be applied for, and it is clear that the intent of the act was that, from parties having ground for the relief contemplated in section 254, promptness in having the motion made, and not promptness in giving such notice, is required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>See, also, Ryan v. Brown, 51 Misc. Rep. 67, 90 N. Y. Supp. 868, and Appelbaum v. Bonagur, 56 Misc. Rep. 615, 107 N. Y. Supp. 635. The motion not having been made within, th.e time required by law, it follows that the court below was without power to entertain and de'cide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Order reversed,. and judgment reinstated, with costs.' All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
