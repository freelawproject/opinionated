The pleadings consist of a complaint and a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The action is brought under the provisions of section 66 of the Stock Corporation Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 59). The complaint alleges the recovery by plaintiff on May 1, 1908, of a judgment for damages for the death of his decedent, and that said judgment was duly docketed, execution issued thereon and returned unsatisfied, and that said judgment remains unpaid. It is alleged that the individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ual defendant was a \"shareholder and otherwise interested\" in the company,\u201d and that on July 18, 1907, the said company being \u25a0 insolvent and in contemplation of insolvency, and with the intent of giving a preference to the individual defendant, executed and deliv\u00e9red to said defendant chattel mortgages upon automobile sight-seeing touring cars which were then the property of the company. It is not alleged that these chattel mortgages were given without consideration, or upon inadequate consideration, or in payment of an antecedent debt due to said defendant.. It is alleged that, at the time of the execution of the mortgages, the automobiles mortgaged constituted the sole assets of the company, and that its liabilities exceeded its assets. The plaintiff treated the demurrer as frivolous, and moved for judgment upon that ground; but, so far is it from being frivolous, it is clearly good. The transfers of which plaintiff complains are alleged to have been made on July 18, 1907, and there is no allegation that on that date plaintiff was a creditor of the corporation or held any claim against it. All that is said on that score is that \u201cprior to the 1st day of May, 1908,\u201d the plaintiff commenced an action, but when the death of plaintiff\u2019s decedent occurred which gave rise to the action does not appear. It is probably true that plaintiff became' a creditor as soon as he was appointed administrator.because the liability of the defendant corporation accrued when the death occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If the death had been c\u00e1used before the transfer, although judgment was not entered thereon until afterwards, th\u00e9 plaintiff could maintain the action (Kain v. Larkin, 4 App. Div. 209, 38 N. Y. Supp. 546); but there is no such allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We are also of the opinion that no cause of action is stated against Charles J3urkelman in his representative capacity. Even if he held shares in the defendant corporation as executor, and the chattel mortgage was in form made to him as executor, the cause of action the plaintiff has attempted to set out is one against him personally, and not against the estate of which he is executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for judgment denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
