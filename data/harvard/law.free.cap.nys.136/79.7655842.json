To the south of all the tracks, and running parallel with them, is Railroad avenue, a public street, with a sidewalk on its south side, farthest from defendant\u2019s roadbed. Pike street crosses the tracks. To the west of Pike street, Brown and Thompson streets intersect Railroad avenue, but do not cross. There are no streets on the northerly side of defendant\u2019s tracks opposite Brown or Thompson streets, and no street adjoining and running parallel with the tracks; the land being owned by the defendant and occupied by its shops. There is no public crossing of the tracks between Thompson and Pike streets, and cars are being constantly switched on the side tracks. The plaintiff, a boy 10 years old at the time of the accident, started from Railroad avenue to cross the tracks diagonally. He had crossed three or four tracks when he saw some coal cars in motion and approaching. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>He could not see whether there was an engine attached to the cars or not. In endeavoring' to get off the track his foot caught, and the cars ran over his leg, inflicting the injuries for which he sought to recover in this action. There was no brakeman in sight on the coal cars, and no one knew of plaintiff\u2019s presence on the track, or injury, until after the accident. It is apparent from the testimony that the public were not licensed to cross defendant\u2019s tracks at any point between Thompson and Pike streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Although it was shown that employ\u00e9s of defendant crossed the tracks at times to and from the defendant\u2019s shops in which they were employed, climbing under, ove-r, and going around, cars standing on the tracks, such user did\" not create' an invitation or license to the general public. Proof was given of a few isolated cases where persons other than employ\u00e9s had crossed the tracks opposite Thompson and Brown streets, but no general custom charging the defendant with notice of such use was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> The\u2019 contention of the appellant that the failure to fence between Railroad avenue and defendant\u2019s tracks constitutes and establishes defendant\u2019s actionable negligence is without merit. Robertson v. Mayor, etc., <em>7 </em>Misc. Rep. 645, 28 N. Y. Supp. 13; Id., 149 N. Y. 609, 44 N. E. 1128. I think the testimony establishes that the plaintiff was a trespasser. No wanton or reckless conduct on the part of defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s was shown. The defendant having the superior right of way and use of its tracks, its employ\u00e9s operating trains or engaged in switching cars were not required to be \u00e1ctively vigilant in discovering trespassers upon the tracks. The difference between active and passive negligence, under such conditions and circumstances, is clearly stated in Rosenthal v. N. Y., Susquehanna &amp; Western R. R. Co., 112 App. Div. 431, 98 N. Y. Supp. 476. See, also, Neuberger v. Long Island R. R. Co., 131 App. Div. 885, 116 N. Y. Supp. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The learned trial justice properly dismissed the complaint, and the judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
