The motion was granted upon the first ground, and the plaintiff appeals from the order, urging that, as the defendants had failed to demand that the case be removed to the proper county on or before the service of an answer, as provided in section 986 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court was without power to order the change. The question appears to have been determined adversely to the plaintiff\u2019s contention. Cronin v. Manhattan Transit Co., 124 App. Div. 543, 544, 108 N. Y.
