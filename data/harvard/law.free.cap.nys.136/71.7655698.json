Under such circumstances, defendant might appropriately, under section 187 of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, c. 580), have procured an order permitting him to pay the money into court. He has, however, preferred to test the issues on the merits, and, as these are plainly against him, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event'.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-17\">\u2022 Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
