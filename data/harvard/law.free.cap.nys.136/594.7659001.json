Whether the plaintiff were coerced into signing the agreement by reason of fraud practised upon her will, from the facts presented, have to be determined l\u00e1rgely from witnesses residing in Rensselaer county. The greater number of witnesses there reside, and for the reasons stated in Kaufman v. Kaufman, 136 N. Y. Supp. 592 (decided herewith), the order appealed from should be reversed, and the motion to change the place of trial from the county of New York to the county of Rensselaer granted, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
