In pursuance of the order, they served an amended answer. Plaintiff then moved to strike out the third defense or counterclaim. The motion was granted to the extent of directing that within 10 day's thereafter defendants should serve an amended answer setting forth definitely and specifically certain facts therein specified. Defendants appealed, and the order was affirmed by this court. Pending the appeal and its determination the time to answer expired. The plaintiff\u2019s attorneys served a copy of the order of affirmance by mail, and in a letter accompanying same stated that, notwithstanding defendants were in default, if an amended answer complying with the order were served within a time stated, and the costs and disbursements of the appeal paid, they would accept it. The amended answer was served within the time stated, and the costs and disbursements paid. Two days later, however, the answer was returned on the ground that it did not comply with the order directing its service. The defendants then moved to excuse their default and for leave to serve an amended answer. The motion was denied, and the appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">So far as can be ascertained from the record' before us, the answer served substantially complied with the order, and, if it did not, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, having accepted the costs and retained it for two days; could not thereafter return it. The proper practice, under such circumstances, was to retain the answer, and then move to strike out the portion which did not comply with the order; Rodgers v. Clement, 54 App. Div. 191, 66 N. Y. Supp. 593; Lange v. Hirsch, 38 App. Div. 176, 56 N. Y. Supp. 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
