His refusal to obey the mandate of the court has been deliberate and defiant. It is in line with his contumacious refusal to answer material- questions, and with the ab.usive, violent, and improper matter which has found a place both in his affidavits and in his proceedings before the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The order will be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to punish defendant granted, with $10 costs, but with leave to: defendant to purge himself of. his contempt by obeying the subpoena duces tecum, and answering the questions as to the disposition of the item of $1,00.0 which he has refused to explain. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
