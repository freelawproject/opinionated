The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tends to show that Russell was employed by the defendant\u2019s husband to procure a purchaser of the said premises, upon an express agreement that he should receive 5 per cent, of the purchase price for his services, and that he procured a purchaser with whom an enforceable contract of purchase and sale was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The complaint was dismissed, apparently on the theory that it was not shown that the husband was the defendant\u2019s authorized agent. Her testimony on that head was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cMy affairs were absolutely in Mr. Bannon\u2019s hands. Q. And he acted for you? A. Entirely and absolutely. * * * Q. What did you say to him? A. The authority that all wives should give their husbands. The authority that I think a wife .should give a husband to take these matters in hand. T said nothing at all. It was in his hands. It was his business absolutely. I was the'owner of the property. He handled it for me absolutely. It'was bought with my money, and handled by Mr. Bannon absolutely. I-Ie did everything that was necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">She denied having given special authority to employ a broker, but it is difficult for us to understand how broader general authority could have been shown.- . ...</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The respondent seeks to sustain the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff pleaded an employment by the defendant, and that it was not competent to show an employment by an agent; but, of course, the act of the agent is the act of the. principal. The ultimate facts only have to be stated in <em>a </em>pleading..</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">.The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial-granted,--with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
