The defendants Hudson Mantel &amp; Mirror Company and the Colwell Lead Company had, subsequent to the mortgage, furnished plumbing, mantels, and mirrors used in the construction of certain houses upon the premises covered by the mortgage; but these materials had been placed under contracts of conditional sale, which contracts were duly recorded -according to law, and the question here presented is whether the plaintiff is entitled to hold these materials as a part of the mortgage security, or whether they belong to the appealing defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">So far as the Hudson Mantel &amp; Mirror Company\u2019s claim is concerned, it cannot be distinguished from the case of Barwin Realty Co. v. Union Stove Works, 146 App. Div. 319, 130 N. Y. Supp. 781, and the judgment in so far as it cuts off said company should, of course, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The only distinction we are able to discover between the claim of the Colwell Lead Company and that involved in the Barwin Realty Co. Case, supra, is that while the defendant\u2019s original conditional contract was duly filed, as required by law, and was on record at the time of the commencement of the action, it appears that the same was not redocketed at the end of the year, and during the pendency of the action. Just how this could operate to give the plaintiff a right to take materials which belonged to the defendant Colwell Lead Company at the time the action was commenced does not occur to us. The litigation relates to the facts as they existed when the action was commenced, and, at that time, the defendant had not parted with title. Being a party to the action, the defendant was not called upon to redocket its conditional sales contract to preserve its rights, for title could not vest in the Milton Construction Company under the contract in any event, though a third party, dealing with that company without notice of the conditional contract, might gain rights which could not be divested.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The judgment, in so far as it affects the defendants Colwell Lead Company and the Hudson Mantel &amp; Mirror Company, should be reversed, with costs, upon the authority of the case above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">THOMAS, CARR, and RICH, JJ, concur. JENKS, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
