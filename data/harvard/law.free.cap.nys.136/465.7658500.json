They have filed what they term an answer, in which they admit the making of the assessment roll, etc., and then allege that \u201call and singular the property of the relator as set forth in the petition herein was assessed at the true market value thereof as the same was ascertained and determined by the said Abram Wolf, Jeremiah F. Stapleton, and Timothy J. Bird, acting as assessors of the town,\u201d etc., and the order appealed from simply commands the defendants to file \u201ca proper and verified return to the writ of certiorari.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is true that the order appealed from requires the defendants to do rather more than the relator claims is necessary in the present instance, but this is a matter which could easily have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>remedied by a motion for a resettlement of the order, and does not justify this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> This is not the old common-law writ of certiorari, nor one provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure, but is one arising, under the provisions of the Tax Law (sections 290-292), and the officers making a return under the Tax Law are required to make \u201ccertified or sworn copies of such roll or papers, or of such portions thereof as may be called for by such writ,\u201d and this without any reference to fees or other compensation. The return as made does not meet the requirements of the law. People ex rel. Consol. Gas Co. v. Feitner, 78 App. Div. 313, 315, 79 N. Y. Supp. 975; People ex rel. N. Y., O. &amp; W. R. Co. v.

The order appealed from should be modified to provide for a certified copy of so much of the assessment roll of 1911 as is necessary for the purposes of the writ, and, as so modified, affirmed!, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
