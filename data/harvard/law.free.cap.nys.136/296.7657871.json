There was evidence from which the trial court could properly make the finding that this condition of affairs continued to the 10th day of December, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Upon the premises demised was a dwelling house. No agreement existed between the lessor and the lessee in relation to the making of the repairs. The defendant agreed to let the premises to the plaintiff on the 1st day of December, 1910. That agreement carried with it the obligation that the lessor would by no act of his prevent the lessee from entering upon and occupying the premises on the day fixed; and upon his failure to deliver possession\u2014his conduct alone standing in the way\u2014the plaintiff had a right to rescind the contract and to recover from the defendant the consideration advanced.
