That charge was \u201cviolation of section 211, Rules and Regulations of 1905\u201d; the specification being that he was guilty of deception, \u201cin that he made a false statement to Rhinelander Waldo, fire commissioner, to the effect that the transcript of testimony taken at his trial on_May 3, 1910, was not a true statement.\u201d The trial on May 3, 1910, referred to, was on the charge of using disrespectful language to his commanding officer. The trial was conducted by Deputy Commissioner O\u2019Keefe, and the relator was found guilty and fined five days\u2019 pay. It appears that a rehearing was granted by the fire commissioner on the relator\u2019s application for a reconsideration of the matter, and upon that rehearing the relator denied the correctness of the transcript of the minutes of his testimony given before Deputy Commissioner O\u2019Keefe; the particular inaccuracy claimed being that an affirmative answer was recorded where a negative answer was given. The trial now being reviewed was also before Deputy Commission O\u2019Keefe, who found the relator guilty and recommended his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">The serious complaint is that the relator was not accorded a fair trial, and a careful examination of the record satisfies us that that complaint is well founded. The fact in dispute was within the personal knowledge of the trial deputy, whose recollection may pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>sibly have been at fault. Almost at the outset of the trial, he was sworn and made a statement to the effect that the record was a true copy of the evidence and statements made at the hearing before him. Later he struck that testimony out. Much irrelevant evidence was admitted, some relevant evidence was excluded on untenable grounds, witnesses whose attendance was requested by the relator were examined and excused in the absence of the relator and his counsel, on the ground that they did not know anything about the case, and the evidence of the hostile attitude of the trial deputy pervades the entire record, and convinces us that the case was prejudged, and was decided, not upon the evidence, but upon his own recollection. It would serve no useful purpose to set forth transcripts of the record upon which we base that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We do not decide that the trial deputy was absolutely disqualified from hearing the case; but we do decide that the relator has not had, what the statute accords him, a fair and impartial trial, and that a trial conducted as a matter of form, to satisfy the requirements of the statute, and not in good faith, to determine the truth of the charge, is a farce, and not what the statute intends, and that, -under1 the circumstances disclosed by this record, the relator is entitled to a trial before a commissioner who has not prejudged his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The determination should be annulled, with $50 costs and disbursements, and the proceedings remitted to the commissioner, with direction to have the charge determined by himself or. another officer. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
