The evident intent was that the appellant should have the app\u00e9al in such a condition that it can be heard within the time fixed. If an agreement between the parties is not sufficient to justify a continuance of the appeal, certainly the neglect of the respondent to consent to the set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tlement of the papers upon which the appeal is to be heard cannot have that effect. There is nothing, in the affidavit of the appellant\u2019s attorneys to show that he was not fully conversant with this provision, and the only excuse is that the corporation counsel did! not return the galley proof of the papers to be used on the appeal, as he had prepared them for a year and a half, which is obviously no excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The time within which to prosecute this appeal has not been extended by an order of the court. The appeal was taken more than two years and a half ago, and the provision of the section of the charter to which attention has been called is mandatory. For that reason the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Motion to dismiss appeal granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
