Upon that petition1 a citation was issued, and, upon the return of the citation, the surrogate dismissed the proceeding on the ground that he had no pow\u00e9r to entertain the proceedings so long as the probate decree stood.'</p>\n<p id=\"b242-19\">.' Said section 2621a, so far as material,; provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-20\">'\u201c\u2019\u201cA' person claiming to be interested in the estate of a decedent may present a petition under oath to a Surrogate's Court; against' any one or- more persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>suspected- of destroying, retaining, concealing or conspiring with others to destroy, retain or conceal a will or testamentary instrument of the decedent, and the court thereupon must issue a citation, directed to such person or persons, ordering the production of the will or testamentary instrument or show cause why it should not be produced. On the return of the citation, the court may order the suspected person or persons, to appear before it and be examined on oath upon the matter of the petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> We think that the learned surrogate was justified in dismissing the proceedings, but not for the reason assigned by him. This proceeding is not an attack upon a probate decree, and we think it may be instituted, irrespective of whether there has been such a decree. If a subsequent alleged will or codicil should be discovered, the probate decree would remain unaffected until a direct attack upon it should be made. The fact that such an attack might- be made if the petitioner should attain his purpose in this proceeding constitutes no objection to the maintenance of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> However, it will be observed that the language of the statute is, \u201con the return of the citation, the court may order the suspected persons,\u201d etc. While the petition may have been sufficient to justify the issuance of a citation, the surrogate was not required to proceed further, upon objection being made, unless the petitioner show'ed some ground or reason for the suspicion that there were other codicils, and that, if they were produced, it would appear that 'he was entitled to an interest in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">For that reason, the order is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
