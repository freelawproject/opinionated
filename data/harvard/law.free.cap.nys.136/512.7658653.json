J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK1\">It appears substantially without contradiction that the testator was possessed of property of the value of about $45,-000 to $50,000; that he left no children or any other relatives or next of kin to whom his bounty should extend. The evidence indicates that he knew little concerning his relatives or next of kin. On the 28th day of February, 1910, he made the will which is the subject of this controversy. By such will he gave to his niece, Grace Joy, a diamond stud; to the oldest living son of his brother George, a ring; to the second oldest living son of his brother George, another ring and watch; and to six others, not relativ\u00e9s, as many specific legacies. By the will the testator distributed the residue of the estate according to the eleventh paragraph, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-17\">\u201cEleventh: All the rest, residue and reversion of my estate, both real and personal, I give, devise and bequeath as follows:\u2014to my nephew, Byron J. Tillman of Buffalo, N. X., one share; to my niece, Grace Joy of Boise, Idaho, one share; and to each of the children of my brother, George Turner, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>share, to be divided equally among my said nieces and nephews, share and share alike. I direct that the share of any dying with issue surviving shall be paid to such issue and that the share of any dying without issue shall be equally divided among the survivors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">There were at the time of testator\u2019s death the following, nephews and nieces, beneficiaries of this paragraph: George W. Turner, Fred Turner, Charles C. Turner, Belle (Turner) Shumway, and Helen M. (Turner) Lucas, all children of testator\u2019s brother George, Grace Joy, and Byron J. Tillman, the appellant, who has been confined for some years in the Buffalo State Hospital. There was also a grandniece, Blanche Turner, the only child of Frank Turner, another son of testator\u2019s brother George, and this Frank was dead at the time of the execution of the will, but there is no evidence that testator knew of Frank\u2019s death. The evidence shows that he knew very little about George\u2019s children, having had no answer to an advertisement for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Upon all the facts the learned surrogate construed! the eleventh paragraph to mean that the residue of the estate should be divided into eight parts, one to Grace Joy, one to Byron J. Tillman, one to each of the five surviving children of George Turner, and one to Blanche, the representative and only child of the dead Frank Turner. We think the learned surrogate was right in deciding as he did!; that entirely independent of punctuation, upon which reliance is placed by the appellant, it seems absolutely clear that the testator intended that the residuum of his estate should be distributed as the learned surrogate decreed. It follows, therefore, that the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court should be affirmed, with costs payable by the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Decree affirmed, with costs to appellant and with separate bills of costs to the respondents, payable out of the estate. All concur, except ROBSON and FOOTE, JJ., who dissent in a memorandum by ROBSON, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b537-8\">ROBSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXR\">(dissenting). The eleventh clause of the will gives (as the surrogate has held) onfe share of the residue of testator\u2019s property to each of the children of his brother, George Turner. So construed, the will designated George\u2019s children as a class to each of whom a share was given. The further direction of this clause is that the share of any legatee designated therein is to be paid to the issue of such legatee in the event of his dying. Frank Turner was a son of George Turner, and had died! before testator\u2019s death leaving one child, the respondent, Blanche Turner. No share of the residue was given by the will to Frank Turner, for he was not living at the time the will was made. Therefore, as to his issue, there was no share to which the direction to pay to the issue of a legatee who might have died could apply. For that reason Blanche Turner is not entitled to any share in the residue of the estate. Pimel v. Betjemann as Ex\u2019r, etc., 183 N. Y. 194, 199, 76 N. E. 157, 2 L. R. A. (N. S.) 580, 5 Ann.
