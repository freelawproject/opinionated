Even if that contention were otherwise well founded, it cannot prevail in this case, for the reason that some of the facts which the defendant thus attempted to put in issue are not matters of public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>But the motion should have been denied for still\" another, and equally conclusive, reason; i. e., that the complaint fails tb state a cause of action. The action is brought by a trustee \"in bankruptcy against an executor. It is averred: That the defendant\u2019s testatrix was the owner of certain described premises, which were conveyed to her by one Mary Heinzelman. That she conveyed said premises to Meyer Loeb and Simon Loeb by deed containing a description which is quoted. That said deed contained the following covenants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201c(1) That the said Christina Fischer will forever warrant the title to said premises. (2) That the party of the first part will execute or procure any further necessary assurance of the title to said premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201cThat by a change in the description of the said premises, and by error or omission, all the premises mentioned in said deed from Mary Heinzelman to Christina Fischer were not conveyed in the deed from Christina Fischer to Meyer Loeb and Simon Loeb.\u201d That \u201csaid Meyer Loeb and Simon Loeb, together with Carrie Loeb and Fannie Loeb,\u201d' afterwards conveyed the.said premises to one Louis Miller, who, \u201ctogether with Helen R. Miller,\u201d conveyed them to the bankrupt. That during the lifetime of the defendant\u2019s testatrix a demand was made upon her that she \u201cexecute or procure further necessary assurances of title to said premises,\u201d and that after her death a like demand was made upon the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">There is no averment in the complaint tending to show that the defendant\u2019s testatrix agreed to, intended to, or that the parties understood that she in fact did, convey all of the premises conveyed to her by Mary Heinzelman. One averment of the complaint is that she conveyed the said premises, and that is negatived by an averment that by a change in the description, and by error or omission, all of said premises was not conveyed. But something more than that is required to state a cause of action. For alight that appears, the said covenants relate exclusively to the premises specifically described in the deed from her to Loeb.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
