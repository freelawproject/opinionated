The summons was not personally served upon the defendant, but the person to whom it was delivered for service presented to the clerk of the court an affidavit stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-23\">\u201cThat after due and diligent search by me made I have been unable to find the within-named defendant so as to serve him with the within summons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-24\">A very large number of alias summonses were subsequently obtained upon similar affidavits, until finally the defendant was served \u00bfwith the summons and complaint. The defendant then appeared specially and moved to set aside the summons and complaint. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>grounds of the motion were that the defendant could have been found by any diligent search, since he was not in any way concealing himself, and that the court is without jurisdiction, since the alias summons was issued upon an affidavit stating no facts, but merely conclusions of law. The trial justice granted this motion, and a formal order was entered setting aside the service of the summons and complaint. In addition to the formal order, the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201cService of the summons and complaint herein set aside by order dated April 30, 1912. See order within\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">i\u2014were indorsed on the summons in the blank space reserved for the judgment. It seems to me quite clear that, under the provisions of the Municipal Court Act, the motion and the order entered thereon were not authorized. We have frequently held that the objection to the jurisdiction of the court must be raised at the trial, and not by motion. Roberts &amp; Lewis Co, v. Dale, 74 Misc. Rep. 390, 132 N. Y. Supp. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> The Municipal Court Act does not specifically authorize such a motion, and the order entered thereon is not appealable. Even if the motion is denied, and a formal order entered thereon, this does not preclude the defendant from raising the same objection at the trial.' Berkman v. Weisinger, 50 Misc. Rep. 515, 99 N. Y. Supp. 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Moreover, in this case, the court had prima facie jurisdiction. Section 30 of the Municipal Court Act does not provide .that, before an alias summons can be issued; satisfactory proof must be presented to the court that the person having the summons to serve cannot find the defendant. On the contrary, it requires the clerk, who is merely a ministerial officer without any,judicial powers, to issue an alias summons whenever the person having the summons to serve shall \u201cso return.\u201d Regarded merely as a \u201creturn,\u201d the affidavit presented to the clerk complies with the requirements of the statute. Of course, the return is not conclusive upon the parties, and may be traversed; but the court, having prima facie jurisdiction, can determine the correctness of the return only by trial' of the traverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> Since, however, we are not specifically given the right to review the order by the Municipal Court Act, we have no power to reverse it, unless upon an appeal from a judgment. In this case the record contains no judgment, and apparently no judgment has ever been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">The appeal must therefore be dismissed, but without costs and without prejudice to the right of plaintiff to enter judgment and appeal therefrom. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
