It was marked ready on the call of the calendar on the first day, but, when reached in its regular order, the defendant did not appear, his default was noted, and the case marked for inquest. The defendant thereupon moved at Special' Term, and obtained an order opening his default and restoring the case to the calendar upon condition that he pay $20 costs within five days, and, in the event of defendant\u2019s failure to make such payment, the motion was denied with $10 costs. More than 10 months after this order, payment not having been made, an inquest was taken, and judgment entered on February 12th following, whereupon defendant obtained an order opening his default and restoring the case to the calendar for trial. The affidavit upon which the second order was obtained does not disclose the application for the first order and defendant\u2019s failure to comply with its requirements; upon the contrary, it states \u201cthat no previous application for the proposed order has been made to any court or judge.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b591-15\">Argued before JENKS, P.

Defendant admits that he received several letters from his attorney referring to this action, requesting him to come to his office, to which he paid no attention. No facts are alleged showing any defense, or from which the inference of a meritorious defense can be presumed. It has been repeatedly held that a litigant applying to a court for an order opening his default must show as a condition precedent to the granting of the relief facts establishing a meritorious defense, and an affidavit of merits is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and defendant\u2019s motion denied, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">BURR, THOMAS, and WOODWARD, JJ., concur.
