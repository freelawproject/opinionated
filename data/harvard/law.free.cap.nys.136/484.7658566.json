Although the courts in which the applicant has been admitted are courts of the highest original jurisdiction, that does not entitle him to admission here without examination. The rules of the Court of Appeals and of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court provide that in the discretion of the Appellate Division a person may be admitted to practice in the courts of this state without examination who has been admitted to practice and has practiced three years as an attorney and counselor in the highest court of law in another state. Rule 2, Court of Appeals (48 N. E. vii), relating to admission of attorneys; rule 1, general rules of practice of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Admission under our rules by the Appellate Division admits an applicant to practice in all the courts of this state, including the Court of Appeals, which is the highest court. We think the applicant is not entitled to be admitted to practice in this state without being admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and having practiced there for the required length of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">The application should therefore be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
