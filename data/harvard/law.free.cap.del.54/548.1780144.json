Plaintiff had fire and theft insurance and his insurance carrier paid him his loss, in the amount as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">In the settlement papers it was provided that upon payment of the claim to plaintiff, he, as</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">\u201c* * * the undersigned hereby assigns and transfers to the said company each and all claims and demands against any other party, person, persons, property or corporation, arising from or connected with such loss and damage and the said Company is hereby subrogated in the place of and to the extent of the amount above named, and the said Company is hereby authorized and empowered to sue, compromise or settle in my name or otherwise to the extent of the money paid as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">The sum of $1,940.00 was paid by the carrier to the plaintiff and the settlement papers recited that this amount was the \u201cagreed sound value of the car\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>At the trial plaintiff proved the bailment of his car with the defendants and then showed that as of the date the car was stolen it had a market value of about $2,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case defendants moved to dismiss because it appeared from the testimony that plaintiff was not the real party in interest, as required by Rule 17, Rules of the Superior Court, <em>Del. C. Ann. </em>That Rule, so far as is pertinent, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201c(a) Real Party in Interest. Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Judge Stiftel, in the case of <em>Cohee v. Ritchey, </em>1 <em>Storey </em>597, 599-600, 150 <em>A. </em>2d 830, 831, said \u2014 \u201c* * * This Rule has the force and effect of a legislative enactment. <em>Associated Transport v. Pusey, </em>10 <em>Terry </em>413, 118 A. 2d 362, 365. The promulgation of the Rule was tantamount to the legislature itself passing a statute covering the subject. See 10 <em>Del. Code Ann. </em>Sec. 561.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In <em>Cammile, Sr. v. Sanderson, </em>9 <em>Terry </em>225, 101 A. 2d 316 (Super. Ct. 1954) Judge Carey held, 9 <em>Terry </em>at 229, 101 A. 2d at 318, that under this Rule \u201cthe real party in interest is the one who, by the substantive law, has the right sought to be enforced.\u201d At a later point in the same paragraph of his opinion, Judge Carey took occasion to point out that in an action involving damages to personal property, \u201cthis right is in the true owner of that property\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">When the plaintiff was testifying, he stated that the police called him when his car was recovered by the police. On cross-examination he testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">\u201cQ You said that the police called you because they thought that you were the owner of the car?</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">\u201cA That is right, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">\u201cQ Were you, in fact, the owner of the car?</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u201cA No, I wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\u201cMe.

It was close to $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"AH\">\u201cQ And that was the claim for damages which made against them? you</p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">\u201cA That is right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Furthermore, it was brought out in testimony that the plaintiff had executed and delivered the title to the automobile at the time of settlement and it was held by the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Rule 17(a) is, in substance, the same as Rule 17(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>In their consideration of this Rule, in their work on <em>Federal Practice and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Procedure, </em>Barron and Holtzoff, in Volume <em>2, </em>\u00a7 482, state at page 19:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201cCases involving subrogation constitute another field in which the real party in interest provision is applied, giving the subrogee a right to sue in his own name. <em>Thus an insurer who has paid the entire loss to the insured is the real party in interest </em>entitled to sue a third person who is liable for the loss <em>and must bring the action in its own name. An insured who has no interest in the recovery cannot sue. </em>* * (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">See also Volume 3, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>\u00b6\u00b617.02, 17.08 and 17.09; <em>Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, </em>Vol. 8, \u00a7 2049 where at page 6706 it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">\u201c* * * it has been held, under a statute requiring an action to be brought in the name of the real party in interest, that the insurer, and not the insured, is the real party in interest in an action against the wrongdoer for the destruction of the insured property, at least where the insured has settled * * * by accepting a sum amounting to its damage * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">A like statement is to be found in an annotation appearing in 157 A. <em>L. R. </em>at page 1247. The Supreme Court of Kansas held in <em>Ellis Canning Co. v. International Harvester Co., </em>174 <em>Kan. </em>357, 255 <em>P. </em>2d 658, 659, (1953), under a real party in interest statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">\u201c* * * an insured who has been fully paid for his loss is not the real party in interest, within the meaning of that term as used [in this statute] and hence cannot maintain an action to recover the amount of such loss in his own name for the use and benefit of the insurer. Conversely stated, the rule now recognized and applied is, that under the confronting conditions and circumstances the right of action against the alleged wrongdoer vests wholly in the insurer who, * * *, may, and indeed must, bring the action as the real and only party in interest if one is to be maintained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In light of the facts brought out in the course of plaintiff\u2019s case and the aforecited authorities, I have no alternative but to grant defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">For what it may be worth, I make the observation that when my attention was first called to the fact that plaintiff had been reimbursed for his loss and the case was before the Court on a subrogation asserted by an insurance company,\u2014 this in the course of the pre-trial stage of this case \u2014 I made inquiry of plaintiff\u2019s attorney as to what his position was on this specific point. Then when defendants\u2019 motion was argued I made a like inquiry of plaintiff\u2019s counsel; I asked what meaning could be given to Rule 17(a) if I were not to apply the cited Rule to the facts developed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel contended (1) that <em>Steenburg v. Braunstein, Inc., </em>6 <em>Terry </em>588, 77 <em>A. </em>2d 206 (Super. Ct. 1950) was authority against granting the motion and (2) that the undertaking by insured in the release and assignment signed by the insured to sue in his name for recovery of the payment made to plaintiff by the insurer operated to preclude Rule 17 (a) from being applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Neither arguments are valid. The facts of this case distinguish it from the <em>Steenburg </em>case, since there the insurer\u2019s payment to the insured was less than insured\u2019s loss. Secondly, while Rule 17 (a) does permit a person \u201cin whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another\u201d to \u201csue in his own name without joining with him the party for whose benefit the action is brought\u201d there was really no contract here between the insurer and the insured, since the release and assignment was not the type of contract envisioned by the language of the Rule as quoted above. Then, too, the excerpt from Barron and Holtzoff, cited <em>supra, </em>seems wholly applicable to the case and obviates any doubt as to insured\u2019s right to maintain this action. The adoption of the Rule, I have heretofore noted, is comparable to the enactment of a statute. It cannot be held that insured\u2019s agreement to bring suit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>his own name for the benefit of the insurer can overcome the Rule, which has the force of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">An Order may be presented carrying into effect the substance of my ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">On Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Following the filing of the Court\u2019s opinion, dated May 4, 1962, and the entry of the order thereon, plaintiff moved for a new trial, contending (1) that defendants\u2019 failure to file a pleading, prior to trial, containing a \u201cspecific negative averment, supported by affidavit\u201d, as provided by Rule 9(a), raising the issue of \u201creal party in interest\u201d therein, foreclosed defendants from thereafter raising the question, and particularly from moving to dismiss, as defendants did, at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case; (2) that the Court erred in granting defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, because of the language in the printed proof of loss, requiring plaintiff, as the assured, to bring a suit in his own name for the benefit of the insurer, the Jersey Insurance Company, amounted to a \u201ccontract for the benefit of another\u201d which, plaintiff contended, came within that portion of Rule 17(a) which provides \u201ca party * * * in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another * * * may sue in his own name without joining with him the party for whose benefit the action is brought; * * *\u201d and (3) that the plaintiff was \u201cthe real party in interest within the meaning of Rule 17(a)\u201d. I propose to take up and dispose of these contentions in the order as set forth in plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">TIMELINESS OF DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION TO DISMISS</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">Plaintiff lays much stress on the term \u201ccapacity\u201d as it appears in the title to Rule 17, and from that argues that the second sentence of Rule 9(a) is controlling; he appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>equate \u201ccapacity\u201d with \u201creal party in interest\u201d; he argues that since the term \u201ccapacity\u201d appears in the title of Rule 17 that means capacity and real party in interest have the same meaning and should be read together to determine the full meaning of Rule 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> A difficulty with this argument is that I can find no ambiguity in Rule 17. A statute or rule of court is not construed by reference to any language except that which appears in the statute or rule, unless there is an ambiguity. This Court, as is considered hereafter, did not adopt paragraph (b) of Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but did retain \u201ccapacity\u201d in the title. Such omission created no ambiguity; it evinced no intent on the part of this Court to say that \u201ccapacity\u201d and \u201creal party in interest\u201d mean the same thing, hence there can be no resort to a title or to a headnote to a section, or catchword in a rule as an aid in matters of construction, so as to create an ambiguity, <em>Trader v. Jester, </em>1 <em>Terry </em>66, 74, 1 A. 2d 609 and see <em>Terracciona v. Magee, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. </em>557, 148 A. 2d 68, 73 (N. J. Super.).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Counsel for defendants properly noted that when this Court adopted Rule 17 \u2014 from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u2014 it did not adopt paragraph (b) of that Rule, as it appears in the Federal Rules. Paragraph (b) of the Federal Rules deals with \u201cCapacity\u201d, and by not adopting paragraph (b) of Rule 17 the usual considerations given to \u201cCapacity\u201d by Rule 17(b) F. R. C. P. are no longer to be considered; that paragraph (b) was not adopted, there is nothing now in Rule 17 that deals with capacity. This Court recognizes this contention and adopts it.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Professor Moore\u2019s <em>Federal Practice, </em>2nd Ed., Vol. 3, pages 1379 <em>et seq., </em>in discussing capacity under Rule 17(b) F. R. C. P., points out that there is a definite distinction drawn between an enforceable right or interest and \u201ccapacity\u201d to sue; that \u201ccapacity\u201d is determined by Federal Law whereas whether or not a party has an enforceable right or interest is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>determined by the substantive law of the State. The clear-cut distinction between capacity and enforceable right or interest to sue is brought out at many points in Professor Moore\u2019s discussion following Rule 17(b). He states at one point (page 1380):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201cHaving capacity to sue is not the same as having an enforceable remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">And again that while technically a party may have capacity to sue in a Federal Court it could not recover where recovery would not be possible in the State Court (page 1397). Finally he points out that a party plaintiff cannot avail itself of the provision of Rule 17(b) relative to an action to enforce a right unless it is the real party in interest (page 1410).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Plaintiff, in his memoranda in support of his Motion for New Trial, now relies on Rule 12(h) and argues that \u201creal party in interest\u201d is a defense that must be raised before trial; that when defendants did not plead Rule 17(a) as a defense before trial, the plaintiff had, under Rule 12(h), the right to consider that defense waived; plaintiff then argues defendants should not have been permitted to assert the point by the mode they employed \u2014 by filing a Motion to Dismiss when all of plaintiff\u2019s evidence was in.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">I do not regard \u201creal party in interest\u201d as a defense and consequently rule that Rule 12(h) is not apposite to such a contention. The fact that a litigant is not the real party in interest is not a defect in capacity within the meaning and purview of Rule 9 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">I can imagine instances where a litigant could be the real party in interest and yet lack capacity to sue, as for example a person who has become mentally incompetent or is an infant with a good cause of action, or by the same token that a person could have capacity to sue and yet not be the real party in interest, as in this case, because plaintiff had assigned all his interest in the cause of action before suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>I regard this premise as acceptable, and Rule 9(a) therefore goes out of the picture and the case simply becomes one of a plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove his case. From the complaint it appears that plaintiff alleged he was the owner of the automobile. Defendants\u2019 answer put this in issue. The pleadings, therefore, required plaintiff to prove his case, including ownership of the automobile. He can recover only if he was able to and proved he was the owner of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The proof showed conclusively that he was not the owner of the automobile, and thus, judgment was properly entered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">It was said in <em>Terry v. Penn. R. R. Co., </em>5 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>1, 8, 156 <em>A. </em>787 (Super. Ct., 1931) that \u201cin a tort action some right or interest in the subject matter of the action must appear in the plaintiff\u201d; here plaintiff had transferred and assigned all his rights in the stolen car to his insurer before suit was brought so he no longer had any \u201cright or interest in the subject matter of the action\u201d at the time suit was brought or the case tried, hence, he could not and did not maintain his burden of proof. I reject plaintiff\u2019s arguments under this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">WAS PLAINTIFF SUING ON A CONTRACT MADE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANOTHER?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Judge Carey\u2019s determination and the reasoning he adopted in <em>Cammile v. Sanderson, </em>9 <em>Terry </em>225, 228, 101 A. 2d 316, 318 (Super. Ct. 1953) is determinative of plaintiff\u2019s second argument. Such contract as plaintiff showed there was, noted that plaintiff was a party to it as the insured and Jersey Insurance Company as the insurer. Hence, plaintiff, in bringing suit, was acting for and in the interest of the insured, a party to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>The discussion to be found in Moore, <em>Federal Practice </em>\u00b617.13, pages 1370-1372 and supplement, and in Barron and Holtzoff, (Wright Ed.), Vol. 2, \u00a7 482, p. 9, where it was pointed out that this \u201cprovision was inserted as a precautionary measure in order that the \u2018real party in interest\u2019 would not be confined to the person beneficially interested\u201d. All show plaintiff\u2019s argument to be without merit. Barron and Holtzoff here point out, as did Professor Moore, that \u201cthe question who is a real party in interest is governed by the substantive law\u201d and in this instance that there is no third party benefit contract before the Court. I reject plaintiff\u2019s arguments under this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">IS THE PLAINTIFF \u201cTHE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST\u201d WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 17(a)?</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Plaintiff, in support of his contention that plaintiff is \u201cthe real party in interest\u201d, argues quite earnestly that since this is a tort case the plaintiff only could and should be permitted to maintain the action and in his name, since tort claims are not assignable, and he cites Judge Christie\u2019s unreported decision <em>(Deseta v. Siple, </em>C. A. 903, 1960) (of which I was fully aware when preparing the former opinion), in support.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">There are no reported cases in this state deciding whether or not a tort claim involving personal property is assignable.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Judge Christie said in <em>Deseta v. Siple:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">\u201cDelaware takes the common law approach to subrogation. Under this approach, an insurance carrier which becomes subrogated to the rights of the insured after payment of damages may sue and recover in the name of the insured. <em>Ierardi v. Farmers\u2019 Trust Co. of Newark, 4 W. W. Harr. </em>246, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>151 A. 822 (Superior Court, 1928). See cases collected in 96 A. <em>L. R. </em>864.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201cSuperior Court Rule 17(a) requires that a suit be brought in the name of the real party in interest.

Farmers\u2019 Trust Co. of Newark, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201cA practical justification for the continuation of the practice is found in the settled policy to exclude from trial as prejudicial any mention of insurance. See <em>Steenburg V. Braunstein, Inc., supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">I reluctantly find myself in apparent disagreement with Judge Christie but I hope ultimately it will appear there is no real disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">The ruling I am about to state will be best understood if all the pertinent facts are set out fully. As the trial of this case opened, the following colloquy took place between counsel and the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">\u201cMe. Beady: Your Honor, if I may, at this point, the Complaint, as originally stated, shows a claim for damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>of the sum of $2,000. Now, evidence will be presented at the trial to indicate that the automobile in this case was subsequently recovered, thus, mitigating the damages and reducing the amount originally stated. I would like Mr. Greenstein, at this time to state the amount of damages which he is now claiming.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\u201cThe Court: Proceed, Mr. Greenstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\u201cMr. Greenstein: Well, Your Honor, the amount that we are claiming is the amount of the claim, minus the salvage value.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">\u201cMr. Brady: My request is for the stated amount of damages. What was the reduction that will be made?</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">\u201cMr. Greenstein: $960.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">\u201cThe Court: Was that the salvage?</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">\u201cMr. Greenstein: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">\u201cThe Court: We have $2,179, minus $960. That is $1,219, now the amount claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s expert witness on the value of plaintiff\u2019s stolen car testified that when plaintiff\u2019s car was stolen it had a value \u201cin the neighborhood of $2,000\u201d. He tended to limit his testimony by referring to the sale of another car of the same model, about which he knew, but with more mileage, stating he was aware it had sold for $1,900. This same expert testified that when plaintiff\u2019s car was recovered it had been sold for $960, less the Pennsylvania State Tax of $38.40, or a net of $921.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">It thus appears that the full extent of plaintiff\u2019s interest in the stolen vehicle amounted to only $1,219, and this is in accordance with the figures he gave at the colloquy, <em>supra, </em>page 9, as the trial got under way.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Before his car was recovered and before he filed suit, plaintiff, for the sum of $1,940, had transferred his car and his cause of action against defendants to the insurer, thereby transferring and surrendering all of his rights in the car or in the cause of action to the insurer, thus, leaving him without any interest whatsoever in the law suit; see <em>Terry v. Penn. R. R. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><em>Ierardi v. Farmers\u2019 Trust Co. of Newark, supra, </em>it is to be noted, involved an action for personal injuries. There is a distinct line of demarcation, see annotation 57 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d at p. 611, between cases involving personal injuries and those wherein property damages are involved. There is no doubt but that a right of action involving personal injuries is not assignable; <em>Id. </em>it seems otherwise, however, where the right of action relates to damage to real or personal property, 6 <em>C.

III </em>chap. 7, gave a remedy to the representatives of a decedent for a trespass to the personal estate, and survivorship was, by a later statute (3 &amp; 4 <em>Wm. IV. </em>chap. 42), prescribed for actions <em>ex delicto </em>for injuries to real property. <em>Ultimately these statutes gave rise to the principle that choses in action for torts which arise from wrongs causing injury to </em>real or <em>personal property, </em>or from torts by which an estate, real or personal, has been injured, diminished, or damages, <em>may be assigned. </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">See also Annotations 157 <em>A.

At page 605 the following statement is to be found: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>in the light of assignees, the quality of assignability being therefore attributed to the causes of action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\u201c \u2018At common law\u2019 (meaning here, prior to English statutes affecting the matter), no chose in action was assignable, the assignment of a mere tort claim being without support even in equity. This situation, according to the statements encountered in various texts, and generally also in the American cases, was at an early time, specifically in the year 1330, altered by the indirect effects of the statute, 4 <em>Edward III, </em>chapter 7, by the terms of which enactment executors were given the right to recover damages for \u2018Trespasses done to their Testators, as to the Goods and Chattels of the same Testators carried away in their fife.\u2019 The same rights of action were later given to administrators. These survival provisions, it is said, received a liberal construction and were deemed to cover the survivability not merely of actions in trover, which clearly were within their language, but other actions for trespasses to personalty as well. As to the additional matter of assignability, the effect of the statutes is traced to the fact that the personal representatives of a decedent were viewed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>\u201cThe theory that a cause of action is assignable if it will survive to the personal representatives of the owner has gained very wide acceptance in this country. </em>A New York case of more than a century ago asserts that \u2018the power to assign and to transmit to personal representatives are convertible propositions.\u2019 The same idea appears in other American cases in various forms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\"><em>\u201cAccordingly, the rule which obtains in most of our states, aided usually by the fact of the English statutes above referred to having become a part of the local common law, but sometimes grounded also in survival statutes </em>in themselves sufficient for the purpose under prevailing theories, and in a few instances directly provided for by statute, <em>is that a tort claim for damages to personal property is fully </em>assignable.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The question was considered at length and a number of cases and authorities reviewed in <em>Zabriskie v. Smith, </em>13 <em>N. Y. </em>322, 332 (N. Y. Ct. of Appeals 1855), and at p. 333 the New York Court referred to the statute 3 <em>Edw. III, </em>ch. 7, and how it changed the rule as to assignments of actions involving torts affecting personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">One such case cited by the New York Court was <em>North et al. v. Turner et al., </em>decided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1823 and reported in 9 <em>Serg. &amp; R. </em>244, 249. That Court held an assignment of a tort action, involving a trespass to personal property \u201csurvives to the personal representative, by the statute 4 <em>Edw. III, </em>c. 7, which clearly shows that such a cause of action is separable from the person of the owner; * * * <em>\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">If there be any doubt whatsoever of the adoption of the statute 4 <em>Edw. III, </em>c. 7, at the time of statement, see 1776 Const., Art. 25, as previously discussed, it is only necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>to show that since 1829, see Vol. 7 <em>Del. Laws </em>at page 477, it has been the statutory law of this state that causes of action pertaining to personal property \u201csurvive to and against the executors or administrators\u201d of deceased persons. Our present statute, 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 3701, in force when the assignment in this case was made, clearly provides for survival of \u201cail causes of action\u201d except a few exceptions specifically noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">It seems clear to me that sufficient has been said in some decisions of this Court to warrant the statement that the statute 4 <em>Edw. III, </em>ch. 7, was \u201cadopted in practice in this state\u201d by Article 25 of the 1776 Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In <em>Hollett v. Wilm. Trust Co., </em>6 <em>W. </em>W. <em>Harr. </em>170, 173, 172 <em>A. </em>763, 764 (Super Ct. 1934) the late Chief Justice Lay-ton observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cThe ancient maxium of the common law, <em>actio personalis moritur cum persona, </em>once applicable alike to contractual and delictual duties and obligations, at the time, had been with respect to the survival of contractual rights and duties, narrowed greatly by natural forces, judicial reasoning and decision, at work in the common law, but in the field of tort, the first relaxation of the maxim was accomplished by the statute 4 <em>Edw. III, </em>c. 7, giving executors a remedy where there was an asportation of, or damage done, to chattels of the testator; but it is to be noted that the statute did not give the executor a right of action for injuries to the person or character of the testator, nor a right of action against executors. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">At a further point in his opinion this great jurist, in considering a reference to <em>Chitty on Pleading, </em>noted (6 <em>W. W. Harr., </em>at 174, 172 A. at 764):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201cThe authority for these conclusions is <em>Hambly v. Trott, supra [Cowp. </em>371]. This great case, decided by Lord Mansfield in 1776, held that the action of trover did not survive against the representative of the deceased converted of chat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tels. This case is of such moment that it has been said, and <em>it is doubtless true, that in a common law jurisdiction the law with respect to survivability of actions for torts is to be determined by, a reference to the doctrine stated by </em>Lord Mansfield, <em>the statute of Edw. III </em>and the statutory enactments of the state. Note to <em>Boor v. Lowrey </em>(103 <em>Ind. </em>468, 3 <em>N. E. </em>151), 53 <em>Am. Rep. </em>530. See, also, <em>R. C. L. Abatement and Revival.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Judge Rodney, while a member of this Court (1942), said, in <em>Industrial Tr. Co. v. Stidham, </em>3 <em>Terry </em>339, 344, 33 A. 2d 159 (Super. Ct. 1943), of the assignability of a cause of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cThe question of assignability largely depends upon the circumstances as to whether the cause of action would survive and pass to the personal representative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Former President Judge Richards of this Court made like observations in 1927 in <em>Garford Motor Truck Company v. Buckson et al., </em>4 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>103, 107, 143 A. 410 (Super. Ct. 1928); and <em>Continental Guaranty Corporation v. People\u2019s Bus Lines, </em>1 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>595, 604-605, 117 A. 275 (Super. Ct. 1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\"> I regard these statements as supporting my holding that if a cause of action survives and passes to the personal representative of a decedent it is assignable and since the trespass to plaintiff\u2019s car, in the case before me, was clearly survivable, it was assignable and plaintiff, by his own act, did assign all of the right, title and interest in the car and cause of action to his insurer and thereby deprived himself of all interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">I point out that in <em>Italo Petroleum Corporation v. Hannigan, </em>1 <em>Terry </em>534, 541, 14 A. 2d 401 (Sup. Ct. 1940), it was held that the right of an assignor or the assignee to maintain suit on a chose in action <em>relates to the remedy of the </em>parties,\u2014 that is to say it is a matter of procedure and, hence, comes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>within the purview of our Rules. For that reason it seems reasonable to consider that Rule 17(a) is probably applicable and determinative of the question before me.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Going back now to Judge Christie\u2019s unreported decision of <em>Deseta v. Siple, </em>of which I previously observed that I did not consider we are in \u201creal disagreement\u201d, I don\u2019t find that Judge Christie was asked to consider the material I have referred to and included in this opinion. Judge Christie\u2019s ruling in that cited case was not that a tort involving damages to personal property was not assignable, but involved a ruling on an interrogatory, the answer to which would have brought mention of insurance into the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">I am not unmindful of Judge Caleb R. Layton, III\u2019s observations in <em>Steenburg v. Braunstein, Inc., </em>6 <em>Terry </em>588, 77 <em>A. </em>2d 206 (Super. Ct. 1950), where 6 <em>Terry </em>at p. 591, 77 <em>A. </em>2d at p. 208 he declined to exercise his discretion, given by Rule 21, to add the insurer in that case as a party plaintiff in light of \u201cthe settled policy of our Courts * * * to exclude from the trial of a case any mention of the fact that a Defendant is insured\u201d. See also <em>Cammile v. Sanderson, </em>9 <em>Terry </em>225, 229, 101 A. 2d 316, 318 (Super. Ct. 1953) per Carey, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">If there be any conflict between what I hold here and the cited cases, I regret my inability to be convinced that I should disregard that which sems to me so clear and logical, and in keeping with the precise directions of Rule 17(a) for considerations that are now unrealistic in light of the fact that practically everybody today, by reason of statutory necessity, is insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">I have given much thought to what the late Chancellor Harrington said in <em>Lynch v. Hill, </em>24 <em>Del. Ch. </em>86, 95, 6 A. 2d 614, 618 (Ct. Ch. 1939):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">\u201c* * * Carefully considered cases in this court should not be disregarded without good reason, * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>See also the comments of the courts in <em>Biddle v. Board of Trustees, </em>3 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>425, 430, 138 <em>A. </em>631, 633 (Super. Ct. 1927) \u2014 per Pennewill, C. J., \u2014 and <em>Green v. Loper, </em>6 <em>Terry </em>117, 124, 67 A. 2d 856, 859 (Super. Ct. 1949), and have concluded that it is my duty \u201cin the interest of justice and proper administration of the law\u201d to take the course I have and to hold claims for torts involving personal property are assignable because our statute has for so long regarded them as surviving to personal representatives. If I am wrong in the conclusion reached and here enunciated, the Supreme Court can and will hold that I erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">I, therefore, conclude that the cause of action which the plaintiff Catalfano acquired by reason of the illegal conduct on the part of the defendants was assignable and effect should be and must be given, as a matter of substantive and procedural law, to Catalfano\u2019s having executed and delivered the instrument (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit #1) by the terms of which he assigned and transferred to his insurer \u201ceach and all claims and demands against any other person * * * arising from or connected with such loss and damage\u201d \u2014 specifically as otherwise resulted therein, and that plaintiff is not the \u201creal party in interest\u201d within the meaning of Rule 17(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">I think this disposes of all arguments advanced by plaintiff in his motion for a new trial. An order may be presented providing that such motion for a new trial is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-12\">This statement may be open to question in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Italo Petroleum Corporation v.
