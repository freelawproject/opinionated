This is a valid ground for annulment under Delaware statute and either party may seek such annulment. 13 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 1551(3). The following are the pertinent facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-21\">(1) On March 23, 1946, Mary married George E. Gar-vine.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-23\">(2) On February 3, 1950, Mary married Elmer C. Staats, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>(3) On February 4, 1950, Mary obtained a final decree of divorce from George E. Garvine from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">(4) On December 8, 1952, Mary married Arthur Harry Warner, plaintiff in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">(5) On March 26,1953, Mary had her marriage to Elmer C. Staats, Jr., annulled by this Court on the ground that she had a living undivorced husband at the time of her marriage to Staats.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">(6) On October 1, 1960, Mary deserted plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Can the existence of the void marriage to Staats form the sole basis for an annulment of the subsequent marriage to Warner?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The following statement in the <em>American Jurisprudence </em>discussion of annulment states the law on the subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">\u201cA void marriage imposes no legal restraint upon the party imposed upon, from contracting another. However, proper and prudent, therefore, it may be that a party to a void marriage should not remarry until the invalidity of the purported marriage becomes a matter of general knowledge or has been pronounced by a court, the law imposes no restraint in this regard. The innocent participant in a bigamous marriage may legally marry another without waiting for the dissolution of the bigamous union either by death or divorce, and indeed, the guilty party to a bigamous marriage may, after the dissolution of his first marriage, legally contract a third marriage. In other words, a marriage is not void by reason of a previous void marriage, although there has been no sentence of nullity of the previous void marriage, and a judicial invalidation of marriage at any time, for the bigamy of a party to it, relates back to the time of the marriage and places the one deceived in a free condition to marry again, or to do any other act as an unmarried woman, without any sentence of the nullity of the marriage.\u201d (35 <em>Am. Jur. </em>Marriage \u00a7 156.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>An annulment decree is not interpreted as voiding a marriage <em>ab initia </em>for all purposes. In <em>Gaines v. Jacobsen, </em>308 <em>N. Y. </em>218, 124 <em>N. E. </em>2d 290, 48 A. <em>L. R. </em>2d 312 (1954), the New York Court of Appeals, in a different fact situation, stated that the relation-back theory as to annulments is a fiction which is sometimes ignored for the \u201cpurposes of justice\u201d. The cases in which the relation-back theory is ignored deal with children, support or property and not with the basic legal status of the parties to the void marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In connection with the marital status of the parties an annulment decree is a judicial declaration that the marriage never had a legal existence. A marriage subject to such a decree was void <em>ab initia </em>and is treated as if it had never existed. 35 <em>Am. Jur. </em>Marriage \u00a7 83; Keezer, <em>Marriage and Divorce </em>(3d ed., Norland, 1946). I conclude that plaintiff in this action has no basis for annulment on the ground that Mary had a living, undivorced husband in the person of Elmer C. Staats, Jr., since her marriage to Staats was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The Court must deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
