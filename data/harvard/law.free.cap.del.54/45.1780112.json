Plaintiff, to enforce payment of the judgment, caused writs of attachment <em>fi. fa. </em>to be issued and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>served on defendant\u2019s employer. Employer\u2019s paymaster testified that defendant was employed as a salesman and was paid a salary and commission. Defendant conceded this testimony was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Defendant moved to quash the attachment writs because of Title 10 <em>Del. C. </em>1953, \u00a7 4913, the pertinent provisions of which are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\u201c(a) Ninety per cent of the amount of the wages for labor or service of any person residing within New Castle County * * * shall be exempt from mesne attachment process and execution attachment process under the laws of this state, except where the execution attachment process is for board or lodging or both, and for an amount not exceeding $50.00 exclusive of costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">\u201c(b) The provisions of this section * * * shall apply solely to debts incurred for or on account of the purchase of food, provisions and articles used in the home, commonly designated as the necessaries of life, * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Defendant\u2019s motion was argued and an opinion filed June 15, 1961, denying the motion because defendant was not a wage earner but was receiving a salary and commissions, consequently he was not in a position to avail himself of the exemption provisions set forth in the wage exemption statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Defendant filed a motion for reargument. This motion was granted. The parties filed new briefs and the case was re-argued orally. The Court reconsidered the case and this opinion is a revision of that filed June 15,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">On reargument defendant contended strenuously that the word \u201csalary\u201d is synonymous with the word \u201cwages\u201d and the Court had erred in differentiating these terms in its original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">Defendant argues that the language of Title 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 8110 \u2014 Statute of Limitations \u2014 as to claims for \u201cwages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>salary or overtime for work, labor or personal services performed\u201d should be considered and read with the wage exemption statute to determine the meaning to be given the word \u201cwages\u201d in the exemption statute. Defendant cites <em>Aero Service Corporation v. Gordy, </em>1954, 10 <em>Terry </em>(49 <em>Del.) </em>59, 109 <em>A. </em>2d 393, and <em>Sorenson v. Overland Corp., D. C., </em>142 <em>F. Supp. </em>354, affirmed 3 <em>Cir., </em>1956, 242 <em>F. </em>2d 70, both of which cases involved the application of Title 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 8110.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">This argument is rejected. The precise holding in <em>Aero Service </em>was that the statute \u201chas reference to the claims of servants, or members of the laboring classes and salaried employees\u201d [49 <em>Del. </em>59, 109 <em>A. </em>2d 394] \u2014 and the holding was based on the language of the statute; it did not consider or define the word \u201cwages\u201d or hold it as synonymous with \u201csalary\u201d; the Court held the statute did not apply to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The precise holding in <em>Sorenson </em>was that the statute did apply to the suit in question \u2014 one brought by a corporate officer against the corporation \u201cfor indemnification for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses growing out of a stockholders\u2019 suit against the officer\u201d \u2014 because 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 8110 covers, not only wages and salaries, but also claims for \u201cdamages * * * resulting from the failure to pay * * * for any other benefit arising from such * * * personal service\u201d. The District Court held that 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 8110 \u201cbars claims for \u2018wages\u2019, \u2018salary\u2019, and it likewise applies * * * to any other \u2018benefits\u2019 arising from the corporate-officer employment relationship. The word \u2018benefits\u2019 is embracing and covers all advantages growing out of the employment.\u201d [142 <em>F. Supp. </em>360.]</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">There is nothing in the <em>Sorenson </em>opinion to the effect that \u201cwages\u201d and \u201csalary\u201d are synonymous and are to be used interchangeably, \u2014 which is defendant\u2019s argument here. The <em>Sorenson </em>opinion of the Court of Appeals doesn\u2019t help defendant\u2019s argument since that Court said only \u201c* * * that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>a claim (such as was asserted) is in the nature of a benefit arising from one\u2019s status as a director. It is in the nature of compensation * * *. * * * we think it is the type of thing that comes under the provision of this one-year statute.\u201d [242 <em>F. </em>2d 73.]</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It is significant that defendant did not cite one case that directly substantiated his argument on this phase of the case; this failure tends to strengthen the conclusion reached by the Court that the terms \u201cwages\u201d and \u201csalary\u201d are not synonymous, as contended, but have a distinct and different meaning, which was the Court\u2019s original determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The question for decision is whether a person being paid a salary \u2014 and receiving a commission, as here \u2014 can avail himself of the protection of the exemption provisions of the statute which uses the term \u201cwages\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The present statute excludes from execution or attachment process\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u201cninety per cent of the amount of <em>the wages for labor or </em>service<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of any person residing within New Castle County.\u201d The italicized language in the present statute, 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 4913, is identical with that used in the initial wage exemption statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of 1873 and with one insignificant exception<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, of all its predecessors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">In construing the meaning to be given to words \u201cwages for labor or service\u201d appearing in the statute, the Court is guided by certain rules of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>First: </em>\u201cwords and phrases shall be read with their context and shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the English language.\u201d 1 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 303<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; <em>Federal United Corporation v. Havender, </em>1940, 24 <em>Del. Ch. </em>318, 335, 11 <em>A. </em>2d 331, 339; <em>State ex rel. Foulger v.

Ch. </em>245, 251, 84 A. 2d 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\"><em>In re </em>Riebs\u2019 <em>Estate, </em>1959, 8 Wis. 2d 110, 98 <em>N. W. </em>2d 453, 455, involved a statute, (W. S. A. 103.39(2), providing that \u201cwages\u201d of a deceased person should, on the death of an employee, be paid by employer to wife, children or other dependents. Riebs had been president of a corporation, at a salary of $20,000 annually. At his death more than $11,000 was found in the hands of the corporation; moneys he had left there. Claims were asserted by the executors of his estate, as personal property devolving to them, and by the executors of his wife\u2019s estate, she having died after he did, which claim was asserted on the basis of the statute. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the term \u201cwages\u201d in the statute was used \u201cin its common meaning of money paid to an employee for manual or physical work done usually on an hourly, daily or piecework basis and distinguished from \u2018salary\u2019 as a fixed payment at regular intervals for services.\u201d That Court applied the rule of construction that where words of a statute are clear they must be given their ordinary meaning. See also <em>Smith v. Board of Trustees, </em>238 <em>Iowa </em>127, 25 <em>N. W. </em>2d 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\"><em>Second: </em>When language is clear a statute must be held to mean what is plainly expressed. <em>Federal United Corporation v. Havender, </em>24 <em>Del. Ch. </em>318, 331, 11 A. 2d 331, 337; <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>26 <em>Del.

Wise, </em>2 <em>Terry 587, 598, 27 A. </em>2d 357, 361, affirming 2 <em>Terry </em>182, 188, 18 A. 2d 419, 421; <em>Pike v. Satterthwaite, </em>1 <em>Terry 595, 597,15 </em>A. 2d 430, 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\"><em>Third: </em>The maxim \u201cExpressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is\u201d seems particularly applicable here. It is stated in Sutherland, <em>Statutory Construction, </em>3rd Ed., \u00a7 4915\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\"><em>\u201cAs the maxim is applied to statutory interpretation, where </em>a form of conduct, the manner of its performance and operation, and the <em>persons and things to which it refers are affirmatively </em>or negatively <em>designated, there is an inference that all omissions were intended by the legislature. </em>* * *\u201d The same author observes, \u00a7 4916\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\u201cWhile the maxim has received considerable mention in legalistic thinking, it is not of legal origin; rather it is a product of \u2018logic and common sense\u2019. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The author, in the following section, suggests this cautionary note\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">\u201cThe maxim * * * requires great caution in its application, and in all cases is applicable only under certain conditions as a tool of statutory interpretation the maxim is important only insofar as it is a syllogistic restatement that the courts will first look strictly to the literal language of the statute to determine legislative intent and so, where the meaning of the statute is plainly expressed in its language, * * * a literal interpretation will prevail. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The Superior Court, sitting in Banc, applied the maxim in the case of <em>State ex rel. Green v. Foote, </em>5 W. W. <em>Harr. </em>(35 <em>Del.) </em>514, 521, 168 A. 245, 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">The language used by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the fairly recent case of <em>Petition for Division into Wards, etc., </em>388 <em>Pa. </em>539, 130 A. 2d 695, 698\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201cIf the legislature had intended to empower the court to abolish or consolidate wards it knew how to express its intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">illustrates when and why the maxim can and does aid in determining the meaning of a statute. So also is the reference by the Vermont Supreme Court in <em>In re Downers\u2019 Estate, </em>101 <em>Vt. </em>167, 142 <em>A. </em>78, 82, where that Court, by comparing the positive language of a statute with what had been omitted, determined the taxability of a legacy. That Court in applying the maxim cited and quoted from an opinion by the late Chief Justice Taft, in <em>Ford v. United States, </em>273 <em>U. S. </em>593, 611, 47 S. <em>Ct. </em>531, 537, 71 <em>L. Ed. </em>793, 801, where it was said\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u201cThis maxim properly applies only when in the natural association of ideas in the mind of the reader that which is expressed is so set over by way of strong contrast to that which is omitted that the contrast enforces the affirmative inference that that which is omitted must be intended to have opposite and contrary treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">If the General Assembly had intended to exempt salary and other forms of remuneration arising from the employer-employee relationship as well as \u201cwages\u201d from garnishment process, it could have easily done so by use of appropriate language, such as inclusion of the word \u201csalaries\u201d or by using a general term, such as \u201ccompensation\u201d or \u201crecompense\u201d or \u201cearnings\u201d. See Vol. 2, <em>Freeman on Executions, 2d </em>Ed., \u00a7 <em>234, </em>Page 1254. It is to be noted that when the General Assembly amended the wage exemption statute, 42 <em>Del. Laws, </em>Ch. 152, now 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 3503, as amended, in its application to public employees, it used the phrase \u201ccompensation from funds of the State, county, district or municipality for any services rendered by such employees * * *\u201d rather than \u201cwages\u201d. When the General Assembly has been considering salaries, it has used the word \u201csalary\u201d, <em>e.g., </em>29 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 6316; and when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>has been concerned with \u201cwages\u201d, it has employed that word in its usual sense, <em>e.g. </em>12 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2105. The provisions of the Code abound with other examples too numerous to consider in detail, <em>i.e. </em>\u201ccompensation\u201d: 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 304; \u201cwages\u201d: 38 <em>Del. L. Ch. </em>1, \u00a7 4; \u201csalary\u201d: 2 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 114, 3 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 5103, 9 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 8205, 20 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 122, 29 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2501, 2902, 2904.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Some treatises and even some decided cases make somewhat broad and general statements to the effect that \u201cwages\u201d and \u201csalaries\u201d are synonymous and used interchangeably. See <em>Shinn on Attachment and Garnishment, </em>Vol. 2, \u00a7 557(c), Page 942; 557(d), Page 944; <em>Freeman on Executions, </em>3d Ed., Vol. 2, \u00a7 234; 35 <em>C. J. S. </em>Exemptions \u00a7 47; and 23 <em>Am. </em>Jur.\u2014 Exemptions \u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 64, 65, 66, 67. I cannot, however, agree with or accept these broad and general statements; such statements have to be analyzed and the statutes under consideration in them examined for specific terminology to see to what extent such interchangeable use may be applicable in light of the particular statutory language. The variation in the language used in these exemption statutes is considered in <em>Freeman on Executions, </em>3d Ed., Vol. 2, \u00a7 234. The author commented at Page 1246 \u2014 \u201cIt will be observed that these statutes, while addressed to the accomplishment of substantially the same objects, vary in their praseology\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\"><em>Fourth: </em>A court must look to the particular word or phrase in a statute from which meaning of the statute is to be determined in order to give meaning and effect to the entire statute. See <em>Aero Service Corporation v. Gordy, supra, </em>and <em>In re Stryker, </em>158 <em>N. Y. </em>526, 53 <em>N. E. </em>525 discussed post. To paraphrase the language in the Stryker case \u201cthe most important word in the [wage exemption, 10 <em>Del. C. </em>1953, \u00a7 4913] statute is the word \u2018wages\u2019. It was wages\u201d that was the concern of the General Assembly when that Body was, in 1873, seeking to exempt \u201cwages for labor or service * * *\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>from execution or attachment process; it, however, evinced no interest or concern for those receiving a \u201csalary\u201d; it showed no intent to exempt \u201csalaries\u201d as it had \u201cwages\u201d, and so those who are paid \u201csalaries\u201d may not claim exemption under the language used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The common and approved meaning of the word wages is \u201cpay given for labor, usually manual or mechanical, at short stated intervals, as distinguished from salaries or fees.\u201d <em>Bell v. Midland National Life Insurance Company, S. D. </em>1960, 102 <em>N. W. </em>2d 322, 328; see also <em>Heard v. Crum, </em>1895, 73 <em>Miss. </em>157, 18 <em>So. </em>934; <em>Gilbert v. State Mutual Life Assurance Co., </em>1958, 7 A. <em>D. </em>2d 778, 180 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 7; <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary; In re Riebs\u2019 Estate </em>and <em>Smith v. Board of Trustees, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The Court should not stop here, for the word \u201cwages\u201d in the statute is followed by the phrase \u201cfor labor or service\u201d and identical phrasing was before the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Laws, </em>1896, 163 <em>U. S. </em>258, 16 <em>S. Ct. </em>998, 999, 41 <em>L. Ed. </em>151, which was considering a statute prohibiting the importation of aliens under contracts \u201cto perform labor or service\u201d in the United States, as such statute applied to a chemist. In concluding that the statute was not applicable, the Court did so upon the ground that the \u201cact was clearly intended to apply * * * to cheap, unskilled labor.\u201d So, too, in <em>Jorgensen v. Mickle, 1930, 259 Mich. </em>571, 244 <em>N. W. </em>167, Michigan Court concluded that an office helper did not perform \u201clabor\u201d for payment of which stockholders were liable under statute (Comp. Laws 1929, \u00a7 10026). And in <em>Weymouth v. Sanborn, </em>1861, 43 <em>N. H. 171, </em>173, the New Hampshire Court held that a physician\u2019s services did not constitute a claim for labor as to which the exception to the exemption of a homestead from execution process was applicable. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cThe common and ordinary signification of the term labor accords, we think, with the definition given by the best lexicographers, and is understood to be physical toil. And the term laborer is ordinarily employed to denote one subsists by physical toil, in distinction from one who subsists by professional skill. The exception of claims for labor would not, therefore, ordinarily be understood to embrace the services of the clergyman, physician, lawyer, commission merchant, or <em>salaried officer, </em>agent, railroad and other contractors, <em>but would be confined to claims arising out of services where physical toil was the main ingredient, </em>although directed and made more valuable by mechanical skill.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">A similar view was expressed in <em>Heebner v. Chave, </em>1846, 5 <em>Pa. </em>115, 117. The Court was there concerned with a statute which, in the Court\u2019s paraphrase, prevented \u201cthe wages of any labourers from being liable to attachment in the hands of the employer.\u201d At issue was the applicability of the exemption to sums due to a contractor from the other contracting party. In holding the exemption inapplicable, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cThe term labour is, to be sure, of very extensive signification. The merchant labours, the farmers labours, the professional man labours, and judges labour, as every member of this Court can testify. <em>But it is this very capability of enlarged extension which produces the necessity to circumscribe and limit the word as used in the statute, in order to accomplish what we believe must have been the intent of the legislature. That is, to secure to the manual labourer by profession and occupation, the fruits of his own work for the subsistance of himself and family.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The term \u201cwages\u201d has been considered in numerous cases and consideration of them leads to the conclusion that the term \u201cwages\u201d has usually been given a different meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>than should be accorded<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the term \u201csalary\u201d. As previously mentioned, courts usually restrict the term \u201cwages\u201d to sums paid as hire to domestic or menial servants and those employed in the various manual occupations. On the other hand, the term \u201csalary\u201d usually has reference to the compensation of clerks, salesmen, bookkeepers, other employees of like class and performing like services and supervisory personnel and officers of corporations, as well as public officers. <em>South &amp; N. A. R. Co. v. Falkner, </em>49 <em>Ala. </em>115, 118; <em>State v. Duncan, </em>1 <em>Tenn. Ch. App. </em>334; <em>Adcock v. Smith, </em>97 <em>Tenn. </em>373, 37 S. <em>W. </em>91, 92; <em>People ex rel. Van Valkenburg v. Myers, Sup., </em>11 <em>N. Y. S. </em>217, 218; <em>Cane v. City of New York, Sup., </em>34 <em>N.

S., </em>1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The distinction between the word \u201cwages\u201d and the word \u201csalary\u201d has been recognized over a long period of time, judicially in <em>Heebner v. Chave, </em>1846, <em>supra </em>and <em>Cowdin v. Huff, </em>1857, 10 <em>Ind. 83, </em>85 and by the lexicographers of that period, as will appear in the discussion in the opinion in <em>People ex rel Van Valkenburg v. Myers, Sup. </em>1890, 11 <em>N. Y. S. </em>217, 218, post. See also <em>Wildner v. Ferguson, </em>1889, 42 <em>Minn. </em>112, 43 <em>N. W. </em>794, 6 <em>L. R. A. </em>338; <em>Jones v. Avery, </em>1883, 50 <em>Mich. </em>326, 15 N.

Lang, </em>1885, 64 Wis. 525, 25 <em>N. W. </em>650, 651, where the opinion discusses, defines and applies meaning to the term \u201cwages\u201d as distinguished from the term \u201csalary\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">This time element is important in light of the fact our wage exemption statute, 15 <em>Del. Laws, </em>p. 309, Ch. 185, now Title 10, <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 4913, was passed in 1873. It is safe to assume that the members of that General Assembly gave the word \u201cwages\u201d the meaning it had at the time the statute was enacted. 82 <em>C. J. S. </em>Statutes \u00a7 329, Page 638 and cases in footnote 11; 50 <em>Am. Jur. </em>\u2014 Statutes\u2014\u00a7 236, Page 224. See <em>Gordon v. Jennings, </em>9 <em>Q. B. D. </em>45 (1882) discussed post. It is further safe to assume that the members of the General Assembly knew of the then recognized distinction in meaning between the words \u201cwages\u201d and \u201csalary\u201d. I, therefore, conclude that the meaning of the word \u201cwages\u201d as it was understood to have been at the time the statute was enacted, including the then understood distinction between \u201cwages\u201d and \u201csalary\u201d was the sense used by the General Assembly and this is a canon of construction that will guide here.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">A case which has an excellent discussion of the words \u201csalary\u201d and \u201cwages\u201d and noted the distinction between them is <em>People ex rel. Van Valkenburg v. Myers, Sup. </em>1890, 11 <em>N. Y. S. </em>217, where the Court, after reviewing the then recognized dictionary meanings of these two words, and a number of decisions, said at page 218:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">\u201c* * * The distinction between \u2018salary\u2019 and \u2018wages\u2019 is recognized by all lexicographers, by the courts in many adjudicated cases, and by the legislatures of this and other states, and by congress, in innumerable statutes. Webster defines \u2018salary\u2019 as follows: \u2018The recompense or consideration stipulated to be paid to a person for services, usually a fixed sum to be paid by the year, as to governors, magistrates, settled clergymen, instructors of seminaries, or other officers, civil or ecclesiastical. When wages are stated or stipulated by the month, week or day, we do not call the compensation \u201csalary\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>but \u201cpay\u201d or \u201cwages\u201d, as in the case of military men and laborers.\u2019 He defines \u2018wages\u2019 as follows: \u2018Hire; reward; that which is paid or stipulated for services, but chiefly for services for manual labor, or for military or naval services. We speak of \u201cservants\u2019 wages\u201d, \u201claborers\u2019 wages\u201d, or \u201csoldiers\u2019 wages\u201d, but we never apply the word to rewards given to men in office, which are called \u201cfees\u201d or \u201csalary\u201d.\u2019 <em>Abbotts Law Dictionary </em>defines \u2018wages\u2019 as follows: \u2018The agreed compensation for services rendered in a menial or subordinate capacity.\u2019 The same work defines \u2018salary\u2019 as \u2018a reward or compensation for services performed. It is usually applied to the reward paid to a public officer for the performance of his official duties.\u2019 <em>Burrill\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u2018salary\u2019 as \u2018an annual compensation for services rendered; a fixed sum to be paid by the year for services.\u2019 Worcester, referring to \u2018wages\u2019, says: \u2018In ordinary language the term \u201cwages\u201d is usually employed to distinguish the sums paid to persons hired to perform menial labor.\u2019 Winfield defines \u2018salary\u2019 as \u2018the per annum compensation to men in official and some other situations.\u2019 The same authority defines \u2018wages\u2019 as follows: \u2018The word \u201cwages\u201d means the compensation paid to a hired person for his services. This compensation to the laborer may be a specific sum for a given time of service, or a fixed sum for a specified work; that is, the payment be made by the job.\u2019 The same distinction between \u2018salary\u2019 and \u2018wages\u2019 is to be found in many cases, in which the courts have been called upon to construe the statutes containing those words. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><em>In re Stryker, </em>1899, 158 <em>N. Y. </em>526, 53 <em>N. E. </em>525, involved construction of a statute <em>(Laws </em>1885, c. 376) giving a preference to \u201cwages\u201d of \u201cemployees, operatives and laborers\u201d. Claims were asserted under this statute by a clerk, a bookkeeper, a superintendent of the corporation, foremen and by draftsmen, \u2014 all of whom had been on salary. They sought preferences on the basis that their compensation was in reality \u201cwages\u201d. The claims had been rejected by the lower court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>this position was sustained, 53 <em>N. E. </em>at page 525, by the New York Court of Appeals, where that Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cThe most important word in the statute is the word \u2018wages\u2019. It was wages that the legislature intended to prefer in the distribution of the assets of the insolvent corporation, not salaries, nor earnings, nor compensation. It was not intended to prefer, the claims of all employees; but it was manifestly intended to limit the preference to the particular class whose claims would be properly expressed by the use of the word \u2018wages.\u2019 This word is applied in common parlance specifically to the payment made for manual labor, or other labor or menial or mechanical kind, as distinguished from salary and from fee, which denotes compensation paid to professional men. Cent. Dist. In its application to laborers and employees, it conveys the idea of subordinate occupation, which is not very remunerative, of not much independent responsibility, but rather subject to immediate supervision. This was the construction which this court placed upon the statute in the case of <em>People v. Remington, </em>45 <em>Hun. </em>[329,] 338, affirmed here on the opinion below, 109 <em>N. Y. </em>631, 16 <em>N. E. </em>680. It was said in that case that the statute was designed to secure the prompt payment of the wages of persons who, as a class, are dependent upon their earnings for the support of themselves and their families; and it was not designed to give a preference to the salaries and compensation due to officers and employes of a corporation occupying superior positions of trust or profit. I cannot doubt that this is a correct interpretation of the statute, which conforms to the purpose which the legislature evidently had in view in its enactment. In order to give the preference provided by the statute, the claim must be for wages in the ordinary sense of that term. It was not, we think, the purpose of the statute to secure a preference for claims due to the clerical force engaged in transacting the business, nor to the superintendent, foreman, or oEcers of the corporation who are compensated by a fixed yearly salary. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>In re Stryker </em>was cited and followed by the late Mr. Justice Cardozo in <em>Austin v. City of New York, </em>258 <em>N. Y. </em>113, 117, 179 <em>N. E. </em>313, 314, while he was a member of the New York Court of Appeals, and by Judge Learned Hand in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in <em>MacGregor v. Johnson-Cowdin-Emmerich, </em>26 <em>F. </em>2d 311, which case considered the same statute, in considering a claim by a department head who was compensated by a monthly salary and a bonus measured by the net profits. See also <em>Gay et al. v. Hudson River Electric Power Co., </em>2 <em>Cir., </em>178 <em>F. </em>499.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The distinction between the word \u201cwages\u201d and the word \u201csalary\u201d was recognized by the English Courts. <em>Gordon v. Jennings, </em>9 <em>Q.B.D. </em>45 (1882), where the Court held that the \u201csalary\u201d of the secretary of a corporation could not be exempted as \u201cwages\u201d under the English Wages Attachment Abolition Act. One of the members of the Court reasoned (P. 46):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u201c* * *. The intention of the Act is to abolish the attachment of \u2018wages\u2019. Now it may be that the term \u2018wages\u2019, according to the etymological meaning of the word, may be correctly applied to any remuneration for services, but <em>it seems to me that the popular signification must be looked to. </em>The term \u2018wages\u2019 is not applied to the remuneration of a high or important officer of the state or a company, for instance, but to that of domestic servants, labourers, and persons of a similar description.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\"><em>South &amp; N. Alabama R. Co. v. Falkner, </em>1873, 49 <em>Ala. </em>115, involved a judgment obtained against a president of a railroad. A judgment creditor sought to attach his salary. It was contended by this president that he could claim an exemption under the statute which provided that the \u201cwages of laborers and employees shall not be subject to garnishment or attachment, * * *.\u201d In rejecting this claim, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled (at page 118):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201c* * * The president of a railroad company cannot be said to be a laborer or employee, within the meaning of this law. The term \u2018wages\u2019 indicates inconsiderable pay, without excluding \u2018salary,\u2019 \u2014 which is suggestive of larger compensation for personal services. But its application to laborers and employees certainly conveys the idea of a subordinate occupation which is not very remunerative; one of not much independent responsibility, but rather subject to immediate supervision. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>South &amp; N. Ala. R. R. Co. v. Falkner, </em>was followed in 1935 in <em>Smith v. City of Mobile, </em>230 <em>Ala. </em>584, 162 <em>So. </em>361, where the Alabama Court considered and discussed the distinction between \u201cwages\u201d and \u201csalary\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The clear intent of Title 10 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 4901, is that all property \u201cmay be seized and sold upon judgment and execution obtained\u201d, unless made specifically exempt by statute, Title 10 <em>Del.

Such cases substantiate a holding that there was a then recognized distinction in meaning between these terms, and the failure of the General Assembly to include the word \u201csalary\u201d in the 1873 exemption statute, and the many amendments thereafter, requires that I deny defendant\u2019s motion to quash since the General Assembly limited the exemption to persons earning \u201cwages\u201d and I hold that \u201csalaries\u201d are not exempt from garnishment proceedings.
