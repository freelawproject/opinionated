The owner of a two hundred acre tract of land near a city entered into a written agreement with four other persons, part of whom were real estate brokers, whereby the latter, at their own expense, were to lay out and plat the land into lots and blocks, advertise and sell the same, and pay the first party the sum of $50,000, after which the balance derived from the sale of the remaining lots was to be divided equally between the parties, each taking a fifth: Held, that by the contract the parties created a partnership in the enterprise of subdividing, platting, advertising and selling the two hundred acres of land, the contract giving to each a community of interest in the profits of the enterprise.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b27-13\" pgmap=\"27\">2.

Benshaw, has sold and conveyed a large portion of the land, but how much the complainants can not state, and has received in payment therefor a sum in excess of $50,000; that Benshaw, who has managed the property for Elizabeth Winstanley, has neglected and refused to furnish the complainants a statement of the amount of land sold and the sum realized therefor, although often requested so to do; that the complainants have at different times negotiated sales of different portions of the land at favorable prices, but that Benshaw and Mrs. Winstanley have refused and failed to cause deeds to be executed in accordance with the sales thus negotiated.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-4\" pgmap=\"32\">That Mrs. Winstanley has made sales without consulting the complainants, at less than could have been obtained for the land; that combining and confederating with John W. Benshaw and Caroline Benshaw, she being the wife of John W. Benshaw and the sister of Mrs. Winstanley, Mrs. Winstanley has made conveyances of portions of the land to Caroline Benshaw, that is to say, on August 18, 1890, she conveyed to. her three certain blocks of the land subdivided for a pretended consideration of $3600; and on June 9, 1890, she also conveyed to Caroline Benshaw another block for a pretended consideration of $3500; and also January 22, 1891, she made to her a pretended' conveyance of seven blocks and parts of two other blocks in the subdivision for a pretended consideration of $15,000; that those conveyances were not made in good faith, and were without consideration, and that the value of the land thus conveyed was much in excess of the pretended considerations named in the deeds, and they were made for the purpose of defrauding the complainants and of depriving them of their just profits arising from the sale of the lands at their true value; that Mrs.' Winstanley also, on August 18, 1890, conveyed to defendant .Josephine Fuchs, who is also her sister, for a pretended consideration of $4500, two and one-half blocks in the subdivision, and it is also charged that such conveyance was made without sufficient consideration, and in fraud of the rights of the complainants.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\" pgmap=\"32(88) 33(20)\">The bill prays for an accounting, and that the pretended sales to Caroline Benshaw and Josephine Fuchs be set aside; that Mrs. Winstanley be enjoined from conveying any more of the lands except with the consent and approval of the complainants ; that a receiver be appointed to take charge of the business of the parties covered by the agreement, with directions to sell such portions of the land as have not been sold, and such as have been conveyed but not in good faith, and for such other and further relief as the nature of the case may require, and as to equity may appertain.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\" pgmap=\"33(322) 34(84)\">The defendants answered, admitting the execution of the contracts as alleged, but otherwise denying the equities of the bill. At the hearing, which was had on pleadings and proofs, evidence was introduced tending to prove performance of the contracts on the part of the complainants as alleged, and among other things, that they, together with defendants Benshaw and Fuchs, caused the land in question, consisting of about 200 acres, with the exception of 65 acres thereof which was omitted by consent of all the parties, to be subdivided and platted, under the name of \u201cWinstanley Parkthat they also caused maps of the subdivision, showing the blocks, lots, streets and alleys, to be made and distributed as advertisements, and that by sign-boards, newspaper advertisements and otherwise, the lands were offered to the public for sale and that they also advanced a portion of their shares of the expenses; that Mrs. Winstanley afterward, with the assistance of Benshaw, but without consulting the complainants, sold and conveyed the 65 acres not platted and various portions of the land embraced in the subdivision, to various parties, for the aggregate sum of $49,946; that she had also entered into a contract with her two sisters for the sale to them of three lots in the subdivision for $600, a contract which the court by its decree confirms, making the total amount with which Mrs. Winstanley is chargeable $50,546; that she has also made to her sisters the several conveyances charged in the bill, and that such conveyances were not in good faith nor for an adequate consideration; that Caroline Benshaw and Josephine Fuchs have each sold and conveyed to hona fide purchasers some portions of the lands so conveyed to them, the sums thus realized by Josephine Fuchs being $2086.50, and those realized by Caroline Benshaw being $5400. It also appears that Caroline Benshaw has erected a dwelling house and placed other improvements on certain'of the lots conveyed to her, the value of the lots so improved being $800, and she was accordingly-charged in the decree with that sum, and her title to the lots improved was confirmed. The total amount with which Mrs. Winstanley and her two sisters are thus shown to be chargeable is $58,832.50. It also appears that Mrs. Winstanley has advanced the sum of $1000, towards defraying the expenses of platting, and advertising,:for which she is entitled to credit.</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\" pgmap=\"34(261) 35(13)\">The decree finds, in substance, that the contracts in question constituted the parties thereto partners in the enterprise of platting, subdividing, advertising and selling the lands, Mrs. Winstanley to receive the first $50,000 realized from sales, the other four contracting parties to pay the expenses incident to platting, advertising and selling the land, and the five to share equally in the net profits, after the $50,000 were paid. It is accordingly decreed that the partnership thus created be dissolved, and that the assets of the firm be distributed between the partners according to their respective interests. The sales from which the $58,832.50 had been realized, having been made to innocent purchasers, were confirmed, and the conveyances to Caroline Eenshaw and Josephine Fuchs, except as above indicated, were set aside. Caroline Eenshaw and Josephine Fuchs are each ordered to pay to the partnership the sums in their hands realized from sales, and Mrs. Winstanley is also ordered to pay over the amount in her hands after deducting $50,000. Out of the moneys thus paid in, Mrs. Winstanley is to be paid the $1000 advanced'by her for the payment of expenses, and that amount is charged to the other parties, after crediting them with the sums advanced by them respectively for the payment of expenses. The surplus on hand collected from Mrs. Winstanley, Mrs. Eenshaw and Mrs. Fuchs, after adjusting the account for expenses, is ordered to be divided equ\u00e1lly between the five partners, and the master is ordered to sell the lands and lots undisposed of, and distribute the proceeds one-fifth to each of the parties to the contracts.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\" pgmap=\"35\">From this decree the defendants to the bill have appealed' to this court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-6\" pgmap=\"35\">Mr. Charles P.

Mrs. Winstanley was to receive $50,000 out of the moneys first realized from sales, and the other four contracting parties were to defray the expenses incidental to the carrying out of the enterprise, and the five were to share equally in the moneys arising from sales, after the $50,000 were paid Mrs. Winstanley. This gave to each a community of interest in the profits of the enterprise.</p> <p id=\"b38-7\" pgmap=\"38\">We think the court below was justified in holding that the conveyances of considerable portions of the land to Mrs. Fuchs and Mrs. Benshaw were fraudulent and void as against the other contracting parties, and in setting those conveyances aside and treating the lands thus conveyed as partnership assets. The prices at which those conveyances were made are clearly shown by the evidence to be much less than the actual market value of the lands conveyed, and the grantees are so related to the other parties in interest that they can not be permitted in that way to obtain an advantage over the other partners. Mrs. Fuchs is a party to the contract, and is consequently one of the partners, and Mrs. Benshaw is the wife of another partner, and a sister of Mrs. Winstanley. A partner is, by virtue of the partnership relation, incapacitated to purchase or deal in the partnership property for his own benefit, but his purchase must be held to be in trust or for the benefit of the copartnership. This principle alone, disposes of- the right of Mrs. Fuchs to claim title under the conveyance to her adverse to the other parties to the contract.</p> <p id=\"b39-4\" pgmap=\"39\">Mrs. Renshaw, though not herself a party to the contract, is the wife of the managing partner. Her husband is shown to have been the chief adviser and principal agent of Mrs. Winstanley in making these as well as the other, conveyances of the lands in question. These facts, as well as her relationship to Mrs. Winstanley, necessarily subject her dealings with the partnership property to a very close and searching scrutiny, and even throw upon her the burden of showing good faith and an adequate consideration. We think the evidence clearly warrants the finding of the court below that her title was not acquired in good faith and for a sufficient consideration, and that she stands in no better plight than her husband would have done if he had taken the title in his own name.</p> <p id=\"b39-5\" pgmap=\"39\">Counsel make the point that the partnership is only in the profits of the enterprise, and therefore that the firm has no interest in the lands themselves, and that the lands not being partnership assets, were subject to be disposed of by Mrs. Winstanley as she saw fit, leaving in the other partners the mere right to call- her to account by an action at law for a breach of her contract. In this view we are unable to concur. After the payment to Mrs. Winstanley of the $50,000 provided by the contract, the residue of the land remaining unsold became partnership assets. The partners then had the right, by the terms of the contract, to have the land so remaining sold, and upon such sale, to have the entire proceeds distributed as partnership profits. Under these circumstances, the land itself was in equity the property of the firm, and is to be treated in all respects as partnership assets, and the court properly decreed its sale and the distribution of the proceeds on that basis.</p> <p id=\"b39-6\" pgmap=\"39\">We find no error in the decree of which the appellants have cause to complain, and it will accordingly be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b39-7\" pgmap=\"39\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
