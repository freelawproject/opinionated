INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To establish eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture, a petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). Having conducted our review, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Shah failed to meet these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Further, we find that the IJ did not abuse her discretion in denying Shah\u2019s request for a continuance. <em>See Onyeme v.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOA\"><em>INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998). Finally, we reject Shah\u2019s equal protection challenge to the NSEERS program. <em>See Kandamar v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir.2006); <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 439-40 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 681 n. 4 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1367 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
