Monica Gant alleged Chander and Ashima Kant (\u201cthe Kants\u201d) breached the contract. Gant sought specific performance as well as damages resulting from the alleged breach. The case, originally filed in state court, was removed to federal district court, and the Kants counterclaimed. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, the Kants moved for summary judgment on Gant\u2019s claims and for partial summary judgment on their counterclaims. Following a hearing, the district court denied the Kants\u2019 Rule 56 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-21\">The district court thereafter issued a settlement order, stating it was advised by the parties that the action had \u201cbeen settled, including all counter-claims, cross-claims, third-party claims and attorney\u2019s fees, if any.\u201d The settlement order dismissed the action but provided \u201c[t]he entry of this Order is WITHOUT PREJUDICE to the right of a party to move for good cause within 30 days to reopen this action if settlement is not consummated. If no party moves to reopen, the dismissal shall be WITH PREJUDICE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-22\">The Kants filed a motion to reopen on the twenty-ninth day following the settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ment order. One day later, and before the district court had an opportunity to rule on the motion to reopen, the Kants filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Citing <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (per curiam), the district court found the Kants\u2019 notice of appeal served to divest the court of jurisdiction to rule on the Kants\u2019 motion to reopen. The Kants then filed a motion for certification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (2000), which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). We dismiss the action without prejudice because the Kants moved to reopen within the thirty-day period allotted for reopening in the district court\u2019s settlement order. Any consideration of the appeal by this court prior to the district court\u2019s ruling on the motion to reopen would be premature. If the district court grants the motion to reopen, the case will proceed in the district court in the ordinary course. On the other hand, if the district court denies the motion to reopen, any party aggrieved by that order may note an appeal at that time. We deny as unnecessary the Kants\u2019 motion to remand filed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
