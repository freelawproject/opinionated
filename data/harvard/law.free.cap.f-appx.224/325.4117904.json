He argues that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 when it adopted the probation officer\u2019s determination that he should be denied a minor-role reduction. He asserts that the probation officer\u2019s evaluation of his role was based solely on a comparison of his culpability to that of his codefendant, and that such was error because the probation officer was required to compare his culpability \u201cto all those actually involved in the offense, not merely to those who were formally charged.\u201d Our review of the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines is de novo. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358-62 (5th Cir.2005); Fed. R.Crim. P. 51(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-16\">A fair reading of the entirety of the probation officer\u2019s response reflects that the probation officer was not restricting his comparison of Gonzalez\u2019s conduct to that of his codefendant. Rather, the probation officer was emphasizing that regardless of any other person\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy, Gonzalez was not less culpable than the codefendant, and thus not less culpable than the average participant. Gonzalez\u2019s argument that the district court misapplied \u00a7 3B1.2 is thus without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">Gonzalez also argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was not reasonable. Although he concedes that his sentence is to be reviewed for reasonableness under this court\u2019s precedent, Gonzalez also asserts that the presumption-of-reasonableness standard is unconstitutional. This court is bound by the precedent of previous panels absent \u201can intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling that prior precedent.\u201d <em>United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Gonzalez\u2019s sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). \u201cIf the sentencing judge exercises her discretion to impose a sentence within a properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>calculated Guideline range, in our reasonableness review we will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519. \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">While Gonzalez\u2019s assertions could possibly support a decision to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range, they do not show that the sentence within the guidelines range was unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 554-55. Gonzalez\u2019s sentence is presumed to be reasonable, and he has failed to rebut that presumption. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
