DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b928-19\">A. <em>Asylum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-20\">We are \u201c \u2018obligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). \u201cAn asylum application must be \u2018filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B)). \u201cThis one-year filing period commences either on the date of the alien\u2019s last arrival in the United States or April 1, 1997, whichever is later.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir.2003). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s timeliness determination because the specific statutory language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) demon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>strates Congress intended to bar such review. <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002). After the passage of the REAL ID Act of 2005, we again recognized \u00a7 1158(a)(3) continues to divest this \u201c \u2018Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 957 (citation omitted). Because the IJ concluded Arango\u2019s asylum application was time-barred and that no extraordinary circumstances excused the untimeliness, we lack jurisdiction to review his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">B. <em>Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). To the extent the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s reasoning as well. <em>Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1312 (11th Cir.2006). In this case, the BIA expressly adopted and affirmed some of the IJ\u2019s findings and articulated additional findings as well. Thus, we will review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">We review legal conclusions <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). We review findings of fact under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to \u201caffirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001)). Under the substantial evidence test, the record must not only support reversal, it must compel it. <em>Fahim, </em>278 F.3d at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">The INA forbids the removal of an alien from the United States if \u201cthe alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened ... because of ... race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). An applicant may show he is entitled to withholding of removal in two ways. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006). First, the applicant may establish he experienced past persecution motivated, at least in part, by a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>Second, he may establish it is more likely than not he would be persecuted on account of the protected ground. <em>Id. </em>Either way, the applicant must establish a causal connection between the protected ground and the feared persecution, presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he ... will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). \u201cIt is not enough to show that [he] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [his] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Even if Arango was persecuted in Colombia, the evidence does not compel the conclusion the persecution was on account of his actual or implied political opinion. Arango did not establish a causal connection between the alleged past persecution or feared future persecution and his political opinion. Arango\u2019s own application and testimony indicated the shootings and other written threats did not begin until he quit paying the FARC\u2019s extortion demands. This supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusions that he was targeted because he refused to cooperate with the FARC by paying their extortion demands, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>does not meet the burden for withholding of removal. <em>See Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">We dismiss the petition for review with respect to the asylum and CAT claims, and deny it with respect to the withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-13\">. We do not address Arango\u2019s CAT claim because Arango did not fully exhaust his administrative remedies by appealing the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim to the BIA. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider his CAT claim on appeal. <em>Camacho-Salinas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>460 F.3d 1343, 1347, n. 1 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
