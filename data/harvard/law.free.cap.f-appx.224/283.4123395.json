Planter\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggesting that the district court erred in sentencing Planter.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">We find that the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing the one hundred month sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006); <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Additionally, we find that the district court\u2019s decision to deny Planter\u2019s request for a variance from the guideline range was reasonable, and its determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>nation of the sentence within the range was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006). (\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated [guidelines range [\u00b6]... ] is presumptively reasonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Planter also challenges the use of prior convictions that were neither admitted by him nor found by the jury, in calculating his criminal history category. The fact of a prior conviction need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-36, 243-44, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 351-54 (4th Cir.) (reaffirming continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>after <em>Booker), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). Thus, the district court was not required to make any factual findings concerning Planter\u2019s prior record, but could rely on \u201cthe conclusive significance\u201d of his record as set out in the presentence report. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 285 (4th Cir.2005) (sentencing judge entitled to rely on undisputed information in presentence report that \u201cbears the earmarks of derivation from Shepard-approved sources such as the indictments and state-court judgments from [defendant\u2019s] prior convictions\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1005, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006). We find that the district court did not violate Planter\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights when it considered his prior convictions in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
