He argues that the district court erred by imposing a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for his being an organizer or leader of criminal activity involving five or more participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-03 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). The district court\u2019s application of a \u00a7 3B1.1 adjustment is a factual matter that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Dadi, </em>235 F.3d 945, 951 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">While the testimony at sentencing was based on information received from unidentified individuals and some of Arredondo\u2019s co-conspirators, hearsay evidence may be considered at sentencing if it has suffieient indicia of reliability, and Arredondo has not shown that the testimony did not have sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>See United States v. Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d 545, 558 (5th Cir.1996). Given the testimony at sentencing and \u201cthe extreme deference of the \u2018clear error\u2019 standard,\u201d <em>United States v. Lowder, </em>148 F.3d 548, 554 (5th Cir.1998), the district court\u2019s application of the four-level enhancement for Arredondo\u2019s being an organizer or leader of the criminal activity was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
