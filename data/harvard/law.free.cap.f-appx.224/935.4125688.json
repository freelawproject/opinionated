Roberson argues that he is 56 years old and suffers from mental illness, which he claims impacted on his past and current criminal offenses; and he asserts that he should have received a sentence below his Guidelines range. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">We review Roberson\u2019s sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005). Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential\u201d; and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">We conclude that Roberson\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court sentenced him to the lowest point of his Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>(noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d). And in sentencing Roberson, the district court noted the section 3553(a) factors and commented in particular on the nature and circumstances of Roberson\u2019s offense, his history and characteristics, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense and to afford adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public and to provide Roberson with treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court was not required to discuss all of the section 3553(a) factors at the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d). In addition, although the district court heard Roberson\u2019s arguments for a sentence below his Guidelines range, the district court concluded that the Guidelines range did not overrepresent Roberson\u2019s criminal history and that a sentence within the Guidelines range was appropriate. Nothing in the record convinces us that Roberson\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in the light of the section 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-8\">. Roberson\u2019s Guidelines range was calculated pursuant to the career offender provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(c). Roberson\u2019s previous convictions included strong arm robbery, attempted strong arm robbery, and robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-13\">. The district court recommended that Roberson be sent to a Bureau of Prisons mental health facility for service of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
