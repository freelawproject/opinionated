(J.A. 11-29). He was sentenced to the statutory minimum sentences of 120 months for Count 5 and sixty months consecutively for Count 6. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000); 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (West Supp.2006). On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but raising the following issues: whether (1) Servin-Terrasas knowingly and intelligently pled guilty; (2) Servin-Terrasas\u2019 sentence violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment; and (3) the district court should have conducted a sua sponte safety-valve inquiry at Servin-Terrasas\u2019 sentencing hearing. Servin-Terrasas has been notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-22\">Servin-Terrasas\u2019 first claim fails as we find no plain error in how the district court conducted the guilty plea hearing. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525-26 (4th Cir.2002) (stating review standard). Second, we find no Eighth Amendment error in Servin-Terrasas\u2019 sentence as he was sentenced to the statutory m\u00ednimums within his advisory sentencing range, and his sentence is therefore reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). Finally, the district court did not plainly err in failing to sua sponte consider Servin-Terrasas for a \u201csafety-valve\u201d sentence under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5C1.2 (2005), when Servin-Terrasas\u2019 related \u00a7 924(c) conviction disqualifies him for the reduction. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-25\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Servin-Terrasas\u2019 convictions and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
