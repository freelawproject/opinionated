For the first time on appeal, Valle argues that the district court erred in assigning a 16-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b) (1) (A) (ii) for a prior California conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. Although Valle arguably waived the issue, out of an abundance of caution we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 194,166 L.Ed.2d 158 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">In <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 412-14, (5th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 315, 166 L.Ed.2d 237 (2006), we examined the identical California statute at issue in Valle\u2019s case and held that the California statute was sufficiently similar to the generic contemporary definition of aggravated assault to qualify as an enumerated offense of a crime of violence. The district court thus did not plainly err in assigning a 16-level increase for Valle\u2019s prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Valle challenges 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Valle\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Valle contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Valle properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
