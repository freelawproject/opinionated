Builtron Malacara argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Builtron Malacara contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>(2005). Builtron Malacara properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">For the first time on appeal, Builtron Malacara argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior Texas aggravated robbery conviction. Our review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Chavez, </em>432 F.3d 334, 336 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by 16 levels if he was previously deported after a conviction of a crime of violence. Robbery is an enumerated crime of violence in the application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Builtron Malacara has not shown plain error in the increase of his offense level based on his prior aggravated robbery conviction. <em>See United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
