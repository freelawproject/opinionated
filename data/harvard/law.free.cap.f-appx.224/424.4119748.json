In 2005, Williams brought the present suit against the V.A. alleging the V.A. violated his constitutional rights by foreclosing and taking possession of his residence after he defaulted on a home-loan. Because the district court found these arguments were raised or reasonably could have been raised in a prior proceeding, it dismissed on <em>res judicata </em>grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">In 2000, the V.A. brought an action in federal court against Williams to take possession of his residence based on his default of a V.A. loan. The loan was secured by his residence located at 5222 Nantucket Drive, Hinds County, Mississippi. Williams counter-claimed, alleging fraud. The district court dismissed Williams\u2019 fraud claim and awarded the V.A. possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">In 2005 Williams filed this suit alleging damages related to the foreclosure and seeking ownership of the property. Based on our de novo review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\"><em>Res judicata </em>is appropriate when: (1) the parties are identical in the two actions; (2) the prior judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the prior judgment is a final judgment on the merits; and (4) the same claim or cause of action is involved in both cases. <em>Test Masters Educ. Servs., Inc. v. Singh, </em>428 F.3d 559 (5th Cir.2005). The doctrine bars the subsequent litigation of claims that have been litigated or should have been raised in an earlier suit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">Clearly, the first three requirements are met here. Further, although Williams cites the correct standard in his briefing before this court, he does not convince us that the present suit involves claims different than the prior suit. In fact, the issues raised by Williams involve the same \u201cnucleus of operative facts,\u201d as the prior suit. <em>Eubanks v. F.D.I.C., </em>977 F.2d 166,171 (5th Cir.1992). These issues either were raised, or should have been raised in the prior suit concerning the foreclosure. Thus, Williams\u2019 suit was properly dismissed under the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
