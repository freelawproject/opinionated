We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-20\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider with extreme deference and only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). Such motions are disfavored \u201cin a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). \u201c[A]dministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">With respect to Sibanda\u2019s motion for reconsideration, she failed to show any error of law or fact. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(2) (2006). With respect to her request to reopen, Sibanda failed to show that the evidence could not have been presented at the asylum hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3) (2006). Accordingly, we find the immigration judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">Insofar as Sibanda seeks review of the immigration judge\u2019s order denying her applications for asylum, withholding from removal, and withholding under the Convention Against Torture, we are without jurisdiction to review that decision. Sibanda did not appeal the immigration judge\u2019s order to the Board, and thus she did not exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>See Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-23\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
