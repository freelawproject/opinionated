On appeal he asserts that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court erroneously admitted a police record into evidence. Although it was error to admit the record, the error was harmless. We therefore affirm Crocktoris conviction. Crockton also asserts that the district court committed Sixth Amendment error because the facts underlying a sentencing enhancement he received were neither admitted by him nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We conclude that any Sixth Amendment error, if it occurred, was harmless because the district court announced an identical, alternative sentence. We therefore affirm Crockton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On the morning of July, 18, 2003, Officer William Holland of the Fayetteville, North Carolina, Police Department was conducting surveillance of a house on Progress Street in response to complaints about prostitution and drug dealing in the neighborhood. Officer Holland saw Carl McLaughlin and Terrence McNeill engaged in what he believed to be a drug sale. Shortly thereafter, Crockton arrived at the house by car. When he exited the car, he went up to McLaughlin and McNeill and appeared to hand them something. Crockton then left on foot. Shortly thereafter, Officer Holland watched as Crockton returned carrying \u201csome type of long firearm wrapped in a white plastic bag.\u201d J.A. 289. This time, Crockton walked around to the backyard where McNeill and McLaughlin were standing and handed the gun to McNeill. McNeill unloaded and reloaded the weapon before hiding it under some bushes. Crockton then drove off. At this point, Officer Holland called for backup, approached the house, and placed McNeill and McLaughlin in handcuffs while he retrieved the firearm, a 12-gauge shotgun. Minutes later, Crockton returned to the house on foot. Officer Holland told him to be seated with McNeill and McLaughlin but did not place him in handcuffs. Although no one was arrested at the time, Holland filled out field interview cards on all three men.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">On March, 17, 2004, Crockton was charged with one count of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924. During Officer Holland\u2019s testimony at trial, the government moved to admit the field interview card that Holland had completed with respect to Crockton. Defense counsel objected to the card\u2019s admissibility under Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(B), and the court held a bench conference. Defense counsel asserted that the card was an inadmissible police report. Looking only at the front side of the card, the district court disagreed, stating that the card was \u201cjust a straight identity record with the name [and] address\u201d of the defendant. J.A. 313. The district court did not comment on the section on the front of the card titled \u201cSus Act\u201d under which boxes next to the words \u201cNarcotics\u201d and \u2018Weapons\u201d had been checked. J.A. 691. The district court was unaware that the back of the card also contained notations by Officer Holland. Under the header \u201cDemeanor,\u201d Officer Holland had checked \u201cNervous.\u201d Similarly, under \u201cDrug Type\u201d Holland had checked \u201cCocaine\u201d and under \u201cWeapon/Tool\u201d he had marked \u201cRifle/Pistol.\u201d In a section of the card titled \u201cRemarks,\u201d Officer Holland wrote, \u201cDealing narcotics &amp; possessing firearm by a felon.\u201d J.A. 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Following the bench conference, the prosecutor resumed the examination of Officer Holland, asking \u201c[T]hat information on there is what you got from him on the front side of the card?\u201d J.A. 314. Officer Holland replied affirmatively, and the prosecutor then asked, \u201cWhat was the purpose in obtaining that information?\u201d Holland answered, \u201cBasically our records keeping, knowing who\u2019s on \u2014 who was on the scene. That\u2019s for biographical information purposes.\u201d J.A. 314. The court then admitted the card into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">In addition to Officer Holland, both McNeill and McLaughlin testified against Crockton. McNeill stated that Crockton had asked him to hold (or store) the shotgun, and McLaughlin corroborated Officer Holland\u2019s account of the manner in which Crockton carried the shotgun and how it had been wrapped in plastic. McNeill and McLaughlin further testified that Crock-ton had pressured them not to implicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>him in the gun possession. This testimony was corroborated by another witness who stated that Crockton told him about his attempts to influence McNeill\u2019s testimony through threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In an effort to impeach McNeill and McLaughlin, the defense called Officer Gregory Guilder, a dispatcher for the Fayetteville Police Department. Officer Guilder testified that computer aided dispatch reports (CAD reports) made of Holland\u2019s radio transmissions on July 18 concerned only McNeill and McLaughlin. During closing argument, defense counsel asserted that the fact that Crockton\u2019s name had not been put out over the radio was significant and implied that Holland may have fabricated Crockton\u2019s involvement with the gun. The prosecutor addressed this argument on rebuttal, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">Now, some remarks made about the CAD reports and that only Mr. McNeill and Mr. McLaughlin was there on the CAD report .... we know from ... these field interview cards, we know exactly what Officer Holland was investigating because it says it on the back .... we look at Mr. Crockton\u2019s [field interview card], filled out at the time this event took place. Says: dealing narcotics and possessing a firearm by a felon. Obviously Officer Holland\u2019s contemporaneous notes on 6, 7, and 8 [the respective exhibit numbers for Crock-ton, McNeill, and McLaughlin\u2019s field interview cards] support his version of the facts. He couldn\u2019t go back and make those later. Those were made at the time. That was his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">J.A. 639. The defense did not object to the mention of information contained on the back of the card. However, after the jury left the courtroom, the district court expressed its frustration with the government\u2019s line of argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">Apologize for the ignorance.... I had no idea there was a charge written on the back----It says what he was doing. You may have a basis for appeal, I will let it go to the jury but I will tell you it\u2019s all I can do to contain myself to find this out at the end of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">J.A. 646. The district court then issued a curative instruction to the jury, stating that the cards, which had not been published to the jury, were not to be considered substantive evidence with regard to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence and would not be sent to the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The jury returned a guilty verdict. At Crockton\u2019s sentencing hearing on October 20, 2004, the defense raised an objection under <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the two-point enhancement for committing the current offense within two years of release from custody. The objection was overruled. The district court sentenced Crockton to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. The district court announced an identical, alternate sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Crockton appeals his conviction and sentence. He argues that the district court\u2019s erroneous admission of his field interview card and the prosecution\u2019s comments to the jury about the contents of that card entitle him to a new trial. Crockton also argues that his enhanced sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. We address both issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">We begin with the question of whether the district court erred in admitting Crockton\u2019s field interview card into evidence. While Fed.R.Evid. 803(8) allows certain public records and reports to be admitted into evidence as hearsay exceptions, subpart (B) of the rule explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>excludes \u201cin criminal cases\u201d written reports of \u201cmatters observed by police officers.\u201d Police investigative reports are inadmissible because they are generally crafted with an eye toward prosecution, and their \u201cuse against the accused in a criminal case\u201d would bring about \u201cthe almost certain collision with confrontation rights.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 803(8) advisory committee\u2019s note. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>111 F.3d 365, 371 (4th Cir.1997), keeping in mind that any \u201cerror ... that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded,\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The district court admitted Crockton\u2019s field interview card because it believed that the card contained only \u201cstraight identity\u201d information. J.A. 313. But the front of the card also contained Officer Holland\u2019s notations about Crockton\u2019s alleged activities in the section titled \u201cSus Act.\u201d Holland\u2019s check marks next to \u201cNarcotics\u201d and \u2018Weapons\u201d are written recordings of observations made during a criminal investigation. Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion in failing to exclude the card under Rule 803(8)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Of course, when the district court realized that the back of the card contained the statement \u201cDealing narcotics <em>&amp; </em>possessing firearm by a felon,\u201d the court recognized its mistake and immediately issued a curative instruction to the jury. Given the curative instruction, the fact that the card was never published to the jury, and the strong case presented against Crock-ton, the government argues that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Crockton contends that admission of the field interview card was not harmless. He argues that the prosecutor in closing argument attempted \u201cto capitalize on the inadmissible information\u201d contained in the card by turning it into \u201can accusation against Mr. Crockton for a crime for which he did not stand trial: \u2018dealing narcotics.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 23. Crockton contends that such an accusation constitutes prosecutorial misconduct. Crockton did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument at trial. Moreover, on appeal Crockton does not raise his prosecutorial misconduct argument as a stand alone claim. Instead, he argues that admission of the card was not harmless because it led to and facilitated prosecutorial misconduct during the government\u2019s closing argument. Thus, if the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not rise to the level of reversible prosecutorial misconduct, the district court\u2019s error in admitting the card would have to be viewed as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Our court applies \u201ca two-pronged test for determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in closing argument \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>135 F.3d 291, 297 (4th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986)). A defendant must show \u201c[1] that the [prosecutor\u2019s] remarks were improper and [2] that they prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights so as to deprive him of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Adam, </em>70 F.3d 776, 780 (4th Cir.1995)). While the prosecutor\u2019s remark may have been improper, Crockton\u2019s substantial rights were not \u201cprejudiced to the point of denying him a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299. We have identified a number of factors, no single one determinative, that are relevant to the prejudice inquiry, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">(1) the degree to which the prosecutor\u2019s remarks have a tendency to mislead the jury and to prejudice the accused; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) absent the remarks, the strength of competent proof introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>to establish the guilt of the accused; and (4) whether the comments were deliberately placed before the jury to divert attention to extraneous matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Adam, </em>70 F.3d at 780). \u201cWe also consider (5) whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were invited by improper conduct of defense counsel, and (6) whether curative instructions were given to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299 (citing <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 12-13, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) and <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>716 F.2d 1050, 1053 (4th Cir.1983)). Taken together, these considerations convince us that Crockton was not denied a fair trial. Any tendency toward prejudice caused by the prosecutor\u2019s mention of Officer Holland\u2019s accusation of drug dealing is outweighed by the single mention of that allegation, the strength of the government\u2019s case, and the curative instruction given to the jury. Because we conclude that the government\u2019s closing argument did not prejudice Crockton\u2019s substantial rights, we must also conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to admit the field interview card was ultimately harmless. We therefore affirm Crockton\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We turn last to Crockton\u2019s challenge to his sentence. Our decision in <em>United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448 (4th Cir.2006), controls and requires us to affirm the sentence. We need not reach the question of whether Crockton\u2019s sentence was enhanced in violation of the Sixth Amendment because even if that was the case, \u201cthe district court indicated that if the Guidelines were non-mandatory, it would have imposed the same 120-month sentence pursuant to the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452. As such, any Sixth Amendment error is harmless because it did not \u201cactually affect[] the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 548 (4th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">For the reasons stated, Crockton\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
