Rouse appeals his conviction and 188-month sentence for armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d) (2000). Rouse\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred by failing to notify Rouse at the plea hearing that he was subject to enhanced punishment as a career offender and whether his sentence was reasonable. Rouse was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, and has done so. The Government elected not to file a reply brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">Rouse argues that the district court erred by failing to inform him at the plea hearing that he was subject to enhanced punishment as a career offender and if the court had done so, he may have elected to proceed to trial. This argument lacks merit because the court at the Rule 11 hearing notified Rouse that he could be sentenced up to the statutory maximum of twenty-five years. Rouse agreed that he understood. Moreover, the Government and the court notified Rouse that he would likely be sentenced within the 188 to 235-month sentencing range. Rouse pled guilty with this knowledge. Rouse does not attack the validity of his guilty plea. Accordingly, Rouse is bound by the agreement that he could face up to the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Rouse\u2019s sentence was reasonable. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. However, in imposing a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a post-Soo/c<em>er </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006). Further, \u201c[t]he district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u2018in checklist fashion;\u2019 \u2018it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432 <em>(quoting United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Here, the district court sentenced Rouse <em>post-Booker </em>and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. The court sentenced Rouse after considering and examining the sentencing guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as instructed by <em>Booker. </em>Rouse\u2019s 188-month sentence is at the bottom of the appropriate guidelines range and is below the twenty-five year statutory maximum sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d). Finally, neither Rouse nor the record suggests any information so compelling as to rebut the presumption that a sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">We have reviewed Rouse\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and find the issues he raises are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Rouse\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Rouse, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Rouse requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Rouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
