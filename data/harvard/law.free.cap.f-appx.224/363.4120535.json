R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. He argues that the district court erred in construing his as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion because he only challenged a defect in the integrity of his 1996 post-conviction proceedings. The district court also determined that Bounds\u2019s motion was untimely, and he contests that finding as well. Bounds also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of motions to unseal and produce documents pertaining to a Rule 35 motion filed by the government in the case of Bounds\u2019s co-defendant, and he has filed a motion to include in the appellate record documents pertaining to that Rule 35 motion. Bounds further complains that the district court failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-23\">Bounds\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion asserted the same claims raised in a previous \u00a7 2255 motion. As such, the district court properly construed his Rule 60(b) motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 553 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 532-33, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>480 (2005). The district court was without jurisdiction to consider a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255; <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Therefore, it is unnecessary to address the district court\u2019s finding that Bounds\u2019s motion was untimely filed or the court\u2019s denial of his motions to produce documents and conduct an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">As Bounds has not demonstrated a non-frivolous issue for appeal, he may not proceed IFP. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). His appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see also Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 201-02 (5th Cir.1997). His motion for the designation of the record on appeal is denied as well. Bounds is warned that future frivolous filings in this court or in the district court, or the future prosecution of frivolous actions or appeals, will invite the imposition of sanctions, including monetary penalties and restrictions of his ability to file actions and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
