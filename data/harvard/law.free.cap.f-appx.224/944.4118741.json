When the district court calculated the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, it imposed an enhancement based on a prior felony conviction reported in the Presentence Investigation Report. <em>See </em>United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (Nov.2005). Lozano-Loza argues that the enhancement is unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the prior conviction was not alleged in the indictment or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Because Lozano-Loza did not raise his objection before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322,1323 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 196, 163 L.Ed.2d 207 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Lozano-Loza\u2019s argument is foreclosed by controlling authority. The Supreme Court held in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219,140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that \u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). As Lozano-Loza concedes, we have held that \u201c[t]his conclusion was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d Id. \u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent.\u201d <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 963 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Even if <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>were not controlling precedent, we would conclude that there was no error because Lozano-Loza admitted to the existence of his prior felony conviction. The conviction was reported as fact in the PSI, and Lozano-Loza raised no objection. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330 (facts alleged in the PSI and not challenged by defendant are deemed admitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">Lozano-Loza\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"AxzI\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
