He argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Given the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), Chavez-Ramirez\u2019s argument, as conceded by the Government, has merit. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 260-61 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Chavez-Ramirez\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Because the Government has conceded that he is entitled to resentencing based on the district court\u2019s erroneous \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) enhancement, Chavez-Ramirez requests that he be allowed to withdraw the remaining issues raised on appeal. His motion to withdraw and remand should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
