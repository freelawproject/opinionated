Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). Dorrough was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1963 for a guilty-plea conviction of robbing a postal employee, and he has had his parole revoked and has been returned to prison multiple times. He filed this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition challenging both his latest parole revocation and the underlying conviction. The district court dismissed Dorrough\u2019s petition as barred by a preclusion order in <em>Dorrough v. Ferguson, </em>No. 6:01-CV-205 (E.D.Tex. May 30, 2001), which was entered based on Dorrough\u2019s having filed approximately 10 postconviction actions regarding both the conviction and parole matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-20\">Dorrough does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision and for the dismissal of his current \u00a7 2241 petition, i.e., that Dorrough\u2019s petition is barred by the preclusion order in <em>Dorrough v. Ferguson. </em>Instead, he continues to challenge on the merits his 1963 conviction and the latest parole revocation. This is the same as if Dorrough had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-21\">It is ordered that Dorrough\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Dorrough was previously warned by this court that the filing of \u201cany further frivolous pleadings relating to his 1963 conviction\u201d could subject him to sanctions. <em>See Dorrough v. Gaines, </em>48 Fed.Appx. 107, 107 (5th Cir.2002). Because we have warned Dorrough previously and his current appeal is another frivolous attack on his 1963 conviction, <em>see Coghlan v. Starkey, </em>852 F.2d 806, 808 (5th Cir.1988) (courts of appeals have the ability to impose sanctions sua sponte), Dorrough is hereby ORDERED to pay $250.00 to the clerk of this court. Until the sanction is paid in full, the clerk of this court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>clerks of all courts subject to the jurisdiction of this court are directed to return to Dorrough unf\u00edled any submissions concerning the validity of his conviction, sentence, and parole revocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Dorrough\u2019s \u201cMotion for Entry of Appropriate Orders,\u201d his request for leave to file a pleading for \u201cInterim Injunctive Relief,\u201d his \u201cPlea for Appointment of Counsel, Extension of Time to File His [Merits] Brief &amp; Emergency Injunctive Relief,\u201d and \u201cPetition for Review of Appeal En Banc\u201d are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
