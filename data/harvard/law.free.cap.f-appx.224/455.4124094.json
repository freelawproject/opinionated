California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Jiwani has responded. We do not address Jiwani\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel because the record has not been developed adequately. See <em>United States v. Sanchez-Pena, </em>336 F.3d 431, 445-46 (5th Cir.2003). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Jiwani\u2019s responses discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Jiwani\u2019s motion for appointment of substitute counsel or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a pro se brief on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
