Calhoun is serving concurrent 60-month prison sentences for 2003 convictions of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit equity skimming. He contends that the district court erred in concluding that Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officials did not abuse their discretion in denying him admission to the BOP\u2019s Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP), the completion of which would have allegedly entitled Calhoun to a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Section 3621(e) provides that federal prisoners convicted of nonviolent offenses who complete an RDAP may apply for sentence reductions of up to one year at the discretion of the BOP director. <em>See Warren v. Miles, </em>230 F.3d 688, 691 (5th Cir.2000). Calhoun was not permitted to participate in the RDAP because officials determined, under BOP Policy Statement (PS) 5330.10, that he had no \u201cverifiable documented drug abuse problem.\u201d Calhoun does not dispute that his Presentence Report and intake screening interview and other information in his central file \u2014 information which PS 5331.10 directs BOP officials to consider in determining whether an inmate should be admitted to the RDAP \u2014 offered no evidence that he had a substance-abuse problem. Officials also concluded that letters and other evidence offered by Calhoun were not \u201csufficient supporting documentation of a substance abuse diagnosis,\u201d a conclusion that is supported by the record. Calhoun has not established that the denial of his request for admission to the RDAP was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of the BOP\u2019s broad discretion. <em>See Jupiter Energy Corp. v. F.E.R.C., </em>407 F.3d 346, 349 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983). Calhoun\u2019s assertion of personal discrimination is not sufficient to state an equal protection claim because he has not shown that there was no rational basis for treating him differently from others similarly situated. <em>See Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">Calhoun\u2019s failure to brief a second claim raised in his \u00a7 2241 petition \u2014 that the BOP was incorrectly computing his good time credit \u2014 amounts to an abandonment of that claim. <em>See Summers v. Dretke, </em>431 F.3d 861, 882 n. 12 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 353, 166 L.Ed.2d 69 (2006); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
