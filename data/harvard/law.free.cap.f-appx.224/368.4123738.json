The district court imposed a sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) on the basis that Rogers transported the four individuals in the rear cargo area of a minivan, covered in newspaper and a layer of wrought iron and ceramic goods. Rogers asserts that the enhancement was unwarranted because the aliens were not exposed to the elements, had adequate <em>oxygen, were able </em>to communicate with her, and easily could have extricated themselves in an emergency. The Government asserts that, during an accident or other sharp maneuver, the aliens could have been injured or killed by flying wrought iron, trapped by the debris, or overlooked by emergency personnel. The Government also notes that the men were sweating profusely when the covering newspaper was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). With respect to the district court\u2019s factual findings, we find no error. The court relied upon the Presentence Report (PSR) in determining that the enhancement was warranted. The facts contained in the PSR are supported by the evidence in the record. Border patrol agents testified during Rogers\u2019s trial that the men were lying side by side, surrounded by newspaper, and covered by \u201ca bunch of\u2019 wrought iron and ceramic items that limited their movement. The agents testified that the men were \u201csweating a lot\u201d when the newspaper was removed. In addition, the aliens testified by deposition that boxes were placed on top of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">The enhancement under \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) is warranted where \u201cthe offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d In <em>United States v. Zuniga-Amezquita, </em>468 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir.2006), we held that transporting aliens in the cargo area of a van with boxes and luggage piled high around them warranted the enhancement because the aliens\u2019 ability to exit the vehicle was impeded and the items could have struck them in an accident. <em>Id. </em>We listed several non-exclusive factors to consider in determining whether the enhancement is proper: (1) whether oxygen was available to the individuals being transported; (2) their exposure to extreme temperatures; (3) their ability to communicate with the driver; (4) their ability to exit the vehicle quickly; and (5) the danger to them if an accident were to occur. <em>Id. </em>at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">The \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) enhancement was proper in this case. The aliens were covered in stifling newspaper, and their movements were restricted by the heavy iron and ceramics, which could have become dangerous projectiles during an accident. Moreover, the record shows that the rear door to the minivan was inoperable, making a quick exit more difficult. <em>See Zuniga-Amezquita, </em>468 F.3d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
