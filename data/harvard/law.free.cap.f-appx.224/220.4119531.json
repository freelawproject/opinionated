Roddy raises three issues on appeal: (1) that his legal mail was improperly opened; (2) that the West Virginia Department of Corrections Policy Directive 503.00 is unconstitutional; and (3) that his free exercise of religion claim was improperly dismissed. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error for the first two issues. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Roddy v. West Virginia, </em>No. 5:05-cv-00170-FPS, 2006 WL 2708596 (N.D.W.Va. Sept. 21, 2006). For Roddy\u2019s third issue,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> however, we vacate and remand in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-14\"> The district court described this claim as the \u201cfree exercise of religion claim\u201d (R. 54 at 10) and dismissed the claim sua sponte for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
