We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-23\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed.

The notice of appeal was filed on August 29, 2006. Because Banks failed to file a timely notice of appeal or obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We deny Banks\u2019 motion for appointment of appellate counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
