He was sentenced to 14 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Denson argues that the district court erred by relying on hearsay evidence to determine that his supervised release should be revoked because he had committed grand larceny rather than petty larceny. He asserts that his Due Process rights were violated under <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2598, 38 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Due process affords a defendant in a parole-revocation hearing \u201cthe right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation).\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). This due process protection applies in revocation of - supervised release proceedings. <em>United States v. McCormick, </em>54 F.3d 214, 221 (5th Cir.1995). Although <em>Morrissey </em>recognized a right to confrontation at revocation proceedings, the right is a limited one in that revocation hearings should be flexible enough that a court may consider \u201cmaterial that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593. Hearsay evidence is such material, hence the district court\u2019s reliance on the police report and its related credibility determination regarding Denson\u2019s mother were not abuses of discretion, <em>see United States v. Arbizu, </em>431 F.3d 469, 470 (5th Cir.2005), and the court wasn\u2019t required to allow Denson to cross-examine the author of the police report, <em>see id.; cf. United States v. Kelley, </em>446 F.3d 688, 691-92 (7th Cir.2006) (holding that <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), which applies only to testimonial hearsay, doesn\u2019t apply to revocation proceedings); <em>Ash v. Reilly, </em>431 F.3d 826, 829-30 (D.C.Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Rondeau, </em>430 F.3d 44, 47-48 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>419 F.3d 980, 985-86 (9th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Kirby, </em>418 F.3d 621, 627-28 (6th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v.
