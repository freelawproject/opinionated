Roberts\u2019s counsel has filed in this court a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he raises one issue at Roberts\u2019s request, but states that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Specifically, Roberts\u2019s counsel argues that Roberts\u2019s two convictions constituted one course of conduct pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3D1.2(d) and therefore the district court should have considered them as one group when sentencing him rather than enhancing his sentence with a multiple count adjustment pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3D1.4. Roberts was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We conclude that the district court properly denied Roberts\u2019s request to group his offenses for sentencing under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2 (d) because very few of the firearms were stolen and none of the firearms were found in the stolen vehicle. Moreover, the offenses had different victims and the offenses were not otherwise related.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-20\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Roberts\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Roberts, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Roberts requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
