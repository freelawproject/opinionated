Relying on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Gonzalez seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce the sentence he received for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, money laundering, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. The district court also denied Gonzalez\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP and certified that an appeal would not be taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-26\">Gonzalez\u2019s IFP motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). He has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>\u00a7 3582; <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Gonzalez is WARNED that the filing or prosecution of frivolous appeals in the future will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
