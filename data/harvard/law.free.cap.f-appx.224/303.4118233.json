Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court filed and docketed Miles\u2019 motion on November 27, 2006, and acted on his motion in an order entered on March 27, 2007. Accordingly, because the district court has recently acted in Miles\u2019 case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant Miles\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauperis, but deny his motion for appointment of counsel and motion for injunction and/or stay of the proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
