Robinson appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s (BOP) method of calculating his good time credit under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b). Robinson contends that the BOP has incorrectly interpreted \u00a7 3624(b) and that he is entitled to earn 54 days of good time credit each year based on his term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In <em>Sample v. Morrison, </em>406 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2005), this court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal of a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, wherein the petitioner, like Robinson, argued that the BOP was miscalculating his good time credit under \u00a7 3624(b). The court concluded that the petitioner, who was not yet eligible for release from prison, did not establish that he would sustain immediate injury that could be redressed by the relief requested such that the petition was not ripe for review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Robinson requests the same form of relief as the petitioner in <em>Sample. </em>However, whether Robinson\u2019s sentence is computed on the basis of the BOP\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3624(b) or his own, he is not entitled to release. Thus, like the petitioner in <em>Sample, </em>Robinson\u2019s petition is not ripe for review, and the instant appeal is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Sample, </em>406 F.3d at 312. Moreover, even if Robinson\u2019s request for relief were not premature, his argument would be foreclosed under present law by <em>Moreland v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>431 F.3d 180, 186 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1906, 164 L.Ed.2d 583 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
