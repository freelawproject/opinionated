He argues, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court employed impermissible double-counting and thus improperly calculated his guideline range when it increased his offense level and criminal history points based on the same prior illegal reentry conviction. Citing <em>United States v. Henry, </em>288 F.3d 657 (5th Cir.2002), Vega further contends that his criminal history should not have been increased based on his prior illegal reentry conviction, because it was an element of the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-19\">The district court did not plainly err in sentencing Vega, because the guidelines do not prohibit such double-counting, because <em>Henry </em>is distinguishable from the instant case, and because this court has approved of such double-counting under similar circumstances concerning U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6); <em>Henry, </em>288 F.3d at 659, 664-65; <em>United States v. Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d 545, 560 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>69 F.3d 11,14-15 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-17\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
