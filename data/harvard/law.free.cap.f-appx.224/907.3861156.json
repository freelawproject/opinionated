Isaac argues that she was not subject to judicial estoppel and that IMRG acted in bad faith. Moreover, she contends that she is entitled to summary judgment. Isaac also claims, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court should not award attorneys\u2019 fees to IMRG. IMRG has filed a motion requesting that we award it attorneys\u2019 fees on the ground that Isaac\u2019s appeal is frivolous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-16\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>considering all evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2002). . The moving party is entitled to summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-17\">We have jurisdiction over appeals \u201cfrom all final decisions of the district courts of the United States....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. However, we do not have jurisdiction to review judgments or issues that are \u201cexpressly referred to and which are not im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>pliedly intended for appeal.\u201d <em>Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre, </em>701 F.2d 1365, 1375 (11th Cir.1983). In addition, the law is well settled that \u201ca legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004). Moreover, \u201c[a]ny issue that an appellant wants the Court to address should be specifically and clearly identified in the brief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we do construe <em>pro se </em>filings liberally. <em>Faulk v. City of Orlando, </em>731 F.2d 787, 789 (11th Cir.1984). We have also held that \u201can issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 1331 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">The commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an estate which is comprised of, among other things, \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1). Therefore, a cause of action belonging to the debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding vests in the bankruptcy estate upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition. <em>Parker v. Wendy\u2019s Int'l Inc., </em>365 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThus, a trustee, as the representative of the bankruptcy estate, is the proper party in interest, and is the only party with standing to prosecute causes of action belonging to the estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1272. \u201cAt the close of the bankruptcy case, property of the estate that is not abandoned ... and that is not administered in the bankruptcy proceedings remains the property of the estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Furthermore, the \u201c[f]ailure to list an interest on a bankruptcy schedule leaves that interest in the bankruptcy estate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">As an initial matter, we conclude from the record that we do not have jurisdiction to address Isaac\u2019s claim that the district court should not award attorneys\u2019 fees to IMRG because she has not appealed a final decision or order of the district court granting such attorneys\u2019 fees. In addition, Isaac has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment because, even construing her brief liberally, she does not argue that she has standing, the lack of which was the basis for the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Access Now, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 1330. Even if she had raised this claim, it would fail because the cause of action she pursues in this case vested with the bankruptcy estate when she filed her bankruptcy petition. <em>See Wendy\u2019s, </em>365 F.3d at 1272. Therefore, Isaac does not have standing to bring these claims because the only party with standing to bring these claims is the trustee of the bankruptcy estate. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we reject the remainder of Isaac\u2019s arguments and affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of IMRG.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1135-13\">. We construe Isaac's <em>pro se </em>brief to include a motion requesting that we seal the record of this appeal. However, we deny this motion because IMRG has filed record excerpts under seal in accordance with Eleventh Circuit Rule 25-5(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1135-18\">. We deny IMRG\u2019s motion requesting attorneys' fees because we have concluded that sanctions would be inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
