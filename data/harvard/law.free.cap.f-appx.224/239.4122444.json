To obtain reversal of an adverse eligibility determination, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that it does not compel a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant Khan the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Similarly, as Khan does not qualify for asylum, he is ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Finally, we also find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Khan failed to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006). We find that Khan failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\"> Khan's wife, Anjum, and his daughters are derivative petitioners. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A) (West 2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(a) (2006). All are natives and citizens of Pakistan.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
