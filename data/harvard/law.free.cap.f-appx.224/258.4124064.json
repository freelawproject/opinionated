We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Blagrove, </em>No. 2:95-cr-00052-RGD (E.D.Va. filed Dec. 26, 2006; entered Dec. 27, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Additionally, we construe Blagrove\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence, not previously discoverable by due diligence, that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2), 2255 (2000). Blagrove\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these criteria. Therefore, we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
