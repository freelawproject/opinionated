Agugua argues that the BIA erred by denying his request for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. Agugua also moves this court for a stay of removal. For the reasons that follow, the motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-22\">The BIA\u2019s determination that cancellation of removal was not warranted under the facts of the case was a discretionary denial of relief that this court does not have jurisdiction to review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Wilmore v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 524, 526-28 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). We note that Agugua\u2019s contention that he was erroneously found to be ineligible for cancellation of removal based on his conviction of an aggravated felony offense is unsupported by the record. We dismiss the petition to the extent that it seeks review from the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision to deny cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-23\">Agugua argues that the denial of cancellation of removal violated his due process rights. We have jurisdiction to consider this legal question. <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 40, 166 L.Ed.2d 18 (2006). The argument is unavailing, however, as Agugua\u2019s \u201c[eligibility for discretionary relief from a removal order is not a liberty or property interest warranting due process protection.\u201d <em>See Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 219 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To the extent that Agugua\u2019s claim challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal on due process grounds, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART; MOTION FOR STAY OF REMOVAL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
