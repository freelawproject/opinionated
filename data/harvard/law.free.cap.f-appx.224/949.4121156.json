The presentence investigative report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated Peters\u2019 total offense level as 31, with a criminal history of I, and resulting guideline range of 108 to 135 months of imprisonment. At sentencing Peters requested to be sentenced to the statutory minimum of 60 months of imprisonment. After stating that it had considered the statements of all parties, the PSI with guideline range, and statutory factors, the district court sentenced Peters at the low end of the guideline range. On appeal, Peters argues that the district court erred by not adequately stating reasons for imposing his 108-month sentence at the very low end of the applicable guideline range. Peters also argues that his sentence is unreasonable in light of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">First, Peters argues that the district court violated 18 U.S.C. 3553(c)(1) by failing to articulate the reasons for his sentence. Whether a district court satisfied \u00a7 3553(c)(1) is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). When stating its reasons for imposing a particular sentence as required by \u00a7 3553(c)(1), the court should \u201ctailor its comments to show that the sentence imposed is appropriate, given the factors to be considered as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d However, \u00a7 3553(c)(1) does not require a sentencing court to use specific language or state that a particular factor is inapplicable. <em>Id. </em>at 1182 (citation omitted). We can consider the record of the entire sentencing hearing in evaluating the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing a particular sentence, and need not rely exclusively on the court\u2019s summary statement at the close of the sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>(citing with approval <em>United States v. Wivell, </em>893 F.2d 156,158 (8th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Peters also challenges his sentence as unreasonable in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences under the advisory guideline regime for reasonableness. Reasonableness review is deferential, requiring us to \u201cevaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in [18 U.S.C.] section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005)(per curiam). Although a sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily would expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-88. In fashioning a sentence, first the district court must correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range; second, it must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>Id. </em>at 786. The court is not required to explicitly consider each of these factors on the record. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). It is enough for the court to acknowledge the parties\u2019 arguments and state that it has considered the factors. <em>See Id. </em>\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,]\u201d and we \u201cwill not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors ...\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 19, 2006) (No. 06-7352). Furthermore, Peters bears the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>burden of establishing that his sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Here, the record adequately reflects a consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to satisfy \u00a7 3553(c)(1), and Peters has not borne the burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable in light of these factors. The district court correctly calculated Peters guideline range. The court then heard Peters\u2019 statements regarding his family background, career plans, and circumstances surrounding the offense, including Peters\u2019 cooperation with the police and expressed remorse. The district court also indicated that the imposed sentence, within the applicable range, would help deter future criminal activity by Peters. Thus the record demonstrates a consideration of several \u00a7 3553(a) including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for deterrence, the applicable guideline range, and the kinds of sentences available. Furthermore, Peters\u2019 sentence was less than half of the statutory maximum sentence of 20 years. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1357-58 (11th Cir.2006) (affirming defendant\u2019s 121-month sentence as reasonable because, <em>inter alia, </em>the low-end sentence was just over one-half of the 20-year statutory-maximum sentence). Because the district court complied with \u00a7 3553(c)(1), and the sentence imposed was reasonable in light of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
