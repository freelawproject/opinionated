Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Soenaryo fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Soenaryo cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Further, she failed to demonstrate eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">In addition, our review discloses no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s denial of Soenaryo\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed\u00fcd 823 (1992); <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 640 (B.I.A. 1988). We grant the Attorney General\u2019s motion to strike the unexhausted arguments and exhibits one through ten of Soenaryo\u2019s supplemental brief. We deny the petitions for review and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
