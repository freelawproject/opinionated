Hatchett\u2019s offense conduct was part of a larger scheme to defraud banks and retailers in Texas that involved fraudulent check-writing and the assumption of false identities.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-20\">The presentence report set Hatchett\u2019s guideline range at 51 to 63 months of imprisonment, but the district court upwardly departed pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0 and \u00a7 2B1.1 of the Guidelines and sentenced Hatchett to 120 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-21\">When a defendant appeals a sentence imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines scheme required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court determines whether the sentence was reasonable. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). The sentencing court\u2019s factual findings are accepted unless clearly erroneous, and the application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-22\">Because the district court upwardly departed pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0 of the Guidelines, Hatchett\u2019s sentence is a \u201cguideline sentence,\u201d and the decision to depart is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 707; <em>see also United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 415-16 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 663 (2006). \u201cA sentencing court does not abuse its discretion in deciding to upwardly depart when its reasons for doing so (1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2); (2) are authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b); and (3) are justified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 310 (5th Cir.2005) (footnotes omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1097, 163 L.Ed.2d 911 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Hatchett\u2019s first argument is predicated on a misreading of <em>Booker. </em>Hatchett claims that the district court violated the rule that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. The district judge\u2019s fact-finding was proper because \u201cwith the mandatory use of the Guidelines excised, the Sixth Amendment will not impede a sentencing judge from finding all facts relevant to sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.) (citing <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233, 259, 125 S.Ct. 738), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Hatchett also argues that the upward departure was unreasonable because the district court\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing and in its written statement of reasons regarding participants in the fraud scheme dressing up like military personnel in order to facilitate their crimes are not supported by the record. While the record does not show that the scheme involved \u201cdressing up\u201d like military personnel, Hatchett never denied that such activity occurred, and he did not object to the court\u2019s statements below. In addition, the record shows that military identification devices were created and used as part of the fraud scheme. The court\u2019s finding of fact was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 706. Nor were its reasons for upwardly departing unreasonable, as they are \u201cjustified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See Saldana, </em>427 F.3d at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Finally, Hatchett argues that the district court\u2019s reasons for upwardly departing were \u201cpatently unreasonable\u201d because the district court held him responsible \u201cfor blowing up the Oklahoma City Federal Building before the superseding indictment\u2019s timeframe\u201d and \u201cfor blowing up the Sears Tower when it has not yet been blown up.\u201d The district court never held Hatchett responsible for these explosive scenarios but mentioned them to illustrate the danger presented by the methods of those involved in Hatchett\u2019s fraud scheme. In addition, the court pointed to the commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1, which specifically contemplates that an upward departure may be warranted where, as here, \u201c[t]he offense caused substantial harm to the victim\u2019s reputation or credit record, or the victim suffered a substantial inconvenience related to repairing the victim\u2019s reputation or a damaged credit record\u201d or where \u201c[a]n individual whose means of identification the defendant used to obtain unlawful means of identification is erroneously arrested.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 19(A)(vi)(I) and (II). One of Hatchett\u2019s victims suffered both these indignities. Accordingly, the court\u2019s decision to depart was not unreasonable. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 706-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
