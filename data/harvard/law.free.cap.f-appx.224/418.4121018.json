Rodriguez argues on appeal that his sentence constitutes plain error because it was based on an incorrect calculation of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and further argues that the district court plainly erred by not specifically addressing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">To establish reversible plain error, Rodriguez must identify a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if Rodriguez establishes these factors, we retain the discretion whether to correct the error and will generally do so only if the error \u201caffects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>386 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1029, 125 S.Ct. 675, 160 L.Ed.2d 510 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Although it is undisputed that Rodriguez\u2019s sentence is the result of a misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines, he has failed to show that the error affected his substantial rights. Rodriguez\u2019s revocation sentence was within the three-year statutory maximum sentence authorized upon revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(vn).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">The district court determined that Rodriguez testified falsely at the sentencing hearing and that his self-serving testimony constituted perjury and obstruction of justice. It is implicit from the court\u2019s comments at the sentencing hearing that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at an appropriate sentence. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>see United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). Rodriguez has therefore failed to demonstrate that his revocation sentence constitutes reversible plain error. Moreover, because the 24-month sentence is within the statutory maximum, it was not unreasonable. <em>United States v. Boykin, </em>No. 05-50704, \u2014 Fed.Appx.-,-, 2006 WL 616031 at <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>1 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>127 S.Ct. 153, 166 L.Ed.2d 112 (2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
