We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002). A \u201cclear probability\u201d means it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). \u201cThe burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal ... to establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal\u201d on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2006). A showing of past threat to life or freedom on such a ground creates a rebuttable presumption that the threat would recur upon removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(I) (2006); <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-21\">A determination regarding eligibility for withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Factual findings by the Board or the immigration judge \u201care conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-22\">To make a prima facie case for relief under the CAT, \u201ca petitioner must offer specific showings that he or she will be subject to \u2018severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental\u2019 by or at \u2018the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Guzman v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1) (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-23\">In <em>Li v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 171,177 (4th Cir.2005), we noted that persecution is an extreme concept and may include actions less severe than threats to life or freedom but must rise above mere harassment. We cited <em>Dandan v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>567, 573 (7th Cir.2003), for the proposition that a three day detention that included interrogations, beatings and deprivations of food and water did not compel a finding of persecution. <em>Li, </em>405 F.3d at 177. We observed that courts are reluctant to categorize detentions unaccompanied by severe physical abuse or torture as persecution. <em>Id. </em>Minor beatings and detentions lasting two to three days do not amount to persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Butt failed to establish past persecution. We further find substantial evidence supports the finding that Butt failed to establish a clear probability or likelihood of persecution or torture if he returns to Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
