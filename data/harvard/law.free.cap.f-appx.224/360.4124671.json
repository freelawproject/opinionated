But even if the ninety-day-period did not begin until November 25, 2005, which the defendant disputes, Clark\u2019s complaint had to be received by the clerk of the court no later than February 23, 2006. Although Clark mailed his complaint on February 14, 2006, it was not received by the clerk until March 9, 2006. If a complaint is mailed, \u201cfiling\u201d is accomplished only when the complaint is actually received by the clerk, and filings reaching the clerk\u2019s office after a deadline are untimely even if mailed before the deadline.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[H]aving chosen to transmit the [complaint] by mail service, [Clark] assumed the risk of any untimely delivery and filing of [his complaint].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Clark appears to argue that the postmark date should be used in this case, contending there were \u201c \u2018mailing\u2019 problems that were going on at that time with court proceedings, deadlines, phones, filing motions, moving to different locations, etc.\u201d and stating \u201chow really bad [the New Orleans] courts were (in terms of damages, loss of employees) after Hurricane[s] Katrina and Rita.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clark does not contend, however, that there was any actual impediment to filing his complaint by February 23, 2006. Although the result seems harsh, Clark chose to risk the vagaries of the postal delivery system despite circumstances that militated against doing so and failed to monitor whether the clerk had received his complaint within the prescribed filing period.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
