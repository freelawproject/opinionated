McComb, an osteopathic physician whose license to practice medicine had been suspended, admitted he injected himself and three others with Botulinum Toxin Type A, a highly potent toxin that causes a muscle-paralyzing condition, that he knew had not been approved for use in humans. McComb contends the district court: (1) erroneously applied a two-level increase to his offense level for a loss amount exceeding $5,000; (2) based its decision to depart upward on impermissible factors; and (3) imposed an unreasonable sentence. We affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">A. <em>Loss Calculation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-15\">We review the district court\u2019s loss calculation for clear error. <em>United States v. Cedeno, </em>471 F.3d 1193, 1196 (11th Cir. 2006). If a district court commits an error in calculating the Guidelines range, we must remand unless the district court \u201cwould have likely sentenced [the defendant] in the same way without the error.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>441 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">The district court calculated a base offense level of 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2), and then added the following specific offense characteristics: (1) a 2-level increase under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(B) for a loss amount exceeding $5,000; (2) a 2-level increase under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(12) because the offense involved the conscious or reckless risk of death or bodily injury; and (3) a 2-level increase under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(C) because the offense involved a violation of a prior administrative order that suspended McComb\u2019s medical license and precluded him from performing injections. Thus, McComb\u2019s offense level totaled 12. The district court then increased the offense level to 14, in accordance with \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(12), which states that, if the resulting offense level is less than 14, the offense level should be increased to 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>McComb challenges only the application of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(B); he does not challenge the application of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(12). Assuming the district court\u2019s finding the loss amount exceeded $5,000 was clearly erroneous and that 2-level increase was therefore improper, McComb\u2019s base offense level of 6, in combination with the 2 unchallenged 2-level increases, would have resulted in an offense level of 10. Pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(12), this would have been increased to level 14, which is the same level calculated by the district court. Thus, we need not decide whether the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. Any possible error by the district court with respect to the loss calculation is harmless because it did not affect the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range. Additionally, the district court sentenced McComb to the statutory maximum, stating his conduct warranted \u201cthe most severe penalty available\u201d to the district court. Consequently, the district court is likely to have imposed the same sentence on McComb regardless of any error in the loss amount calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">B. <em>Upward Departure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The district court\u2019s obligation to calculate the Guidelines range correctly applies to upward departures. <em>United States v. Jordi </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1215 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 812, 163 L.Ed.2d 639 (2005). We review departures from the Guidelines in three analytical steps: (1) the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is a legal conclusion reviewed <em>de novo; (2) </em>the district court\u2019s factual basis for a departure is reviewed for clear error; and (3) the extent of the departure is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Maurice, </em>69 F.3d 1553, 1556 (11th Cir.1995). Reasonableness is evaluated \u201cin light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the reasons stated by the district court for departing.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1236 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">A district court may depart if \u201csignificant physical injury resulted\u201d from the defendant\u2019s conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.2. According to this provision, \u201c[t]he extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the extent of the injury, the degree to which it may prove permanent, and the extent to which the injury was intended or knowingly risked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in cases where \u201cthe victim suffers a major, permanent disability and when such injury was intentionally inflicted, a substantial departure may be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Furthermore, a district court may depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 if \u201cthere is something atypical about the defendant or the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime which significantly differ from the normal or heartland conduct in the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Blas, </em>360 F.3d 1268, 1273 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). The district court\u2019s determination as to whether a case is \u201coutside the heartland\u201d is entitled to \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">\u201cA guided departure is one based on a factor about an offense or a defendant that the Guidelines expressly discuss.\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>368 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir.2004). If a guideline encourages courts to consider a factor that has not already been taken into account by the specific guideline under which the defendant is sentenced, that factor may always be used as the basis for an upward departure. <em>Id. </em>at 1339. If a guideline encourages courts to consider a factor that has already been taken into account by the guideline under which the defendant is sentenced, however, that factor may be the basis for an upward departure only if \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>factor is present to an exceptional degree not contemplated by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Both \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0 and 5K2.2 warrant an upward departure. First, with regard to the application of \u00a7 5K2.0, McComb argues the district court improperly based its decision to depart upward on the fact he administered the injections of Botulinum Toxin Type A when his medical license was suspended, a factor which had been taken into account by the two-level increase to his offense level under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(C) for violating an administrative order. McComb did not raise this argument to the district court, so we review it for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Maurice, </em>69 F.3d at 1556-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, the district court did not commit plain error by considering McComb\u2019s license suspension as a factor in its decision to depart upward, even if this factor was accounted for in calculating McComb\u2019s Guidelines range. First, we note this factor had no effect on McComb\u2019s Guidelines range because, as explained previously, his offense level would have been 14, pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(12), regardless of the 2-level enhancement for violating an administrative order. Second, in the unique circumstances of this case, \u201cthe factor is present to an exceptional degree not contemplated by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See Simmons, </em>368 F.3d at 1339. A doctor injected a toxin into three of his patients when he knew the toxin was not approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in humans, and regardless of the contents of the injection, he was prohibited from administering any injections because of the suspension of his medical license. Furthermore, his victims had no knowledge of either of these facts. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion this conduct was \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201ctotally inexcusable,\u201d and the district court did not commit plain error by considering this factor as a justification for an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">Additionally, as the district court found, \u00a7 5K2.2 provides a basis for an upward departure because of the significant physical injuries that resulted from McComb\u2019s offense. To the extent McComb argues in his reply brief this factor had also already been accounted for in calculating his Guidelines range, he waived this argument by not raising it in his initial appellate brief. <em>See United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104-05 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">Additionally, we find the extent of the departure, from the advisory Guidelines range of 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment to the statutory maximum of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(a)(2), was reasonable. The victims\u2019 injuries were substantial and included total paralysis, complete incapacitation, and months of hospitalization, and the testimony at the sentencing hearing established the victims continued to experience medical complications such as hearing loss and respiratory difficulties. Additionally, the district court\u2019s decision reflected consideration of the following 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine the extent of the departure: McComb\u2019s history, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the seriousness of the offense, the need to protect the public, and the need to deter similar criminal conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>did not err in applying \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.2 and 5K2.0 and the departure to the statutory maximum sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">C. <em>Reasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Having determined the Guidelines range was properly calculated, we review the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, considering the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. <em>Martin, </em>455 F.3d at 1237. The burden to show the sentence is unreasonable is on the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">As previously stated, the district court considered \u00a7 3553(a) factors in sentencing McComb to the statutory maximum. McComb contention the district court did not sufficiently consider mitigating factors is without merit. The district court stated that, in determining McComb\u2019s sentence, it considered all of the arguments and evidence presented, specifically pointing out the letters submitted on McComb\u2019s behalf and the presentence investigation report, which reflected McComb\u2019s lack of a criminal history. Additionally, the district court acknowledged McComb suffered injuries as a result of his conduct. Nonetheless, after weighing the other \u00a7 3553 factors, the district court found the statutory maximum sentence of 36 months was appropriate due to McComb\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d conduct. In light of the district court\u2019s consideration of several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, McComb has not met his burden of showing the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">First, any possible error committed by the district court in calculating McComb\u2019s Guidelines range was harmless. Additionally, the district court did not err in applying an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.2 and 5K2.0, and the extent of the departure was reasonable. Third, the final sentence of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment was reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm McComb\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-6\">.
