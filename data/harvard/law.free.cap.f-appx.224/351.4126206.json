Rogers appeals. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-24\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b377-25\">On August 17, 2005, Rogers filed a complaint in district court seeking review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny his application for social security disability benefits. On February 7, 2006, the Commissioner filed a Motion to Reverse With Remand. The Commissioner acknowledges that the Administrative Law Judge \u201cdrafted a decision that was not supported by substantial evidence and did not follow the appropriate legal standards.\u201d The district court granted the Motion to Reverse With Remand on March 2, 2006. Rogers filed a Motion for New Trial on March 9, 2006, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court should have awarded benefits instead of remanding the case back for further administrative proceedings. The district court denied Rogers\u2019 motion. He appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-26\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b377-27\">We review the district court\u2019s order of remand, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(g), fourth sentence, for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Rogers argues that he does not believe that the Commissioner will grant him a fair proceeding on remand and seeks a new trial in the district court. There are, however, important and unresolved aspects of Rogers\u2019 claim that should first be addressed before the Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge should be allowed to give proper consideration to Rogers\u2019 treating physician\u2019s opinion under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527 and complete a credibility analysis according to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529. In light of these issues and other unresolved issues of fact, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to remand the case back for further administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
