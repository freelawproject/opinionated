Moore entered guilty pleas to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and social security fraud (Count One) and mail fraud and aiding and abetting (Count Four). The district court sentenced Moore to concurrent terms of 12 months of imprisonment and one day and concurrent terms of three years and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-25\">For the first time on appeal, Moore contends that the imposition of a five-year term of supervised release for her mail fraud conviction exceeds the statutory maximum sentence. Moore asserts that this error is plain and affects her substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-26\">We \u201creview de novo a sentence that allegedly exceeds the statutory maximum term.\u201d <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>369 F.3d 847, 849 (5th Cir.2004). Moore plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ed guilty to conduct that occurred from January 2000 to July 2000 when the offense of mail fraud carried a maximum statutory penalty of five years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (2000); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>869 F.2d 835, 836-37 (5th Cir.1989) (holding that proper penalty statute is statute in effect at time offense is committed). Thus, Moore was subject to a statutory maximum term of supervised release of three years on the mail fraud conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(4), 3583(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of a supervised release term of three years as to Moore\u2019s conspiracy conviction conflicts with the written judgment which provides that the supervised release term is five years. The oral pronouncement controls. <em>See United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Moore\u2019s conviction and affirm her sentence in part. We vacate and remand for resentencing the sentence of five years of supervised release as to Moore\u2019s conviction for mail fraud and order the correction of the clerical error in the written judgment to conform to the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of a three-year term supervised release as to Moore\u2019s conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
