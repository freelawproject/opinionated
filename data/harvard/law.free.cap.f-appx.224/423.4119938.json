Torres argues that the BIA erred by upholding the immigration judge\u2019s decision following the hearing of May 24, 2005, to pretermit consideration of his waiver application under former Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(c) based on Torres\u2019s prior aggravated felony conviction. Torres argues that his waiver application should have been considered under the law in place in 2003, which would have applied had he received effective assistance of counsel and had his waiver application been timely filed at the earlier time. Torres contends that his waiver application would likely have been granted under the law in place in 2003 and that the subsequent clarification of the law in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) and <em>In re Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (BIA 2005), should not apply. He asserts, citing <em>Batanic v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 662 (7th Cir.1993), that the failure to consider his application nunc pro tunc violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Although we generally lack jurisdiction to review final orders of removal of aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), pursuant to the REAL ID Act, we retain jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Rodriguez-Castro v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, we may consider Torres\u2019s assertion that his right to due process was violated by the failure to consider his arguments as of the time his attorney should have filed his \u00a7 212(c) application. We review claims of a due process violation de novo. <em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140,144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Torres has not pointed to any authority or evidence supporting his claim that he would likely have received a waiver under \u00a7 212(c) had his application for such relief been adjudicated in 2003. Nor has he supported his contention that application of the clarification in <em>Blake </em>and \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) changes anything that would affect the process he received. As Torres admits, the statutory language regarding waivers of admissibility has not changed. Torres\u2019s reliance on <em>Batanic </em>in support of his argument is misplaced. <em>Batanic </em>involved a change in statutory law and is neither controlling nor persuasive authority for Torres\u2019s contention. <em>See Batanic, </em>12 F.3d at 664, 667-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
