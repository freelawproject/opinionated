On appeal, Esogbue argues the various deficiencies in his deportation proceedings. Because Esogbue did not appeal the BIA\u2019s affirmance, only the BIA\u2019s denial of Esogbue\u2019s motion to reopen is at issue in this petition. <em>See Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006). The BIA denied the motion to reopen as untimely. Esogbue makes no arguments concerning the BIA\u2019s determination that his motion to reopen was untimely other than to assert that his claims should not be dismissed on technical grounds. Esogbue has, therefore, waived review of that issue. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986). Because Esogbue has waived the only issue before us, we pretermit consideration of any jurisdictional issues regarding our review. <em>See Madriz-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 321, 327-28 (5th Cir.2004). Esogbue\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">By a document dated July 27, 2005, and filed on August 25, 2005, Esogbue moved the district court for review of the denial of his application for naturalization. The district court construed this as a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging Esogbue\u2019s deportation order. Esogbue argues that the transfer order was error because his petition in the district court sought direct review of the denial of his naturalization application and should not have been construed as a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking his deportation order. Esogbue has moved to supplement the record with respect to the denial of his application for naturalization. The motion to supplement the record is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">The district court transferred the ease to this court pursuant to the Real ID Act. <em>See </em>Real ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302-11 (May 11, 2005); <em>see Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006). Because Esogbue\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition was not pending in the district court on May 11, 2005, the district court\u2019s transfer of the case to this court under the Real ID Act was improper. Given that the transfer was improper and Esogbue\u2019s argument that the pleading was not a \u00a7 2241 petition in the first instance, the transfer is VACATED and REMANDED to the district court for additional proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
