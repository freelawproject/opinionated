California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Hernandez has not filed a response to the renewed motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-20\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Hernandez\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal and for appointment of new counsel is DENIED. His motion for an extension of time to respond to counsel\u2019s initial <em>Anders </em>motion is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
