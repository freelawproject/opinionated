California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Serrano\u2019s conviction and sentence is AFFIRMED. However, we discovered a scrivener\u2019s error in the judgment and, therefore, this case is REMANDED for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment so that it indicates that the statute of conviction was 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
