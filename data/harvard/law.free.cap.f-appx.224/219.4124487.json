In addition to imposing a 156-month sentence and a five-year term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>of supervised release, the district court ordered Gripper to pay restitution of $2100. In his motion, Gripper asserts that the BOP improperly set up a payment schedule through the inmate financial responsibility program in direct conflict with Gripper\u2019s judgment, which stated that the restitution shall be paid immediately, or in installments after his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Gripper\u2019s motion challenges the implementation of the restitution portion of his sentence. We therefore conclude the district court should have construed Gripper\u2019s motion as a petition for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). A \u00a7 2241 petition, however, must be brought in the district in which the petitioner is incarcerated, <em>see In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 332 (4th Cir.2000), and Gripper is presently incarcerated in Atlanta, Georgia. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for the district court to construe the filing as a \u00a7 2241 petition and to determine whether transferring the petition to the proper federal district court would serve the interests of justice, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (2000), or whether the action should be dismissed without prejudice to allow Gripper the opportunity to file his action in the appropriate district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
