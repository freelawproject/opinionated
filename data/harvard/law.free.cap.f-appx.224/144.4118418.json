This case arises from Banks\u2019 arrest in the District of Columbia for carrying a dangerous weapon (a flare gun) on the steps of the United States Supreme Court in September 2006. Banks was incarcerated and subsequently filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. <em>See Banks v. United States Attorney General, </em>Civ. No. 07-cv-00021.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Banks also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in January 2007, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As noted by the District Court, it is somewhat unclear the relief Banks sought by filing this petition in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. To the extent that Banks\u2019 petition could be perceived as a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, he must file the petition in the District Court having jurisdiction over Banks\u2019 custodian (which is not the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). <em>See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 442, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004). Therefore, because Banks\u2019 appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Banks\u2019 motion to seal, motion for security tapes, motion for default and summary judgment as well as his motion for an emergency hearing and witness protection are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. This habeas petition is still pending in the District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-13\">. To the extent that Banks\u2019 petition could be perceived as a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, <em>see Coady </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>251 F.3d 480, 484-85 (3d Cir.2001), we would deny a certificate of appealability. Banks cannot bring a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under these circumstances. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
