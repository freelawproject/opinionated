Goldman filed suit under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 901, the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, in the administrative court. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) granted summary judgment to Halliburton because Goldman was excluded from coverage under the Act as a member of a vessel\u2019s crew.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Goldman argued that Halliburton was judicially es-topped from claiming that he was a member of the crew, but the ALJ denied his motion. Goldman appealed to the Benefits Review Board at the U.S. Department of Labor, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision that Halliburton was not estopped. Goldman now petitions for review of the Benefits Review Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Judicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken in the same or some earlier proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For a party to be judicially estopped from arguing a position, the position must be clearly inconsistent with the party\u2019s previous one, and the party must have clearly convinced the court to accept that previous position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Goldman fails to show that Halliburton convinced a court in any judicial proceeding to accept the position that he was not a member of a crew, so Halliburton is not judicially es-topped from claiming that Goldman is a member of a crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We therefore AFFIRM the Benefit Review Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
