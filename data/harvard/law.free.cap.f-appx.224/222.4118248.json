R.Crim.P. 35(b) and denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-22\">The district court denied Dasher\u2019s motion for a reduction of his sentence under Rule 35(b) as it is well-settled that whether to file a Rule 35(b) motion is a matter left to the Government\u2019s discretion. Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>998 F.2d 228, 230 (4th Cir.1993). Here, the Government found Dasher\u2019s assistance insufficient to merit a motion and Dasher has failed to show the Government\u2019s refusal to move for a reduction was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Rule 35(b) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-23\">The second order that Dasher appeals denied his \u00a7 2255 motion, on the ground that it was filed beyond the one-year limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>for such actions. The order also denied Dasher\u2019s motion to reconsider the denial of his Rule 35(b) motion. To the extent Dasher appeals from the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief, the order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent <em>\u201ca </em>substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Dasher has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss this portion of the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
