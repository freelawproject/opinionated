As a result of the investigation, two arrest warrants were issued for Godsey, one for rape and another for furnishing a controlled substance to a minor. In early November 2003, Wilson contacted Deloris Bagsby, an employee of the Mobile County Community Corrections Center (\u201cMCCCC\u201d) and Godsey\u2019s probation officer. Bagsby referred the matter to John Branscomb, a subordinate county probation officer who at times had visited Godsey as part of Godsey\u2019s probation. Wilson related to Branscomb that warrants had been issued for Godsey\u2019s arrest. Wilson then requested that Branscomb accompany him to Godsey\u2019s residence at the time the warrants were served for the purpose of conducting a search. Branscomb agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>On the morning of November 13, 2003, Wilson, Branscomb, and a Bayou La Batre police officer arrived at Godsey\u2019s trailer home. When Godsey opened the door, he was arrested. Wilson handcuffed Godsey and explained his rights. According to Branscomb, Godsey stated that he wanted to cooperate. After a second individual in the trailer was arrested for possession of Ecstacy, Branscomb explained to Godsey that, as a probation officer, he had the right to search the residence. Godsey then shook his head in agreement, although he denies that he consented to the ensuing search. Branscomb proceeded to search the house, including using keys found in the house to open a locked room and a safe. During his search of the residence, Branscomb located drugs and weapons. As a result, Godsey was indicted for possession with intent to distribute 46 grams of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and using and carrying a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Godsey moved to suppress the evidence seized from his home, asserting that the probation officer lacked a warrant or probable cause for the search. Godsey also denied that he had consented to the search. The district court denied the motion to suppress, finding that the county probation officer had operated under state regulations authorizing searches of probationers\u2019 residences upon reasonable grounds, and that the arrest warrants here established reasonable suspicion to conduct the search. The district court found that, to the extent a diminished privacy interest was relevant to its analysis, the very fact that Godsey was on probation demonstrated its existence. The district court also found that Godsey waived any argument that a state probationer was different from a county probationer because he cited no authority to support this claim. Finally, the district court found that, even if there was no county regulation, the motion failed because other courts had found that such searches were constitutional as long as supported by reasonable suspicion, and there was no requirement that the probationer be on notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Godsey moved for reconsideration, asserting that the information supporting the arrest warrants was stale, therefore, the probation officer did not have reasonable suspicion. The district court denied the motion. Godsey then pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment pursuant to a written plea agreement in which he retained the right to challenge the denial of his motion to suppress. Godsey was sentenced to 96 months on the drug count and a consecutive mandatory 60 months on the firearm count, for a total of 156 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress <em>de novo, </em>reviewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed in the district court. <em>United States v. Yuknavich, </em>419 F.3d 1302, 1308 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>71 F.3d 819, 824 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">\u201cIt is always true of probationers ... that they do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only ... conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special [probation] restrictions.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 U.S. 868, 874, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3169, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987) (citation and internal quotations omitted). In <em>Griffin, </em>a Wisconsin regulation permitted a probation officer to conduct a warrantless search of a probationer\u2019s home if there were \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe the probationer was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>violation of his probation. <em>Id. </em>at 870-71, 107 S.Ct. 3164. The Supreme Court upheld the search, concluding that the regulation was justified by the \u201cspecial needs\u201d of a state\u2019s probation system. <em>Id. </em>at 876, 107 S.Ct. 3164.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">In this case, Godsey argues that the search was improper in the absence of a regulation such as that described in <em>Griffin. </em>Alabama does, however, have a regulation similar to that in <em>Griffin, </em>although it is part of the state probation system. Godsey alleges that because the probation officer who conducted the search of his home was a county probation officer, the state regulation did not apply and did not grant him the authority to conduct the search. The county program responsible for overseeing Godsey\u2019s probation was created by the court system as an alternative program for youthful offenders and was modeled after the state system. Furthermore, though the MCCCC was not formally connected to the state system, the MCCCC did not have its own independent regulations and Branscomb testified that he assumed the authority to search probationers\u2019 homes, as described in the state regulations, extended to county probation officers. Therefore, the distinction advanced by Godsey is a distinction without a difference, and we conclude that the state regulations did give Branscomb authority to search the probationer\u2019s home if the search was properly supported by reasonable suspicion. <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 876, 107 S.Ct. 3164.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Reasonable suspicion consists of \u201ca sufficiently high probability that criminal conduct is occurring to make the intrusion on the individual\u2019s privacy interest reasonable.\u201d <em>Yuknavich, </em>419 F.3d at 1311.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-7\">When making a determination of reasonable suspicion, [this court] must look at the totality of the circumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing. It is clear that an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch of criminal activity is not enough to satisfy the minimum level of objectivity required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-11\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>348 F.3d 965, 970 (11th Cir.2003)). The officer must \u201cbe able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Boyce, </em>351 F.3d 1102,1107 (11th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">In this case, police notified the MCCCC that arrest warrants for rape and a controlled substance offense had been issued for Godsey. This information was sufficient to give reasonable suspicion that Godsey had violated the terms of his supervised release. As reasonable suspicion may arise from the officers\u2019 collective knowledge, it is of no matter that Branscomb received the information second hand. <em>United States v. Acosta, </em>363 F.3d 1141, 1145 (11th Cir.2004). Thus, in light of the arrest warrants and the information from police and Branscomb\u2019s supervisor, we conclude that Branscomb had reasonable suspicion to support the search, and the district court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
