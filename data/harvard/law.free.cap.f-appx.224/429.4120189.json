Owens challenges the sufficiency of the factual basis to support his conviction for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. The Government concedes that, to the extent the indictment charged Owens with possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, the stipulated facts and Owens\u2019s admissions do not support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u201c[Section] 924(c) criminalizes two separate offenses \u2014 (1) using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, and (2) possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Combs, </em>369 F.3d 925, 931 (6th Cir.2004) (emphasis omitted). The indictment did not charge Owens with using or carrying a firearm. Thus, we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the indictment charged Owens with possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">The record as a whole does not show that Owens\u2019s possession of firearms furthered, advanced, or helped forward his drug trafficking activities. <em>See United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 410-11 (5th Cir.2000). Because the conduct to which Owens admitted does not constitute the crime of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense and added 60 months to his sentence, the district court\u2019s error in accepting Owens\u2019s plea of guilty to this offense was plain error which affected Owens\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333,159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004); <em>United States v. Castro-Trevino, </em>464 F.3d 536, 544 (5th Cir.2006). A guilty plea based on facts insufficient to support a conviction \u201c \u2018colors the fundamental fairness of the entire proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>456 F.3d 484, 491 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Kennedy v. Maggio, </em>725 F.2d 269, 273 (5th Cir.1984)). Accordingly, we exercise our discretion to correct the error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">We AFFIRM Owens\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 but VACATE his conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). We REMAND for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">Counsel\u2019s outstanding motion to withdraw under <em>Anders v.
