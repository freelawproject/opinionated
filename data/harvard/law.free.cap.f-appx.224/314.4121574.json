Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-23\">Pabell\u00f3n argues that the district court violated her due process rights under the Fifth Amendment by rendering oral orders or \u201ctext orders\u201d rather than issuing an opinion and explaining why her motions were denied. Based on our review of the record, we find no evidence that Pabell\u00f3n was prejudiced by the district court\u2019s decision to enter a text order and therefore find no Fifth Amendment violation. <em>Cf. Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 281-82 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-24\">We also uphold the denial of Pabellon\u2019s motion for modification of sentence. Pabell\u00f3n appears to base her motion on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Supreme Court has lowered the sentencing range applicable to her case. This argument has been squarely rejected by several of our sister circuits. <em>See Carrington v. United States, </em>470 F.3d 920, 923 (9th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Pena, </em>470 F.3d 431, 433 (1st Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Price, </em>438 F.3d 1005, 1007 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2365, 165 L.Ed.2d 289 (2006); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1643, 164 L.Ed.2d 351 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders denying Pabellon\u2019s motions for modification of sentence and her motion for reconsideration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
