Pineda argues that he received an unreasonable sentence because the district court failed to consider properly the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Pineda also argues that, upon remand, this Court should order a new judge to preside over his sentencing hearing because the earlier judge failed to fairly consider the factors under Section 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">In sentencing Pineda, the district court considered his arguments for a sentence below his applicable guideline range based on his personal characteristics and the nature of the offense, and considered the available sentences and appropriately consulted the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785-88 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence upon Pineda.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
