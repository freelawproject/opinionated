Smith\u2019s only contention on appeal is that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-19\">When imposing a sentence after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts must calculate the appropriate Guidelines range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), and impose a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). A sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Thus, Smith\u2019s 57-month sentence is presumptively reasonable, because it is within both the properly calculated Guidelines range and the applicable statutory maximum. The record reflects that the district court complied with \u00a7 3553(a), and considered Smith\u2019s personal history and circumstances in determining his sentence. Having reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties on appeal, we find the sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-24\">Therefore, we affirm Smith\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
