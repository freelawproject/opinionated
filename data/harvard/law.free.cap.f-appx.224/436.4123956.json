She argues that the BIA erred when it rejected her claim that removal proceedings should be terminated because the proceedings were instituted based on information set forth in an application for benefits that she filed under the confidentiality provisions of the Legal Immigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">As the BIA noted in its order of removal, the confidentiality requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act are applicable to applications for legalization under the LIFE Act. Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 245A(c)(5), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(c)(5)(A)(i); LIFE Act, PL 106-553, 2000 HR 4942, *2762A-148; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.21. However, the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that Khan failed to establish that she filed an application under the LIFE Act is based upon substantial evidence. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137-38 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that an independent source apprised Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials of Khan\u2019s illegal status is also based upon substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>The BIA therefore did not err when it determined that the confidentiality provisions of the LIFE Act were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">Khan\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
