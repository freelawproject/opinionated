Liendo argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) after finding that the offense \u201cinvolved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d Even after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268,163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-23\">The record reflects that Liendo was driving a tractor trailer carrying four illegal aliens. Two of the aliens were hiding in a compartment under the bottom bunk in the trailer\u2019s sleeper area from which they could not easily extricate themselves. The district court did not err in concluding that these circumstances qualified as intentional or reckless creation of a \u201csubstantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 401-03 (5th Cir.2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment.(n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-24\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
