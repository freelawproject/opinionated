Foncham contends that the IJ should have deemed her motion unopposed and granted it; that she was in substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); that application of the <em>Lozada </em>requirements to her case violates due process; and that application of the <em>Lozada </em>requirements violates equal protection by impeding her fundamental right to counsel by placing her in a disadvantageous position vis a vis aliens who are represented by accredited representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The IJ was not required to grant Foncham\u2019s unopposed motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(l)(iv). Foncham has failed to brief the issue whether she can make a prima facie showing that she would have obtained asylum or withholding of deportation but for the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. She therefore has failed to show the prejudice required to succeed on her due process claims. <em>See Miranda-Lores v. INS, </em>17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Finally, Foncham has failed to show that requiring aliens who are represented by counsel to file complaints with the relevant disciplinary authorities singles out a particular group for discriminatory treatment or impermissibly interferes with a fundamental right. <em>See Hatten v. Rains, </em>854 F.2d 687, 690 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Lavernia v. Lynaugh, </em>845 F.2d 493, 496 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
