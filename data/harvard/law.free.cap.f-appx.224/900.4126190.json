Because Hankerson was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not apply, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-22\">Hankerson filed a motion in the district court seeking to modify his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which provides that \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced ... based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d the court may, upon motion of the defendant, reduce the term of imprisonment. Hankerson argued that Amendment 591 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which was enacted after his sentencing, lowered the guideline range under which he was sentenced. Therefore, Hankerson argued, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) applies and he is eligible for a reduction of his sentence. After considering Hanker-son\u2019s motion, a magistrate judge recommended denying it on the ground that Hankerson was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender provision, which was not affected by Amendment 591. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>over Hankerson\u2019s objection, denying the motion. Hankerson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted). Section 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Rather, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only permits the district court to modify a sentence if the defendant\u2019s sentencing range was subsequently lowered by an amendment to the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Amendment 591, upon which Hankerson based his motion, affected the way a district court determines the applicable offense guideline in cases where the defendant is sentenced under Chapter Two of the sentencing guidelines. See U.S.S.G. Amend. 591; <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219-20. Though Hankerson was convicted of an offense that otherwise qualified for sentencing under Chapter Two of the guidelines, he was ultimately sentenced under Chapter Four of the guidelines, specifically, \u00a7 4B1.1. Amendment 591 did not affect the application of \u00a7 4B1.1, and therefore did not lower the sentencing range under which Hankerson was sentenced. See U.S.S.G. Amend. 591. Indeed, had Hankerson been sentenced after the enactment of Amendment 591, his guideline range would have been the same. Thus, Hankerson was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not apply. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hankerson\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Because Hankerson was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1,-Amendment 591 did not affect the guideline range under which he was sentenced, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not apply. Therefore, district court properly denied the motion, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
