He now appeals that conviction and his 46-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Ramirez-Castro argues that his previous Florida conviction of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon is not a crime of violence because it is not an offense enumerated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 comment. n.l(B)(iii) and it does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. Ramirez-Castro\u2019s conviction for aggravated battery using a deadly weapon under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 784.045 (1) (a) (2) \u201chas as an element at least a threatened use of force\u201d and thus was properly characterized by the district court as a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 345, 346-50 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Ramirez-Castro also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Ramirez-Castro\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ramirez-Castro properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
