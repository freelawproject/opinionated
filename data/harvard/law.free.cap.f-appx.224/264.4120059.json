Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">On January 6, 2005, Burlington (North Carolina) Police Department officers executed a search warrant at Dixon\u2019s residence based on controlled drug purchases previously made from that residence, including from Dixon. One item seized by the officers was a stolen, loaded Ruger .44 caliber magnum revolver, model Redhawk, located under the mattress of the bed in the room Dixon identified as his. During the search, Dixon asked to put on a pair of sweat pants that were on the floor by the bed, the pockets of which were found to contain $3,098 in United States currency. The search of the residence also uncovered electronic scales with white powder residue, a large box of plastic sandwich bags, and a set of walkie talkies. Finally, officers seized a plastic bag containing 5.7 grams of marijuana that was in plain view of Dixon and other persons in the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">Dixon was subsequently indicted by a grand jury for the Middle District of North Carolina for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Dixon pleaded guilty to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-19\">Following a sentencing hearing, the district court employed a base offense level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>24 after determining that Dixon had at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. <em>See United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 (a)(2) (2004). This determination was based on Dixon\u2019s North Carolina state court felony convictions in 1994 for possession with the intent to sell and deliver cocaine and in 2000 for speeding to elude arrest. The court applied a two-level enhancement because at least one of the firearms involved in the offense was stolen, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(4), and a four-level enhancement because Dixon possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(5). With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, Dixon\u2019s total offense level was 27, which, when combined with Dixon\u2019s Criminal History Category of VI, yielded a guideline range of 130 to 162 months imprisonment. Because the statutory maximum for Dixon\u2019s offense was 120 months, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (West 2000), that term became Dixon\u2019s guideline range, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). Finding no reason to deviate from the advisory guideline range, the district court imposed a 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Dixon maintains that the district court, in the course of determining his guidelines offense level, erred in concluding that he had at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. He does not challenge the fact that his 1994 conviction for possession with intent to sell and deliver cocaine constituted one predicate offense. But, he argues that his 2000 conviction for speeding to elude arrest was not for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u201cCrime of violence\u201d is defined by the guidelines as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.l) (adopting definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d from U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2). The offense of speeding to elude arrest does not include \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d so it is a crime of violence only if it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the question before us is whether the offense at issue satisfies that definition. This is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Pierce, </em>278 F.3d 282, 286 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Dixon was convicted of violating N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-141.5, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-15\">(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle on a street, highway, or public vehicular area while fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer who is in the lawful performance of his duties....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-16\">(b) If two or more of the following aggravating factors are present at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>time the violation occurs, violation of this section shall be a Class H felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahv\">(1) Speeding in excess of 15 miles per hour over the legal speed limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">(5) Driving when the person\u2019s drivers license is revoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-141.5 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Our decision in <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387 (4th Cir .2003), demonstrates that Dixon\u2019s offense was a crime of violence. In <em>James, </em>we held that the South Carolina offense of failure to stop for a blue light, <em>see </em>S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-5-750 (2006), constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">Most cases of failing to stop for a blue light involve the deliberate choice by the driver to disobey the police officer\u2019s signal. This disobedience poses the threat of a direct confrontation between the police officer and the occupants of the vehicle, which, in turn, creates a potential for serious physical injury to the officer, other occupants of the vehicle, and even bystanders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\"><em>James, </em>337 F.3d at 391. In this regard, we found \u201cthe potential for injury in [that] crime analogous to the potential for injury presented in the crimes of escape and pickpocketing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391 n. 4 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">The very same reasoning requires a conclusion that a violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-141.5 \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d To violate \u00a7 20-141.5, a person \u201cmust actually intend to operate a motor vehicle in order to elude law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>State v. Woodard, </em>146 N.C.App. 75, 552 S.E.2d 650, 654 (2001). Thus, the very circumstance that we found present in \u201c[m]ost cases\u201d of violations of the statute at issue in <em>James </em>is present in all cases of violations of the statute at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">Dixon maintains that his conviction was not for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because one of the two aggravating factors that made his offense a felony rather than a misdemeanor \u2014 driving with a revoked license\u2014 does not <em>in itself </em>present a serious risk of injury to another. The controlling question here, however, is whether a violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-141.5 \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d not whether a particular element of that crime \u2014 or a factor used in determining the sentence for the crime \u2014 involved such conduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">In a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, Dixon also argues that the district court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>enhancing his offense level for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">This enhancement was well supported by the record. Defense counsel conceded that Dixon had no \u201clegitimate income\u201d at the time of the search, J.A. 21, yet the search revealed that Dixon\u2019s sweat pants, located right next to the bed in which the revolver was hidden, contained $3,098. <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>171 F.3d 188, 195 (4th Cir.1999) (recognizing that a Rolex watch, a wad of currency totaling $1,055, and a handgun were \u201call indicia of drug dealing\u201d). The residence contained electronic scales with a white powder residue as well as a large box of sandwich bags and a bag of marijuana. And, it was information from a confidential informant that he had purchased drugs from Dixon at the residence that had served as the basis for the search warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taken together, the evidence strongly supported the inference that Dixon\u2019s possession of the firearm facilitated his continuing business of selling illegal drugs from his residence, including protecting the proceeds of those sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In sum, finding no error, we affirm Dixon\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">. Dixon does not dispute that his offense was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">. We have recognized the likenesses between the definitions of \"crime of violence\u201d under the guidelines and \"violent felony\u201d under the ACCA, calling them \"almost identical\u201d and holding that \"our reasoning regarding the meaning of \u2018violent felony\u2019 is relevant to determining the meaning of 'crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>246 F.3d 330, 333 n. 5 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\">. Dixon also argues that a violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-141.5 would not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 16(b) (West 2000). Dixon's reference to that definition is puzzling, however, because he does not argue that the definition applies here. And, the definition in \u00a7 16(b) is critically different than the definition before us in that \u00a7 16(b) defines \"crime of violence\u201d in part to mean \"any ... offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk <em>that physical force </em>against the person or property of another <em>may be used </em>in the <em>course of </em>committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 16(b) (emphasis added). For the reasons we have explained, <em>James </em>governs the application of the definition relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">. Dixon points out that the Government has not established the quantity or type of drugs that the confidential informant claimed to have purchased from Dixon. However, in North Carolina, even possession with the intent to distribute marijuana is a felony. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
