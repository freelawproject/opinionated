The district court dismissed Doines\u2019s complaint with prejudice as frivolous and for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A, 1915(e)(2), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Domes argues on appeal that the district court should have conducted a thorough hearing prior to dismissing his claims. He contends that such a hearing would have shown his allegations to be true. The district court, however, did not dismiss any of Doines\u2019s claims on the ground that they were untruthful. By failing to address the bases of the district court\u2019s dismissal, Domes has effectively waived the only appealable issue. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Doines\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Doines\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal each count as a strike against Domes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Domes is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
