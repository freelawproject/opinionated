J.</author>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction, contending that the trial court erroneously awarded restitution under ORS 137.106 for amounts beyond what the victim could have recovered in a civil action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having recently rejected that contention in <em>State v. Ramos, </em>267 Or App 164, 340 P3d 703 (2014), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The material facts are uncontroverted. Defendant\u2019s convictions arose from an automobile accident that occurred while defendant was driving under the influence of intoxicants. That accident damaged the vehicle of the other driver, Weeldreyer. Weeldreyer\u2019s insurance company, State Farm, paid to repair the damage. Defendant\u2019s insurer partially compensated State Farm for the money it had paid to repair the vehicle. The state sought restitution for the difference between the amount State Farm and Weeldreyer had paid for repairs and the amount defendant\u2019s insurer had paid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>State Farm \u2014 that is, $2,333.18. At the restitution hearing, defendant posited that Weeldreyer was partially responsible for the accident. Further, defendant contended that, because the $2,333.18 that the state sought reflected the fault attributable to Weeldreyer \u2014 which would not have been recoverable in a civil action \u2014 the court could not award it as restitution under ORS 137.106. The trial court disagreed. Defendant appeals the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that \u201c[t]he trial court erroneously concluded that State Farm could recover restitution for what it paid its insured, rather than what it could recover in a civil action given the liability of its insured.\u201d The success of that contention is necessarily predicated on the correctness of a subsidiary <em>premise </em>\u2014 viz., that, for purposes of ORS 137.106, \u201ceconomic damages\u201d are limited to those recoverable in a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We recently rejected that premise in <em>Ramos. </em>In <em>Ramos, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">\u201cTo the extent that defendant contends that \u2018economic damages\u2019 are limited to those that would be recoverable in a civil action, we reject that argument. In 2005, the Legislative Assembly amended ORS 137.103 and ORS 137.106 to expand the scope of restitution. Under the former version of the statutes, a victim was entitled to restitution if the victim had suffered \u2018pecuniary damages\u2019 as a result of a defendant\u2019s criminal activities. ORS 137.106 (2003), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2005, ch 564, \u00a7 2. \u2018Pecuniary damages,\u2019 in turn, was defined as \u2018all special damages, but not general damages, which a person could recover against the defendant in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the defendant\u2019s criminal activities [listing examples].\u2019 ORS 137.103 (2003), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2005, ch 564, \u00a7 1. After the amendments, a victim is entitled to restitution of \u2018economic damages,\u2019 which term \u2014 as noted above \u2014 has the broad meaning set out in ORS 31.170(2)(a): \u2018objectively verifiable monetary losses [listing examples].\u2019 <em>See also </em>Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2230, Jan 24, 2005, Tape 137, Side A (statement of Fred Boss, Chief Counsel of the Oregon Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Enforcement Division; introducing the bill on behalf of its sponsor, the Attorney General\u2019s Restitution Reform Task Force, and explaining that the bill was intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>replace the term \u2018pecuniary damages\u2019 \u2014 and specifically including the requirement that the damages would have been recoverable in a civil action \u2014 with the concept of \u2018economic damages\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">267 Or App at 175-76 (brackets in <em>Ramos).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Our holding in <em>Ramos </em>is dispositive of defendant\u2019s appellate contentions in this case. Further, on appeal, defendant does not contend that the trial court\u2019s award of restitution was otherwise erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> ORS 137.106 (l)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">\u201cWhen a person is convicted of a crime * * * that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court * * * evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. *** If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall enter a judgment or supplemental judgment requiring that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages as determined by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">For purposes of that statute, \u201ceconomic damages\u201d is defined to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">\u201cobjectively verifiable monetary losses including but not limited to reasonable charges necessarily incurred for medical, hospital, nursing and rehabilitative services and other health care services, burial and memorial expenses, loss of income and past * * * impairment of earning capacity, reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for substitute domestic services, recurring loss to an estate, damage to reputation that is economically verifiable, reasonable and necessarily incurred costs due to loss of use of property and reasonable costs incurred for repair or for replacement of damaged property, whichever is less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">ORS 31.710 (2)(a); <em>see </em>ORS 137.103 (providing that, for purposes of ORS 137.106, the term \u201ceconomic damages\u201d has \u201cthe meaning given that term in ORS 31.710, except that \u2018economic damages\u2019 does not include future impairment of earning capacity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">We note that ORS 137.106 was amended in 2013. Or Laws 2013, ch 388, \u00a7 1. Because defendant\u2019s sentencing occurred before the effective date of those amendments, they are inapplicable. Or Laws 2013, ch 388, \u00a7 2. Nevertheless, because the 2013 amendments are immaterial to our analysis, we refer to the current version of the statute for convenience.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
