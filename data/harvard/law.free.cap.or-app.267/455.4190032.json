A few days after a police officer confronted defendant with physical evidence potentially linking him to that disappearance, officers discovered what appeared to be a suicide note written by defendant in which he confessed to having done something that could not be forgiven and indicated where his wife\u2019s body could be found. Defendant was arrested and charged with one count of murder constituting domestic violence, ORS 163.115. At trial, defendant admitted to killing his wife, but asserted that he had accidentally caused her death while defending himself from her attacks. Defendant was tried by a jury and found guilty. He appeals the resulting judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In his first four assignments of error, defendant argues that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements under various exceptions to the hearsay rule. In his fifth assignment of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of no-contact provisions in its judgment. As explained below, we reject the evidentiary arguments that defendant makes in conjunction with his first four assignments of error and, therefore, affirm defendant\u2019s murder conviction. However, we reverse on his fifth assignment of error and remand for entry of a judgment that does not include the challenged no-contact provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Because the jury found defendant guilty, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State v. Clegg, </em>332 Or 432, 434, 31 P3d 408 (2001). Defendant and the victim met through mutual friends and married a few months later in August 2009. The victim worked as a respiratory therapist at a hospital, where her colleagues described her as an excellent employee with high standards who remained calm during medical crises.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">On October 27,2010, defendant had planned to drive from his home in Bend to his ex-wife\u2019s home in Silverton, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>which was approximately two hours away, for their daughter\u2019s birthday. Defendant called and told his ex-wife that he could not make it to Silverton that day because he and the victim had gotten into a fight. He did drive to his ex-wife\u2019s home three days later to attend his daughter\u2019s birthday party. He returned to her home the next day, October 31, to leave a trailer containing motorcycles, guns, and other items for storage.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">At around the same time, defendant told several friends that the victim had left home on October 27 after a fight and had not returned. After learning about the victim\u2019s disappearance, some friends became concerned and tried unsuccessfully to contact her by phone. The victim\u2019s colleagues reported her missing to the police on November 2, when she did not come to work and they were unable to reach her by phone. Bend Police Officer Craig responded to the report from the victim\u2019s colleagues, performed a welfare check at the victim\u2019s residence, and began calling her friends and colleagues. Although defendant had not informed the police that the victim was missing, he agreed to be interviewed on November 2 after police contacted him. In that initial police interview, defendant told a detective that the victim had been drunk on October 27 and had struck his face, leaving a small gash. He also told the detective that he and the victim had gotten into another fight the next night, after which the victim had left home and not returned. Defendant also consented to a search of his home. Police officers left several voicemail messages for defendant after the initial interview, but he did not return the calls for several days.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On November 3, 2010, Bend Detective Tabor drove to defendant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s home in Silverton and, with defendant\u2019s consent, searched the trailer he had left there four days earlier. During his initial search of the trailer, Tabor noticed two stains on the trailer\u2019s floor that he thought could be blood. On November 6,2010, Tabor interviewed defendant about possible sources for any blood in the trailer. Defendant first suggested it could have been \u201cred antifreeze\u201d and later suggested it could have been his blood. After Tabor told defendant that it was a \u201csignificant amount of [recent] blood\u201d that was \u201cconsistent with [the victim\u2019s] blood,\u201d defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>explained that the victim had cut her knee while pulling weeds a few days before she disappeared and must have bled inside the trailer while watching him work on his motorcycles. That same day, defendant participated in a search party that was organized by the victim\u2019s friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">On November 9, 2010, police officers searched defendant\u2019s home for a second time, pursuant to a warrant. Officers noted that a shotgun that had been unloaded during their first search of defendant\u2019s home was now loaded and in a different location. Officers also found what appeared to be a suicide note in the master bedroom nightstand. In that note, which was labeled \u201cMy Log,\u201d defendant wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cWhat I\u2019ve done can\u2019t be forgiven. She pushed me [too] far last week, beating me down mentally and physically. I should have been man enough to walk away, but she just wouldn\u2019t stop. You will find her in the Santiam [River] 6 miles past Marion Forks, down from the big pull out turn around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">\u201c* * * This is not something I planned, I just snapped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">In a section of the note addressed to his children, defendant wrote, \u201cPlease stay away from the alcohol, you\u2019ve seen what it has done to mine and others lives.\u201d Defendant was taken into custody. During a search of his wallet at the police station, officers found receipts dated October 23 and 24, 2010, for the purchase of two shotguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">On November 12, 2010, defendant took police officers to the location described in his note where he claimed he had thrown the victim\u2019s body into the Santiam River. Officers recovered some of the victim\u2019s clothing, but her body was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">A few weeks after his arrest, defendant sent a letter to his cousin Jane, purporting to describe the events on the night leading up to the victim\u2019s death. In that letter, defendant claimed that he went to sleep and that the victim, who was drunk, came into the bedroom, jumped on top of him, forcibly took his wedding ring off his finger, and left the room. Around two hours later, she came back into the room and jumped on top of him again, striking him repeatedly and attempting to suffocate him with a pillow. Then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>defendant explained, he reached up in self-defense and grabbed the victim\u2019s throat with one hand and strangled her to unconsciousness. The victim then regained consciousness and jumped at him \u201cgrowling like an animal,\u201d striking him repeatedly in the head, ribs, and genitals, until he was able to throw her off of him. According to defendant, the altercation ended when the victim \u201chit the corner of the bed, flipped over backward\u201d and died after landing \u201cupside down on her head and []neck.\u201d Defendant related similar versions of events in telephone conversations that he had with Jane while he was in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">After defendant\u2019s letter to Jane was introduced at trial, the state medical examiner testified that she thought it was \u201cunlikely that [defendant] could strangle [the victim into] unconsciousness while she [was] above him\u201d because it would be difficult to obtain the necessary leverage or pressure. The medical examiner also testified that death from a broken neck would require \u201cquite a bit\u201d of force and that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem likely\u201d from defendant\u2019s description of events. She explained that death from a broken neck is typically seen in car crashes or \u201cwhen people have * * * jumped from buildings to commit suicide.\u201d She added that, although \u201canything is possible,\u201d from her experience, the events described in defendant\u2019s letter were \u201cimprobable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The medical examiner also testified that photos taken of defendant\u2019s body on November 2, 2010 \u2014 the day that police officers first interviewed him \u2014 did not reflect the injuries that defendant described in his letter as having occurred on October 27:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201cWell, in reading the letter there was a description of multiple blows by fists and open hands to the face. And [defendant] states that [the victim] concentrated around his ears and the side of his head. So I would expect, given the description that he had of still having ringing in his ears from this event a month later, that there should be contusions or bruises on the side of his face or around his ears.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201cI don\u2019t see any contusions or bruises. I see what appears to be an abrasion, sort of a scratch type abrasion on his left cheek. That wouldn\u2019t come from say a fist or an open hand. So I don\u2019t see any indication of bruising around his head.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The jury also heard evidence about statements that the victim made to friends and colleagues during the several months leading up to her death, in which she described defendant\u2019s violence, her fear of him, her concern about his drinking, and her desire to obtain marital counseling. In closing arguments, the state asserted that defendant intentionally killed the victim, emphasizing the numerous times she had expressed fear about defendant before her death and defendant\u2019s behavior in the days following her disappearance. Defendant, on the other hand, maintained that he had acted in self-defense. He portrayed the victim as a heavy drinker who had been growing increasingly jealous in her relationship with defendant. He argued that the victim had been the aggressor on the night she died and that defendant had panicked in the aftermath when he threw her body in the river and lied to police. The jury found defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In his first four assignments of error on appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred by admitting evidence about the statements the victim made before her death. According to defendant, those statements \u2014 which we describe in detail below \u2014 all were inadmissible hearsay to which no exception to the rule against hearsay applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u201c\u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d OEC 801(3). Generally, hearsay is inadm issible unless it qualifies under an exception or exclusion from that general rule. OEC 802. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling \u201cthat a statement fits within an exception to the hearsay rule,\u201d we will \u201cuphold the trial court\u2019s preliminary factual determinations if any evidence in the record supports them.\u201d <em>State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 537, 135 P3d 260 (2006). We review \u201cthe trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion, as to whether the hearsay statement is admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, to determine if the trial court made an error of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We begin by addressing defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which he challenges the admission of a statement that the victim made to her colleague, Knight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>approximately one day before her death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Knight had worked with the victim for approximately 10 years, and the two worked together on October 26, 2010. At the end of her shift, the victim told Knight, \u201cI hope he is not drunk when I get home,\u201d before she got in her car and drove away. Defendant objected to that part of Knight\u2019s testimony on the ground that the victim\u2019s statement to Knight was inadmissible hearsay. The state argued that Knight\u2019s testimony was admissible under the state-of-mind exception to the rule against hearsay, OEC 803(3), because it showed the \u201cvictim\u2019s state of mind on that date when she left work\u201d and was relevant to defendant\u2019s \u201cclaim of self defense,\u201d as well as defendant\u2019s theory \u201cthat [the victim] was the one with the alcohol problem not Defendant.\u201d The trial court admitted Knight\u2019s testimony. Defendant reiterates his objection to that evidence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">OEC 803(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by [OEC 802, the general rule against hearsay], even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201c(3) A statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation or physical condition, such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain or bodily health, but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of the declarant\u2019s will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The \u201cstate-of-mind\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay admits \u201cstatements of existing mental or emotional condition to prove the mental or emotional condition of the declarant at the time the statements were made.\u201d <em>State v. Richardson, </em>253 Or App 75, 80, 288 P3d 995 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 714 (2013) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and emphasis omitted). \u201c[E]ven if a statement merely reflects the declarant\u2019s state of mind or reasonably supports an inference as to the declarant\u2019s state of mind, it constitutes an assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>of the declarant\u2019s state of mind for purposes of OEC 803(3).\u201d <em>Clegg, </em>332 Or at 441. <em>\u201cA </em>statement of then-existing fear meets the test of OEC 803(3).\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 358, 800 P2d 259 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Although defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of Knight\u2019s testimony, asserting that it was inadmissible hearsay, he develops no argument specific to that evidence. Rather, he argues only generally that Knight\u2019s testimony \u2014 along with the other evidence of the victim\u2019s statements \u2014 was impermissibly \u201coffered to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d because any inference regarding the victim\u2019s state of mind \u201conly arose if the jury accepted the truth of the [victim\u2019s] statements.\u201d Read literally, defendant\u2019s argument would be a <em>non sequitur </em>because, by characterizing the evidence as relating to an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, defendant merely observes that the statement is hearsay that would be inadmissible if not for the existence of OEC 803(3). The argument does not, on its face, explain why that exception to the hearsay rule does not apply. It may be that defendant\u2019s abbreviated argument is meant to reference, instead, one constraint on the extent to which evidence may be admissible under OEC 803(3) \u2014 that a \u201cstatement of memory or belief\u2019 is not admissible \u201cto prove the fact remembered or believed\u201d except in circumstances not relevant here. OEC 803(3). However, Knight\u2019s testimony did not describe any statements by the victim of her memories or beliefs of past events. Rather, she was describing her then-existing state of mind related to her apprehension about going home and what she might encounter there. The evidence was therefore admissible under OEC 803(3), and the trial court did not err when it overruled defendant\u2019s objection to Knight\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>In his third and fourth assignments of error, defendant challenges the admission, over his objections, of two statements that the victim made to Rebecca Brown in March and May 2010.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Brown met the victim through work and the two became close friends, often seeing each other outside of work. In March 2010, the victim called Brown and asked her to come over. Brown testified about the events of that night and what the victim told her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">\u201cA: [The victim] called me that night because we were \u2014 because she was \u2014 or that morning after and said that she was very upset and she wanted me to come over right away. And I came over and she told me that [defendant] actually put his hands around her neck and strangled her and she passed out \u2014 fell against the wall in the bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cQ: How \u2014 what was [the victim\u2019s] demeanor as she was telling you this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201cA: She was very \u2014 very, very scared. She was very upset. She definitely was not herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201cQ: And when you say not herself, what do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\"><em>\u201cA: </em>Well, for one thing she was extremely embarrassed. I think we find sometimes, you know, when things like that happen you just \u2014 you feel mortified. She was very, very sad and frightened \u2014 just frightened. I remember that. She was very afraid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">\u00ab:}; if; <em>% </em>:{; \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">\u201cA: I was very concerned. The reason she didn\u2019t report the incident as far as I know, as far as what she told me was that she was concerned about separating the Defendant from his children. She had very much had a lot of concern for his kids. ***\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Rebecca Brown also testified about a night in May 2010, when the victim called her and asked her to come over.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">\u201cQ: Was there a later time when she contacted you again when something had happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u201cA: Yes. In May she called me. It [w]as about 10:00 [or] 10:30 at night. She says you have got to come. I called the police. And so I went right over. And she was really upset. She had called the police and [defendant] was asked to leave and he left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">\u201cQ: When you say that [the victim] was upset can I have you describe what your observation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201cA: She was shaky. She was shaky. She was crying. She was \u2014 her hand was swollen. I believe it was her right hand, her thumb area. She did not seem like herself. She wanted me to stay. She felt even more frightened this time than she did the last.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cQ: And when you say she didn\u2019t seem like herself what was different?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cA: Just not in control of her situation. In other words, just wanting me to stay, needing comfort, needing \u2014 *** she agreed to have the locks changed on the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">\u201cQ: Did you personally observe the locks get changed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">\u201cA: Yes. Yes, I was there. That night she asked me to stay with her I stayed with her all night and held her hand. She was that afraid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201cQ: Did \u2014 to your knowledge after that incident did [the victim] and the Defendant reconcile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">\u201cA: Yes. They did reconcile. She did change the locks. And I believe they were separated for maybe six days, seven days. I don\u2019t know. But she did reconcile. And at that time she wasn\u2019t returning my calls because I needed to know if she was all right. And she didn\u2019t return my calls. And then she finally said yes, we did. We are going to get counseling, I think.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">Defendant objected, arguing that Rebecca Brown\u2019s testimony was inadmissible as \u201cprior bad act evidence\u201d and inadmissible hearsay. The state responded that the testimony was relevant under OEC 404 because defendant \u201copened that door when [he] filed the notice of self defense.\u201d The state also argued that the evidence should be admitted under the state-of-mind hearsay exception, OEC 803(3), and under the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d hearsay exception, OEC 803(2). The trial court agreed that the testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>admissible. Looking first at relevance, the trial court determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">\u201cwith regard to relevance, I think it is relevant under the [analysis in <em>State v. </em>Johns, 301 Or 535, 725 P2d 312 (1986),] under [OEC] 404. And I think it is relevant [under OEC 404] because of the self defense issue in the case. I think it is relevant to show absence of mistake, absence of accident and to rebut the self defense issue raised by the Defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The trial court then examined the hearsay objection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cWith regard to the hearsay issue I find that under [OEC] 803(3), *** I find that it is admissible as state of mind. And I think part of it would be admissible under the excited utterance exception \u2014 not all of it. Part of it would be. But I think in balance all of it would be admissible under [OEC] 803(3) exception for state of mind as discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Brown[, </em>310 Or 347].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Defendant renews his objections on appeal, contending that the testimony was hearsay, not admissible under the state-of-mind exception, and that the testimony constituted prior bad acts evidence inadmissible under OEC 404(3). The state responds that the victim\u2019s March 2010 statement to Rebecca Brown was admissible under the excited utterance exception and that both the March and May 2010 statements to Brown were admissible under the state-of-mind exception. The state also argues that the trial court correctly rejected defendant\u2019s \u201ccomplaint that the victim\u2019s hearsay descriptions of his previously strangling her portrayed him in a bad light, or constituted \u2018propensity\u2019 evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">We first address whether the trial court correctly determined that the victim\u2019s statements to Rebecca Brown were admissible under OEC 404(3), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Under that rule, evidence of uncharged misconduct by the defendant in a criminal case is not admissible to prove that the defendant has a criminal character or a propensity to engage in criminal behavior. Rather, the admissibility of uncharged misconduct must be based on its relevance to a contested fact that is material to the issues at trial. <em>State v. Pitt, </em>352 Or 566, 575-76, 293 P3d 1002 (2012). Thus, when\u2014 as here \u2014 a defendant has admitted the <em>actus reus, </em>but contends that he did not act with a culpable mental state, evidence of prior bad acts may be admissible to counter that argument by, for example, showing the absence of mistake or accident, or that the defendant acted with intent. OEC 404(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">On appeal, the state argues that those principles established the relevance of evidence that defendant previously had strangled the victim deliberately because that evidence tended to undermine his account that he had only accidentally strangled the victim on the night she died. In arguing to the contrary, defendant simply asserts that the evidence does nothing more than characterize him as somebody with a propensity toward aggressiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We agree with the state that the evidence that defendant had strangled the victim on at least one previous occasion was relevant, under OEC 404(3), to establish his culpable mental state. A defendant\u2019s prior hostile acts towards a homicide victim have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201cspecial relevance to the issue of a hostile motive, which in turn is probative of intent. Evidence that shows a hostile relationship existed between a defendant and his victim tends to shed light on a defendant\u2019s <em>mens rea. </em>The state had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s acts were intentional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\u201c[The Supreme Court], noted in <em>State v. Johns </em>that \u00a3[i]ntent or state of mind is often the most difficult element of a crime to prove because many crimes are unwitnessed and even if a witness is present, the witness can only surmise the actor\u2019s state of mind. *** [Tjherefore courts very liberally admit prior crime evidence to prove <em>mens rea! </em>301 Or at 551.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\"><em>State v. Moen, </em>309 Or 45, 68-69, 786 P2d 111 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Nonetheless, courts must take care to distinguish between evidence that actually is probative of a defendant\u2019s mental state and that which does nothing more than tend to establish a defendant\u2019s propensity for engaging in criminal conduct. In <em>Johns, </em>the Supreme Court identified factors that a court should consider in making that determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">\u201c(1) Does the present charged act require proof of intent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">\u201c(2) Did the prior act require intent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201c(3) Was the victim in the prior act the same victim or in the same class as the victim in the present case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201c(4) Was the type of prior act the same or similar to the acts involved in the charged crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201c(5) Were the physical elements of the prior act and the present act similar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201c(6) If these criteria are met, is the probative value of the prior act evidence substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues or misleading the jury, undue delay or presentation of cumulative evidence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">301 Or at 555-56. Under OEC 404(4), however, the final factor \u201cis evaluated only when constitutionally required.\u201d <em>State v. Olson, </em>263 Or App 246, 248, 328 P3d 704, <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 400 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\"><em>Johns, </em>like this case, arose after a man killed his wife and was charged with murder. The <em>Johns </em>defendant admitted that he had shot his wife, resulting in her death, but claimed that the killing was accidental. 301 Or at 537-38. To disprove that claim, the state introduced evidence that the defendant had assaulted his ex-wife with a gun, attempting to shoot her, about six years earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 540-41. After considering the factors identified above, the Supreme Court held that the trial court did not err by admitting evidence of the earlier assault as relevant to prove the defendant\u2019s intent. <em>Id. </em>at 556-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\"><em>Johns </em>controls the outcome of the OEC 404(3) analysis in this case. Here, Rebecca Brown\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s prior strangulation of the victim gave rise to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>particularly strong inference about defendant\u2019s mental state when he strangled the victim on the night she died, precisely because the acts of strangulation were so similar. In March 2010, as on the night the victim died (as described by defendant), defendant strangled the victim with his hands, to the point of unconsciousness, in their bedroom. Put in terms of the first five <em>Johns </em>factors, the present charged act required proof of intent, the past acts were intentional (according to the victim\u2019s descriptions), the same victim was involved on each occasion, the acts involved were extremely similar, and so were their \u201cphysical elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555-56.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant\u2019s OEC 404(3) objections to Rebecca Brown\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">We next address defendant\u2019s contention that, even if relevant under OEC 404(3), the victim\u2019s statements to Rebecca Brown were inadmissible hearsay. Brown recalled that, in May 2010, the victim called her late one night. \u201cShe says you have got to come. I called the police. And so I went right over. And she was really upset. She had called the police and [defendant] was asked to leave and he left.\u201d Although the victim\u2019s statements to Brown were not <em>direct </em>commentary on her \u201cstate of mind, emotion, sensation or physical condition,\u201d as described in OEC 803(3), they do support an inference that the victim feared defendant and did not wish to be alone with him at their home. That permissible inference regarding the victim\u2019s state of mind is sufficient to bring the statements within the scope of the OEC 803(3) hearsay exception. <em>Clegg, </em>332 Or at 441. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in allowing in Brown\u2019s testimony about her May 2010 conversation with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We turn to Rebecca Brown\u2019s testimony about events that occurred one day in March 2010. She related that the victim</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201ccalled me that night because we were \u2014 because she was\u2014 or that morning after and said that she was very upset and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>she wanted me to come over right away. And I came over and she told me that [defendant] actually put his hands around her neck and strangled her and she passed out \u2014 fell against the wall in the bedroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Brown testified that the victim was \u201cvery, very scared\u201d when Brown arrived at her house. Her neck was bruised and she \u201chad a tough time swallowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The victim\u2019s March 2010 statement that defendant had \u201cput his hands around her neck and strangled her\u201d does not qualify under the OEC 803(3) state-of-mind exception to the general rule against hearsay. As explained above, that exception does not apply to statements \u201cof memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\u201d OEC 803(3). In her March 2010 statement, the victim described her recollection of a past event \u2014 the strangulation. Accordingly, Rebecca Brown\u2019s testimony about that statement was not admissible under OEC 803(3). The trial court\u2019s contrary conclusion was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">That error does not present a basis for reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction, however, because the trial court also concluded that some of Rebecca Brown\u2019s testimony about the victim\u2019s statements was admissible under the OEC 803(2) excited utterance exception. In context, it is clear that that aspect of the trial court\u2019s ruling referred to Brown\u2019s testimony about the victim\u2019s March 2010 statement, as only that statement described a specific \u201cstartling event or condition\u201d that was fresh in the victim\u2019s mind. OEC 803(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by [OEC 802, the general rule against hearsay], even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">* * $ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">\u201c(2) A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">In <em>State v. Carlson, </em>311 Or 201, 215-16, 808 P2d 1002 (1991), the Supreme Court discussed the excited utterance exception and explained that, for statements to fall within its scope, the trial court must conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that three elements are satisfied: (1) a startling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>event or condition must have occurred; (2) the statement must have been made while the declarant was under the stress of the excitement caused by the event or condition; and (3) the statement must relate to the startling event or condition. <em>See also State v. Underwood, </em>266 Or App 274, 277-81, 337 P3d 969 (2014) (discussing requirements of excited-utterance exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The victim\u2019s statements to Rebecca Brown in March 2010 meet that test. First, being strangled to the point of unconsciousness is a startling event. Second, the evidence amply supports the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the victim described that event to Brown when she still was under the stress caused by having been strangled. The victim called Brown within hours of that event, asking her to come over \u201cright away.\u201d She still was suffering physical effects of having been strangled, in that she had difficulty swallowing. Brown characterized her as \u201cvery, very scared,\u201d frightened, mortified, and \u201cvery, very sad.\u201d Those facts are sufficient to establish that the victim spoke to Brown when she still was under the stress caused by having been strangled. Finally, the victim\u2019s statements to Brown related directly to that event. We conclude that Rebecca Brown\u2019s testimony about the victim\u2019s March 2010 statements was admissible under OEC 803(2) and, accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Defendant\u2019s final evidentiary argument, presented in conjunction with his first assignment of error, is that the trial court erred by admitting statements that the victim made to Jeffrey Brown in October 2010. Jeffrey Brown and the victim were colleagues and had known each other for 19 years. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">\u201cA: Well, the last time I spoke with [the victim] at work she told me that [defendant], her husband, had tried to strangle her. She was frightened. I asked her if she called the police. And she said he asked me not to because he feels that it would inhibit his ability to buy guns. And I said why would you want someone like this to have guns? She says, too late, he has already got two. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201cQ: And could you describe [the victim\u2019s] demeanor at the time she is confiding in you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">\u201cA: She was nervous and she was frightened. And how I could visualize that, as well as the tone of her .voice was that she was biting her lip as she was speaking of this. And I have always known [the victim] in moments of tension, stress, that she would bite her lip. And so I knew that she was serious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u201cQ: At that moment what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cA: I told her that she probably ought to leave. And that if she didn\u2019t, she definitely needs counseling. And she said she didn\u2019t think it would do any good because of the way he drinks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Defendant objected to that testimony, contending that it was inadmissible hearsay and unreliable. The state argued that the testimony was admissible under the state-of-mind exception, OEC 803(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court agreed with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">On appeal, defendant argues that the testimony was hearsay, inadmissible under the state-of-mind exception in OEC 803(3) and inadmissible as prior bad acts evidence under OEC 404(3). Defendant also argues that admission of the evidence was not harmless. The state argues that the trial court correctly admitted the testimony under the state-of-mind exception, OEC 803(3). Alternatively, the state urges us to affirm the trial court\u2019s admission of the testimony pursuant to the excited utterance exception, under the \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d doctrine. <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001). The state also argues that the testimony was not inadmissible evidence of prior bad acts under OEC 404(3). Finally, the state contends that any error in admitting the testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">We need not determine whether the trial court erred in admitting Jeffrey Brown\u2019s testimony about his conversation with the victim because we conclude that any error in that regard was harmless. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 77 P3d 1111 (2003), frames the proper inquiry. In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court determined that, under Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">\u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error consists of a single inquiry: Is there little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict? The correct focus of the inquiry regarding affirmance despite error is on the possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as a fact-finder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial and compelling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">336 Or at 32. Further, in <em>Davis, </em>the court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201ca variety of considerations may properly inform that \u2018single inquiry,\u2019 including \u2018the nature of the error that occurred below,\u2019 <em>[Davis, </em>336 Or at 32], and the \u2018context of the legal error.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 33. The court noted, for example, that the erroneous exclusion or admission of evidence would be harmless \u2018if the particular issue to which the error pertains has no relationship to the jury\u2019s determination of its verdict,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 32, or if the jury \u2018would have regarded the * * * evidence as duplicative or unhelpful to its deliberations.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 33. Ultimately, the Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>concluded that the erroneous exclusion was not harmless, because it could not \u2018say that the excluded statements were merely cumulative of admitted evidence \u2014 and, indeed, \u2018were qualitatively different than the evidence that the jury heard\u2019 \u2014 -and because \u2018the excluded evidence goes directly to the heart of defendant\u2019s factual theory of the case.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 34.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-7\"><em>State v. Perkins, </em>221 Or App 136, 143, 188 P3d 482 (2008) (omission in <em>Perkins).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The same harmless error analysis applies when we analyze the effect of a trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of evidence. <em>State v. Maiden, </em>222 Or App 9, 13, 191 P3d 803 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 618 (2009). Thus, erroneous admission of evidence that is \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d of other admitted evidence and not \u201cqualitatively different\u201d than other admitted evidence generally is harmless. <em>See Davis, </em>336 Or at 34; <em>Maiden, </em>222 Or App at 13 (assessing, among other things, \u201cthe nature of erroneously admitted evidence in the context of other evidence on the same issue\u201d). Here, the jury heard the same details contained in Jeffrey Brown\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>testimony \u2014 an instance of strangulation, the victim\u2019s fear of defendant, defendant\u2019s possession of guns, defendant\u2019s drinking, and the victim\u2019s desire to pursue marital counseling \u2014 from other witnesses. In addition to the properly admitted evidence discussed earlier in this opinion, three other witnesses \u2014 including one called by defendant\u2014 testified at trial about their interactions with the victim in the days and months leading up to her death. Defendant does not assign error on appeal to the admission of any of that testimony, which we describe below.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Defendant\u2019s own witness, Hind-Bachofer, testified that she and the victim worked together for over 15 years and were friends outside of work. Hind-Bachofer testified that, sometime between six months and one year before the victim\u2019s death, the victim came to Hind-Bachofer\u2019s house and told her that defendant \u201chad choked her to the point of unconsciousness.\u201d The victim spent the night at HindBachofer\u2019s house because \u201c[w]e were concerned for her safety.\u201d Hind-Bachofer did not recall seeing any physical marks on the victim, but also testified that she had not been looking for them. Hind-Bachofer also testified that the victim would occasionally discuss her marriage at work. She recalled that \u201cthe primary thing [the victim] complained about was that [defendant] did not have full-time work and when he did have part-time work he would send the money to his [ex-] wife and kids and did not contribute to their household at all * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The second of those witnesses, Fletcher, worked with the victim for 10 years and became \u201creally good\u201d friends with her. Fletcher testified that, about four weeks before the victim\u2019s death, the victim had discussed wanting to see a marriage counselor. The victim was concerned about \u201cgoing home and finding, you know, [defendant] had been drinking and leading to fights.\u201d Fletcher recalled that the victim had told her their fights were \u201cusually over drinking or money.\u201d Fletcher thought that the victim \u201cdidn\u2019t want to go home\u201d to a \u201cbad situation at home with [defendant] being there and being * * * drunk by the time she got home from work.\u201d The victim discussed that topic with Fletcher every time they saw each other at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>On the evening of October 24, Fletcher and another colleague from work went over to the victim and defendant\u2019s home. Fletcher recalled that defendant was drunk. \u201cHe was stumbling his words. He had even fallen over \u2014 kind of tripped or something. Just wasn\u2019t himself.\u201d Fletcher explained that she socialized with defendant approximately four times a month and that, on October 24, he was \u201cjust different\u201d and \u201cverbally outspoken.\u201d At one point in the evening, defendant brought out a shotgun, which he had recently purchased, to show his guests. Fletcher decided to leave after around an hour and a half because she \u201cjust didn\u2019t like how the situation was going.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The third witness, Johnson, also had worked with the victim for many years, but they hardly socialized outside of work. The victim and defendant attended a going-away party for Johnson in July 2010, as he prepared to move from Bend to Prineville. Johnson testified that, at the end of the party, the victim pulled Johnson aside and asked him if he would accompany the victim and defendant home. Johnson explained that the victim felt that defendant was \u201cescalating\u201d and \u201cshe wanted somebody else there.\u201d Johnson went home with them and sat on the back deck talking with defendant for around 45 minutes. At that point, they found that the victim \u201chad passed out on the lawn.\u201d Johnson helped defendant get the victim to bed and went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In sum, two witnesses other than Jeffrey Brown\u2014 Rebecca Brown and Hind-Bachofer \u2014 described instances of defendant strangling the victim to unconsciousness. In testifying that the victim had described being choked until she passed out, their testimony was far more dramatic than Jeffrey Brown\u2019s unelaborated testimony that the victim told him that defendant \u201chad tried to strangle her.\u201d Thus, Jeffrey Brown\u2019s testimony was \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d on that point and added nothing \u201cqualitatively different\u201d to the record. <em>See Davis, </em>336 Or at 34 (describing when evidentiary error is harmless); <em>Maiden, </em>222 Or App at 13 (in assessing whether erroneous admission of evidence was harmless, court considers \u201cany differences between the quality of the erroneously admitted evidence and other evidence admitted on the same issue\u201d). With respect to other aspects of Jeffrey Brown\u2019s testimony, even more witnesses provided testimony that made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>his \u201cmerely cumulative.\u201d Five witnesses described the victim as being afraid of defendant or being apprehensive about going home, one witness described defendant\u2019s possession of guns (and store receipts also established that defendant had purchased two guns shortly before the victim\u2019s disappearance), one witness described the victim\u2019s interest in pursuing marital counseling, and three witnesses, plus defendant\u2019s own \u201clog,\u201d discussed defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption. In light of the other evidence admitted, we conclude that the challenged aspects of Jeffrey Brown\u2019s testimony were merely duplicative or cumulative of that other, more compelling evidence in the record. Because there is little likelihood that the admission of Jeffrey Brown\u2019s testimony affected the jury\u2019s verdict, any error associated with its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In his fifth assignment of error, defendant challenges a provision of the judgment that orders him to \u201chave no contact with\u201d two specific individuals or any members of their families, apparently including during his term of incarceration. The state acknowledges that the court lacked authority to impose that requirement. We accept the concession. <em>See State v. Langmayer, </em>239 Or App 600, 601, 244 P3d 894 (2010) (\u201c[A] court does not have authority to impose a condition of incarceration.\u201d); <em>State v. Reed, </em>235 Or App 470, 475-76, 237 P3d 826 (2010) (trial court erred by imposing a \u201cno contact\u201d condition of post-prison supervision in the judgment of conviction). We also agree with the state\u2019s assertion that the error can be remedied through entry of a corrected judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Remanded for entry of a corrected judgment omitting the challenged \u201cno contact\u201d provision; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\"> However, when we are assessing the harmlessness of evidentiary error, we look at all pertinent evidence. <em>See State v. Cunningham, </em>179 Or App 359, 361 n 2, 40 P3d 1065 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>337 Or 528, 99 P3d 271 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\"> At the direction of the trial court, each of the evidentiary rulings was made after a formal offer of proof outside the presence of jurors. The content of trial testimony was largely consistent with the offer-of-proof testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-5\"> Except as it relates to his \u201cprior bad acts\u201d argument, defendant did not object to Knight\u2019s testimony (or to other evidence of the victim\u2019s statements) on the ground that the evidence was not relevant because it had no \u201ctendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d OEC 401. Rather, he confined his objections to the applicability of OEC 803 exceptions to the hearsay rule and he similarly limits his argument on appeal. Accordingly, we do not discuss in detail the theories of relevance that the state urged when it offered the evidence at trial except as they relate to defendant\u2019s \u201cprior bad acts\u201d arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-15\"> As discussed later in this opinion, another trial witness also had the last name of \u201cBrown.\u201d To avoid confusion, we sometimes refer to Rebecca Brown and to that other witness using both their first and last names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> As noted, the sixth <em>Johns </em>factor \u2014 whether \u201cthe probative value of the prior act evidence [is] substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues or misleading the jury, undue delay or presentation of cumulative evidence,\u201d 301 Or at 556 \u2014 \u201cis evaluated only when constitutionally required.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>263 Or App at 248.
