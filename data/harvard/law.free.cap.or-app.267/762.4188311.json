J.</author>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for first-degree burglary, ORS 164.225, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal. He argues that the state failed to prove that he was not licensed or privileged to be in the victim\u2019s apartment at the time that he stole her purse and that the state did not prove that defendant had lost his license or privilege to remain in the victim\u2019s apartment. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational factfinder could find that the state had proved every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994). We conclude that defendant exceeded the express limits of the license to be in the victim\u2019s apartment, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The facts are undisputed. The victim, who has a physical disability, was sitting outside of her apartment visiting with a friend. She learned \u201cthat [defendant] was helping the neighbor across from [her] move furniture and stuff.\u201d She had never seen defendant before. The neighbor left for an hour or two while defendant stayed behind. He lingered between the victim\u2019s and the neighbor\u2019s apartments and eventually asked if he could use the victim\u2019s bathroom. Believing that defendant was her neighbor\u2019s friend, the victim said, \u201cYes, you can go,\u201d and she told defendant where to find the bathroom. Defendant entered the victim\u2019s two-bedroom apartment while she continued sitting outside, next to her front door, speaking with her friend. After talking for a while, the victim realized that it was \u201ctaking [defendant] a long time\u201d and \u201cgot kind of worried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">To get to the bathroom, a person would enter the apartment through the front door, take two small steps to the left, \u201cgo right down the hallway,\u201d and go into the bathroom on the right. The door to the bathroom was removed so that the victim could easily access the facilities. Her bed and nightstand, which were in the front room of her apartment, were visible from the front entryway. A wall separated the bathroom from the area where her bed and nightstand were located. The victim did not hear the toilet flush, and she believed that she would have been able to hear a flush <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>because the front door had remained open while defendant was in the apartment. She expected that defendant would only be present in her apartment for the purpose of using the bathroom. She estimated that defendant had been inside of her apartment by himself for approximately 20 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Shortly thereafter, defendant emerged from the apartment and sat on some steps nearby. The victim saw defendant putting something into his backpack. When the victim asked defendant about his plans, he said that he would not wait for the neighbor to return home. He began heading across the parking lot. The victim went inside her apartment to discover that her purse was missing from the nightstand next to her bed. A stack of videocassette tapes had been moved from a stand by the television in her bedroom area to underneath a bench in her shower. She notified the police and provided a list of missing things, including money and bus tickets. The following day, the neighbor\u2019s boyfriend returned the purse to the victim, but many of its contents were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Defendant was charged with first-degree burglary, ORS 164.225, among several other counts that are not relevant to the issue on appeal. The offense of first-degree burglary, as it was charged here, requires that a person commit second-degree burglary, ORS 164.215, and that the building the person enter be a dwelling. ORS 164.225(1). A person commits second-degree burglary \u201cif the person enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d ORS 164.215. To \u201center or remain unlawfully\u201d in the context of this case means \u201c[t]o enter or remain in or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public or when the entrant is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u201d ORS 164.205(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. He argued that he had permission to be present in the victim\u2019s apartment and, to revoke that permission, \u201cthere has to be some notice given to the person who\u2019s invited into the home.\u201d No such notice was given to him, either expressly or impliedly, and, he added, merely committing a crime in a place where he was permitted to be could not convert that activity to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>burglary. Without waiting for the state\u2019s response, the trial court rejoined, \u201c[W]hen you commit the crime in the house, you revoke any permission you were given to be there.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied defendant\u2019s motion. During the state\u2019s closing argument the state addressed the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-4\">\u201cAnd so I\u2019m not going to say or argue to you that every single time a person decides they want to commit a crime in somebody\u2019s house that that elevates what\u2019s otherwise a consensual entry into a burglary. But you have to think about the details and the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">\u201cThe definition of unlawful entry or remain talks about a person who is not licensed or privileged. *** [W]hen you say, \u2018You can use the bathroom,\u2019 and they don\u2019t do that, but they go into your bedroom, is that beyond the scope of consent? Of course it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-6\">\u201cNobody would feel like, \u2018If I let somebody go into my apartment because they asked to use the bathroom, it\u2019s okay for them to root around in my bedroom and steal my purse.\u2019 That\u2019s beyond the license of privilege the defendant had, and he knew it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Defendant was convicted on a count of first-degree burglary, corresponding to the count for his conduct at the victim\u2019s apartment, in addition to other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">On appeal, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling, arguing that defendant did not lose his license or privilege to be in the victim\u2019s apartment by subsequently forming the intent to commit a crime therein. Defendant contends that \u201cto prove the trespass aspect of burglary, the state must establish that the defendant lacked a license or privilege to enter or remain on the premises, and the defendant\u2019s knowledge thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state responds that defendant had a limited license or privilege to be in the victim\u2019s apartment, that defendant exceeded the scope of that license by entering and remaining in the victim\u2019s bedroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>area, and therefore, that he was unlawfully present in the victim\u2019s apartment when he stole her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Our review begins with the elements of the crime charged. \u201c [B]urglary as defined by ORS 164.225 is accomplished if a person (1) enters or remains unlawfully, (2) in a dwelling, (3) with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d <em>State v. Andre, </em>142 Or App 285, 289-90, 920 P2d 1145, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 229 (1996). In <em>State v. Holte, </em>170 Or App 377, 12 P3d 553 (2000), we addressed a similar argument regarding oral limitations to a license or privilege to remain in a dwelling. The defendant rented a room in the victim\u2019s house under the condition that he stay out of the victim\u2019s bedroom. <em>Id. </em>at 379. Within a few months, however, the defendant entered the victim\u2019s bedroom and stole \u201ca significant amount of money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. At trial, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that there was no unlawful entry. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. On appeal, we affirmed, explaining that the defendant had received consent to enter and remain in some parts of the victim\u2019s house, but that the defendant did not have consent to enter the victim\u2019s bedroom. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">\u201cTo enter or remain unlawfully under the burglary statutes requires proof of an unprivileged or unlicensed entry or stay. Defendant\u2019s right to be in the house was conditioned on the requirement that he not enter [the victim\u2019s] bedroom. Thus, a rational jury could have found that, once defendant entered [the victim\u2019s] bedroom in violation of the oral rental agreement, he no longer was licensed or privileged to remain in the house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">In this case, there is a similar express limitation on the license or privilege afforded to defendant. Defendant himself limited the scope of his license or privilege to be in the victim\u2019s apartment by asking the victim to use her bathroom. In response, the victim said that defendant \u201ccan go\u201d and gave explicit instructions for him to find the bathroom in her apartment. The victim did not know defendant personally and expected that defendant would only be present in her apartment to use the bathroom. From those facts, reasonable inferences can be drawn that defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>no license or privilege to wander elsewhere in the victim\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">The record reflects that defendant exceeded the scope of his limited license. The victim\u2019s purse was located in an area of the victim\u2019s apartment that was used as a bedroom. That bedroom area was not connected to the bathroom, and a wall separated the hallway where the bathroom was located from the bedroom area. At some point during a 20-minute period, defendant entered the bedroom area, took the victim\u2019s purse, and displaced videocassette tapes from her television stand by moving them to her shower. Viewed in the light most favorable to the state, the record contains \u201cproof of an unlicensed or unprivileged * * * stay.\u201d <em>State v. Felt, </em>108 Or App 730, 733, 816 P2d 1213 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>313 Or 75 (1992). A rational jury could have found that defendant had no license or privilege to enter or remain in the victim\u2019s bedroom, the area in which he committed the theft. The trial court did not err by allowing the jury to determine that, by entering in the victim\u2019s bedroom area with the intent to commit a theft, defendant was guilty of first-degree burglary. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-9\"> We do not consider the trial court\u2019s rationale, because, as we will explain, the facts provide a different basis upon which to deny the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b787-10\"> Defendant acknowledges that \u201can invitation may expressly limit the areas to which the invitation applies\u201d and that permission to remain in a dwelling may be revoked, thereby turning a defendant\u2019s presence inside a dwelling into a criminal trespass.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
