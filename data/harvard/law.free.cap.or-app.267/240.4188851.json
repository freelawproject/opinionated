Petitioner asserts that DHS improperly amended OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B)(viii) and OAR 461-135-0835(l)(e)(B)(iii) (the challenged rules)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to expand Oregon\u2019s Medicaid \u201cestate recovery\u201d provisions to encompass assets owned by a Medicaid recipient at the time of the recipient\u2019s death, in addition to assets that the recipient conveyed to the recipient\u2019s spouse or others within five years of the date of the Medicaid application or anytime thereafter. We agree with petitioner and hold invalid the text added to OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B)(viii) and OAR 461-135-0835(l)(e)(B)(iii) by the 2008 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We consider facial challenges to agency rules, such as the challenge by petitioner in this case, as allowed by ORS 183.400. The scope of our judicial review \u201cis limited. [We] examine[] the challenged rules only to determine whether those rules on their face comply with applicable constitutional and statutory requirements.\u201d <em>Oregon Newspaper Publishers v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>329 Or 115, 118, 988 P2d 359 (1999). In examining the challenged rules\u2019 facial validity, we are limited to consideration of the rule itself, statutory provisions authorizing the rule, and documents dealing with rulemaking procedures. \u201cWe may declare a rule invalid only if, based on those sources, * * * the rule violates a constitutional provision, exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority, or was adopted without compliance with applicable rulemaking procedures.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>259 Or App 554, 556, 314 P3d 994 (2013); ORS 183.400(3), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Petitioner does not challenge DHS\u2019s compliance with rulemaking procedures. Petitioner does, however, assert that the amendments to the challenged rules are unconstitutional and also exceed DHS\u2019s statutory authority. Thus, we may consider only the challenged rules and the federal and state statutory provisions authorizing those rules. Further, we may declare the rules invalid only if, based on those sources, we conclude that those rules violate a constitutional provision or exceed the agency\u2019s statutory authority. ORS 183.400(3), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">On review, petitioner argues that DHS \u201cexceeded its statutory authority\u201d under both federal and state law\u2014 specifically, 42 USC section 1396p(b)(4)(B), ORS 416.350(6), and ORS 411.060 \u2014 and violated the Supremacy Clause of Article VII of the United States Constitution when it amended OAR 461-135-0832 and OAR 461-135-0835. Petitioner\u2019s precise argument is that OAR 461-135-0832 and OAR 461-135-0835, as amended in 2008, exceed the scope of both federal and state law, because the challenged amendments purport to allow DHS to engage in estate recovery from assets in which the deceased Medicaid recipient had no legal interest at the time of his or her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">DHS responds that the challenged amendments are consistent with both federal and state law, contending that petitioner\u2019s construction of the federal and state statutes is impermissibly narrow, and that statutory context and the expressed legislative policy (by both Congress and the Oregon legislature) \u201cfavors estate recovery and disfavors the use of property transfers to avoid recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Because it is helpful to understanding the parties\u2019 arguments, we begin by providing a brief explanation of the applicable federal and state law and delimiting the scope of those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">A. <em>Medicaid law, generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Subchapter XIX of the federal Social Security Act, 42 USC \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq., </em>established the Medicaid program \u201cfor the purpose of providing federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>treatment for needy persons. Although participation in the Medicaid program is entirely optional, once a State elects to participate, it must comply with the requirements of [sub-chapter] XIX.\u201d <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 US 297, 301, 100 S Ct 2671, 65 L Ed 2d 784 (1980); 42 CFR \u00a7 430.0. Although the Medicaid program is jointly financed by the federal and state governments, each state administers its own program. 42 USC \u00a7 1396; 42 CFR \u00a7 430.0. In the course of that administration, each state creates its own \u201cstate plan.\u201d 42 USC \u00a7 1396a; 42 CFR \u00a7 430.10. DHS is the administrative agency designated to administer Oregon\u2019s state plan. ORS 411.060.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">As noted, Oregon\u2019s state plan must comply with federal requirements. <em>Harris, </em>448 US at 301; <em>see generally </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396a(a), (b); 42 CFR \u00a7 430.10; 42 CFR \u00a7 430.12(b)(l)(i). One of those federal requirements is that the \u201c[s]tate plan for medical assistance must *** comply with\u201d the federal \u201cestate recovery\u201d provisions, namely 42 USC section 1396p, which relates to liens, adjustments and recoveries of medical assistance correctly paid, transfers of assets, and treatment of certain trusts. <em>See </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396a(a)(18).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">B. <em>Establishing medicaid eligibility: spousal impoverishment and the community spouse resource allowance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">States with a participating Medicaid program must \u201cprovide financial assistance to the \u2018categorically needy\u2019\u201d\u2014 which, generally, includes \u201caged, blind, and disabled [individuals] eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program\u201d \u2014 and \u201cpermits a State to extend Medicaid benefits to other needy persons, termed \u2018medically needy.\u2019\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>Harris, </em>448 US at 301, 301 n 1; <em>see </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A), (C). \u201cMedically needy\u201d persons, who \u201clack[] the ability to pay for medical expenses, but [have] incomes too large to qualify for categorical assistance [,]\u201d can obtain benefits (if available from the state) if they meet specified income and resource requirements. <em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, </em>453 US 34, 37, 101 S Ct 2633, 69 L Ed 2d 460 (1981); 42 USC \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(C). To become eligible for Medicaid, \u201cmedically needy\u201d individuals (the applicant or institutionalized spouse) who have resources exceeding the resource thresholds must \u201cspend down\u201d their resources to reach the required resource levels. 42 USC \u00a7 1396a(a)(17).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">However, there are limits and exclusions on what assets are \u201cavailable\u201d to pay for the applicant\u2019s medical care. 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(d), (f)(2). For both single and married applicants, the home, a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of household goods and personal effects, one automobile, and, with certain limitations, a burial space or agreement are <em>excluded </em>assets that are not included in the eligibility-related resource calculation. 42 USC \u00a7 1382b(a)(1), (2); 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(5) (clarifying that, for purposes of eligibility determination, \u201cthe term \u2018resources\u2019 does not include * * * resources excluded under [42 USC \u00a7 1382b(a)]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The provisions challenged by petitioner generally concern transfers between a married applicant and his or her spouse. Thus, we focus on the eligibility requirements for married individuals. Generally, to determine whether a married applicant\u2019s assets exceed the income and resource thresholds, federal law requires that the assets of both the applicant and his or her spouse (the community spouse or well spouse) be considered available to the applicant to pay for the applicant\u2019s care, 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(c), subject to the aforementioned exclusions, 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(d), (f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Federal law also allows some other exceptions to that general rule. The purpose of those exceptions is to prevent \u201cspousal impoverishment.\u201d That is, federal law aims to \u201cend th[e] pauperization [of community spouses] by assuring that the community spouse has a sufficient \u2014 but not excessive \u2014 amount of income and resources available [for his or her use] while [his or] her spouse is in a nursing home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>at Medicaid expense.\u201d HR Rep No 100-105(11), 100th Cong, 1st Sess, <em>reprinted in </em>1988 USCCAN 857, 888 (relating to spousal impoverishment provisions created by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, Pub L 100-360, Title III, \u00a7 303, which amended 42 USC sections 1396p and 1396r-5). To achieve that end, the community spouse is allowed to shelter or \u201creserve certain income and assets to meet the minimum monthly maintenance needs he or she will have when the [institutionalized] spouse *** becomes eligible for Medicaid.\u201d <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. v. Blumer, </em>534 US 473, 478, 122 S Ct 962, 151 L Ed 2d 935 (2002). Those sheltered assets are referred to as the Community Spouse Resource Allowance (CSRA). 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(1), (2). In other words, the CSRA calculation protects a standard amount of assets from the \u201cspend down.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Despite the general rule prohibiting applicants\u2014 or their spouses \u2014 from transferring assets for less than fair market value in order to qualify for Medicaid, 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(c)(l)(A), (c)(2), federal law expressly permits the applicant to transfer the CSRA amount to the community spouse. Indeed, federal law specifically requires that, once a previously over-resource applicant becomes eligible for Medicaid (becoming the Medicaid recipient) \u2014 having met the resource threshold \u2014 \u201cno resources of the community spouse shall be deemed available\u201d to the recipient. 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(4). As part of that mandate, the transfer of the Medicaid recipient\u2019s resources (in the amount of the CSRA) <em>\u201cshall </em>be made [to or for the sole benefit of the community spouse] as soon as practicable after the date of the initial determination of [Medicaid] eligibility[.]\u201d 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">C. <em>Estate recovery: Brief summary of federal law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">As noted, petitioner challenges several amendments to Oregon\u2019s administrative rules, revolving around the scope of Oregon\u2019s administrative rules governing \u201cestate recovery.\u201d Generally, federal law prohibits states from seeking estate recovery of correctly paid Medicaid benefits. 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(l). However, federal law provides limited exceptions to that general rule, permitting states to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Medicaid benefits from the estates of certain institutionalized and older beneficiaries. 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(1); 42 USC \u00a7 1396a(a)(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">1. <em>Federal estate recovery </em>\u2014 42 <em>USC \u00a7 1396p(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">To determine whether DHS exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the challenged amendments, we first examine the outer limits of that authority. The federal provision relating to estate recovery, 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b), sets that outer limit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Estate recovery for medical assistance \u201cmay be made only after the death of the individual\u2019s surviving spouse, if any\u201d and only when the individual has no surviving children who are under age 21, blind, or disabled. 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(2)(A). Further, estate recovery generally is to be sought \u201cfrom the individual\u2019s estate [.]\u201d 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(l)(A) - (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The federal statute governing \u201cestate recovery,\u201d 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(4),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sets forth two definitions of \u201cestate,\u201d one mandatory and one permissive. That statute begins by defining estate \u201cwith respect to a deceased individual.\u201d Paragraph (b)(4)(A) provides the mandatory limits for estate recovery programs administered by the states, requiring that states seek recovery from a Medicaid recipient\u2019s \u201creal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and personal property and other assets included within the [deceased] individual\u2019s estate, as defined for purposes of State probate law\u201d and leaves that definition to state law. 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">On the other hand, 42 USC section 1396p(b)(4)(B) is permissive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It allows states the option to enact legislation and promulgate rules that enable the state to recover from a more expansive definition of assets, defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201cany other real and personal property and other assets in which the [deceased] individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death (to the extent of such interest), including such assets conveyed to a survivor, heir, or assign of the deceased individual through joint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivorship, life estate, living trust, or other arrangement [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Under that definition, it becomes clear from the plain text of the statute that the assets subject to estate recovery include property subject to probate, 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(A), but also reaches \u201cassets conveyed\u201d to another person through any one of the listed methods, 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Virtually all of the methods for conveyance to another person included in the definition of \u201cestate\u201d are legal terms \u2014 namely \u201cjoint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivorship, life estate, living trust\u201d \u2014 referencing various methods of transferring legal title or interest that generally occur by operation of law on account of the Medicaid recipient\u2019s death. The term at the core of petitioner\u2019s challenge, \u201cother arrangement,\u201d is the outlier. That term is not defined in the statutes, nor is it a well-defined legal term to which we can attribute a legal meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Thus, we generally assume that such a nonspecific term in a series, such as \u201cother arrangement\u201d shares the same qualities as the specific terms that precede it. <em>Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham </em>Corp., ___ US ___, ___, 132 S Ct 2156, 2170, 183 L Ed 2d 153 (2012) (noting that the term including indicates that the examples enumerated in the text are illustrative and not exhaustive); <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>Estate of Keffeler, </em>537 US 371, 384, 123 S Ct 1017, 154 L Ed 2d 972 (2003) (utilizing the interpretative canons <em>ejusdem generis, </em>noting that, \u201c[w]here general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words\u201d (brackets in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Therefore, we conclude that \u201cother arrangement\u201d in the context of the definition of \u201cestate\u201d means that assets transferred from the deceased \u201cindividual\u201d \u2014 the Medicaid recipient \u2014 by operation of law on account of or occurring <em>at the recipient\u2019s death </em>are included in that definition. Thus, the \u201cincluding\u201d clause in the federal permissive definition of \u201cestate\u201d incorporates nonprobate assets that are transferred from the Medicaid recipient to a third party by operation of law or other mechanism, but in which the deceased Medicaid recipient retained legal title or \u201cany\u201d interest <em>at the time of his or her death.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Other aspects of the statute also support that conclusion. Congress defined estate with respect to a \u201cdeceased individual\u201d (deceased Medicaid recipient), mandated recovery from the deceased Medicaid recipient\u2019s probate assets, 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(A), and incorporated the requirement that the deceased Medicaid recipient \u201cha[ve] any legal title or interest at the time of death\u201d into the permissive definition. Therefore, the plain text of 42 USC sections 1396p(b)(4)(A) and (B) indicates that the federal statute limits estate recovery to assets and property held \u201cat the time of death.\u201d That definition sets the scope of authority granted to the states and DHS in promulgating its rules on estate recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">DHS makes several arguments relating to the scope of federal law, which we find prudent to address here. First, DHS argues that the federal statute and surrounding context does not limit estate recovery to assets owned or held by the Medicaid recipient at his or her death. Specifically, DHS responds that \u201cestate\u201d is defined sufficiently broadly in 42 USC section 1396p(b)(4)(B) to encompass assets that the Medicaid recipient fully transferred away during his or her life. DHS further contends that Congress\u2019s expressed legislative policy \u201cfavors estate recovery and disfavors the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>use of property transfers to avoid recovery\u201d and that \u201cnothing in the *** context of 42 USC section 1396p suggests that states are prohibited from recovering assets that were transferred between spouses prior to an application for medical assistance benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">DHS also asserts that the \u201coverall effect\u201d of the contextual provisions it cites is to \u201cprevent the impoverishment of the spouse, while at the same time providing for recovery of the cost of assistance, after the deaths of the recipient and [the] recipient\u2019s spouse, from <em>any asset in which the recipient had some type of interest.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Specifically, DHS contends that the context of federal law, namely 42 USC section 1396p(b)(l) and (c)(1),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cprovides a definition of\u2018asset\u2019 that is broad enough to include an interspousal transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We reject DHS\u2019s argument that, based on expressed legislative policy and context, federal law does not limit estate recovery to assets owned or held by the Medicaid recipient at his or her death. Although we may look to context and legislative history when construing a statute, the best indicator of the legislature\u2019s intent is the text of the statute itself. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (noting that, \u201cthere is no more persuasive evidence of the intent of the legislature than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Taken in isolation, the portions of 42 USC section 1396p cited by DHS appear to support its position. But, taken as a whole, the text of 42 USC section 1396p persuades us that DHS is incorrect. As indicated above, the plain text of 42 USC section 1396p(b)(4)(A) and (B) limits estate recovery to assets and property in which the Medicaid recipient \u201chad any legal title or interest at the time of death,\u201d including nonprobate assets transferred by operation of law due to the decedent\u2019s death, but in which the Medicaid recipient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>had retained an interest at the time of his or her death. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396p(a)(l) (providing that \u201c[n]o lien may be imposed against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid or to be paid on his behalf under the State plan,\u201d with limited exceptions); 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(2) (providing that \u201c[a]ny adjustment or recovery under [42 USC section 1396p(a)](l) may be made only after the death of the individual\u2019s <em>surviving </em>spouse, if any,\u201d and only if the Medicaid recipient does not also have a \u201csurviving\u201d child that is under age 21, blind, or disabled (emphasis added)); 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(l) (disallowing recovery of medical assistance, except with limited exceptions, <em>i.e., </em>from certain individual\u2019s estates or upon sale of certain real property on which a lien has been imposed); 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(c)(l)(A) (providing that, if a Medicaid recipient or the recipient\u2019s spouse \u201cdisposes of assets for less than fair market value *** the individual is ineligible for medical assistance\u201d during a specified period during his or her life); 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(A) (providing that \u201c[a]n individual shall not be ineligible for medical assistance by reason of [42 USC section 1396p(c)](l) to the extent that \u2014 (A) the assets transferred were a home and title to the home was transferred to\u201d the Medicaid recipient\u2019s spouse, among others).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Likewise, we reject DHS\u2019s contention that the context of federal law, \u201cprovides a definition of \u2018asset\u2019 that is broad enough to include an interspousal transfer.\u201d Although DHS is correct that the definition of \u201casset\u201d is broad, the use of that term in the definition of \u201cestate\u201d plainly limits estate recovery from the broad pool of assets owned or otherwise held by the Medicaid recipient at the time of his or her death. 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(4) (defining \u201c\u2018estate\u2019, with respect to a deceased individual\u201d); 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(A) (defining the <em>mandatory </em>provision for estate recovery in terms of the Medicaid recipient\u2019s probate estate); 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(B) (including in the definition of \u201cestate\u201d \u201cassets in which the [Medicaid recipient] had any legal title or interest at the time of death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">With regard to the \u201cexpressed legislative policy,\u201d we likewise reject DHS\u2019s argument. Although, according to DHS, that policy \u201cfavors estate recovery and disfavors the use of property transfers to avoid recovery,\u201d the plain text of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the federal statute belies DHS\u2019s position. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396p(b)(l) (providing specific, limited exceptions to the general rule that \u201c[n]o adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance *** may be made\u201d); 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(A) (providing that a Medicaid recipient does not become ineligible due to a disposal of assets for less than fair market value if the Medicaid recipient transfers title to a home to the recipient\u2019s spouse); 42 USC \u00a7 1396p(c)(2)(B) (providing that a Medicaid recipient does not become ineligible due to a disposal of assets for less than fair market value if the assets were transferred to the spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the recipient\u2019s spouse, transferred to the recipient\u2019s blind or disabled child (or a special needs trust for that child\u2019s benefit), or transferred to a trust for the benefit of a disabled person under 65 years of age).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The provision DHS cites \u2014 42 USC section 1396p(c)(l), which creates eligibility penalties for certain transfers of property for less than fair-market value \u2014 generally governs transfers made for the purpose of qualifying for medical assistance. However, in order to qualify for Medicaid benefits (and to fund the CSRA), it is necessary for the Medicaid recipient to transfer assets. 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(l) (providing that a Medicaid recipient may, without regard to the asset transfer restrictions in 42 USC section 1396p(c)(l), transfer an amount equal to the CSRA to the extent that the resources transferred are transferred to (or for the sole benefit of) the community spouse). The transfer of the CSRA amount <em>\u201cshall </em>be made as soon as practicable after the date of the initial determination of eligibility, taking into account such time as may be necessary to obtain a court order [for the support of the community spouse].\u201d 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(f)(l) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(2) (\u201cIn determining the resources of an institutionalized spouse at the time of application for benefits under this sub-chapter ***\u25a0 \u2014 (A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), all the resources held by either the institutionalized spouse, community spouse, or both, shall be considered to be available to the institutionalized spouse, and (B) resources shall be considered to be available to an institutionalized spouse, <em>but only to the extent that the amount of such resources exceeds the amount [of the CSRA] </em>(as of the time of application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>benefits).\u201d (Emphasis added.)); 42 USC \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(4) (with regard to the eligibility determination, after the applicant becomes eligible \u201cno resources of the community spouse shall be deemed available to the institutionalized spouse\u201d). Thus, in light of the plain text used in the whole of the statute, the specific provisions that DHS cites do not support its position that the legislative policy expressed in the statutes disfavoring the use of property transfers has any relation to estate recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">2. <em>Oregon estate recovery </em>\u2014 ORS <em>416.350</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Having delimited the scope of federal law, we turn to examine Oregon\u2019s estate recovery statutes. Pursuant to 42 USC section 1396p(b), Oregon has enacted laws that authorize it to recover correctly paid medical assistance from a recipient\u2019s estate. ORS 416.310 - 416.351.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The relevant portion of Oregon\u2019s estate recovery statute, ORS 416.350, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201c(2) Medical assistance pursuant to ORS chapter 414 paid to or on behalf of an individual who was 55 years of age or older when the individual received the assistance, or paid to or on behalf of a person of any age who was a permanently institutionalized inpatient in a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities or other medical institution, may be recovered from the estate of the individual or from any recipient of property or other assets held by the individual at the time of death including the estate of the surviving spouse. Claim for such medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of the individual may be established against the estate, but the claim may not be adjusted or recovered until after the death of the surviving spouse, if any, and only at a time when the individual has no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or who is blind or permanently and totally disabled. Transfers of real or personal property by recipients of such aid without adequate consideration are voidable and may be set aside under ORS 411.620 (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u00abH\u00ed ^ H* \u2021 ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">\u201c(6)(a) \u2018Estate\u2019 includes all real and personal property and other assets in which the deceased individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death including assets conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign of the deceased individual through joint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivor-ship, life estate, living trust or other similar arrangement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Like its federal counterpart, the text of ORS 416.350(6)(a) defines estate to include property \u201cin which the deceased individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">ORS 416.350(2), in turn, provides the limits of estate recovery. That statute allows recovery from the estate of a deceased Medicaid recipient or any person \u2014 including the \u201cestate of the surviving spouse\u201d \u2014 who received property that was \u201cheld by the [Medicaid recipient] at the time of death.\u201d Thus, by incorporating the definition of \u201cestate\u201d into the text of ORS 416.350(2), the legislature effectively allowed recovery for medical assistance from either of two sources: (1) from the Medicaid recipient\u2019s estate <em>(i.e., </em>from the \u201cestate of the individual,\u201d meaning property that the Medicaid recipient owned at the time of death), or (2) from a third party who had received property that the Medicaid recipient had held at the time of his or her death <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cfrom any recipient of property or other assets held by the individual at the time of death including the estate of the surviving spouse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The legislature also limited <em>when </em>Oregon could recover for medical assistance, namely \u201cafter the death of the surviving spouse\u201d of a married Medicaid recipient, \u201cand only at a time when the individual has no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or who is blind or permanently and totally disabled.\u201d ORS 416.350(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Thus, under ORS 416.350, DHS may recover medical assistance payments from either the estate of the Medicaid recipient <em>or </em>from any person \u2014 including the surviving spouse or the surviving spouse\u2019s estate \u2014 who has received property or assets <em>that were held by the Medicaid recipient at the time of his or her death. </em>ORS 416.350(2), (6) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Incorporating a virtually identical \u201cincluding\u201d clause into the definition of estate, ORS 416.350(6) \u2014 like its federal counterpart \u2014 incorporates nonprobate assets that are transferred from the Medicaid recipient to a third party by operation of law or other mechanism, but in which the deceased Medicaid recipient retained legal title or interest at the time of his or her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">With that understanding of the scope of federal and state law, we turn to examine the challenged rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">III. DETERMINATION OF RULE VALIDITY</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">At issue in this case are two administrative rules pertaining to estate recovery. The first is OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B)(viii), which deals with the definition of \u201cestate\u201d for estate recovery purposes. The second is OAR 461-135-0835(l)(e)(B)(iii), dealing with the application of that definition on the limits of estate recovery. The amendments at issue in this case took effect on October 1, 2008, and are applicable to Medicaid recipients who died on or after October 1, 2008. Petitioner asserts that the definition of the term \u201cestate\u201d in OAR 461-135-0832 and OAR 461-135-0835, as amended, exceeds the scope of federal and state law, because the challenged amendments purport to allow DHS to engage in estate recovery from assets in which the deceased Medicaid recipient had no legal interest at the time of his or her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">A. <em>Definitions </em>\u2014 OAR <em>461-135-0832</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Before the adoption of the challenged amendments, the basic definition of \u201cestate\u201d included property and other assets \u201cin which a recipient had any legal title or ownership or beneficial interest at the time of death,\u201d in addition to transfers by tenancy by the entirety, joint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivorship, life estate, living trust, annuity, or other similar arrangement. In the 2008 amendments, the definition of estate was \u201cexpanded\u201d from that \u201cbasic\u201d definition to include \u201cother similar arrangements,\u201d which encompasses interspousal transfers made within 60 months of the date of request for benefits, as another example of assets that fall within the definition of \u201cestate\u201d \u2014 the text that is being challenged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Thus, OAR 461-135-0832 provides the following definitions, as relevant here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">\u201c(1) \u2018Assets\u2019 means all income and resources of an individual, including any income or resources that an individual is entitled to at the time of death, including any income or resources to which the individual is entitled, but does not receive, because of action: by the individual; the individual\u2019s spouse; by a person, including a court or administrative body with legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the individual; or by any person, including any court or administrative body, acting at the direction or upon the request of the individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u2021 \u2021 <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201c(8) \u2018Date of request\u2019 means the date an individual or someone authorized on behalf of the individual contacts [DHS] or uses another appropriate method to request benefits (see OAR 461-115-0150).

OAR 461-135-0832(1) (defining \u201cassets\u201d) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The definition of estate further requires that the Medicaid recipient not merely be \u201centitled to\u201d the property but to \u201cha[ve] * * * legal title or ownership or beneficial interest at the time of death.\u201d As indicated above, legal title is defined as \u201clegal ownership by a person.\u201d OAR 461-135-0832(17). The Medicaid recipient\u2019s \u201ctime of death\u201d means the \u201cinstant of death\u201d which \u201cshall [not be construed] to mean a time after which an interest in real or personal property or other assets may * * * [p]ass by survivorship or other operation of law due to the death of the decedent; or * * * [t]erminate by reason of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d OAR 461-135-0832(30) (emphases omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Thus, the definition of \u201cestate\u201d captures a specific pool of assets, namely real property, personal property, and all other income or resources to which the Medicaid recipient was \u201centitled\u201d or in which the recipient had legal title, ownership, or a beneficial interest at the time of death. And, by implication, the rule contemplates that property interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>may terminate or pass to third parties \u2014 by survivorship or operation of law \u2014 on account of the Medicaid recipient\u2019s death. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The definition of estate also specifically includes property \u201cconveyed by the [Medicaid] recipient to, subsequently acquired by, or traceable to, a person[.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B) (emphasis omitted). That plain text makes clear that the definition of estate specifically encompasses any property that is conveyed to or otherwise subsequently transferred to a person by the Medicaid recipient after he or she has become eligible to receive Medicaid benefits, but \u2014 because the Medicaid recipient must have an interest in the property at the time of death \u2014 the transfer must occur at (or on account of) the Medicaid recipient\u2019s death. OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B); see <em>also </em>OAR 461-135-0832(30) (defining \u201ctime of death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Finally, the definition of estate specifically includes several methods of conveyance through which that other person may obtain an interest in property, setting out a list of legal arrangements <em>(e.g., </em>tenancy by the entirety, joint tenancy, tenancy in common, \u201c[n]ot as tenants in common, but with the right of survivorship\u201d). Thus, the definition of estate in OAR 461-135-0832 includes direct transfers from the Medicaid recipient to another person, as well as any transfers that occur by operation of law on account of the recipient\u2019s death. OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B), (30).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Utilizing wording similar to that of ORS 416.350, that list of legal arrangements also includes the terminology \u201cother similar arrangement.\u201d However, unlike with the federal statute, 42 USC section 1396p (\u201cother arrangement\u201d), and the Oregon statute, ORS 416.350 (\u201cother similar arrangement\u201d), DHS did not leave the parameters of that term undefined. Instead, the rule delineates the contours of \u201cother similar arrangement\u201d as an \u201cinterspousal transfer of assets, including [transfers] facilitated by a court order, which occurred no earlier than 60 months prior to the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>date of request<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark> * * * or at anytime thereafter [.]\u201d OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B)(viii) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\">Based on the plain wording of OAR 461-135-0832(10) (b)(B)(viii), it becomes clear that \u201cother similar arrangement\u201d captures any transfer between spouses \u2014 including direct transfers, transfers from one or both spouses to a trust, transfers from one trust to another trust, or transfers facilitated by a court order, OAR 461-135-0832(13) \u2014 that transfers title to an asset, control of an asset, or an interest in an asset, and that occurs no earlier than 60 months before the initial date of application for Medicaid benefits or \u201cat any time thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">According to petitioner, it is that text \u2014 defining the contours of \u201cother similar arrangement\u201d \u2014 that exceeds the scope of federal and state law. Because we conclude that DHS\u2019s proffered interpretation of \u201cother similar arrangement\u201d is at odds with the remainder of the DHS\u2019s definition of estate and federal state law, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">DHS acknowledges that the term \u201cother similar arrangement\u201d in the expanded definition of estate, \u201cprovides for [estate] recovery * * * from a spouse\u2019s estate to the extent the spouse received property or assets from the recipient by an \u2018interspousal transfer\u2019 that occurred within five years before\u201d the date of the Medicaid application.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">That interpretation of \u201cother similar arrangement,\u201d stands at odds with the remainder of the definition of estate. The initial portion of the rule plainly limits estate recovery to property in which the Medicaid recipient held an interest <em>at the time of death </em>or that was <em>transferred on account of the Medicaid recipient\u2019s death. </em>That text complies with 42 USC section 1396p(b)(4)(B) and ORS 416.350. In contrast, the breadth of the term \u201cother similar arrangement\u201d in OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B)(viii) plainly includes transfers of assets that occurred before the Medicaid recipient\u2019s death. For example, by its plain terms, the \u201cdate of request\u201d (to obtain Medicaid \u2014 or other program\u2014 benefits) can only occur during a Medicaid applicant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>lifetime. OAR 461-135-0832(8); <em>see also </em>OAR 641-115-0071 (discussing application process); OAR 461-115-0020 (same); OAR 461-115-0230 (same). Thus, DHS\u2019s amendments to OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B)(viii) \u2014 which expanded the definition of estate by adding to the scope of \u201cother similar arrangement\u201d \u2014 exceeds the scope of the authority granted to DHS by ORS 416.350 and 42 USC section 1396p(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Arguing in support of the rule, DHS contends that petitioner\u2019s challenge fails because the federal and state statutes do not require that the Medicaid recipient \u201cown\u201d property at the time of his or her death. Specifically, DHS argues that petitioner \u201cincorrectly equates the phrase \u2018any legal title or interest\u2019 [found in 42 USC section 1396p(b)(4)(B) and ORS 416.350] with [the concept of] \u2018ownership\u2019 of an asset.\u201d In other words, according to DHS, a person \u201cmay continue to have an interest \u2014 legal, equitable, or beneficial \u2014 in an asset even after transferring * * *property,\u201d such as an interest in marital property, ORS 107.105(5), or an interest under probate law, such as the elective share. Thus, in DHS\u2019s view, because those laws provide for a continuing residual interest that remains with the transferor, the rule is not inconsistent with federal or state law because the state can recover from assets transferred before the recipient\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We turn to DHS\u2019s argument under Oregon probate law. As noted, DHS contends that, under Oregon probate law, the surviving spouse\u2019s right to take the elective share means that the first spouse retained some continuing residual interest in an asset transferred before his or her death. A brief review of the elective share statutes leads to the conclusion that a spouse\u2019s statutory right to make such an election is just that: a statutory right and not an inchoate property interest retained by the spouse. ORS 114.600(1) (\u201c[T]he surviving spouse of the decedent may elect to receive the elective share.\u201d); ORS 114.610 (designating the manner in which a surviving spouse can \u201cclaim\u201d the elective share); ORS 114.615 (noting that, to determine whether payment is required to satisfy the elective share, the court shall consider the values of decedent\u2019s probate estate, nonprobate estate, probate transfers to the surviving spouse, and non-probate transfers to the surviving spouse, in addition to the surviving spouse\u2019s estate; limiting payments to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>elective share to amounts exceeding the value of the surviving spouse\u2019s estate and the decedent\u2019s probate and non-probate transfers to the surviving spouse); ORS 114.635(2) (excluding from the \u201caugmented estate\u201d \u201c[a]ny property that is irrevocably transferred before the death of the decedent spouse\u201d); ORS 114.725 (granting the court discretion to reduce or deny the elective share amount \u201c[i]f the decedent and the surviving spouse were living apart at the time of the decedent\u2019s death, whether or not there was a judgment of legal separation\u201d after considering, among other things, \u201cthe contribution of the surviving spouse to the property of the decedent in the form of * * * transfers of property\u201d). Thus, we reject DHS\u2019s argument that the elective share statutes are indicative of a \u201cretained\u201d interest in property after one spouse has transferred property to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Next, we examine DHS\u2019s argument that Oregon domestic relations law also provides for a married transferor to retain a continuing residual interest in property transferred. According to DHS, \u201cshould the marriage end in divorce,\u201d the provision in ORS 107.105(l)(f)(E) \u2014 providing that \u201cthe rights of the parties in the marital assets shall be considered a species of co-ownership\u201d \u2014 presumes that the spouses retain a half-interest, which \u201ccontinu\u00e9is] until [the decedent transferor\u2019s] death, when they terminate and merge with the interests of [his or] her surviving spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We similarly reject that argument. Oregon is a separate-property state. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art XV, \u00a7 5 (\u201cThe property and pecuniary rights of every married woman, at the time of marriage or afterwards, acquired by gift, devise, or inheritance shall not be subject to the debts, or contracts of the husband; and laws shall be passed providing for the registration of the wife\u2019s seperate[sic] property.\u201d (Alteration in original.)). Therefore, the presumption of co-ownership does not arise until after the parties have filed to dissolve their marriage. ORS 107.105(l)(f)(E) <em>(\u201cSubsequent to the filing of a petition for annulment or dissolution of marriage or separation, </em>the rights of the parties in the marital assets shall be considered a species of co-ownership[.]\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, for DHS\u2019s argument to be successful, the spouses would have to engage in the interspousal transfer while married, but <em>after </em>the petition to dissolve the marriage has been filed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Only under those facts would the transferor spouse retain an interest in the transferred property from which the state could recover. However, under general principles of property law in the state of Oregon, DHS\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Having considered and rejected DHS\u2019s arguments in support of the rule, we return to square one in our analysis. Our task is to determine whether OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b) (B)(viii) exceeds federal and state statutory authority. We conclude that it does and hold the challenged language invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">B. <em>Limits on estate recovery </em>\u2014 OAR <em>461-135-0835</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Finally, we turn to examine petitioner\u2019s challenge to OAR 461-135-0835(l)(e)(B)(iii). Petitioner asserts that, in amending the rule, DHS exceeded its statutory authority granted by 42 USC section 1396p(b)(4)(B) and ORS 416.350.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The challenged rule, OAR 461-135-0835(l)(e)(B) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u201c(1) In the * * * OSIPM * * * program!]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">\u201c(e) For a recipient who died on or after October 1, 2008:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">\u2021 H\u00ed # sH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">\u201c(B) In addition, [DHS] has a claim against the estate of the recipient\u2019s spouse for public assistance paid to the recipient, but only to the extent that the recipient\u2019s spouse received property or other assets from the recipient through any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-13\">\u201c(i) Probate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-14\">\u201c(ii) Operation of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-15\">\u201c(iii) <em>An interspousal transfer, including one facilitated by a court order, which </em>occurs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-16\">\u201c(I) <em>Before, on, or after October 1, 2008; and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-17\">\u201c(II) <em>No earlier than 60 months prior to the first date of request (see OAR 461-135-0832) established from the applications of the recipient and the recipient\u2019s spouse, or at any time thereafter, whether approved, withdrawn, or denied, for the public assistance programs referenced in section (2) of this rule.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>OAR 461-135-0835(l)(e)(B) (bold and italics inserted to indicate challenged text). DHS acknowledges that the prior version of the rule allowed estate recovery from a surviving spouse\u2019s estate \u201c\u2018only to the extent that the surviving spouse received property or other assets from the pre-deceased spouse\u2019 through probate or operation of law.\u201d DHS further acknowledges that, after the challenged amendments were made, the rule now allows for estate recovery from a surviving spouse\u2019s estate \u201cto the extent [that] the spouse received property or assets from the recipient\u201d through probate, operation of law, or \u201cby an \u2018interspousal transfer\u2019 that occurred within five years before the recipient\u2019s date of request for benefits.\u201d We conclude that DHS again exceeded its statutory authority by including the interspousal transfer in the class of transfers to the recipient\u2019s spouse from which DHS may recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">By including the \u201cinterspousal transfer\u201d text in the pool of assets from which the state can recover from the surviving spouse\u2019s estate, the rule includes assets that necessarily were transferred before the recipient\u2019s death. Because we have concluded that such predeath transfers are antithetical to the definition of estate as provided by federal and state law (requiring that the recipient have an interest in the property at the time of his or her death), we conclude that DHS\u2019s amendments of OAR 461-135-0835(1)(e)(B)(iii) relating to interspousal transfers exceeded its statutory authority granted by ORS 416.350 and 42 USC section 1396p, and we hold those provisions invalid.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Because we have concluded that the challenged provisions exceed federal and state statutory authority, we do not reach petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Text added by amendment to OAR 461-135-0832(10) (b)(B)(viii) and OAR 461-135-0835(l)(e)(B)(iii), effective October 1, 2008, held invalid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\"> Petitioner does not challenge the rules in their entirety. Instead, petitioner challenges the portions added as part of DHS\u2019s 2008 amendments to OAR 461-135-0832(10)(b)(B)(viii) and OAR 461-135-0835(l)(e)(B)(iii), effective October 1, 2008, which have been retained in all subsequent versions of the rule. We follow the parties\u2019 lead and, for ease of reference, unless otherwise noted, we refer to the November 15, 2010, version of the rule which incorporates the 2008 amendments.

Petitioner argues that the state has not done so and that that failure is legally significant, because lack of CMS approval affects DHS\u2019s ability to enforce the provisions at issue. DHS argues that the issue of whether DHS has submitted a state plan is a factual question that cannot be resolved on this record. Further, DHS contends that, even if petitioner\u2019s assertion is correct, lack of CMS approval is not relevant to our review in a facial rule challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Although petitioner may have a valid point relating to DHS\u2019s ability to enforce rules that have not been approved by CMS \u2014 a situation that we do not address here, because petitioner has not cast DHS\u2019s failure to obtain approval as a deficiency in rulemaking procedure \u2014 we agree that the failure to obtain CMS approval is not relevant to our review in this facial challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> In interpreting the federal scheme, we use a methodology similar to that set forth in <em>State v.
