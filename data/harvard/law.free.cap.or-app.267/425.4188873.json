J.</author>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Entrepreneurs Foundation (employer) petitions for judicial review of an order by the Employment Appeals Board (the EAB), which adopted an order of an administrative law judge (AL J) awarding unemployment benefits to claimant on the basis that employer terminated claimant but not for misconduct. Employer raises three assignments of error concerning the EAB\u2019s adoption of the ALJ\u2019s order, but all depend on its contention that the AL J and the EAB should have based their legal conclusions and factual findings on ORS 657.176(2)(e), rather than on ORS 657.176(2)(a) and ORS 657.176(2)(c). Because employer\u2019s arguments under ORS 657.176(2)(e) were not preserved before the ALJ or the EAB, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The facts are largely undisputed. Claimant worked as a remote employee in Portland for a little over a year, commuting once a month to employer\u2019s California office. In 2012, employer and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) made plans to merge. While claimant was still employed, SVCF offered claimant a new job at the same pay after the merger and told claimant that she would be allowed to continue working remotely. Claimant initially accepted the job offer. On June 29, 2012, employer\u2019s executive director sent claimant an e-mail stating that, \u201cdue to the acquisition of [employer,] there is no longer a role for you with our organization. As of the close of business today, June 29, 2012, your employment with [employer] is terminated.\u201d Later that day, claimant sent SVCF an e-mail declining its job offer because the \u201ccompany culture does not support remote employees\u201d and working remotely would be a \u201cliability to * * * success with [the] organization.\u201d Claimant\u2019s job with employer terminated at the end of the business day on June 29. Employer and SVCF merged the next day and employer agreed to \u201coperate under SVCF\u2019s complete control\u201d; employer \u201cwas not capable of employing claimant as a separate employer from SVCF after the merger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Claimant then applied for unemployment benefits. The Employment Department (department) denied her claim, concluding that she had voluntarily left work without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>good cause and was therefore disqualified from receiving benefits under ORS 657.176(2)(c). Claimant requested a hearing before an ALJ to contest the department\u2019s decision, after which the ALJ issued a final order concluding that claimant was eligible for benefits because she had been discharged but not for misconduct. The hearing notice and the ALJ\u2019s opinion both framed the broad issue on appeal as, \u201cShall claimant be disqualified from the receipt of benefits because of a separation, discharge, suspension or voluntary-leaving from work? (ORS 657.176, ORS 657.190 and OAR 471-030-0038.)\u201d The ALJ\u2019s opinion specifically addressed ORS 657.176(2)(a) and ORS 657.176(2)(c). ORS 657.176 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">\u201c(2) An individual shall be disqualified from the receipt of benefits * * * if * * * the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201c(a) Has been discharged for misconduct connected with work; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201c(c) Voluntarily left work without good cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">(Emphasis added.) The ALJ\u2019s order was organized accordingly; the first issue was \u201cwhether claimant quit or was discharged.\u201d The ALJ concluded that claimant was discharged because employer was not willing to employ claimant after June 29, 2012, even though claimant was willing to continue to work for employer after that time. The second issue was \u201cwhether the employer discharged claimant for misconduct connected with work.\u201d Because employer did not present any evidence at the hearing that \u201csuggested that claimant violated its policies or disregarded its interests,\u201d the ALJ concluded that claimant was discharged but not for misconduct connected with work.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Employer appealed the ALJ\u2019s order to the EAB. As part of the application, employer submitted a written argument, which included additional evidence and argued for the first time that ORS 657.176(2)(e) disqualified claimant from receiving unemployment benefits because she failed \u201cwithout good cause to accept suitable work when offered.\u201d The EAB did not consider employer\u2019s written argument, stating that it \u201ccontained information that was not part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>hearing record and [employer] failed to certify that it provided a copy of its written argument to the other parties as required.\u201d The EAB reviewed the entire hearing record and adopted the ALJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Employer argues to us on review that claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits because she failed without good cause to accept suitable work when offered under ORS 657.176(2)(e). Employer\u2019s three assignments of error center around employer\u2019s contention that the ALJ committed legal error and the order lacked substantial reason under ORS 657.176(2)(e); indeed, employer contends that the ALJ utterly disregarded its defense and failed to engage in any legal analysis related to ORS 657.176(2)(e). Claimant counters that, because employer failed to make arguments relating to that section before the ALJ, and because the EAB refused to consider its arguments for the first time on review, employer\u2019s assignments of error were not preserved. Employer responds that its arguments under ORS 657.176(2)(e) were preserved under <em>Marella v. Employment Dept., </em>223 Or App 121, 126, 194 P3d 849 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 65 (2009), because the job offer was discussed at the administrative hearing. Employer alternatively argues that, because it is the ALJ\u2019s duty under ORS 657.270(3)(a) to explain the legal issues to unrepresented parties and to ensure that there is a \u201cfull and fair inquiry into the facts,\u201d the ALJ was responsible for any failure to preserve arguments under ORS 657.176(2)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We begin with the matter of preservation, because it is dispositive. ORAP 5.45(1) provides that \u201c[n]o matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court.\u201d Preservation requirements \u201capply with as much force in the administrative area.\u201d <em>Veselik v. SAIF, </em>177 Or App 280, 288, 33 P3d 1007 (2001); <em>see Marella, </em>223 Or App at 126 (\u201cAn issue must first be raised to the EAB before we will consider it on review.\u201d). In order to preserve an argument for judicial review, the party asserting the error \u201cmust provide the * * * agency with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the * * * agency is able to consider the point and avoid committing error.\u201d <em>Becklin v. Board of Examiners for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>Engineering, </em>195 Or App 186, 199-200, 97 P3d 1216 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 16 (2005). This requirement advances the purposes of the preservation rule, such as ensuring fairness so that parties are not \u201csurprise [d], misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument.\u201d <em>Davis v. O\u2019Brien, </em>320 Or 729, 737, 891 P2d 1307 (1995). Preservation also assists the \u201cdevelopment of a full record to facilitate review\u201d and \u201cpromotion of judicial efficiency.\u201d <em>State v. Hardesty, </em>238 Or App 146, 150, 241 P3d 741 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 654 (2011). \u201cUltimately, the preservation rule is a practical one, and close calls * * * inevitably will turn on whether, given the particular record of a case, the court concludes that the policies underlying the rule have been sufficiently served.\u201d <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 341, 211 P3d 262 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The record here reveals that employer did not preserve its arguments regarding ORS 657.176(2)(e) before the ALJ. Employer never argued that section at the hearing, or even questioned claimant about whether the job offer constituted \u201csuitable work.\u201d Although the facts developed at the hearing could support an argument under ORS 657.176(2)(e), it is apparent that those facts were presented for purposes of addressing issues raised by ORS 657.176(2)(a) and (c), and additional facts and argument would have been necessary to support a conclusion that ORS 657.176(2)(e) was dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The ALJ\u2019s questions at the hearing and the order focused on whether claimant voluntarily quit or was discharged. In an opening statement, the ALJ stated, \u201cThe issue for this hearing is whether the [claimant shall be disqualified from receipt of benefits based on a separation, discharge, or voluntarily leaving work.\u201d The ALJ then described the burden of proof for each claim: for a discharge case, \u201cthe burden of persuasion is on the [e]mployer to show that the [claimant was discharged for misconduct. In a voluntary quit case, the burden of persuasion is on the [claimant to show that he or she quit for good cause.\u201d When the ALJ discussed the issues with the parties and asked each party for any \u201cquestions about the hearing process or the law that will apply today,\u201d employer asked for a postponement, but did not attempt to change the focus of the inquiry at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>hearing. The ALJ asked employer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a series of questions that similarly framed the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">\u201cQ: And was [claimant] discharged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201cA: No. She was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u201cQ: Did she quit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">A: Yes. She did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Employer\u2019s representatives went on to testify that claimant submitted an e-mail on June 29 stating that she \u201chad decided to not join [SVCF].\u201d The ALJ then asked, \u201cDid she give any other reason as to why she would not be joining [SVCF]?\u201d Employer replied with claimant\u2019s explanation about the company culture not supporting remote employees. The ALJ then proceeded into a line of questions regarding whether the job offered was for an identical position as claimant\u2019s job with employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">When the ALJ questioned claimant, he framed the questions similarly, asking claimant if she quit her job or was discharged and asking for her reasons for rejecting the SVCF job offer. Claimant\u2019s attorney questioned claimant about her job with employer and how it compared with the job offer from SVCF. Because ORS 657.176(2)(a) and (c) were the focus of argument, claimant had the burden to persuade the ALJ that, if she quit, it was for good cause. Accordingly, claimant testified as to how SVCF\u2019s job offer was for a different position than her former one and how various SVCF supervisors had made it clear to her that SVCF did not support remote employees. Because employer was arguing that claimant quit voluntarily when she refused SVCF\u2019s job offer, the testimony about the job offer and SVCF\u2019s treatment of remote employees was developed to support employer\u2019s argument that claimant had quit without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>By contrast, preliminary issues of fact relevant to an ORS 657.176(2)(e) analysis were never raised. In order for the ALJ to address that section, employer (not claimant) would have been required to prove that claimant (a) failed to accept suitable work (b) without good cause. However, the record was not developed with regard to whether the job offer from SVCF was \u201csuitable\u201d or whether claimant had \u201cgood cause\u201d for rejecting it. Further, employer never argued, as it does now, that the impending merger meant that a job offer from SVCF before the merger was no different from employer offering an employee \u201csuitable work\u201d before discharge or that that section applies to a claimant who is still employed. Accordingly, claimant never had the opportunity to respond to that line of reasoning and present evidence that the work was not suitable or argue that ORS 657.176(2)(e) does not apply to a person who receives an offer of employment while still employed. Indeed, on more than one occasion, claimant questioned how SVCF employees could testify on behalf of employer and testified that, even though she had been willing to continue working for employer, she did not take the SVCF position because \u201c[i]t was not the same employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Moreover, we note that the EAB rejected employer\u2019s written argument addressing its contentions under ORS 657.176(2)(e) precisely because that argument relied on evidence not in the hearing record and had not been properly submitted to opposing parties. The EAB treated the argument as a new argument. We likewise conclude that straining to read the testimony about the job offer to be sufficient to preserve arguments that were not addressed to the ALJ would not promote the policies of procedural fairness to the parties that underlie the preservation rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Contrary to employer\u2019s contention, <em>Marella </em>does not stand for the proposition that any mention of contested facts that could support an alternative legal argument preserves that legal argument. In that case, the claimant argued that she had a permanent or long-term impairment that justified her rejection of a post-discharge job offer, 223 Or App at 125-26, and relied on a declaration in the supplemental record to support her contention that the argument was preserved. The declaration stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u201cAt [the time of the purported job offer], I was being treated for high blood pressure, thyroid disease, lichen sclerosis, hernia, and an eating disorder. To treat those medical conditions, I took a number of prescription medications. I am still treating those medical conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 125. However, we concluded that the claimant \u201cdid not make the existence of her chronic conditions a contested issue of fact or law,\u201d because she did not argue to the ALJ or the EAB that she had a permanent or long-term impairment, that her impairment met the definition of the relevant rule, and that the applicable \u201cgood cause\u201d standard in the rules would apply differently to her as a result. <em>Id. </em>at 126. Accordingly, we held that her declaration did not sufficiently raise the issue of whether she had permanent or long-term impairments and concluded that the EAB \u201cwould be surprised by the arguments raised in this assignment of error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Similarly here, employer points to testimony discussing SVCF\u2019s job offer, claimant\u2019s rejection of it, and contested facts about whether the offer was for a position different from claimant\u2019s original job \u2014 but because employer never argued at the hearing that claimant \u201cfailed without good cause\u201d to accept the job offer or that the offer was for \u201csuitable work,\u201d the cited testimony was not sufficient to preserve the argument. Moreover, the EAB, which viewed employer\u2019s written arguments and evidence as new, would likely be surprised by the arguments raised in employer\u2019s assignments of error. Therefore, employer failed to preserve the argument that ORS 657.176 (2) (e) provides a basis for reversing the award of unemployment benefits in this case and accordingly, none of its three assignments of error are preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We turn to employer\u2019s argument that the ALJ had a duty to develop the issues related to ORS 657.176(2)(e). Under ORS 657.270(3)(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201c[w]hen the claimant or the employer is unrepresented at the hearing, the administrative law judge shall explain the issues involved in the hearing and the matters that the unrepresented claimant or the employer must either prove or disprove. The administrative law judge shall ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>that the record developed at the hearing shows a full and fair inquiry into the facts necessary for consideration of all issues properly before the administrative law judge in the case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The \u201cduty to inquire fully into the matters at issue is simply a requirement that relevant evidence does not go unpresented because of the ignorance or inexperience of a party.\u201d <em>Dennis v. Employment Div., </em>302 Or 160, 166, 728 P2d 12 (1986). In making a full and fair inquiry, the ALJ is not required to \u201ccast aimlessly for evidence\u201d; rather, the \u201cnecessary inquiry should be apparent from the nature of the proceedings and the evidence adduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That duty means that the ALJ must explain the issues involved and the matters which the party must either prove or disprove. <em>Willamette Graystone, Inc. v. Hammond, </em>151 Or App 561, 566, 951 P2d 166 (1997). The ALJ also must ensure that the \u201crecord developed at the hearing shows a full and fair inquiry for consideration of <em>all issues properly before </em>the referee in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) The ALJ, then, must make sure that the record is developed with respect to issues before the ALJ, however, this does not mean that the ALJ has a duty to pursue all legal issues that a party could potentially argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Under the circumstances presented here, the ALJ was under no obligation to introduce an ORS 657.176(2)(e) analysis when employer failed to develop a number of the issues that would apply to such an analysis, such as the relationship between employer and SVCF, its legal significance with regard to claimant\u2019s obligation to accept the job offer, whether the job was suitable work, whether good cause existed for refusing the offer, and whether the statute requires an employee to accept an offer from either her existing employer or a third-party employer while currently employed. None of those issues were addressed at the hearing, and it was not the ALJ\u2019s job to introduce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>In <em>Wahlgren v. DMV, </em>196 Or App 452, 102 P3d 761 (2004), we rejected a similar argument concerning the ALJ\u2019s duty to preserve issues for appeal. In <em>Wahlgren, </em>petitioner contended that, \u201ceven if ordinary preservation rules otherwise apply,\u201d the ALJ in the case had an \u201cindependent obligation\u201d to preserve meritorious issues that the petitioner was attempting to assert on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 458. We rejected that argument and determined that although an ALJ may have an obligation to assist a litigant in following up on potentially favorable lines of factual inquiry, that duty does not remove a party\u2019s obligation to raise issues for preservation purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 459. Likewise here, the ALJ did not have an independent obligation to develop an alternative ORS 657.176(2)(e) analysis and preserve it for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\"> The three representatives for employer at the ALJ hearing were SVCF employees. At the time of the hearing, employer had merged into SVCF and \u201cno longer exist [ed] as an employing unit.\u201d Employer appeared to assume, in appearing with only SVCF employees, that SVCF and employer were one and the same. However, employer never argued this before the ALJ and, as a result, its arguments concerning whether claimant quit or was discharged are confused. Employer proceeded with its argument that claimant quit when she refused the job offer, ignoring the fact that claimant was never an employee of SVCF, so she could not have quit SVCF.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-6\"> Under ORS 657.270(3)(b), \u201c\u2018unrepresented\u2019 means the claimant or the employer is not represented by an attorney, paralegal worker, legal assistant, union representative or person otherwise qualified by experience or training.\u201d Employer was represented by SVCF\u2019s Vice-President of Human Resources, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Human Resources Generalist. In entertaining employer\u2019s argument about the ALJ\u2019s obligations, we express no opinion on whether experienced executives and human resource management would qualify as \u201cotherwise qualified by experience or training.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
