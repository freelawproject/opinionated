The post-conviction court rejected petitioner\u2019s argument and denied the petition for relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Petitioner was indicted on one count of third-degree rape and three counts of third-degree sexual abuse. Petitioner and his trial counsel signed a petition providing that petitioner would plead guilty to the third-degree rape charge and receive a downward departure prison sentence of 23 months in exchange for the district attorney\u2019s recommendation that the court dismiss the other three counts. Petitioner submitted the plea petition to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The sentencing hearing occurred on a later date. At that hearing, petitioner told the trial court that he wanted to withdraw his plea. This appeal concerns the discussion that ensued, as to which the facts are undisputed. We rely on the extensive written findings made by the post-conviction court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cAt sentencing, [petitioner] requested the judge setover sentencing so he could hire a new attorney to prepare a request to withdraw his guilty plea. He told the court he didn\u2019t understand what was going on and didn\u2019t have an attorney, and indicated he felt rushed. Judge Bergstrom noted they \u2018talked about it a lot\u2019 as he had participated in several settlement conferences regarding the case. At that point, [petitioner\u2019s] mother, Connie Garcia, chimed in \u2018Because of your disability.\u2019 The following exchange then took place:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">\u201c\u2018The Court: You knew that you were going to get 23 months. You knew that your exposure was much, much higher than that. You knew the case against you is a slam dunk. To think you could go to trial and lose and get much, much more time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">\u201c \u2018 [Petitioner]: I didn\u2019t know that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">\u201c \u2018The Court: How didn\u2019t you know it? You and I talked about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201c\u2018[Petitioner]: Well, I was trying to talk to [trial counsel] about it, and the case was rescheduled, and then all of a sudden it was put back, appointed, and I wasn\u2019t explained what I was going to sign, and I didn\u2019t have anybody that I felt. . .\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">\u201cHis mother also apparently walked in front of the bar and [trial counsel] told her she needed to be behind it. [Trial counsel] reiterated to the judge her version of the events of the day the plea took place. [The prosecutor] also reiterated the history of the case and settlement conferences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201cAfter that, [petitioner] stated, T felt rushed into taking this plea. * * * I didn\u2019t have anybody to talk to me, to tell me what was actually going on. * * * When I came in here, I wasn\u2019t even explained what was going on. It was just, sign it.\u2019 [Trial counsel] then stated, \u2018That\u2019s not true.\u2019 [Petitioner] also told the judge he had documentation of the diagnosis of his \u2018disability of understanding,\u2019 and that an attorney had agreed to represent him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s] mother, *** had spoken to attorney Alexander Hamalian after [petitioner\u2019s] plea. Mr. Hamalian agreed to represent [petitioner] and file a motion to withdraw his plea if [petitioner] could secure a setover as Mr. Hamalian was out of town and unavailable to appear at that court proceeding. Mr. Hamalian sent a fax confirming this scenario.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The trial court denied petitioner\u2019s requests to withdraw his guilty plea and set over sentencing. Petitioner was sentenced consistently with the terms of the plea petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Petitioner brought this action for post-conviction relief, alleging numerous deficiencies in his trial attorney\u2019s representation of him, including that his trial attorney (1) \u201cfailed to request to withdraw at sentencing or request a continuance on petitioner\u2019s behalf\u2019 when petitioner indicated to the Court that he did not understand the plea and did not have an attorney to answer his questions; (2) \u201cfailed to object to the [t]rial [c]ourt[\u2019]s failure to set over sentencing for retained counsel to appear and move to withdraw the plea\u201d; (3) and \u201cviolated her ethical and statutory duties when she contradicted petitioner on the record concerning his understanding of the plea proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The post-conviction court denied the petition in its entirety. As to the claims relevant on appeal, the court entered the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s] disability involved borderline intelligence functioning with an IQ of around 77. [Trial counsel] was aware of his disability. It is her practice to communicate in a manner that is understandable for the individual, and in the case of developmental disabilities would take special steps to change her language and style of speaking, to repeat back information regularly, and to take more time to ask and answer questions. Judge Bergstrom was also aware of the disability and communicated with [petitioner] in a similar fashion. * * * [Trial counsel] participated in a judicial settlement conference with Judge Bergstrom and her client and was aware he\u2019d had two earlier judicial settlement conferences ***, and she was confident her client developed a full understanding of the issues. She also had a psycho-sexual evaluation ***, which included the doctor\u2019s observation that [petitioner] appeared to understand his legal situation and possible consequences. Judge Bergstrom, who was familiar with defendant from the multiple settlement conferences, made a finding that the plea was made freely, voluntarily and intelligently. There is no evidence that [petitioner\u2019s] disability interfered with his ability to make a knowing and voluntary decision other than his statement at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201c*** [Trial counsel] had good reason to believe [petitioner] was being manipulated by his mother and that he was not speaking for himself at the time of his request. Not only was [petitioner\u2019s] mother both vocally and physically intrusive at the hearing, [trial counsel] testified that she was disruptive during conferences with [petitioner], [Trial counsel] testified in the post-conviction trial that Ms. Garcia would not let him make decisions for himself and she would get irate and disruptive and mad at him that he wanted to enter a plea. She said, \u2018He was more sure of himself and decisive in conversations without her. He was afraid to speak up for himself if she was here.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201cShe also testified about the plea that \u2018It was clear it\u2019s what he wanted to do\u2019 despite his mother\u2019s objection. * * * [Petitioner] told [trial counsel] his mother would be mad about the plea but he was \u2018doing what\u2019s right for me.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\u201c*** In not asking the court for a continuance, [trial counsel] was, in fact, protecting her client\u2019s interests based on what she understood them to be from the totality of their discussions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">\u201c[Trial counsel] did not need to withdraw due to [petitioner\u2019s] mention of another attorney as she did not have confirmation another attorney had actually been hired. * * * Nothing in the Oregon Rules of Professional Conduct or the U.S. or Oregon Constitutions would require her to withdraw because her client was seeking a setover and indicated another attorney would represent him at a subsequent hearing if he were to get a setover. Instead, she would be violating her ethical duty in doing so because she would be leaving her client totally unrepresented in violation of ORPC 1.16(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cOnce [petitioner] said he didn\u2019t understand the plea proceeding, it would have been better to put the brakes on the sentencing hearing and to not state her client\u2019s statement was not true. However, she was in an untenable position. [Petitioner] had affirmed his position to her of what he wanted to do despite his mother\u2019s interference, but was unable to vocalize that position in the face of domineering statements and disruptions when his mother was present. [Trial counsel] was confident her client\u2019s decision to plea was the choice that was uncoerced and that it was made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. In representing clients with diminished capacity, a lawyer must as far as reasonably possible maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client, and may take reasonably necessary protective action to protect the client when the client cannot adequately act in his own interest. ORPC Rule 1.14. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\u201cEven if she were to request a setover, petitioner has not established that the continuance or her withdrawal would tend to change the outcome of the case. Judge Bergstrom was presented with the setover request, considered it and denied it. While it\u2019s possible he might have been more likely to grant the motion for setover when made by an attorney, there\u2019s no indication in the record the judge would have considered differently. He was relying, among other factors on his own observations during three settlement conferences. He confronted [petitioner] with the content of their conversations and [petitioner] provided a non-credible response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>about why it was he didn\u2019t understand what the judge told him during conferences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">On appeal, petitioner argues that the post-conviction court should, have granted him relief on the alleged grounds that his trial counsel was inadequate in failing to request to withdraw, failing to request a continuance or to object to the trial court\u2019s refusal to set over sentencing, and in contradicting petitioner on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">To prevail on a claim for post-conviction relief, a petitioner must demonstrate a substantial violation of his state or federal constitutional rights. ORS 138.530(l)(a). Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution guarantees every criminal defendant the right to adequate assistance of counsel. <em>Krummacher v. Gierloff </em>290 Or 867, 871-72, 627 P2d 458 (1981). Similarly, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution guarantee defendants the effective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 US 668, 687, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984); <em>Herring v. New York, </em>422 US 853, 856-57, 95 S Ct 2550, 45 L Ed 2d 593 (1975). The standards under the state and federal constitutions are \u201cfunctionally equivalent.\u201d <em>Montez v. Czerniak, </em>237 Or App 276, 278 n 1, 239 P3d 1023 (2010). To make out a claim of inadequate or ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment, and (2) petitioner was prejudiced as a result. <em>Monahan v. Belleque, </em>234 Or App 93, 97, 227 P3d 777, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 669 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We review post-conviction proceedings for legal error. <em>Chew v. State of Oregon, </em>121 Or App 474, 476, 855 P2d 1120, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 24 (1993). We are bound by the post-conviction court\u2019s findings of fact if there is evidence in the record to support them. <em>Brock v. Wright, </em>98 Or App 323, 326, 778 P2d 999 (1989). We make our own determination, however, of the constitutional issue whether petitioner was deprived of effective and adequate counsel. <em>Loveless v. Maass, </em>166 Or App 611, 615, 999 P2d 537 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">As noted above, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel typically requires the petitioner to prove prejudice. In this case, petitioner invokes a narrow exception to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>rule that has been recognized in some cases involving a conflict of interest. <em>See, e.g., Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 US 335, 348-49, 100 S Ct 1708, 64 L Ed 2d 333 (1980); <em>United States v. Ellison, </em>798 F2d 1102, 1107 (7th Cir 1986). Petitioner argues that his trial counsel had an actual conflict of interest because, when petitioner told the trial court that the attorney had inadequately advised him and pressured him into accepting a plea, the attorney had to choose between representing petitioner\u2019s interests and representing her own interests by defending her conduct to the court (thus disagreeing with petitioner\u2019s account). Relying on <em>Sullivan, </em>petitioner contends that the actual conflict rendered counsel\u2019s assistance inadequate and ineffective and that a separate showing of prejudice need not be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In response, the state argues that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not have a conflict of interest and, in fact, was working to further petitioner\u2019s interests when she made her remarks to the trial court. The state also argues that, even if petitioner\u2019s trial attorney was inadequate, petitioner was required to prove prejudice and failed to do so. The state contends that the exception in <em>Sullivan </em>is narrower than petitioner interprets it to be and does not apply to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We need not resolve whether the <em>Sullivan </em>exception to the prejudice requirement applies to this circumstance, because we agree with the state that petitioner has failed to prove any inadequacy of counsel. The fundamental premise of petitioner\u2019s argument \u2014 that his trial counsel had an actual conflict of interest under Oregon Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7(a)(2) \u2014 is incorrect. That rule provides that an actual conflict of interest exists if there is <em>\u201ca </em>significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by * * * a personal interest of the lawyer.\u201d Petitioner theorizes that his trial counsel had a personal interest \u2014 preservation of her reputation \u2014 that came into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>conflict with petitioner\u2019s interests when petitioner told the trial court that his counsel had inadequately advised him. But that characterization of trial counsel\u2019s motivation and conduct is not compelled by the record. Relying in part on the testimony of petitioner\u2019s trial counsel, the post-conviction court found that, when trial counsel spoke up to contradict what petitioner had told the trial court, she was acting not to protect herself, but to advocate for what she believed to be petitioner\u2019s actual wishes in the face of \u201cdomineering statements and disruptions\u201d from petitioner\u2019s mother, who did not want petitioner to plead guilty. We readily conclude that that finding is supported by evidence in the record. <em>Brock, </em>98 Or App at 326. Accordingly, the post-conviction court did not err in rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that his trial counsel had a conflict of interest and should have sought to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Although petitioner separately asserts that his trial counsel was inadequate in failing to request a continuance or to object to the trial court\u2019s refusal to set over the sentencing hearing, petitioner makes no argument in support of those contentions other than his conflict-of-interest theory, which we reject. In any event, the record amply supports the post-conviction court\u2019s conclusion that, even if trial counsel had sought a postponement, there is no indication that the trial judge would have granted it. Rather, the record indicates that the trial judge was fully acquainted with the circumstances leading up to the sentencing hearing, had personally observed and interacted with petitioner in settlement conferences, and doubted the veracity of petitioner\u2019s stated reasons for wanting a continuance. Because there is no basis for inferring that the trial court would have granted a continuance if petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had requested one, petitioner has failed to establish prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> The parties\u2019 dispute over the applicability of <em>Sullivan </em>has to do with the nature of the conflict of interest. The state argues that the exception to the prejudice requirement has been applied only to cases involving an attorney\u2019s representation of multiple defendants. Petitioner contends that it has broader application to other forms of conflict of interest. We express no view on the breadth of the exception because, as we explain, there was no conflict of interest in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
