ORS 163.187; ORS 132.586. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s determination that the stipulated facts, recounted in his petition for entry of a guilty plea, were sufficient for the court to find that the act constituted domestic violence. The state contends, among other things, that the judgment is not appealable under ORS 138.050(1). After review of an unusual process, we conclude that the judgment is not appealable on the grounds that defendant raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">On January 26, 2012, defendant was indicted on two counts: felony fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160(3), and felony strangulation, ORS 163.187(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to the second count, the indictment charged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly impede the normal breathing and blood circulation of [defendant\u2019s wife] by applying pressure on the neck and throat [.]\u201d The indictment added, as an element of the crime pursuant to ORS 132.586, that the act constituted domestic violence as defined by ORS 135.230.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">On April 16, 2012, the parties negotiated a guilty plea on a lesser charge of misdemeanor strangulation constituting domestic violence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At least on paper, it appeared to be a complete agreement. Defendant agreed to plead guilty to the second count, strangulation constituting domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>violence, but with the indictment modified to charge the offense as a Class A misdemeanor. The state dismissed the assault count. On a multi-purpose printed form, entitled \u201cPetition to Plead Guilty / No Contest / Conditional Guilty Plea,\u201d defendant indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-4\">\u201c8. I want to plead: X Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">Counts.- <em>misdemeanor Strangulation* * * </em>X Misdemeanor\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Later, the form specified the acts involved with a description:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-7\">\u201c17. X I PLEAD \u2018GUILTY\u2019 because in <em>Umatilla </em>County, Oregon, I did the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">\u201c7 <em>grabbed my wife by the throat causing her normal breathing to be impeded - On 1-25-12</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">\n<em>\u201cThe victim is my spouse.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">(Handwriting in italics.) Defendant left the box blank at paragraph 19 that would have indicated that he entered a conditional plea pursuant to ORS 135.335(3). Immediately below, the form recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">\u201c20. APPEAL RIGHTS Unless this is a conditional plea, I understand the right to appeal my conviction is limited and that I may appeal only if I can make a colorable showing that the sentence exceeds the maximum allowed by law or is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">(Boldface in original.) Defendant signed the form on April 16, 2012. In a proceeding to accept the plea, the trial court verified that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was entered voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly. The court specifically asked defendant, \u201cDo you understand that if you plead guilty and give up your right to trial, the only thing left for me to do will be to sentence you?\u201d Defendant responded that he understood. The court accepted defendant\u2019s plea and set the matter for sentencing at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">On May 4, 2012, the parties appeared for the sentencing hearing. Defense counsel alerted the court that, in-truth, the parties disagreed whether the basis for defendant\u2019s plea had established \u201cconstituting domestic violence\u201d for the purposes of defendant\u2019s strangulation conviction. A predictable colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>\u201cCOURT: The modification of the indictment left intact the state\u2019s allegation that the offense was one of domestic violence, so the court accepted the plea petition on April 16th for misdemeanor strangulation, I had thought, under those circumstances. So why are we arguing whether or not it is a crime involving domestic violence at this point in time, if the plea was accepted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-4\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, the statutes contemplate that there are additional consequences, collateral consequences, that result from a crime of domestic violence, and that is why ORS 132.586 talks about when the state believes that a crime involves domestic violence, that it should be pled, and that it has to be proven at trial as an element of the crime. <em>And what we haven\u2019t agreed on is that last element. </em>We\u2019ve agreed that [defendant] pled to strangulation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">\u201cCOURT: So was this contemplated between the parties when the plea was made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">\u201cCOURT: The domestic violence thing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: No. <em>It was contemplated that the court would decide that issue.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">\u201cSTATE: <em>Essentially, Your Honor, it\u2019s a stipulated facts, </em>[sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">\u201cCOURT: Was that *** what you both had decided at that time, that the court would decide the issue on the domestic violence component?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-12\">\u201cSTATE: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">(Emphases added.) The court repeated that, on April 16, 2012, after modification of the indictment, the court had accepted the plea petition. Both parties confirmed that, at that time, they had not agreed on the added element involving domestic violence and still planned to have the court resolve the dispute. The court explained that it would have proceeded differently, in the earlier proceeding, if the court had understood that the parties had not reached agreement on that point. If there had not been complete agreement, the judge explained, \u201cthen I would have simply said there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>meeting of the minds, and I would have set this matter for trial.\u201d Nevertheless, the court agreed to reschedule for such a hearing, but added that \u201cthe court is reluctant in doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">On May 24, 2012, the parties appeared again for sentencing but with the intention to dispute the element involving domestic violence. The prosecutor and defense attorney explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">\u201cSTATE: *** I guess you could say it\u2019s a stipulated facts trial to the court with closing regarding interpretation of the law, and it has to do with whether strangulation falls under the \u2018constituting domestic violence\u2019 statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">\u00absfc * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, I think it was a guilty plea, not a stipulated facts trial. I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-9\">\u201cSTATE: Well, I mean, basically it\u2019s a guilty plea and the facts have been put into evidence by the guilty plea, and we\u2019re arguing how that applies to the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-10\">\u201cDEFENSE COUNSEL: Right, Your Honor. We wanted the court to decide if the elements of strangulation that [defendant] admitted to in his plea petition constitutes domestic violence or abuse under the statute that we both have briefed for the court. That\u2019s the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">Treating the remaining issue as one to be resolved in a bench trial, the court elicited from defendant a signed waiver of a jury trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties presented no testimony and simply argued whether the facts admitted in the plea document sufficed to prove the requisites for \u201cconstituting domestic violence.\u201d Defense counsel argued that the facts were insufficient to prove \u201cabuse\u201d because there was no stipulation as to physical injury. The victim was defendant\u2019s spouse. But counsel argued that defendant\u2019s act of grabbing his wife by the throat and \u201ccausing her normal breathing to be impeded\u201d was insufficient to permit the court to conclude that there was any harm. Unpersuaded, the court ruled that defendant\u2019s admitted act qualified as abuse and constituted domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>The hearing proceeded to sentencing. Defendant was sentenced to 180 days, suspended for bench probation, with special domestic-violence-related conditions and a fine. The court entered a judgment of conviction for strangulation constituting domestic violence. The judgment specified, \u201cConviction is based upon a plea of Guilty on 04/16/2012.\u201d Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Defendant maintains that we have jurisdiction to entertain his appeal pursuant to ORS 138.040, providing a general right of appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the merits, he assigns error to the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s act of strangulation constituted domestic violence. The state responds that we do not have jurisdiction, because defendant entered a guilty plea, and ORS 138.050 precludes appeal from a guilty verdict on these grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are compelled to agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">\u201cA party does not have an inherent right to appellate court review; the right to appeal is wholly statutory and an appellant must establish that the decision from which the appeal is taken is appealable under some statutory provision.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 74, 261 P3d 1234 (2011); (quoting <em>Waybrant v. Bernstein, </em>294 Or 650, 653, 661 P2d 931 (1983) (brackets omitted)). To determine if we may address an issue raised on appeal, we must resolve whether there is a statutory right to appeal and whether the statute authorizes or limits appellate review of an issue raised in the appeal. <em>State v. Brewer, </em>260 Or App 607, 609, 320 P3d 620, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 380 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Because defendant pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense, this appeal is governed by ORS 138.050. <em>See Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 91 (observing that ORS 138.050 applies to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>and review of sentences for misdemeanor offenses); <em>State v. Stubbs, </em>193 Or App 595, 604, 91 P3d 774 (2004) (ORS 138.050 governs both appealability and reviewability). A defendant who has entered a guilty plea may only appeal a judgment or order described in ORS 138.050(1) (judgments and orders that are subject to appeal) when the defendant \u201cmakes a colorable showing that the disposition\u201d \u201c[e]xceeds the maximum allowable by law\u201d or that it \u201c [i] s unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u201d ORS 138.050(l)(a) - (b); <em>see also State v. Clevenger, </em>297 Or 234, 683 P2d 1360 (1984) (defendant\u2019s appeal assigning error to trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw guilty plea not reviewable under ORS 138.050). Likewise, the court\u2019s review is limited to \u201cwhether the disposition exceeds the maximum allowable by law or is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u201d <em>Brewer, </em>260 Or App at 609; ORS 138.050. Thus, \u201cthe issues that may be appealed and those that may be reviewed in the appeal are the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, defendant does not contend that his sentence exceeds the maximum allowable by law or that it is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Despite the parties\u2019 attempt to treat a portion of the proceeding below as a de facto stipulated-facts trial, the procedure and documents employed were those of a guilty plea.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Without notice to the court of any remaining disputed issue, the parties tendered a written guilty plea on April 16. Without qualification, that written plea indicated that defendant pleaded guilty to Count 2, as modified to charge a misdemeanor. Count 2 remained a charge of strangulation, constituting domestic violence. In the form, defendant acknowledged that he forfeited his right of appeal, except on narrow grounds not available here. On that date, the court proceeded to ensure that the plea was voluntary and that defendant understood that only sentencing remained. After all requisite precautions and formalities, the court accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the guilty plea. In the subsequent hearing of May 4, when the disputed issue was disclosed, the court expressed its reluctance to pursue the parties\u2019 plan, explaining that, if the lack of agreement had been known, the court would have refused to accept the plea and set the matter for trial. At the insistence of the parties, the court heard argument and concluded that the admitted facts constituted domestic violence. The resulting judgment did not provide that the conviction was based upon the court\u2019s conclusions drawn from stipulated facts. Instead, the judgment declared, \u201cConviction is based upon a plea of Guilty * *</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Defendant did not enter a conditional plea. Defendant did not withdraw his guilty plea when the court indicated that the lack of agreement on an offense should ordinarily have required a setting for trial. The court indulged the parties in a \u201cstipulated facts trial\u201d on the one element involving domestic violence. Given, however, the court\u2019s prior acceptance of an unqualified, written, guilty plea, the failure to withdraw the plea, and the entry of conviction based on the plea, the result is not an appealable judgment of conviction under either ORS 138.040 or ORS 138.050. <em>See State v. Woodard, </em>121 Or App 483, 855 P2d 1139, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 26 (1993) (after guilty plea, defendant cannot appeal to dispute whether the facts support the conviction); <em>State v. Wright, </em>109 Or App 495, 497, 820 P2d 824 (1991) (\u201c[0]ne purpose of stipulating to the facts, rather than simply pleading guilty, is to preserve issues for appeal [.]\u201d). We lack jurisdiction to entertain defendant\u2019s appeal. <em>See generally Clevenger, </em>297 Or at 234 (construing ORS 138.050).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\"> ORS 163.187 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of strangulation if the person knowingly impedes the normal breathing or circulation of the blood of another person by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">\u201c(a) Applying pressure on the throat or neck of the other person].]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\"> ORS 132.586 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-11\">\u201c(1) As used in this section, \u2018domestic violence\u2019 has the meaning given to that term in ORS 135.230.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-12\">\u201c(2) When a crime involves domestic violence, the accusatory instrument may plead, and the prosecution may prove at trial, domestic violence as an element of the crime.
