In the course of that stop, the officers came to believe that defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance. The officers questioned defendant and his passenger about controlled-substance use and requested that another officer bring a drug-detection dog to the scene to perform a sniff of the car. The dog alerted to the car; the officers then searched it and discovered heroin and related paraphernalia. In this appeal from the ensuing judgment of conviction for delivery of a controlled substance, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress that evidence. He argues that, under <em>State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 227 P3d 695 (2010), the officers unlawfully extended the traffic stop by commencing a drug investigation and that the extension of the stop was not supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. For the reasons below, we conclude that the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the beginning of the stop to the point at which the officers deployed the dog. However, we agree with defendant that the deployment of the drug-detection dog unlawfully prolonged the stop, was not supported by an objectively reasonable suspicion that drugs were in the car, and that suppression of the evidence obtained as a result of the dog\u2019s deployment was required in consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress for legal error. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 854 P2d 421 (1993). The trial court in this case did not make any explicit factual findings; therefore, where there is evidence from which particular facts could be decided in more than one way, we will presume that the court found the facts in a manner consistent with its legal conclusion so long as there is evidence in the record that would support those findings. <em>State v. Juarez-Godinez, </em>326 Or 1, 7, 924 P2d 772 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Defendant was driving in front of a police cruiser when he made a turn without first signaling for at least 100 feet as required by ORS 811.335(l)(b). Salem Police Officer Gould was driving the police cruiser. Officer Horn was with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>him. They signaled for defendant to stop. Defendant turned into the parking lot of a grocery store; he drove very slowly for approximately 50 yards, passing several open parking spaces before turning into one and stopping. There was one passenger in defendant\u2019s vehicle. It was 1:12 p.m. Gould approached to speak with defendant, and Horn approached to speak with the passenger. Gould asked for defendant\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance. In return, defendant provided him with a student identification card and stated that his license was suspended. Defendant also explained that the car belonged to a friend. Gould asked defendant questions about who owned the car, how defendant had come to be driving it, and where defendant lived. Throughout their conversation, Gould noticed that defendant appeared \u201cvery nervous\u201d and that he was shaking. Gould also took note of defendant\u2019s \u201cvery slow\u201d responses to his questions, which were delivered in a \u201cmonotone\u201d voice and only after a \u201cnoticeable delay.\u201d Gould knew, from his experience and training, that those symptoms \u201coftentimes\u201d resulted from controlled-substance use, and he began to look for other such symptoms. In that vein, he observed that defendant\u2019s pupils were \u201coverly constricted,\u201d given the light of that day; he also observed needle marks on the inside of defendant\u2019s right arm. Gould knew, from experience and training, that hypodermic needle injections often left such marks. Gould testified that, within a minute of their initial contact, he believed that defendant was \u201clikely under the influence of, for example, a narcotic analgesic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Gould asked defendant what the needle marks were from; defendant replied that he had incurred them from drug use about a year before, but that he had not recently been using. Gould did not believe that explanation. As he later explained at the hearing on the motion to suppress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201cThe marks appeared to be fairly fresh \u2014 recent that \u2014 I mean, and you can tell the difference between a recent bruise on somebody\u2019s arm as opposed to a scar, or a permanent mark that \u2014 of something that would have happened a year before. So it was plainly obvious to me, even though I\u2019m not a doctor * * * of those that I\u2019ve seen in the past, that it was very recent that those \u2014 those had been \u2014 been, you know \u2014 needles had been used on the arm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Gould also explained that he believed that defendant had controlled substances in the vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">\u201cWell, in my mind, without questioning him, there was either something going on with the use, or \u2014 or sales of controlled substances. Oftentimes, they go hand-in-hand. Based on my observations on the initial \u2014 the reaction of the initial vehicle to it going at a very delayed place through the parking lot, contacting the driver, my physical observations of him, noticing track marks, his admitted use of \u2014 of narcotics, whether they were \u2014 -you know, even though I saw the signs of recent use, but he said that he\u2019d used a year ago, I believe that there was * * * at the very least, use of * * * controlled substances going on in \u2014 likely in the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Gould continued to question defendant; defendant provided Gould with what Gould considered \u201cvague\u201d answers. Gould asked why he had turned into the parking lot; defendant said that he had done so in order to pick up a friend. Gould asked why he was meeting the friend; defendant paused, looked around, and said, \u201cTo go to the bank.\u201d Gould asked why he was going to the bank; after another pause, defendant replied that the friend owed him $40. Gould asked what the debt was for; defendant said that it was from a long time ago. Gould later testified that he asked those questions as part of a \u201cdrug investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">While Gould was talking with defendant, Horn was talking to defendant\u2019s passenger, Foster. Foster told Horn that they had arrived in the parking lot to meet a friend and take the friend to \u201ca patio job.\u201d After Horn informed Gould of that inconsistency with defendant\u2019s story, Gould returned to his cruiser in order to run routine \u201cwants checks,\u201d to investigate the status of defendant\u2019s driving privileges, and to fill out citations for the vehicular infractions that he had observed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gould testified that it took him two minutes to run the background-type checks and three to four minutes to complete each of two different citations for the vehicular infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>During the time that Gould was either talking to defendant or attending to the vehicular-infraction-related work in his cruiser, Horn requested that another officer, Miller, bring a drug-detection dog to the scene to perform a sniff of defendant\u2019s car. Horn made that request without asking Gould. The reason that Horn requested the dog owed to \u201csuspicions\u201d that he had developed while talking with the passenger, Foster. Horn later summarized those suspicions, stating that he recognized Foster from some sort of previous drug investigation (he also learned that Foster had recently been arrested on a \u201cheroin charge\u201d); Foster\u2019s eyes were red and bloodshot; he was talking slowly and repeating himself \u201cover, and over, and over\u201d; he kept putting his hand underneath his thigh, in what Horn perceived as an attempt to hide something from Horn; and he apparently did not want to put his feet on the coat that was resting on the floorboard beneath him. Horn believed that Foster was \u201cprobably\u201d under the influence of a controlled substance. At the suppression hearing, the prosecutor asked Horn, \u201c[D]o you have any experience with people showing signs such as those, and then having with them some kind of ingestion paraphernalia, or further possessing other controlled substances?\u201d Without further elaboration, Horn answered, \u201cAbsolutely. Absolutely.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Officer Miller arrived on the scene with the drug-detection dog at 1:30 p.m., 10 minutes after he had been called and 18 minutes from the stop\u2019s inception. Gould testified that he did not remember whether he had finished writing out his citations by that point, but that he had not yet given them to defendant. Miller deployed his dog around the car, but believed that the presence of defendant and Foster in the car was affecting the dog\u2019s ability to perform its task. Miller told Gould as much, and asked him if he would get the occupants out of the vehicle. Gould asked defendant and Foster to step out of the car. Once defendant was out of the car, Gould patted him down to search for any weapons that might pose a threat to the officers\u2019 safety. On a second pass, the dog \u201calerted\u201d to the car, which indicated to the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that controlled substances were present. Gould testified that he then believed that he had probable cause to think that there was a controlled substance in the vehicle. He placed defendant in the back of his cruiser, stating that defendant was, at that point, under arrest for a \u201cmisdemeanor crime.\u201d The officers then searched the car. One of them found an eyeglass case in the pocket of a coat that was resting on the passenger-side floor; there was drug paraphernalia inside the case. Another officer discovered a black pouch beneath the \u201cdriver\u2019s side console\u201d; the pouch contained heroin and related paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress all evidence discovered as a result of what he contended was an unlawful extension of the traffic stop for the purpose of conducting a drug investigation. The trial court denied that motion, stating in a brief letter opinion that the officers \u201cdeveloped sufficient reasonable suspicion probable cause [sic] in the course of the routine traffic stop and investigation of defendant\u2019s vehicle to search.\u201d Defendant was subsequently convicted of one count of unlawful delivery of heroin, ORS 475.850, and one count of delivery of heroin within 1,000 feet of a school, ORS 475.882. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Defendant assigns error to the denial of the motion to suppress. He concedes that the traffic stop was lawful at its inception, but contends that, under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, the officers unlawfully extended the traffic stop when they started to conduct a drug investigation and that suppression of the evidence obtained as a result of that extension was required under Rodgers/<em>Kirkeby. </em>Defendant asserts that Gould\u2019s questioning about matters unrelated to the traffic stop and the officers\u2019 call for and deployment of a drug-detection dog prolonged the stop beyond the time reasonably necessary to investigate and process the vehicular infractions. He further contends that those actions were not supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The state responds that none of the officers\u2019 actions actually prolonged the stop beyond what was reasonably necessary to deal with the vehicular infractions and that, in all events, any extension of the stop was justified because it was based on a reasonable suspicion of defendant\u2019s involvement in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Article I, section 9, establishes the right of the people \u201cto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure.\u201d A \u201cstop\u201d is a type of seizure; it is \u201ca temporary restraint of a person\u2019s liberty for the purpose of criminal investigation\u201d and must be justified by a \u201creasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Rodgers /Kirkeby, </em>347 Or at 621. \u201cPolice can conduct a stop for violation of a traffic offense if they have probable cause to believe that the offense has occurred and that belief is reasonable.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>238 Or App 75, 78-79, 241 P3d 757 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 664 (2011).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">\u201cPolice authority to perform a traffic stop arises out of the facts that created probable cause to believe that there has been unlawful, noncriminal activity, <em>viz., </em>a traffic infraction.

Other or further conduct by the police, beyond that reasonably related to the traffic violation, must <em>he justified </em>on some basis other than the traffic violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or at 623 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We begin with defendant\u2019s contention that certain questions that Gould asked defendant were unrelated to the valid purposes of the stop. <em>See State v. Farrar, </em>252 Or App 256, 260, 287 P3d 1124 (2012) (\u201cAn officer unlawfully extends the scope of an otherwise lawful stop if the officer questions the person about matters unrelated to the basis for the traffic stop without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Specifically, defendant identifies Gould\u2019s questions about defendant\u2019s needle marks, about where defendant was going, and about whom defendant was going to meet as those that prolonged the stop. We understand defendant to contend that those questions both prolonged the stop and were not reasonably related to \u2014 what he concedes were\u2014 the legitimate justifications for the stop, <em>viz., </em>addressing the vehicular infractions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The state quotes <em>State v. Dennis, </em>250 Or App 732, 737, 282 P3d 955 (2012), for the proposition that \u201cthere are no Article I, section 9, implications if an inquiry unrelated to the traffic stop occurs during a routine stop but does not delay it.\u201d <em>See Hall, </em>238 Or App at 83 (questions posed by an officer that are unrelated to the purposes of the traffic stop but that occur during an \u201cunavoidable lull\u201d in the course of the stop do not implicate Article I, section 9). The state thus contends that defendant did not show that the \u201cquestions asked of him in this case resulted in any increase in the length of his detention.\u201d We need not decide whether that is the case, for we conclude that, even with any prolongation of the stop, that questioning was justified by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">\u201cA stop of a person by a police officer is supported by reasonable suspicion when the officer subjectively believes that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime and that belief is objectively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances existing at the time of the stop. To be objectively reasonable, the officer\u2019s suspicion must be based on specific and articulable facts. A police officer\u2019s training and experience are relevant considerations that bear on the reasonable factual inferences that an officer may draw.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>State v. Maciel, </em>254 Or App 530, 535, 295 P3d 145 (2013) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">These are the facts known to Gould at the time he began questioning defendant: defendant had made a sudden left turn and then drove very slowly through a parking lot, passing several open parking spaces after Gould signaled him to stop; he had \u201cvery recent\u201d needle marks on his arm that were inconsistent with his explanation that he had used drugs approximately one year earlier; defendant was acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>very nervous and his hands were shaking; he was speaking very slowly in a monotone voice; there was a \u201cnoticeable delay\u201d in his answers to Gould\u2019s questions; and his pupils were overly constricted, given the level of daylight. Based on those facts, Gould, a trained member of the Salem Police Department Drug Activity Response Team, testified that he believed that defendant was \u201clikely under the influence of, for example, a narcotic analgesic.\u201d Defendant points to <em>State v. Frias, </em>229 Or App 60, 210 P3d 914 (2009), <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>202 Or App 73, 121 P3d 13, <em>modified on recons, </em>203 Or App 35, 125 P3d 22 (2005), and <em>State v. Ehret (A111248), </em>184 Or App 1, 9, 55 P3d 512 (2002), for the proposition that an officer\u2019s knowledge that a suspect has been involved with drugs at some point in the past does not support a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. That may be true as a general rule, but those cases are easily distinguishable for the reason that, here, there are ample facts from which Gould could reasonably conclude, in light of his experience and training, that defendant was under the influence of a controlled <em>substance </em>\u2014 viz., an <em>intoxicant </em>\u2014 while <em>driving a car. See </em>ORS 813.010(1); <em>cf. Frias, </em>229 Or App at 65 (there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of driving under the influence of intoxicants); <em>Holcomb, </em>202 Or App at 75 (the officer \u201cconcluded that [the defendant] was not under the influence of a controlled substance\u201d); <em>Ehret, </em>184 Or App at 10 (\u201cNothing in the record would permit the inference that [the officer] subjectively believed that defendant had been driving while under the influence.\u201d). In light of the facts known to him, Gould\u2019s suspicion that defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant was objectively reasonable; therefore, he was justified in commencing an investigation into defendant\u2019s recent <em>use </em>of a controlled substance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">That leaves defendant\u2019s contention that the officers unlawfully extended the stop by sending for a drug-detection dog and allowing the dog to sniff the car. On that point, defendant contends that, even if Gould had a reasonable suspicion that he was under the influence of narcotics, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Gould\u2019s belief that there were <em>narcotics in the vehicle </em>was not reasonable. That is, argues defendant, Gould\u2019s belief that defendant was presently under the influence of an intoxicant could not justify the extension of the stop for the purpose of deploying a drug-detection dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The state attempts to forestall the need to examine the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 suspicions about the presence of drugs in the car by arguing that the call for and deployment of the dog did not, in any event, prolong the stop, and thus required no additional justification. We agree with the state that the act of calling for the drug dog did not prolong the stop. In accordance with our standard of review, 267 Or App at 383, the record shows that Gould was in the process of writing his citations at the time that Horn sent for the dog. It also reveals that Gould was working on the citations during the time that it took for Miller and his dog to reach the scene. The state\u2019s contention that the <em>deployment </em>of the drug dog did not prolong the stop, however, finds no evidentiary support. To the contrary, Gould testified that, during the dog sniff, he \u201cwas standing and watching\u2014 watching the dog because both \u2014 both [defendant] and Foster were still in the vehicle at that point.\u201d Gould testified that he then removed defendant from the car at the request of Miller and for the purpose of facilitating the dog\u2019s work. Although Gould could not remember whether he had completed the citations by that time, he stated that he had not yet given any of them to defendant. It is not possible to conclude from that testimony other than that the deployment of the dog prolonged the stop; Gould could have been completing whatever work remained to process the vehicular infractions at a time that he was instead facilitating the dog sniff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The question then becomes whether the deployment of the drug-detection dog was supported by a reasonable suspicion that there were drugs present in the vehicle. As our framing of that question implies, we agree with defendant that, unlike Gould\u2019s questioning of defendant, the act of deploying the dog cannot be supported as \u201creasonably related\u201d to Gould\u2019s suspicion of DUII. The gravamen of that crime, of course, is driving under the influence of an intoxicant. However, \u201can officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion about certain crimes <em>does not justify </em>the officer\u2019s extension of a stop to conduct an investigation of another crime for which the officer does not also have reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>State v. Kentopp, </em>251 Or App 527, 534, 284 P3d 564 (2012) (emphasis in original). In other words, Article I, section 9, requires \u201cthat law enforcement officers have a justification for temporarily seizing or stopping a person to conduct an investigation, and that the officer\u2019s activities be reasonably related to that investigation and reasonably necessary to effectuate it.\u201d <em>State v. Watson, </em>353 Or 768, 781, 305 P3d 94 (2013); <em>see Maciel, </em>254 Or App at 537 (officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that the car in which defendant was a passenger was stolen did not support extension of stop to initiate drug-trafficking investigation). A drug-detection dog detects the presence of drugs, not whether a person is intoxicated. It is for that reason that the relevant question is whether Gould\u2019s stated belief that there were drugs in the <em>car </em>\u2014 e.g., the circumstance that would support the deployment of a drug-detection dog \u2014 was objectively reasonable. <em>But see State v. Nevel, </em>126 Or App 270, 275, 888 P2d 1338 (1994) (\u201c[The officer\u2019s] inquiry of defendant concerning the possibility of methamphetamine in his van was not unrelated to [the crime of DUII] and thus was within the permissible scope of questioning under ORS 131.615(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Having staked its arguments largely on the premise that the stop was not prolonged, the state does not exert any significant effort to argue that the deployment of the drug dog was supported by a reasonable suspicion that defendant <em>presently possessed a controlled substance. </em>Instead, it merely offers the conclusory statement that any extension of the stop was \u201cjustified by reasonable suspicion that drugs or drug paraphernalia would be found in the vehicle\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have had frequent occasion to consider whether an officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that a person is under the influence of a drug is sufficient on its own to provide an objectively reasonable basis for concluding that the person presently possesses drugs; we have consistently conclude that it does not. <em>See Kentopp, </em>251 Or App at 532 (\u201c[A]n officer\u2019s observation of signs of a person\u2019s past drug use does not, by itself, give rise to reasonable suspicion that the person currently possesses drugs.\u201d); <em>State v. Morton, </em>151 Or App 734, 739, 951 P2d 179 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 521 (1998) (officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that a defendant passenger possessed marijuana, despite the officer\u2019s observations that the defendant\u2019s appearance and behavior were consistent with being under the influence of that drug); <em>Farrar, </em>252 Or App at 261 (\u201c[E]vidence of methamphetamine use, without more, does not give rise to reasonable suspicion that defendant presently possesses more methamphetamine.\u201d); <em>accord State v. Lavender, </em>93 Or App 361, 762 P2d 1027 (1988) (officer\u2019s belief that the defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance at the time of her arrest was insufficient to support probable cause to believe that she possessed drugs, even when she was being arrested on a warrant for controlled-substance possession and had attempted to hide the contents of her purse from the view of the arresting officers). <em>But see State v. Blount, </em>143 Or App 582, 589, 924 P2d 860, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 488 (1996) (officer\u2019s observation that the defendant appeared to be on methamphetamine, when combined with the defendant\u2019s location in an area known for drug activity and a lack of evidence that \u201csomeone other than [the] defendant had introduced the methamphetamine into [the] defendant\u2019s body,\u201d established probable cause for the officer to think that the defendant had \u201cpossessed methamphetamine before introducing it into his body\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Thus, something more is required than an officer\u2019s reasonable belief that a suspect is under the influence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>controlled substance to render a suspicion of present possession objectively reasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the suppression hearing, the state asked Gould about the basis for his belief that there were controlled substances in the car.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">\u201c[STATE]: So based on your training and experience, did you \u2014 do you have an experience in the area of if someone has used recently, whether or not they would possibly have any kind of controlled substances on their person, or within their vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">\u201c[GOULD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\u201c[STATE]: And what can you [tell] the Court about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">\u201c[GOULD]: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s my experience, even if somebody doesn\u2019t have the actual substance with them, they\u2019ll oftentimes carry a \u2014 I\u2019d say a drug kit. They\u2019ll carry that, say, in an eyeglass container with their syringes that they can use, a lighting source, a spoon, for, in this case, heroin, that they\u2019ll \u2014 they\u2019ll use a spoon. So different \u2014 at least paraphernalia, and then also likely substance that they keep with them. I know that specifically heroin users oftentimes, if they have a strong addiction, will have to use regularly, so in \u2014 in order not to get sick, so in that case, they oftentimes keep those things with them closely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Defense counsel asked Horn about the basis for his belief that there were drugs in the car:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So *** you indicated that you had reasonable suspicion that there w[ere] narcotics in the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">\u201c[HORN]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And that was based on your knowledge of the driver from the \u2014 what turned out to be the prior investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201c[HORN]: The passenger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m sorry.

That is, despite that his \u201ctraining and experience\u201d taught him that heroin users often carry \u201cdrug kits\u201d about <em>them </em>\u2014 i.e., the very inference that, standing alone, we have repeatedly declared insufficient \u2014 Gould never identified anything that could serve as the \u201csomething more\u201d that our cases demand.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">That leaves Horn\u2019s knowledge of Foster\u2019s prior involvement in drug activity and observations about Foster\u2019s movements, the \u201cshuffling of his feet\u201d around the coat, and his \u201cputting his hand under his thigh\u201d repeatedly. As an initial matter, Horn\u2019s testimony about the coat was so vague and equivocal that it is impossible to ascribe it any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>significance in our analysis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As to the movements around his thigh, neither officer testified at any point that he had observed any contraband or object associated with drug use, nor any containers that might indicate, for one reason or another, that they contained illicit items. The implication, of course, was that Foster might have had something under his thigh that he wanted concealed from police view, but in no way was that suspicion of Horn\u2019s verified through direct observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Even more problematic is that that testimony reveals that Horn\u2019s suspicions were entirely centered on Foster. However, \u201c[t]he officer\u2019s suspicion must be \u2018particularized to the individual based on the individual\u2019s own conduct.\u2019 <em>\u201d Farrar, </em>252 Or App at 260 (quoting <em>State v. Miglavs, </em>337 Or 1, 12, 90 P3d 607 (2004)). That is, even assuming that it was objectively reasonable to think that Foster, based on his intoxication, his peculiar movements, and his prior involvement with drugs, had concealed drugs under his leg or in the coat at his feet, the state has not explained how that suspicion justified prolonging the stop of <em>defendant </em>on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that <em>defendant </em>presently possessed drugs. It is that stop, however, that is at issue in this appeal. The indicators of criminal activity that were articulated by the officers, other than defendant\u2019s intoxication, were entirely centered on Foster, but there is no indication, on this record, that prolonging the detention of defendant was necessary to investigate Foster based on a reasonable suspicion that Foster was carrying drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Consider the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State v. Holdorf, </em>355 Or 812, 333 P3d 982 (2014). There, a defendant was a passenger in a car being driven by a \u201cknown felon with an outstanding warrant who was under investigation as a suspect in a local methamphetamine distribution ring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829. After a police officer lawfully stopped the car for a traffic infraction, the officer saw that the defendant was \u201ctweaking,\u201d that is, under the influence of methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>at 815. The defendant asked if he was free to leave; the officer told him that he was not. The officer then asked the defendant if there were any weapons in the vehicle; the defendant responded that there was a knife between the seat and the door. The officer opened the door and saw a knife. The defendant stepped out of the vehicle. The officer patted him down, finding a knife and metal containers inside the defendant\u2019s pockets. Marijuana and methamphetamine \u201cwere subsequently found inside the containers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The court addressed \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s observation that [the] defendant appeared to be under the influence of methamphetamine, based on the officer\u2019s training and experience, was sufficient to establish \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 that [the] defendant had committed the crime of possession of methamphetamine when considered under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814. The court concluded that the officer\u2019s observation that the defendant was \u201ctweaking,\u201d when coupled with the knowledge that the driver was a \u201cknown felon with an outstanding warrant who was under investigation as a suspect in a local methamphetamine distribution ring,\u201d was sufficient to \u201cg[i]ve rise to a reasonable inference that the defendant committed the crime of possession of methamphetamine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><em>Holdorf </em>only addressed whether there was reasonable suspicion to conduct a stop in the first place, <em>i.e., </em>whether it was objectively reasonable to conclude that the defendant \u201chas committed a crime or is about to commit a crime.\u201d 355 Or at 823. Whether it was reasonable to conclude that the defendant presently possessed drugs \u2014 the relevant issue in this case \u2014 is a point on which <em>Holdorf </em>had nothing to say. <em>See Watson, </em>353 Or at 781 (\u201c[B]oth Oregon statutes and [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Supreme] [C]ourt\u2019s Article I, section 9, case law require that law enforcement officers have a justification for temporarily seizing or stopping a person to conduct an investigation, <em>and </em>that the officer\u2019s activities be reasonably related to that investigation and reasonably necessary to effectuate it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). In other words, even if we assume that it was reasonable to think that defendant had possessed drugs before consuming them, that only takes the state as far as it got in <em>Holdorf: </em>that it was lawful to stop the defendant. The question here though is whether the deployment of the drug-detection dog was supported \u2014 as we conclude it was required to be \u2014 by an objectively reasonable suspicion that defendant was <em>presently </em>in possession of drugs. On this record, there were insufficient facts to render it objectively reasonable to conclude that defendant \u2014 presently\u2014 possessed drugs; we conclude that the extension of the stop was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Our remaining task is to determine whether that conclusion requires that the evidence should have been suppressed. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>313 Or 246, 249, 834 P2d 1008 (1992) (Oregon\u2019s constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures includes the right to be free from the use, in a criminal prosecution, of evidence obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9). Whenever the state has obtained evidence following the violation of a defendant\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights, it is presumed that the evidence was tainted by the violation and must be suppressed. <em>See State v. Unger, </em>356 Or 59, 84, 333 P3d 1009 (2014). The state may rebut that presumption by establishing that the disputed evidence \u201cdid not derive from the preceding illegality.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005). One of the ways that the state may do so is by \u201cshowing that the observance of lawful procedures inevitably would have brought the evidence to light.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In what is perhaps a misstatement of the applicable burden, the state argues that \u201cthere is no basis for concluding that the evidence defendant sought to suppress would not have been discovered but for his extended detention.\u201d For that proposition, the state argues that defendant would not have been allowed to drive his car away for either of two reasons: (1) he was already under arrest for the crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>failing to present a valid license at the time of the dog sniff, and (2) defendant was not, in any event, licensed to drive. Thus, urges the state, the car would have remained parked where it was after the stop of defendant was over, Miller and his dog would have arrived, and the evidence would have, inevitably, been discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The argument that defendant was already under arrest for failing to present a valid license is not supported by the record. Gould testified that he arrested defendant for a \u201cmisdemeanor crime\u201d immediately after the dog alerted to the car. Although Gould never stated the precise basis for that arrest, it defies all reason to suggest that Gould spent more than 18 minutes, in part, engaged in preparing a citation to issue defendant for his failure to carry a license and then, immediately after a drug dog sniffed his car, in the middle of a drug investigation involving three officers, and in apparent contravention of his department\u2019s policy, suddenly decided to arrest him for the license offense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In other words, the record admits of no doubt that the arrest occurred <em>because </em>of the dog sniff.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">That leaves the state\u2019s second hypothetical that, even if the stop had not ended in his arrest, the car would have remained parked lawfully where it was because defendant was not privileged to drive. The difficulty with that argument is that it assumes that defendant would have\u2014 after he was no longer stopped and thus free to carry on his way \u2014 left his possessions in the car. There is neither a basis in the record for that assumption, nor is there an argument from the state that the officers would have been entitled to seize or search either the coat or the black pouch in the event that defendant had attempted to leave with them before the dog alerted to the car.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state has failed to establish that the evidence obtained after the dog sniff would inevitably have been discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In sum, based on defendant\u2019s concession that the traffic stop was lawful at its inception, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion with respect to the evidence that was obtained from the beginning of the stop to the point at which the officers deployed the drug dog. However, because the deployment of the drug dog prolonged the stop and was not supported by an objectively reasonable suspicion that drugs would be found in the vehicle, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress that evidence obtained after the drug dog was deployed. Consequently, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> Failure to carry or present a license is a misdemeanor criminal offense. ORS 807.570. Driving with a suspended or revoked license may be either a felony or misdemeanor offense. ORS 811.182. Failure to signal is a traffic violation. ORS 811.335(l)(b). For simplicity\u2019s sake, we will refer to those offenses and that violation collectively as the \u201cvehicular infractions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-5\"> At some point, apparently while Gould was working on processing the citations, Horn asked for consent to search the vehicle; both defendant and Foster declined to give that consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> Gould stated that the reason he inquired about where defendant was going and whom he was meeting was to investigate drug crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> In <em>Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>the Supreme Court noted that \u201cverbal inquiries are not searches and seizures. *** However, police conduct that involves physical restraint or a show of authority that restricts an individual\u2019s freedom of movement typically does implicate Article I, section 9.\u201d 347 Or at 627. There is no suggestion that defendant ever ceased to be \u201cseized\u201d throughout the course of the encounter. <em>See State v. Ehret (A111248), </em>184 Or App 1, 8, 55 P3d 512 (2002) (\u201cThis case is not like those cases in which a conversation occurred between a citizen and a police officer after a traffic stop has ended.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b412-5\"> Defendant\u2019s only contention regarding Gould\u2019s questioning is that Gould did not have a reasonable suspicion to think that defendant had engaged in criminal activity; there is no argument from defendant that the questions asked by Gould were not sufficiently tailored to the scope of his suspicions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b413-5\"> The state argues that, because defendant\u2019s license was suspended, he would have been asked to step out of the car in any event, and that the act of removing him from the car did not add to the length of the stop. We fail to see how that is the case. Certainly, defendant would not be permitted to drive away from the scene, but we do not understand why that leads to the conclusion that defendant would have been removed from the car, patted down, and detained for the time that the dog took to sniff his car twice. The state also argues that there were, at the time of the dog sniff, lots of \u201cloose ends that had to be tied up\u201d by the officers that had to do with the vehicular infractions before the stop could end. To that, we can only say that, in the absence of reasonable suspicion to support the deployment of the drug dog, the officers should have been tying them up.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b415-5\"> The state does not separately argue that the dog sniff was justified as part of an investigation that was reasonably related to the crime of DUII. <em>See generally Watson, </em>353 Or at 781 (noting that when officers temporarily seize or stop a person for purposes of conducting an investigation, the officers\u2019 activities must \u201cbe reasonably related to that investigation and reasonably necessary to effectuate it\u201d). Accordingly, we express no opinion on that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b416-12\"> That is, of course, a distinct question from whether present intoxication can support an objectively reasonable suspicion that a suspect previously possessed drugs, <em>i.e., </em>immediately before consuming them. The reasonableness of <em>that </em>inference, however, is not at issue here: a drug dog detects the presence of drugs, not prior drug consumption. <em>See State v. Kolb, </em>251 Or App 303, 310-11, 283 P3d 423 (2012) (explaining the distinction and declining to consider state\u2019s \u201c\u2018recent past possession\u2019 theory of reasonable suspicion\u201d where the state failed to preserve that argument); <em>see also Watson, </em>353 Or at 781 (\u201c[T]he officer\u2019s activities [must] be reasonably related to that investigation and reasonably necessary to effectuate it.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\"> The state does not specifically suggest that Gould\u2019s belief that there was a \u201cdrug kit\u201d in the ear \u2014 that is, syringes, a spoon, and a \u201clighting source\u201d\u2014 supported the extension of the stop for the purposes of deploying a drug dog. Even if we did discern such an argument, we would, on this record, reject it for the reasons stated in <em>Kolb, </em>251 Or App at 314-15 (\u201c[T]here is absolutely no basis in this record from which one can infer, without resorting to speculation, that [the fact that drug paraphernalia may bear traces of prior use] applies specifically to methamphetamine use, yielding an objectively reasonable prospect that implements of recent use will bear or contain detectable traces of the controlled substance. <em>That </em>\u2018bridge\u2019 was never \u2018built.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis in original.)). To the reasoning in <em>Kolb, </em>we might add that, in this case, there was no evidence presented that the dog could detect the residue left on used drug implements; the only evidence was that the dog was trained to detect the \u201codors\u201d of marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b418-5\"> Horn testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201cWell, there was a coat \u2014 -down there was a coat on the floorboard, and it was like he was \u2014 I mean, normal people when they sit there, and there\u2019s stuff on the floorboard, they just kind of \u2014 their feet are already in the position that they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re not on something.
