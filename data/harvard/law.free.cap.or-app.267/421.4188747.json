As part of the plea negotiations, defendant agreed to allow the state additional time to present the court with evidence of the nature and amount of any claimed restitution, and the state asked for \u201c90 days to get that sorted out.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 137.106(1)(b) (2011), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2013, ch 388, \u00a7 1 (stating that restitution will be \u201cbased upon a determination made by the court within 90 days of entry of the judgment\u201d unless the court \u201cextend [s] the time within which the determination and supplemental judgment may be completed for good cause\u201d). The court eventually imposed restitution after that 90-day period expired, over defendant\u2019s objection that the determination was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court failed to make the necessary \u201cgood cause\u201d determination under ORS 137.106(l)(b) (2011) before imposing restitution more than 90 days after entry of judgment. We agree with defendant\u2019s argument, vacate the supplemental judgment, and remand for the trial court to consider whether, at the time the court entered the supplemental judgment, there was good cause to extend the restitution determination. <em>See, e.g., State v. Beckham, </em>253 Or App 609, 292 P3d 611 (2012).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Supplemental judgment vacated and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\"> In a separate assignment of error, defendant argues that the restitution award amounted to a windfall for the victim. Because we vacate and remand the restitution award, we do not address that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
