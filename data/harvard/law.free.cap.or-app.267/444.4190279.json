J.</author>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Claimant seeks judicial review after the Employment Appeals Board (EAB) denied her unemployment benefits. The Employment Department (department) initially allowed benefits. Employer Wells Fargo requested a hearing on that allowance, but its request was untimely, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that employer lacked good cause for its tardiness. EAB reversed the ALJ, concluding that employer had good cause for filing a late hearing request. Claimant contends that EAB did not adequately explain why it disagreed with an explicit credibility determination that was central to the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that there was not good cause for employer\u2019s untimely request. We agree with claimant and, therefore, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Except as noted below, we summarize the facts from the board\u2019s findings and the undisputed evidence in the record that is not inconsistent with those findings. <em>Campbell v. Employment Dept., </em>245 Or App 573, 575, 263 P3d 1122 (2011). Employer terminated claimant\u2019s employment, and she sought unemployment benefits. On October 18, 2011, the department determined that employer had discharged claimant, but not for misconduct, and, accordingly, allowed claimant unemployment benefits. That decision included the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cIF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS DECISION SEE THE ENCLOSED INFORMATION FOR YOUR APPEAL RIGHTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\u201cDate Mailed: October 18, 2011. Any appeal from this decision must be filed on or before November 07, 2011 to be timely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\u201cIMPORTANT INFORMATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">\u201cIf you disagree with the enclosed Administrative Decision, PLEASE USE THE FORM BELOW TO REQUEST A HEARING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">\u00abHi * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">\u201c\u2022 Mail or fax this form to the Office of Administrative Hearings by the date stated on the administrative decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(Capitalization and underscoring in original.) Employer\u2019s representative, Barnett Associates, received the decision on October 21, 2011. Barnett filed a \u201crequest for relief of charges\u201d (Form 197) with the department on November 1, 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Barnett did not request a hearing to contest the unemployment compensation determination by the department until November 17, 2011, 10 days after the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">On January 6, 2012, ALJ Janzen held a hearing, in part to consider whether employer had good cause for filing a late hearing request. Employer argued that there was good cause for its late hearing request because Barnett staff had received incorrect advice from the department about when such a request could be filed. In support of that argument, employer offered the testimony of Danielle Sfera, an employee of Barnett. Because of the importance of Sfera\u2019s testimony to this case, we set it out in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Sfera first responded to questions from ALJ Janzen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201cQ Okay, who would have been responsible for reading [the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\u201cA That would be me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\u201cQ And * * * is there some kind of procedure, or who makes the decision on whether to appeal something or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">\u201cA We give our recommendation to Wells Fargo, but ultimately, the decision is up to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">\u201cQ What happened after you received this particular decision? What was the interaction between Barnett Associates and Wells Fargo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">\u201cA Well, at the time that this one was received, there was no interaction, as we hadn\u2019t received the claim, the request for separation, from the state. We still haven\u2019t received that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>claim here at Barnett, as those claims do go to the location, they don\u2019t come here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u201cQ Why did you need the request for separation to *** contact the client in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201cA Well, without answering that claim, we don\u2019t have rights to protest that determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201cQ What do you mean by that, what are you talking about with the request for separation, what is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201cA The actual claim from the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\"><em>\u201cQ </em>Okay * * * explain this a little bit more to me. Can you sort of describe the procedure or policy that goes on after you receive an administrative decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">\u201cA Sure. Well, first we receive the initial claim for unemployment, in which case we would reach out to Wells Fargo to get the separation information to see why the claimant no longer works for the company. After that information is submitted to the state, then they would get the administrative decision, which allows or denies the claimant unemployment. When we received this administrative decision, we had no rights to protest because we never answered that initial claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">\u201cQ Who answered the initial claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">\u201cA That initial claim usually goes to the location, it usually goes to the branch, as we cannot file powers of attorney in Oregon, it\u2019s a work site state, so those claims go directly to the employer, they wouldn\u2019t come to Barnett.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">\u201cQ Okay, so when you received this particular administrative decision, * * * what was done with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">\u201cA That was scanned into [claimant\u2019s] file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-14\">\u201cQ And was anything else done with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-15\">\u201cA We waited until we received the relief of charges, and that\u2019s when the state informed me that that\u2019s when we could appeal, at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-16\">\u201cQ You could have \u2014 Barnett could have \u2014 what do you mean, you could appeal, what does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-17\">\u201cA We could appeal the relief of charges, because that\u2019s the only form that we received here at Barnett.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u201cQ And what about the administrative decision that\u2019s at issue here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">\u201cA We did not appeal that one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cQ * * * Can you explain to me why * * * Barnett Associates did not appeal the administrative decision on behalf of Wells Fargo until what appears to be November 17th, 2011?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cA When we received the administrative decision, a call was made to the state to see if we lost our rights to appeal that decision. They informed us that because the initial claim was never answered, we could not appeal this decision, we would have to wait until we received the relief of charges decision, which we received the relief of charges form here, so we answered that timely. And then as soon as we received the relief of charges decision, which informed us that * * * the state could not relieve our account of* * * charges, we then went ahead and appealed that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cQ When *** Barnett Associates received the administrative decision here, is there any reason why it didn\u2019t just contact Wells Fargo to let it know that it had received this decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201cA No[t] that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Claimant\u2019s lawyer then asked Sfera why Barnett did not seek a hearing on the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits, and Sfera responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">\u201cWell, because when we received the administrative decision, we only had the relief of charges form. We didn\u2019t get the actual termination. I forget what form it is, but Oregon has two separate claim forms \u2014 one is a relief of charges and one is the actual unemployment claim. When we received this, all we had in our office was the relief of charges. So when a call was made to the state, they told us that we needed to wait to appeal the relief of charges decision, we could not appeal this administrative decision, because we never answered that initial claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">\u201cQ You were told by a representative of the state that you could not appeal this decision until you received a separate form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">A Yes:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The ALJ then asked some follow-up questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">\u201cQ [W]ho made the call to the state about * * * appealing this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201cA That I\u2019m not 100 percent sure of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">\u201cQ Do you have notes on \u2014 in your file about this at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201cA No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">\u201cQ Do you know when that call was made to the state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">\u201cA I don\u2019t want to say for sure, but it would probably be the 21st or the 22nd, right after we received that administrative decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">\u201cQ And were any notes made about who said \u2014 or which representative said that Barnett Associates couldn\u2019t appeal until this other information was received?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">\u201cA Not by me, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Claimant\u2019s lawyer then asked additional questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">\u201cQ How are you so sure * * * that you were advised affirmatively that you could not appeal this decision * * * but yet you do not know who would have called the State of Oregon and been told this, or when they would have called *** what evidence do you have that this was what was said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">\u201cA No, I didn\u2019t make that call. That\u2019s just what I was told after the call was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-15\">\u201cQ Who * * * told you this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-16\">\u201cA Somebody at Barnett.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-17\">\u201cQ But you don\u2019t want to disclose who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-18\">\u201cA I don\u2019t know if I can. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-19\">\u201cALJ JANZEN: Well, I\u2019ll chime in here. I can only go off of information that\u2019s provided in this hearing. *** [W]finesses who are at least named assist me in making decisions on how much weight to give hearsay evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-20\">\u201c [WELLS FARGO REPRESENTATIVE]: I would advise, Ms. Sfera, if you know the name, you\u2019re more than free to provide it, if you have that with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-21\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u201cALJ JANZEN: Okay. Ms. Sfera, do you know the name of the individual who gave you that information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">\u201cMS. SFERA: I can\u2019t recall who told me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">To summarize, employer\u2019s position \u2014 supported primarily if not exclusively by Sfera\u2019s testimony \u2014 was that, when Barnett received the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits, it had not received claimant\u2019s claim for unemployment benefits and, accordingly, had not answered that claim. Employer further asserted that Barnett believed that, without answering the claim, it had no right to seek a hearing on the decision allowing benefits; instead, it had to wait for the \u201crelief of charges decision,\u201d at which point it could appeal. Sfera explained that that belief was based on a phone call that her coworker \u2014 whose name she could not recall \u2014 made to an unspecified state office. That phone call was not documented in Barnett\u2019s files. Because Barnett misunderstood employer\u2019s rights, based on advice from the department, employer asserted that it had good cause for not filing a timely hearing request on the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The ALJ dismissed employer\u2019s hearing request. The ALJ found that the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits was based, in part, on a request for separation information (Form 220) supplied by Barnett on October 11, 2011.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ also found that Sfera\u2019s testimony was not credible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">\u201cSfera did not know who had the conversation with [the department], who the [department] representative was who provided the information, or when the phone call was made. * * * Sfera\u2019s hearsay testimony is not credible. I have found facts accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The ALJ accordingly concluded that evidence that employer believed, based on information provided from the department, that it could not challenge the administrative decision allowing benefits until it filed its request for relief from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>charges did not meet employer\u2019s burden to prove that it had good cause to file a late hearing request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Employer appealed to EAB, which reversed the ALJ\u2019s order. EAB found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">\u201cPrior to [the hearingbefore ALJ Janzen], Barnett staff mistakenly believed that [employer] had not filed a response to the Department\u2019s request for separation information (Form 220), and consequently, that the employer had forfeited any right to request a hearing on [the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits]. After Barnett received notice of [the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits], its staff contacted the Department to confirm their understanding that employer had no hearing rights. From that contact, Barnett staff understood or misunderstood that the employer \u2018could not appeal,\u2019 and to wait for the Form 197 [notice of potential charges], which they did. *** As a consequence of Barnett\u2019s staffs contacts with the Department, and consequent confusion over the Department\u2019s appeal processes, Barnett mistakenly failed to file a request for hearing * * * until ten days after the filing deadline had expired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">EAB concluded that employer had met its burden to establish good cause for filing a late hearing request, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">\u201cThe Department\u2019s processes are varied and complex, some would say unnecessarily so. The hearing record contains abundant evidence that Barnett staff were confused by the Department\u2019s acronyms for, and arcane distinctions between, types of decisions and the procedures that must be used to perfect each type of appeal. And, although the Department\u2019s witnesses and the ALJ each seemed to understand the processes with which they were familiar, there were other, \u2018related\u2019 processes that they very clearly did not understand, and so were unable to clarify at the hearing as one might have expected them to do. It is, therefore, entirely plausible that Barnett staff were misinformed in their dealings with the Department as to whether, when, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>and how they might request a hearing on [the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">EAB relied on its own decision in <em>Robert J. Moreau </em>(EAB Decision ll-AB-2800 (Oct 5, 2011)) and our decision in <em>Meritage at Little Creek v. Employment Dept., </em>232 Or App 554, 222 P3d 736 (2009), cases in which reliance on or confusion resulting from misleading advice from the department had constituted good cause for a late hearing request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> EAB concluded that (1) \u201cto the extent the employer filed a late request for hearing as the result of the Department\u2019s faulty, misleading or misunderstood advice, good cause has been shown\u201d under <em>Meritage at Little Creek </em>and (2) to the extent that employer filed a late hearing request as the result of a mistake, the mistake was excusable under OAR 471-040-0010.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Generally, a party may appeal an adverse department decision within 20 days. ORS 657.269. However, for good cause, the period may be extended for a time that is reasonable under the circumstances of each case. ORS 657.875. \u201c\u2018Good cause\u2019 exists when an action, delay, or failure to act arises from excusable mistake or from factors beyond an applicant\u2019s reasonable control.\u201d OAR 471-040-0010(1). Here, EAB determined that employer submitted a late hearing request as the result of misleading advice and excusable mistake. We review the evidentiary support for the board\u2019s factual findings that are pertinent to its good cause determination for substantial evidence, ORS 183.482(8)(c), and review the legal sufficiency of the resulting good cause determination for substantial reason and legal error, ORS 183.482(8)(a). \u201cSubstantial reason\u201d is \u201csome kind of an explanation connecting the facts of the case (which could include the facts found, if any) and the result reached.\u201d <em>Martin v. Board of Parole, </em>327 Or 147, 157, 957 P2d 1210 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Claimant contends that EAB relied solely on Sfera\u2019s testimony to reach its findings. According to claimant, in doing so, EAB disregarded ALJ Janzen\u2019s express determination that Sfera was not credible, without explaining why it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>came to a different credibility determination than the ALJ. As there was no other evidence to support EAB\u2019s findings, claimant asks us to reverse EAB\u2019s order for lack of substantial evidence. Because the department has waived appearance on judicial review, it offers no counterargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">ORS 657.275 governs EAB review of ALJ orders. In pertinent part, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cWhen there is evidence in the record both to make more probable and less probable the existence of any basic fact or inference, the board need not explain its decision to believe or rely on such evidence <em>unless the administrative law judge has made an explicit credibility determination regarding the source of such facts or </em>evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">ORS 657.275(2) (emphasis added). Accordingly, when an ALJ has made an express credibility finding regarding the source of evidence, EAB must explain its decision to nonetheless rely on that evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In this case, the ALJ made an explicit credibility determination regarding the source of evidence \u2014 Sfera\u2019s testimony \u2014 that Barnett staff mistakenly believed that employer had not filed a response to the department\u2019s request for separation information, that Barnett had contacted the department and received misleading information about when it could file its hearing request, and that Barnett was, for those reasons, reasonably mistaken about the process to follow to file such a request. EAB did not explain why it relied on Sfera\u2019s testimony after the ALJ had expressly found her not to be credible. Where, as here, the particular evidence is the lynchpin \u2014 and perhaps the sole source of support \u2014 of a party\u2019s position, an explanation is even more crucial. Without it, we cannot tell whether EAB\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>reverse \u2014 based upon its acceptance of Sfera\u2019s testimony \u2014 is supported by substantial reason. And without Sfera\u2019s testimony, the board\u2019s factual findings on Barnett\u2019s mistaken belief and the department\u2019s misleading information are not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case to EAB for further consideration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\"> ORS 657.471 provides standards and a process for an employer to request relief from the charges that result from a determination that a claimant is eligible for unemployment compensation benefits under ORS 657.267. In <em>Johnson v. Employment Div., </em>124 Or App 77, 861 P2d 1032 (1993), we determined that the process for obtaining relief from charges under ORS 657.471 was independent of, and not a substitute for, the process to contest unemployment compensation eligibility determinations under ORS 657.266(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\"> This form was included in employer\u2019s exhibit 3. The form indicates that it was completed by Debbie Durand of Barnett and faxed to the department on October 11, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> Employer initially appealed ALJ Janzen\u2019s decision to EAB, which remanded for supplementation of the evidentiary record. ALJ Davis determined that employer\u2019s proffered exhibit 3 had been discussed during the hearing before ALJ Janzen and admitted that exhibit. On consideration of the entire record, including exhibit 3, ALJ Davis readopted ALJ Janzen\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\"> Both <em>Meritage at Little Creek </em>and <em>Moreau </em>were decided under a previous and different definition of \u201cgood cause\u201d in OAR 471-040-0010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> ORS 657.275(2), including the quoted sentence, was enacted in 1991. Or Laws 1991, ch 328, \u00a7 1. We had regularly applied a similar principle in case law prior to 1991. <em>See, e.g., Whitney v. Employment Division, </em>84 Or App 206, 210, 733 P2d 493 (1987) (remanding for reconsideration where EAB had rejected referee\u2019s determination of credibility; noting that, in those circumstances, \u201cEAB must explain its credibility finding by specifically describing why it disagrees with that determination\u201d or the court will not be able to tell whether EAB\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence); <em>Hill v. Employment Division, </em>73 Or App 422, 424-25, 698 P2d 1010 (1985) (remanding for reconsideration where credibility of witnesses was pivotal but EAB had failed to explain adequately its reversal of a referee\u2019s explicit credibility determination).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\"> Claimant also takes issue with another part of EAB\u2019s order. Before concluding that employer had good cause for its late hearing request, EAB rejected employer\u2019s argument that its November 1, 2011, request for relief from charges (Form 197) could be construed as a timely request for hearing on the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits. EAB rejected that argument because the Form 197 had been submitted to the incorrect section of the department. However, before reaching that conclusion, claimant complains, EAB \u201cindulged in a fallacious and erroneous legal analysis which concluded that requesting relief from charges on Form 197 could be considered a request for a hearing or an appeal of [the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits].\u201d However, this contention is beside the point, since EAB concluded that the Form 197 was not properly submitted to be considered a hearing request on the October 18, 2011, administrative decision allowing benefits in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
