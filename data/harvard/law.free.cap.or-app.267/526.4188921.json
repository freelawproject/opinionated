Specifically, DCBS challenges the board\u2019s conclusion that, although claimant failed to timely notify her employer\u2019s insurer that she had multiple employers, as required by ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A), the insurer had \u201cimputed notice\u201d of claimant\u2019s secondary employment, because claimant\u2019s employer was aware that she had other employers. We conclude that the board erred when it applied the principle of imputed notice to the circumstances in this case, contrary to the requirements set forth in ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A). Accordingly, we reverse and remand the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We begin with an overview of the statutory provisions that are relevant to this case. Under ORS 656.210, an injured worker can receive temporary total disability compensation in an amount based on the worker\u2019s wages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the worker has one job, the amount of compensation is based on the worker\u2019s weekly wage from that one job. ORS 656.210(2)(a)(A). Further, \u201c[f]or workers employed in more than one job at the time of injury,\u201d the calculation factors in \u201call earnings the worker was receiving from all subject employment.\u201d ORS 656.210(2)(a)(B). Replacement of lost wages for the injured worker\u2019s secondary employment is called \u201csupplemental disability.\u201d OAR 436-060-0035(l)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Pursuant to ORS 656.210 (2) (b), an injured worker is not entitled to supplemental disability,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201cunless the insurer, self-insured employer or assigned claims agent for a noncomplying employer receives:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u201c(A) Within 30 days of receipt of the initial claim, notice that the worker was employed in more than one job with a subject employer at the time of injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">\u201c(B) Within 60 days of the date of mailing a request for verification, verifiable documentation of wages from such additional employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The relevant facts of this case are undisputed. Claimant was a certified nursing assistant employed by Adams &amp; Gray Home Care - Marquis Home Health (Adams &amp; Gray) when she sustained a workplace injury. Claimant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with Adams &amp; Gray\u2019s insurer, Liberty Northwest Insurance Corporation (Liberty). At the time of her injury, claimant also worked for two other employers, and Adams &amp; Gray was aware that claimant had other employers. However, when filling out and signing various workers\u2019 compensation forms, claimant did not check the boxes that would have indicated that she had more than one employer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, within 30 days of filing her claim, neither claimant nor Adams &amp; Gray had communicated to Liberty that claimant had secondary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Approximately nine months after her injury, claimant, through counsel, informed Liberty that she had had multiple employers at the time of her injury, and she requested payment of supplemental disability. Liberty elected not to process the claim for supplemental disability, so DCBS, through its designated agent, ComPro, Inc., processed the claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ComPro later informed claimant that she was not eligible for supplemental disability because Liberty had not received notice of claimant\u2019s secondary employment within 30 days of her claim, as required by ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>After a contested, case hearing, an ALJ concluded that claimant was eligible for supplemental disability and ordered ComPro to process her claim. The ALJ determined that, because Adams &amp; Gray was aware of claimant\u2019s secondary employment at the time of her injury, Liberty had \u201cimputed\u201d notice that claimant had multiple employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">ComPro and DCBS appealed the decision to the board. In its order, a majority of the board affirmed the AL J\u2019s order, concluding that \u201cthe \u2018notice\u2019 requirement of ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A) has been met when the employer receives information regarding secondary employment.\u201d The board \u201cacknowledge [d] that the express language of ORS 656.210(2) (b)(A) provides that notice must be received by the \u2018insurer,\u2019\u201d but stated that \u201cit is well settled that, with respect to the processing of claims, notice provided by a claimant to an insured employer may be imputed to the insurer.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) (Citing <em>SAIF v. Abbott, </em>103 Or App 49, 53, 796 P2d 378 (1990), <em>modified on recons, </em>107 Or App 53, 810 P2d 878 (1991); <em>Nix v. SAIF, </em>80 Or App 656, 660, 723 P2d 366, <em>rev den, </em>302 Or 158 (1986); <em>Anfilofieff v. SAIF, </em>52 Or App 127, 134-35, 627 P2d 1274 (1981).)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The board determined that, under the circumstances of this case, \u201cthe employer\u2019s failure to provide timely, correct, and complete information to the insurer did not insulate the insurer from its processing responsibilities.\u201d According to the board, even if claimant had the burden to provide notice of secondary employment, \u201c[claimant <em>did </em>provide the information, albeit to the employer,\u201d and the \u201cissue of whether [the required] information should be imputed from the employer to the insurer is a matter distinct from the express statutory language.\u201d (Footnote omitted; emphasis in original.) Further, the board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cAgain, we recognize that the employer (unless it is self-insured) has no express statutory obligation to pass information/knowledge to its insurer or statutory administrator, and no responsibilities under the Director\u2019s rules for processing supplemental disability claims. Notwithstanding this absence of contractual or regulatory responsibility, ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A) is focused on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u2018notice\u2019 of a supplemental disability claim (and its components), not on \u2018payment\u2019 of benefits for such a claim. Thus, we conclude that the \u2018notice\u2019 requirement of ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A) has been met when the employer receives information regarding secondary employment. To do otherwise would allow an employer to nullify a supplemental disability claim by simply refraining from forwarding otherwise timely received supplemental disability information to its insurer. We decline to interpret the statutory scheme in such a manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">DCBS now seeks reversal of the board\u2019s final order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The issue in this case concerns a question of statutory interpretation: whether an employer\u2019s knowledge that a worker has secondary employment is sufficient to establish the notification required by ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A). When construing a statute, our goal is to discern the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the text and context of the statute, and the legislative history, if useful. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We begin with the text of ORS 656.210 (2)(b)(A). As noted, ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A) establishes, as a prerequisite to supplemental disability, that \u201cthe insurer, self-insured employer or assigned claims agent for a noncomplying employer\u201d receive \u201c[w]ithin 30 days of receipt of the initial claim, notice that the worker was employed in more than one job with a subject employer at the time of injury [.]\u201d As DCBS notes, under the express terms of the statute, an insurer must actually \u201creceive,\u201d within 30 days, \u201cnotice\u201d that a worker had secondary employment at the time of injury. Based on the text of the statute, DCBS argues that an employer\u2019s knowledge of secondary employment cannot be imputed to the insurer, because the insurer has not actually received the notice, as expressly required by statute. <em>See Benson v. State of Oregon, </em>196 Or App 211, 218-19, 100 P3d 1077 (2004) (under common law of agency, \u201c[t]he imputation rule adopts as an unrebuttable presumption the legal fiction that an agent always communicates to the principal all information that it should communicate within the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>of the agency, even if the party seeking to prove the communication cannot actually do so\u201d). DCBS contends that the statute spells out who must receive notice (\u201cthe insurer, self-insured employer or assigned claims agent for a noncomplying employer\u201d), and it makes no provision for any type of notice to those specified entities, other than actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">For her part, claimant does not dispute that the terms of ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A) require that the insurer receive notice of an injured worker\u2019s secondary employment, but she nevertheless contends that the \u201clong and well-known common law surrounding imputed knowledge and notice\u201d provides informative context for the statute, and that notice to a primary employer can be \u201cimputed\u201d to the insurer, thereby satisfying the statutory notice requirement. In other words, she contends that, because Adams &amp; Gray was aware that she had secondary employment at the time of the injury, Liberty also had knowledge of that employment. According to claimant, Liberty had \u201cactual notice\u201d of claimant\u2019s secondary employment because it \u201chad the means of informing itself, and ought to have done so.\u201d Thus, we turn to the question of whether our cases suggest a legislative intent that is otherwise not expressed in the plain terms of ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">As \u201ccontext,\u201d claimant cites three of our previous cases in support of her argument that the imputation doctrine applies to the circumstances of this case. First, claimant cites <em>Anfilofieff </em>in which we addressed the issue of whether penalties under ORS 656.262(8) (1979)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were authorized against SAIF for an employer\u2019s unreasonable conduct related to the processing of claims. 52 Or App at 133-35. In that case, the employer \u201cdid not truthfully describe the cause of the injury or his relationship with [the worker],\u201d \u201caltered the scene [of the injury] in order to cover up the true facts,\u201d and \u201cgave false information to the doctor as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>how the injury occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135. Although ORS 656.262 (1979) did not specifically authorize penalties against an insurer for the unreasonable conduct of its insured employer, we interpreted the statute to \u201cauthorize penalties to be paid by SAIF to the extent unreasonable conduct of a contributing or noncomplying employer causes or contributes to the delay or refusal of compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135. In reaching that conclusion, we noted that, \u201c[i]f a direct responsibility employer or its insurer is guilty of unreasonable conduct, the employer is liable for penalties,\u201d and we did \u201cnot believe the legislature intended to treat noncomplying employers or other employers insured by SAIF differently or to insulate their unreasonable conduct from penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134. We also noted that \u201c[cjonstruing ORS 656.262(8) literally not to authorize penalties for unreasonable conduct of employers insured by SAIF would substantially detract from\u201d the penalty provision\u2019s purpose of inducing \u201cprompt and reasonable payment of compensation so the injured worker will not be subjected to protracted periods of economic hardship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">This court reached a similar conclusion in <em>Nix. </em>That case involved the same penalty provision discussed in <em>Anfilofieff, </em>which had since been amended and renumbered as ORS 656.262(10) (1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Nix, </em>80 Or App at 658-59, 659 n 3. Citing <em>Anfilofieff, </em>we concluded that, although SAIF had not engaged in unreasonable conduct, a penalty and attorney fees could be assessed against SAIF for an unreasonable delay in payment of compensation based on the employer\u2019s failure to report the worker\u2019s accident to SAIF within five days, as required by ORS 656.262(3) (1985),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because the unreasonable conduct of the employer was \u201clegally attributable\u201d to SAIF. <em>Id. </em>at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Finally, in <em>Abbott, </em>the employer\u2019s insurer, SAIF, denied responsibility for two previously accepted claims on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the ground that the injured worker had misrepresented his status as an employee and that he was not a covered employee. 103 Or App at 51-53. On judicial review, the issue was whether SAIF had shown that the worker had made a sufficiently material misrepresentation to justify its backup denial of compensation. <em>Id.', see also Ebbtide Enterprises v. Tucker, </em>303 Or 459, 465-67, 738 P2d 194 (1987) (insurer may not deny a previously accepted claim more than 60 days after receiving notice of the claim, without a showing of fraud, illegality, or material misrepresentation). We concluded that the worker\u2019s misrepresentations \u201cwere not sufficiently material to justify SAIF\u2019s backup denial,\u201d because the worker\u2019s supervisor \u201cknew what [the worker\u2019s] status at the mill was and that he had filed the claims,\u201d and \u201c[t]hat knowledge was attributable to [the employer] as well as to its insurer, SAIF.\u201d <em>Abbott, </em>103 Or App at 53 (citing <em>Colvin v. Industrial Indemnity, </em>301 Or 743, 725 P2d 356 (1986); <em>Nix, </em>80 Or App at 660).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In those cases, it is true that we held that the employer\u2019s conduct or knowledge of the circumstances could affect the obligations of the insurer. But the holdings in those cases must be understood in the contexts in which they arose. In <em>Anfilofieff, </em>we decided that a noncomplying employer\u2019s \u201cclearly unreasonable\u201d conduct \u201cdesigned to avoid responsibility for the injury\u201d made the insurer\u2019s delay that was caused by that conduct unreasonable. 52 Or App at 134-35. Similarly, in <em>Nix, </em>we stated that the employer\u2019s failure to report the worker\u2019s injury, as required by statute, was unreasonable conduct that was \u201clegally attributable to his insurer, SAIF,\u201d for purposes of making the delay in compensation unreasonable under ORS 656.262. 80 Or App at 660. In <em>Abbott, </em>we concluded that the worker\u2019s misrepresentations to both the employer and the insurer about his employment status and injury claims were not sufficiently material to justify a backup denial, because the worker\u2019s supervisor knew what the worker\u2019s status was and also knew that the worker had filed claims with the insurer, and that knowledge was attributable to both the employer and the insurer. 103 Or App at 52-53. In all three cases, we found the employer\u2019s conduct or knowledge relevant to assessing the quality of an insurer\u2019s conduct or state of mind. None of those cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>however, addressed the particular question presented in this case \u2014 that is, whether an employer\u2019s knowledge that a worker has secondary employment is sufficient to establish the notification that a worker is required to provide to the insurer under ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A). In other words, the issue before us concerns whether a worker\u2019s conduct in providing information to an employer satisfies the worker\u2019s notice requirement under ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A). Thus, we do not agree with claimant that <em>Anfilofieff, Nix, </em>and <em>Abbott </em>provide helpful context for an interpretation of the notice requirement in ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A), and claimant has not offered any other helpful context or legislative history supporting her construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Instead, as urged by DCBS, we find this court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Valencia v. GET BTL, LLC, </em>247 Or App 115, 269 P3d 65 (2011), instructive. In <em>Valencia, </em>the insurer received notice of the claimant\u2019s secondary employment, as required by ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A), but the claimant failed to provide \u201cverifiable documentation,\u201d as required by ORS 656.210(2)(b)(B). 247 Or App at 124; <em>see also </em>OAR 436-060-0035(l)(f) (defining \u201cverifiable documentation\u201d). ComPro<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> sent a letter asking the claimant for more information, but after receiving no response, it notified the claimant that he was ineligible for supplemental disability benefits. <em>Valencia, </em>247 Or App at 121. On judicial review, the issue was whether ComPro acted unreasonably when it denied the claimant\u2019s claim instead of independently seeking out additional information from the claimant\u2019s secondary employers in order to determine the claimant\u2019s eligibility for supplemental disability benefits. We concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201cthe statutes and administrative rule imposed no such investigative obligation on ComPro. ORS 656.210(2)(b) makes clear that, as a prerequisite to eligibility for supplemental disability, it is the claimant\u2019s obligation to provide verifiable documentation of secondary employment. OAR 436-060-0035 sets out the information that a claimant is required to submit to establish verifiable documentation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Thus, we conclude that ComPro had no independent obligation to seek out information necessary to determine claimant\u2019s weekly wage or to determine that claimant was a subject worker on the date of his injury. Nor did it have an obligation to confirm whether claimant was an employee or an independent contractor. It was claimant\u2019s obligation to provide that information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 125 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Under our decision in <em>Valencia, </em>an injured worker seeking supplemental disability has the burden of satisfying the requirements of ORS 656.210(2)(b); when the worker does not provide the necessary information, the entity responsible for processing the claim is not obligated to independently seek that information out.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As an extension of that reasoning, we reject claimant\u2019s argument that Adams &amp; Gray\u2019s knowledge of claimant\u2019s secondary employment should be imputed to Liberty because Liberty \u201chad the means of informing itself, and ought to have done so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We agree with DCBS that ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A) spells out who must receive notice and makes no provision for any type of notice to those specified in the statute, other than actual notice. The board\u2019s application of the principle of imputed notice to the circumstances of this case essentially amended ORS 656.210 to allow eligibility for supplemental disability by notification of secondary employment to the insurer <em>or to the employer. </em>That was legal error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 174.010 (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is, in terms or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>in substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted!.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Because claimant did not provide notice to Liberty that she had secondary employment within 30 days of the receipt of her initial claim, the board erred in affirming the ALJ\u2019s order directing DCBS, through ComPro, to pay claimant supplemental disability. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> ORS 656.210(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">\u201cWhen the total disability is only temporary, the worker shall receive during the period of that total disability compensation equal to 66-2/3 percent of wages, but not more than 133 percent of the average weekly wage nor less than the amount of 90 percent of wages a week or the amount of $50 a week, whichever amount is less.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> According to the record, claimant signed at least two forms related to her claim that were later submitted to Liberty \u2014 a Liberty claim form (Form 801) and a DCBS \u201cWorker\u2019s and Physician\u2019s Report for Workers\u2019 Compensation Claims\u201d (Form 827). On each form, there is a box above the signature line labeled, \u201cCheck here if you are employed w/more than one employer!,] \u201d or, \u201cCheck here if you have more than one employer.\u201d Claimant did not check the box on either form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> An employer may elect not to pay supplemental disability benefits, in which case DCBS will administer and pay the benefits directly or assign the responsibility to an agent.

We do not agree that <em>Valencia </em>is distinguishable on that basis, because ORS 656.210(2)(b) does not set forth different obligations depending on whether the claim is processed by an employer\u2019s insurer or by ComPro.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\"> We also note that the director of DCBS has adopted OAR 436-060-0035(6) to implement the provisions of ORS 656.210(2)(b)(A). That rule, which is not challenged here, provides, in part, \u201cA worker is eligible [for supplemental disability] if *** [t]he worker provides notification of a secondary job to the insurer within 30 days of the insurer\u2019s receipt of the initial claim[.]\u201d OAR 436-060-0035 was adopted pursuant to ORS 656.210(6), which grants DCBS broad rulemaking authority regarding the payment and reimbursement of supplemental disability. The board acknowledged that the rule requires the worker to notify the insurer of secondary employment, but reasoned that that requirement is satisfied when the worker provides notice to the employer. For the same reasons discussed above, we disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
