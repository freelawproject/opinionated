Employer argues that the board\u2019s order lacks substantial evidence and substantial reason, and contends that a reasonably prudent person in claimant\u2019s position would not have quit his job. Claimant raises one \u201calternative cross assignment of error[,]\u201d which we reject without discussion. We review the board\u2019s order \u201cfor substantial evidence, substantial reason, and errors of law.\u201d <em>Franklin v. Employment Dept., </em>254 Or App 656, 657, 294 P3d 554 (2013). We agree with employer that the board\u2019s order lacks substantial evidence and substantial reason. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Except as noted below, we summarize the facts from the board\u2019s findings and \u201cthe undisputed evidence in the record that is not inconsistent with those findings.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Employment Dept., </em>245 Or App 573, 575, 263 P3d 1122 (2011). In the 1980s, claimant developed asthma. His condition was treated with medication, and it \u201cbasically went away\u201d for a number of years \u2014 that is, \u201chis condition was sufficiently controlled such that he did not require medical treatment.\u201d In 2004, employer hired claimant to work as \u201cadministrator of safety reliability and security division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">At some point on or before April 17, 2012, employer was presented with some \u201cconcerning\u201d information about claimant. A law enforcement agency commenced an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>investigation, instructed employer \u201cto keep the \u2018concerning\u2019 information confidential,\u201d and directed employer to withhold from claimant information about the reason for the investigation and law enforcement\u2019s involvement in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">On April 17, 2012, employer\u2019s representatives, including claimant\u2019s supervisor and the human resource manager, \u201cmet with claimant and \u2018duty-stationed\u2019 claimant at home, with pay, for an indefinite period pending the completion of an administrative investigation, [and] then escorted him from the building.\u201d Claimant asked, but he was not told, why he was duty-stationed at home. The only \u201c\u2018work\u2019 that was expected\u201d of claimant while he was duty-stationed at home was to be available to employer by telephone during work hours. Claimant continued to accrue hours for vacation and medical leave, and he was informed by letter that he could request vacation or medical leave when needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Claimant then experienced a recurrence of his asthma, which he attributed to the stress associated with his job. Before being duty-stationed at home, claimant regularly used his treadmill for exercise. His asthma symptoms worsened to the point that he could no longer exercise and had difficulty breathing. However, \u201c[c]laimant\u2019s symptoms did not prevent him from being duty-stationed at home and available to the employer\u201d during work hours, which, as noted, \u201cwas all the \u2018work\u2019 that was expected of him during the period at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Around May 4, 2012, claimant heard from coworkers that employer had sealed his office and that a coworker had been barred from his office due to the investigation. Claimant\u2019s asthma grew progressively worse. He was concerned about his reputation after being escorted out of the office, and he \u201cthought his reputation would be irreparably damaged if he was also fired\u201d from his position. On May 4, 2012, claimant tendered his resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">On May 21, 2012, after his resignation, \u201cclaimant sought medical treatment for his asthma.\u201d His condition was serious enough that he required steroid injections, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>he was placed on two prescription medications to treat his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Claimant subsequently sought unemployment insurance benefits from the Employment Department, which denied claimant benefits on the ground that he voluntarily left work without good cause. Claimant requested and received a hearing, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) issued an amended final order that also denied claimant benefits on the ground that he voluntarily left work without good cause. In that order, the ALJ stated that \u201c[c]laimant may very well have considered the debilitating asthma attacks grave, despite the fact that he neither missed work nor sought medical care while employed [,]\u201d but, if gravity existed, \u201cclaimant had the reasonable alternatives of consulting a physician, tendering medical documentation to the employer and/or taking medical leave for treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Claimant appealed to the board, and the board disagreed with the ALJ. The board first found that claimant did not have the reasonable alternatives of seeking medical treatment or care for his asthma and taking medical leave, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201cWhile a reasonable and prudent working asthmatic might reasonably be expected to seek medical treatment and request accommodation prior to leaving work for health reasons, substantial evidence fails to support that doing so was a reasonable alternative for this claimant. Claimant had asthma for over 20 years, and his condition was sufficiently controlled such that he did not require medical treatment, until he was duty-stationed at home, which triggered the \u2018debilitating asthma attacks\u2019 the ALJ mentioned in his decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s symptoms did not prevent him from being duty-stationed at home and available to the employer between certain hours, which was all the \u2018work\u201d that was expected of him during the period at issue. There is no record evidence that medical leave from such \u2018work\u2019 would have offered claimant any relief from his stressful employment relationship, and so was not a reasonable alternative. Nor is there any record evidence that medical care could have offered relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The board then concluded that claimant \u201cvoluntarily left work with good cause\u201d and was \u201cnot disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits because of his work separation.\u201d The board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">\u201cAt the time claimant quit work, he had been duty-stationed at home for approximately three weeks, without being told why, without being told why he could not be told why, and without being given any information about the status [of] pending matters or when he might expect to return to work. His foreseeable work-related stress resulted in serious physical symptoms (asthma attacks) that persisted for six months, up until the time of hearing, at which time the employer still could not disclose the reason for the ongoing investigation and his office remained locked and sealed. Claimant\u2019s concerns about the irreparable harm to his reputation and future prospects resulting from being \u2018walked out\u2019 of his office and possibly fired no doubt aggravated his physical symptoms. Under such circumstances, no reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would continue the employment relationship beyond May 4th.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">As noted, an individual who \u201c[voluntarily left work without good cause\u201d is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. ORS 657.176(2)(c). OAR 471-030-0038(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cGood cause for voluntarily leaving work under ORS 657.176(2)(c) is such that a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work. For an individual with a permanent or long-term \u2018physical or mental impairment\u2019 (as defined at 29 CFR \u00a71630.2(h))<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> good cause for voluntarily leaving work is such that a reasonable and prudent person with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the characteristics and qualities of such individual, would leave work. Except as provided in OAR 471-030-0038(5)(g), for all individuals, the reason must be of such gravity that the individual has no reasonable alternative but to leave work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">It is the claimant\u2019s burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he voluntarily left work with good cause, <em>Young v. Employment Dept., </em>170 Or App 752, 756, 13 P3d 1027 (2000), that is, that <em>\u201ca </em>\u2018reasonable and prudent person\u2019 would consider the situation so grave that he or she had no reasonable alternative to quitting.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Employment Dept., </em>348 Or 605, 612, 236 P3d 722 (2010). Claimant had asthma, and the parties appear to agree that asthma is a long-term physical impairment. Thus, the question in this case is whether, based on the evidence in the record, \u201ca \u2018reasonable and prudent person\u2019\u201d in claimant\u2019s position\u2014 having the characteristics and qualities of an individual with asthma \u2014 would have considered the situation so grave that he or she had no reasonable alternative but to voluntarily leave work. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Employer first argues that certain findings made by the board are not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Warkentin v. Employment Dept., </em>245 Or App 128, 132-33, 261 P3d 72 (2011) (stating that \u201cORS 183.482(8)(c) requires an appellate court to set aside or remand an agency order when the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record\u201d). We write only to address employer\u2019s contention that the board erred when it found that there is no \u201crecord evidence that medical care could have offered [claimant] relief\u2019 and that \u201c[t]here is no record evidence that medical leave from * * * \u2018work\u2019 would have offered claimant any relief from his stressful employment relationship [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We agree with employer that at least portions of those findings are not supported by substantial evidence. The undisputed evidence shows that that claimant did not seek medical treatment or care for his asthma until May 21, 2012 \u2014 17 days after his resignation. The undisputed evidence also shows, and the board found, that, when claimant had previously suffered from asthma, he was able to treat his condition with medication so that it \u201cbasically went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>away.\u201d Thus, the record does not support the board\u2019s determination that there is no evidence that medical care could have provided relief to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We turn to the board\u2019s finding about medical leave. To the extent that the board meant to suggest that leave was not available to claimant, the record does not support that finding. Rather, the undisputed evidence shows that claimant had \u201cmultiple options\u201d available for leave, including medical leave; employer\u2019s representative testified that claimant, even though he was duty-stationed at home, was at liberty to call in sick if he thought that was needed, and claimant was informed by letter that he could request medical leave. To the extent that the board found that medical leave would not have offered claimant relief, that may be true \u2014 but it is beside the point because, as we discuss below, 267 Or App at 75-76, leaving work did not offer claimant relief, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Employer also argues that the board\u2019s conclusion that claimant had good cause to voluntarily leave work is not supported by substantial reason and that a reasonably prudent person in claimant\u2019s position would have sought medical treatment or care or medical leave before voluntarily leaving work. <em>See Warkentin, </em>245 Or App at 134 (\u201cAs part of our review of an agency\u2019s findings for substantial evidence, we look at whether the findings provide \u2018substantial reason\u2019 to support the legal conclusion reached by the agency.\u201d). In part, we again agree with employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">To the extent that the board concluded that claimant had good cause to leave work because seeking medical treatment or care was not a reasonable alternative, that conclusion was based on a lack of record evidence and, therefore, was not supported by substantial reason. Claimant, who bore the burden of proof, submitted no evidence that he could not have sought medical treatment or care before he resigned, and the evidence shows that claimant could have and should have pursued those alternatives in light of his earlier success after seeking medical assistance for his asthma. As we have noted above, it is claimant\u2019s burden to prove that \u201ca \u2018reasonable and prudent person\u2019\u201d in claimant\u2019s position \u2014 having the characteristics and qualities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>an individual with asthma \u2014 would have considered the situation so grave that he or she had no reasonable alternative but to voluntarily leave work. <em>McDowell, </em>348 Or at 612; <em>see Young, </em>170 Or App at 757 (claimant failed to meet her burden to \u201cprove that remaining on medical leave was not a reasonable alternative\u201d). Because the lack of evidence defeats, rather than establishes, claimant\u2019s claim, there is no \u201cbasis in reason\u201d for the board\u2019s contrary conclusion. <em>See City of Roseburg v. Roseburg City Firefighters, </em>292 Or 266, 271, 639 P2d 90 (1981) (stating the test for substantial reason as \u201cwhether there is a basis in reason connecting the inference [of compliance with the decisional standard] to the facts from which it is derived\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">To the extent that the board concluded that claimant had good cause to voluntarily leave work due to his work-related stress, specifically, his \u201cconcerns about the irreparable harm to his reputation\u201d due to \u201cbeing \u2018walked out\u2019 of his office\u201d and investigated [,]\u201d that conclusion is also not supported by substantial reason. We pause to highlight an important underlying principle \u2014 for a claimant to have good cause to voluntarily leave work, the claimant must derive some benefit from leaving work. For example, a claimant may have good cause to voluntarily leave work when leaving work averts the grave consequences associated with an impending discharge, <em>McDowell, </em>348 Or at 620, or ends the substantial risk of continuing underpayment, <em>Nielsen v. Employment Dept., </em>263 Or App 274, 278, 328 P3d 707 (2014). In this case, the board implicitly acknowledged that principle when it stated, \u201cThere is no record evidence that medical leave from such \u2018work\u2019 <em>would have offered claimant any relief </em>from his stressful employment relationship, and so was not a reasonable alternative. Nor is there any record evidence that medical care <em>could have offered relief.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Although the board appears to acknowledge that legal principle, the board misapplied that principle here. Claimant\u2019s concern about the irreparable harm to his reputation cannot, in this case, constitute good cause to voluntarily leave work because there is no evidence that leaving work would have alleviated that concern \u2014 that is, claimant\u2019s resignation could not undo the past, and claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>submitted no evidence that he could, by resigning his position, stop the investigation that was underway at the Public Utility Commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, claimant submitted no evidence that, by voluntarily leaving work, he derived the benefit of alleviating his \u201cconcerns about the irreparable harm to his reputation\u201d due to \u201cbeing \u2018walked out\u2019 of his office\u201d and investigated. Indeed, by stating that the harm to claimant\u2019s reputation was \u201cirreparable [,]\u201d the board appears to suggest that claimant could not repair his reputation, and thus, it does not follow from the facts that claimant had good cause to voluntarily leave work on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Finally, to the extent that the board concluded that claimant had good cause to leave work due to his concern about being \u201cpossibly fired,\u201d that conclusion is also not supported by substantial reason. We note that, in certain cases, impending termination and other factors may constitute good cause. For example, in <em>McDowell, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court concluded that the claimant, a probationary teacher, voluntarily left work with good cause, where the claimant had been advised \u201cthat there was \u2018absolutely no chance\u2019 that the school board would not discharge him[,]\u201d the consequences of a discharge were grave, and the claimant had no \u201cpredismissal opportunity to be heard.\u201d 348 Or at 614-18. However, in this case, claimant submitted no evidence that he was facing termination at the time that he resigned. Indeed, when asked whether claimant could have \u201ccontinued with his employment at PUC if he hadn\u2019t quit[,]\u201d and if claimant would \u201chave remained employed for some time period\u201d if he had not resigned, employer\u2019s representative responded, \u201cCorrect.\u201d Claimant did not dispute employer\u2019s evidence that he could have continued to work while duty-stationed at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In sum, we agree with employer that the board\u2019s order lacks substantial evidence and substantial reason, and we conclude that the board erred in concluding that claimant voluntarily left work with good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> ORS 657.176(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201cAn individual shall be disqualified from the receipt of benefits * * * if the authorized representative designated by the director finds that the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">H\u00ed H* H5 H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">\u201c(c) Voluntarily left work without good cause!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">2 29 CFR \u00a7 1630.2(h) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\"><em>\u201cPhysical or mental impairment </em>means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">\u201c(1) Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genito-urinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin, and endocrine; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">\u201c(2) Any mental or psychological disorder, such as an intellectual disability (formerly termed \u2018mental retardation\u2019), organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\"> In fact, the undisputed evidence shows that the investigation continued after claimant\u2019s resignation and was still ongoing at the time of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
