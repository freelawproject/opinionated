J.</author>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In this workers\u2019 compensation case, SAIF Corporation and employer Clackamas County Fire District #1 seek judicial review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board finding that claimant\u2019s heart condition was compensable as an occupational disease under ORS 656.802(4), commonly known as the firefighter\u2019s presumption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board concluded that, under that statute, claimant was entitled to a presumption that his heart condition resulted from his work as a firefighter, and SAIF, the insurer of claimant\u2019s employer, did not overcome that presumption by presenting \u201cclear and convincing medical evidence that the cause of the condition or impairment is unrelated to [his] employment.\u201d On review, SAIF argues that the board erred in applying that standard of proof to the evidence SAIF presented because the board\u2019s sole basis for discounting that evidence was its failure to identify an alternative cause for claimant\u2019s condition. As we explain below, we agree and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">At the outset, we review the undisputed legal principles that govern the firefighter\u2019s presumption. Under ORS 656.802(4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> if a firefighter becomes disabled or impaired as a result of a \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d or other specified conditions, then the condition is presumed to have resulted from employment as a firefighter, if (1) the claimant has worked as a firefighter for at least five years, and (2) a medical examination shows that the condition did not preexist the employment. Once the presumption is established, the trier of fact must give it the \u201cvalue of evidence\u201d; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>presumption binds the trier of fact if no contrary evidence is presented. <em>Wright v. SAIF, </em>289 Or 323, 331, 613 P2d 755 (1980). The employer or insurer can overcome the presumption, however, by presenting \u201cclear and convincing medical evidence that the cause of the condition or impairment is unrelated to the firefighter\u2019s employment.\u201d ORS 656.802(4). Proof by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d generally means that \u201cthe truth of the facts asserted [is] highly probable.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Brown, </em>159 Or App 440, 445, 978 P2d 407 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Here, claimant experienced muscular discomfort in his right chest and neck while he was off duty. He sought medical treatment, and two treating cardiologists diagnosed a myocardial infarction \u2014 commonly known as a heart attack \u2014 related to coronary artery atherosclerosis. One of those cardiologists successfully treated claimant with angioplasty and stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Claimant, who had been a firefighter for nearly 20 years, later filed a claim for the heart attack as a work-related occupational disease under ORS 656.802(4). SAIF denied the claim, asserting that it had clear and convincing evidence that claimant\u2019s condition was unrelated to his employment as a firefighter. Claimant requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Based on evidence presented at the hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the ALJ found that claimant was entitled to the presumption that his heart condition was work related: He had worked as a firefighter for nearly 20 years, and a prehire physical examination and subsequent examinations did not reveal any evidence of cardiovascular disease or impairment that preexisted that employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In an effort to rebut the presumption, SAIF presented a medical evaluation and testimony from Dr. Semler, a cardiologist and professor of cardiovascular disease who examined claimant. Semler explained that atherosclerosis is a hardening of the arteries that decreases blood flow to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the heart muscle, eventually resulting in a heart attack. According to Semler, \u201cthe exact etiology\u201d \u2014 the cause or set of causes \u2014 of atherosclerosis \u201cis not definitely known,\u201d but the consensus among cardiologists is that the condition is related to multiple risk factors, including aging, diabetes, obesity, elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, tobacco use, sedentary life style, and family history.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Those particular risk factors, Semler explained, are sometimes not present in cases of a heart attack caused by atherosclerosis. He confirmed that those risk factors were not present in claimant\u2019s case, though he did state that \u201c[atherosclerosis is more in keeping with the aging process in [claimant\u2019s] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Semler concluded that claimant\u2019s atherosclerosis and heart attack were not related to claimant\u2019s work as a firefighter. Specifically, Semler explained that physical and emotional stress related to claimant\u2019s work activity as a firefighter did not contribute to the atherosclerosis that caused his heart attack. Comparing atherosclerosis to other types of coronary disease, such as arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy, Semler explained that the medical community recognized physical and emotional stress as contributing factors to some types of arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies, but that there was no valid scientific evidence that physical or emotional stress contributed to atherosclerosis. Semler also referenced claimant\u2019s report that the onset of the heart attack did not occur when he was fighting a fire or otherwise under physical or emotional stress. Semler further explained that the literature did not reveal \u201cany scientific evidence that firefighting per se leads to atherosclerosis.\u201d Ultimately, when asked if claimant\u2019s \u201cemployment as a firefighter played a role in his condition,\u201d Semler replied that \u201cit has no role whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Claimant\u2019s treating cardiologist, Dr. Dawley, fully endorsed Semler\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s work as a firefighter did not \u201cplay any role in his overall heart condition.\u201d Elsewhere in Dawley\u2019s testimony, however, he softened that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>position, stating that it was \u201cunlikely that there was a major contribution\u201d from claimant\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The ALJ concluded that SAIF had shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that claimant\u2019s heart condition was unrelated to his work as a firefighter. While recognizing that Semler \u201cdid not definitively identify a non-work cause for claimant\u2019s condition,\u201d the ALJ determined that he \u201cotherwise explained why physical and emotional stress would not have contributed to claimant\u2019s atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction.\u201d The ALJ upheld SAIF\u2019s denial, noting that no medical expert had rendered a contrary opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The board reversed the ALJ\u2019s order. The board concluded that Semler\u2019s opinion did not satisfy SAIF\u2019s burden to overcome the statutory presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cDr. Semler conceded that the cause of atherosclerosis is unknown. Despite that concession, Dr. Semler ruled out any contribution from claimant\u2019s employment as a firefighter. Dr. Semler did not persuasively explain, however, how he was able to make such a categorical exclusion, given that the causes of that condition were unknown. The lack of such a persuasive explanation is particularly significant, given that the record does not establish that claimant had any identified \u2018risk factors\u2019 for atherosclerosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">A dissenting member would have affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order, echoing the ALJ\u2019s reasoning that, although Semler could not identify a precise cause of claimant\u2019s heart condition, Semler \u201cpresented an unwavering and unequivocal opinion\u201d that the condition was unrelated to claimant\u2019s work, and there was \u201cno contrary medical evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">On review, SAIF argues that the board erred in its application of the standard of proof in ORS 656.802(4). SAIF acknowledges that proof by clear and convincing evidence is proof that a proposition is highly probable, but contends that the board went beyond that standard, requiring an insurer or employer \u201cto prove an alternative cause of the claimed occupational disease, when medical science has not yet been able to pinpoint the ultimate cause.\u201d In SAIF\u2019s view, the board\u2019s order conflicts with our opinion in <em>Long v. Tualatin Valley Fire, </em>163 Or App 397, 987 P2d 1267 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Claimant views the question on review from a different angle. As claimant sees it, SAIF \u201cis asking this court to reweigh the evidence.\u201d Claimant contends that the board weighed the evidence, \u201cfinding the opinions of Dr. Semler to be internally inconsistent and unpersuasive,\u201d and we should therefore review the board\u2019s order for substantial evidence. <em>See SAIF v. Pepperling, </em>237 Or App 79, 84-85, 238 P3d 1013 (2010) (\u201cIn reviewing the board\u2019s evaluation of [an expert\u2019s] opinion, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the board; rather, we determine whether the board\u2019s evaluation of that evidence was reasonable.\u201d). According to claimant, the board, in finding an \u201cunexplained inconsistency\u201d in Semler\u2019s opinion, did not run afoul of <em>Long </em>by requiring \u201cSAIF to affirmatively prove the cause of [claimant\u2019s] cardiovascular condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We start with our decision in <em>Long, </em>which underlies the parties\u2019 arguments on review. In <em>Long, </em>three doctors concluded that the cause of the claimant\u2019s atrial fibrillation was \u201cunknown\u201d but was unrelated to his employment as a firefighter. 163 Or App at 399. The board concluded that the employer had established by clear and convincing evidence that the claimant\u2019s condition was unrelated to his work as a firefighter. On review, the claimant argued that the employer\u2019s evidence was not \u201cthe type of evidence legally required to rebut the presumption\u201d in ORS 656.802(4) because that evidence did not establish \u201can alternative cause of the condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400. We rejected that view, reasoning that, even if the doctors\u2019 opinions did not \u201cdemonstrate an alternative cause of [the] claimant\u2019s condition,\u201d those opinions nonetheless provided \u201caffirmative evidence that [the] claimant\u2019s condition is unrelated to his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401. And we rejected the claimant\u2019s additional argument that, \u201ceven if the [b]oard was not bound by the presumption, the record [did] not support its finding that [the] employer <em>overcame </em>the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The employer had put forward medical evidence that \u201cthe cause, whatever else it is, is not related to [the] claimant\u2019s employment\u201d and nothing, \u201cother than the presumption,\u201d contradicted that evidence. <em>Id. </em>In light of that evidence, we determined that \u201cthe [b]oard\u2019s conclusion that [the] employer overcame the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>presumption by clear and convincing evidence [was] correct.\u201d Id,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The question on review is whether the board, in contravention of <em>Long, </em>ultimately required SAIF to present evidence of an alternative cause for claimant\u2019s condition in order to rebut the presumption. The board\u2019s order, of course, did not explicitly require SAIF to present evidence of an alternative cause for claimant\u2019s atherosclerosis. Instead, the board described Semler\u2019s opinion that claimant\u2019s heart condition was unrelated to his employment as lacking \u201cpersuasive explanation.\u201d What Semler failed to \u201cpersuasively explain,\u201d in the board\u2019s view, was \u201chow he was able to make such a categorical exclusion, given that the causes of that condition were unknown\u201d and \u201cgiven that the record [did] not establish that claimant had any identified \u2018risk factors\u2019 for atherosclerosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Claimant suggests that the board simply found that Semler failed to sufficiently explain <em>how </em>he reached the conclusion that claimant\u2019s condition was unrelated to his work, when Semler could not identify a definite alternative cause. But Semler did explain the basis for his conclusion in detail. Semler explained, based on his experience and review of the extensive literature considering atherosclerosis, that there was no valid scientific evidence that physical or emotional stress, or \u201cfirefighting per se,\u201d causes atherosclerosis, though some studies have associated stress with other heart conditions. He further noted that claimant\u2019s heart attack did not occur when he was fighting a fire or otherwise under physical or emotional stress. And he related claimant\u2019s atherosclerosis to aging, one of the known risk factors for that condition. Because Semler set out the bases for his conclusion that firefighting was not the cause of claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>condition \u2014 and because that explanation was not met with contrary evidence or criticized by the board \u2014 we do not understand the board\u2019s order to rest on Semler\u2019s failure to adequately explain the reasoning supporting his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The better understanding of the order on review, given the record in this case, is that the board viewed Semler\u2019s opinion as inadequate to overcome the presumption because it lacked proof of the ultimate cause of claimant\u2019s atherosclerosis. As SAIF describes it, \u201cthe nub of [the board\u2019s] reasoning was that without knowledge of the cause, the doctor\u2019s opinion that work was not a cause could not logically hold together.\u201d That view is supported by the board\u2019s description of Semler\u2019s opinion as ruling out claimant\u2019s employment as a cause of his atherosclerosis \u201cdespite [his] concession\u201d that the cause was unknown. Ultimately, the board concluded that Semler\u2019s opinion that claimant\u2019s work did not contribute to his condition could not be convincing, as long as he did not identify what did cause claimant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">That conclusion cannot be harmonized with our decision in <em>Long. </em>ORS 656.802(4) does not require \u201cevidence of an alternative cause of the condition\u201d for an insurer to rebut the presumption; all that is required is \u201caffirmative medical evidence that [the] claimant\u2019s condition is unrelated to his employment.\u201d <em>Long, </em>163 Or App at 400-01. Because the board\u2019s only reason for concluding that Semler\u2019s opinion did not meet the \u201cclear and convincing medical evidence\u201d standard was that it failed to connect claimant\u2019s atherosclerosis to a specific, non-work-related cause, we conclude that the board erred in applying that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Claimant contends that there is another reason that Semler\u2019s opinion fell short of the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard in ORS 656.802(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to claimant, because Semler\u2019s opinion was based, in part, on his conclusion that the medical consensus was that firefighting (or physical and emotional stress) did not cause atherosclerosis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>it improperly \u201cattack[ed]\u201d the presumption. Claimant argues that, where medical evidence shows that, in general, there is no scientific basis to conclude that firefighting (or physical and emotional stress) causes atherosclerosis, that evidence is insufficient to overcome the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">We disagree with claimant\u2019s understanding of ORS 656.802(4). We recognize that the firefighter\u2019s presumption was \u201cintended to give relief to firefighters because statistical studies indicated that firefighters were much more likely to suffer from heart and lung diseases due to exposure to smoke and gases under strenuous conditions.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>289 Or at 328. But here, we are concerned with a <em>particular </em>condition\u2019s connection to the activities associated with firefighting. And in determining what \u201cmedical evidence\u201d effectively rebuts the presumption, our cases have not recognized the categorical limitation that claimant proposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In <em>Wright, </em>for example, although most of the medical evidence in that case showed that the claimant\u2019s heart pain was of \u201cunknown origin,\u201d the Supreme Court noted that \u201cthere [was] evidence * * * that the cause of [the] claimant\u2019s impairments [was] unrelated to his employment\u201d \u2014 a treating doctor had opined that \u201c[t]he disease obviously was not caused by [the claimant\u2019s] work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 333 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court, after announcing principles relating to overcoming the presumption, remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to determine if that evidence overcame the presumption. On remand, we concluded that the treating doctor\u2019s opinion was not sufficient to overcome the presumption because it had been \u201cdilute [d]\u201d by a subsequent opinion. <em>Wright v. SAIF, </em>48 Or App 867, 872, 618 P2d 18 (1980). In that later opinion, the doctor explained that he was still \u201creviewing all current literature on the subject,\u201d so he could not yet say whether the claimant\u2019s condition was caused by his work without \u201cfurther research.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 871-72 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In contrast, where medical evidence established, as a general matter, that a particular condition was not caused by activities associated with firefighting, that evidence was the type of evidence that overcame the presumption. That was the view that we took in <em>Long. </em>In that case, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>cause of the claimant\u2019s atrial fibrillation was unknown, we concluded that the doctors\u2019 opinions that \u201cthe cause, whatever else it is, [is] not related to [the] claimant\u2019s employment\u201d constituted clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption. <em>Long, </em>163 Or App at 401. Given that there was no evidence to identify an alternative cause for the claimant\u2019s condition, those opinions necessarily relied, at least in part, on the current scientific understanding that certain activities (those that the claimant would have engaged in as a firefighter) were <em>not </em>the cause of atrial fibrillation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The claimant, of course, had the opportunity to present contrary medical evidence that atrial fibrillation was linked to firefighting, but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Ultimately, if we were to agree with claimant that the presumption cannot be rebutted by competent medical evidence showing that a particular condition is not caused by firefighting, then it would be nearly impossible to overcome the presumption in those cases \u2014 like this one, <em>Wright, </em>and <em>Long </em>\u2014 where medical science cannot identify a certain cause of that condition. The presumption could be overcome only if medical science could at least identify potential causes unrelated to firefighting <em>ii.e., </em>alternative causes), those potential causes were present in the claimant\u2019s case, and those potential causes were significant enough in the claimant\u2019s case to establish a causal link to the condition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>That is not what the statute requires, as shown by <em>Wright </em>and <em>Long.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In accord with those cases, we conclude that the board misapplied the standard of proof in ORS 656.802(4). When that standard is properly applied, the record does not support the board\u2019s conclusion that SAIF\u2019s evidence\u2014 an unequivocal opinion from Semler \u2014 did not overcome the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. No other evidence, other than the presumption, contradicted that medical evidence, and SAIF therefore met its burden under ORS 656.802(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\"> For ease of reference, we refer to petitioners collectively as SAIF.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> ORS 656.802(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">\u201cDeath, disability or impairment of health of firefighters of any political division who have completed five or more years of employment as firefighters, caused by any disease of the lungs or respiratory tract, hypertension or cardiovascular-renal disease, and resulting from their employment as firefighters is an \u2018occupational disease.\u2019 Any condition or impairment of health arising under this subsection shall be presumed to result from a firefighter\u2019s employment. However, any such firefighter must have taken a physical examination upon becoming a firefighter, or subsequently thereto, which failed to reveal any evidence of such condition or impairment of health which preexisted employment.

We note that in <em>Long, </em>as in this case, ORS 656.802 required the insurer or employer to come forward with <em>\u201cclear and convincing </em>medical evidence that the cause of the condition or impairment is unrelated to the firefighter\u2019s employment,\u201d while at the time of the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Wright, </em>the statute did not require the insurer or employer to present \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence.

The board did not mention it, and the ALJ specifically rejected it, noting that \u201c[t]he fact that general statistics suggest work as a firefighter can contribute to heart disease in general does not mean that claimant\u2019s particular work exposure contributed to his particular atherosclerosis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b388-5\"> Other cases under the presumption have referenced evidence of the general causal relationship between firefighting and a particular condition. <em>See Johnson v.

To overcome the presumption under that approach, the employer or insurer must present evidence that the claimant\u2019s condition was the result of some alternative cause or that the claimant\u2019s work was considerably less stressful than that of his peers. <em>See </em>Arthur Larson and Lex K.
