J.</author>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Defendant, who was convicted of first-degree criminal trespass, ORS 164.255, appeals, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. He asserts that he did not unlawfully enter or remain in a dwelling as required for first-degree criminal trespass. As explained below, we agree that the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we state the evidence in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998); <em>State v. Alvarado, </em>257 Or App 612, 614, 307 P3d 540 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Defendant shared a mobile home with his mother (Nash), who rented a space for the mobile home in a mobile home park owned by Wilson. When Nash fell behind on the rent for the space, Wilson brought a legal proceeding against her and ultimately obtained a writ of execution returning the premises to his possession. A sheriffs deputy posted a notice that the occupants of the space had been \u201cevicted by an order of the court\u201d and that \u201ctrespassing or entering into or upon these premises without written consent of the landlord [would] result in arrest and prosecution.\u201d (Capitalization omitted.) Thereafter, defendant reentered the mobile home, which remained in the space at the mobile home park. Wilson, who had not given defendant permission to enter the property, notified the police and, as a result, defendant was arrested and charged with first-degree criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of first-degree criminal trespass. He contended that, although the landlord was entitled to possession of the real property, the mobile home was separate. According to defendant, \u201cas long as his mother gave him permission to be in [the mobile home], *** they don\u2019t have a Trespass I because that requires trespassing into the residence itself. And, granted, that you can\u2019t be in the residence itself without being on the real property, but we feel as a matter of law that he did not commit Trespass I.\u201d The trial court denied the motion, and the jury found defendant guilty of first-degree criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>On appeal from the resulting judgment, defendant renews the argument he made before the trial court. In particular, he contends that the \u201ctrial court erred when it denied [his] motion for judgment of acquittal because, though defendant unlawfully entered the premises and committed criminal trespass in the second degree, defendant did not unlawfully enter or remain in the dwelling, as required for criminal trespass in the first degree.\u201d Defendant asserts that he \u201chad license to enter the dwelling but not the premises.\u201d Thus, \u201cwhen defendant entered onto the landlord\u2019s premises, he committed second degree criminal trespass. But when he continued into the dwelling,\u201d that was not an additional unlawful entry. Rather, in his view, the landlord had \u201cno property rights in the dwelling\u201d and could exclude persons from it \u201conly because it [was] located on the landlord\u2019s real property.\u201d The state, for its part, asserts that the writ of execution \u201cgranted the park owner lawful possession of the mobile home\u201d and, accordingly, the park owner could \u201cexclude others from the mobile home and not just the land it sits upon.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Under ORS 164.255(1), a \u201cperson commits the crime of criminal trespass in the first degree if the person *** [e]nters or remains unlawfully <em>in a </em>dwellingi,]\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Under ORS 164.205(3)(a), the phrase \u201c[e]nter or remain unlawfully\u201d is defined as entering or remaining \u201cin or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public or when the entrant is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so[.]\u201d That definition was \u201cintended to ground the crime of criminal trespass in traditional property law[.]\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>181 Or App 536, 539, 47 P3d 55 (2002). Thus, \u201cwhen a person had received an invitation from the owner of the property to enter, consistently with the principles of common-law trespass, that invitation generally is sufficient to establish that the entrant was \u2018licensed or privileged\u2019 to do so[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Supreme Court explained in <em>State v. Hartfield, </em>290 Or 583, 595, 624 P2d 588 (1981),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u201c [wjhere one is permitted or invited to enter premises, not open to the public, the state must prove two elements in order to establish that his entry is \u2018not otherwise licensed or privileged.\u2019 The state must prove that the person extending the permission or invitation was without actual authority to do so and that the entrant knew or believed there was no such actual authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Similarly, as defendant points out, a person who has no property rights in a dwelling \u201ccannot exclude the dwelling\u2019s owner from it for the purposes of the\u201d first-degree criminal trespass statute. \u201cAs a general rule, one of the incidents of property ownership is the right in invite other persons to use property or, conversely, to exclude them from doing so.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>181 Or App at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Here, it is undisputed that Wilson owned the space on which the mobile home was parked but did not own the mobile home itself. The court\u2019s judgment in the eviction proceedings gave Wilson restitution of the premises of the space in the mobile home park. The writ of execution of judgment of restitution provided that judgment had been rendered in an eviction action for the possession of the premises of space \u201c#18 of Benham Lane Mobile Home Park\u201d and stated that the possession of those premises was to be returned to Wilson. The judgment and the writ of execution pertained to the space in the mobile home park that Wilson had rented to Nash. They did not purport to give Wilson an exclusive right to possess or occupy the residence itself. As well, the eviction trespass notice posted on the premises by the sheriff stated that \u201cany personal property present on these premises at the time this notice was served * * * is in the possession of the landlord and may be redeemed by contacting the landlord/Richard Wilson\u201d at a specified telephone number. (Capitalization omitted.) The state points to that notice in support of its contention that the landlord had the right to possession of the residence. First, we note that the state does not explain how a notice itself, merely by referring to possession, could have the effect of giving the landlord any rights beyond those conferred by statute, court order, or some other legal source. Furthermore, the notice, although it refers to possession of personal property, does not suggest that the landlord has a right to occupy the residence or exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the owner or the owner\u2019s invitees from it. Contrary to the state\u2019s contention, although that notice provides information regarding how to obtain personal property left on the premises, it did not give the park owner rights in the mobile home. To the extent that Wilson could exclude the owner or the owner\u2019s invitees from the residence, as defendant points out, that was solely as a result of the fact that the mobile home was located on Wilson\u2019s land and Wilson could exclude defendant from the land itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The state, nonetheless, cites several provisions of the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, asserting that the landlord \u201chad some property right\u201d in the mobile home and could therefore exclude defendant from it. We disagree. Pursuant to ORS 90.634(1), \u201c[a] landlord may not assert a lien *** for dwelling unit rent against a manufactured dwelling * * * located in a facility.\u201d Furthermore, the landlord of a mobile home park that \u201creceives possession of the <em>facility space </em>from the sheriff following restitution\u201d pursuant to a writ of execution \u201cmay sell or dispose of\u2019 the mobile home \u201cas provided in ORS 90.675.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That section, in turn, sets forth procedures that the landlord must follow in order to dispose of a manufactured dwelling left in a park. Among other things, the statute (1) contains notice requirements that the landlord must follow prior to storing, selling, or disposing of the tenant\u2019s property;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>(2) requires the landlord to store the property on the rented space and exercise reasonable care after providing the notice; and (3) provides procedures that the landlord must follow to sell or dispose of the property if the tenant does not respond to the notice or remove the property. Under ORS 90.675(8), if a tenant responds and seeks to remove the mobile home, \u201cthe landlord must make that personal property available for removal by the tenant * * * by appointment at reasonable times during the 30 days following the date of the response [.]\u201d And, if the tenant does not respond and the property is deemed abandoned under the statute, the proceeds of any sale are not kept by the landlord. Instead, pursuant to ORS 90.675(13), the landlord may deduct from the proceeds of the sale any unpaid rent and expenses. Remaining proceeds go to the county tax collector to pay any unpaid taxes and assessments owed, any lienholder to the extent of any unpaid balance on a lien on the property, and, finally, the tenant, who receives any remaining amount along with an itemized accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Those statutory provisions do not give a landlord the right to occupy the dwelling or to exclude the owner or the owner\u2019s invitees from the dwelling. Indeed, given that there was no evidence that the landlord provided the notice required by ORS 90.675, it is unclear that the landlord had the right to take any action as to the mobile home. In any event, under the circumstances of this case, those statutes do not give the landlord an interest in the mobile home such that he could be considered to have properly excluded defendant from the residence for purposes of first-degree criminal trespass. Thus, although Wilson could exclude defendant from the land on which the mobile home sat, he did not have a right to also exclude defendant from the residence and, accordingly, the state failed to demonstrate that defendant was not licensed or privileged to enter the dwelling. Thus, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of first-degree criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Finally, the state contends that, if we conclude that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, we \u201cshould remand to the trial court for entry of judgment convicting defendant of second-degree criminal trespass, a lesser-included offense, and for resentencing.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u201cAn offense is a lesser included offense of another if the facts alleged in the indictment expressly include conduct that describes the elements of the lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State v. Litscher, </em>207 Or App 565, 570, 142 P3d 549 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). As noted, pursuant to ORS 164.245(1), a person \u201ccommits the crime of criminal trespass in the second degree if the person enters or remains unlawfully in a motor vehicle or in or upon premises.\u201d The charging instrument sufficiently alleged those elements, and, in addition, the trial court instructed the jury on that lesser included offense. Furthermore, there is no dispute as to the sufficiency of the evidence as to that offense; defendant conceded before the trial court and again concedes on appeal that he \u201cunlawfully entered the premises and committed criminal trespass in the second degree.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse and remand with instructions for the trial court to enter a judgment of conviction for the lesser included crime of criminal trespass in the second degree. <em>See State v. Touchstone, </em>188 Or App 45, 48, 71 P3d 536 (2003) (remanding for entry of a judgment of conviction for a lesser included offense where there was no question as to the sufficiency of the evidence of that offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Judgment of conviction for first-degree criminal trespass reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for second-degree criminal trespass and for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-5\"> In contrast, a person \u201ccommits the crime of criminal trespass in the second degree if the person enters or remains unlawfully in a motor vehicle or in or <em>upon premises.\u201d </em>ORS 164.245(1) (emphasis added).
