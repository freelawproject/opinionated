The trial court denied that motion. After the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for judgments of acquittal on several of the charges. The trial court denied those motions as well. Defendant also objected to one of the state\u2019s proposed jury instructions. The court overruled that objection and delivered the disputed instruction. Defendant raises eight assignments of error challenging the above rulings. For the reasons below, we reverse and remand on defendant\u2019s convictions for first-degree child neglect, ORS 163.547, reverse the conviction for possession of LSD, ORS 475.840, remand for resentencing, and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The parties do not dispute the following relevant facts. Eugene Police Detective Lowe, a narcotics enforcement officer, began investigating defendant after observing him loading numerous bags of potting soil into a rented van. Lowe followed defendant to a residence on Beech Place and began regular surveillance of that residence. Lowe observed two cars and a minivan regularly parked at the residence. One of the cars was registered to defendant, the second was registered to an individual named Kimm, and the minivan was registered to defendant\u2019s deceased uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Assistant District Attorney Montgomery signed and issued a \u201cgrand jury subpoena\u201d <em>duces tecum </em>to the custodian of records of the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board (EWEB). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The subpoena required production of \u201cpower subscriber information, power records, and method of payment for the past 2 years\u201d for the Beech Place residence and a second residence on East 32nd. The one-page subpoena commanded the EWEB custodian of records to \u201cappear before the Lane County Grand Jury\u201d at the courthouse \u201cas a witness before the Grand Jury\u201d on a certain date and at a specific time. The subpoena also notified the custodian to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">\u201c [b] ring this subpoena if appearing as a witness or information may be e-mailed directly to Detective Lowe at [Lowe\u2019s email address]. Should you have any questions regarding this subpoena, please call Detective Lowe at [Lowe\u2019s phone number].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The subpoena further specified, <em>\u201cMANDATORY APPEARANCE IS NOT REQUIRED IF RECORDS </em>PROVIDED.\u201d (Capitalization and italics in original.) The subpoena concluded with the statement that \u201c[t]his information being requested is pursuant to an official investigation being conducted by Detective [] Lowe of the Eugene Police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Lowe received the subscriber and usage information from EWEB several days later. The usage information consisted of the number of kilowatts used each month at each address. Lowe later stated in an affidavit that the requested records demonstrated that \u201c[d]uring the last 24 months utility usage has remained unusually high\u201d at both addresses and that \u201cit is extraordinary for a residence the size of either of the above locations to be generating this much power usage and not be involved in the manufacture of marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Lowe later observed the minivan one night at the East 32nd residence, which had previously appeared vacant, with the curtains always closed. Lowe stated that, on the night that he noted the minivan in the driveway, he also observed defendant exiting the residence and \u201cthe overwhelming odor of fresh marijuana\u201d around and emanating from the location.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The following day, Lowe called the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP) and learned that Kimm was a registered patient permitted to grow for her own use and that defendant was registered as her caregiver. As Kimm\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>caregiver, defendant was allowed to transport and administer marijuana to Kimm but was not allowed to grow marijuana. Neither the Beech Place home nor the East 32nd residence was registered as a grow site. However, Kimm\u2019s previous residence, on Ferry Street, was registered as a grow site, with Kimm as the only grower and patient. Lowe also discovered that defendant had previously been convicted in Lane County of unlawful delivery of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Lowe submitted an affidavit setting forth the facts above and requesting warrants to search the Beech Place and East 32nd residences as well as defendant\u2019s and Kimm\u2019s person for evidence of an illegal marijuana manufacture and distribution enterprise. Lowe did not seek authorization to search the Ferry Street residence because it was registered with OMMP as Kimm\u2019s marijuana-growing site. The court issued the warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Lowe and four other plainclothes officers served and executed the search warrants, beginning at the Beech Place residence. When defendant opened the door, Lowe immediately smelled the \u201coverwhelming odor\u201d of marijuana \u201cjust waft out of the house.\u201d Kimm and her two children (ages 11 and 14) were present at the Beech Place residence during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Lowe interviewed defendant while officers searched the premises. Lowe asked defendant \u201cif he was still using the home on Ferry Street for purposes of growing marijuana,\u201d and defendant responded, \u201cyes.\u201d Lowe then asked if he could have defendant\u2019s consent to search the Ferry Street residence. Defendant consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The search of the Beech Place residence revealed 33 mature marijuana plants growing in a room constructed within the attached garage. Lowe also found growing equipment and supplies in the garage. In a closet in the master bedroom, police found large bags of packaged marijuana buds, various jars with marijuana material, a digital scale, a small bag of psilocin mushrooms, and a bowl containing marijuana residue. Police also discovered some hashish in the bedroom, as well as a vial of LSD in the drawer of a dresser in the bedroom. There were postal shipping boxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>in one of the bedrooms, which the evidence suggested defendant used to ship marijuana to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Lowe later testified that \u201cthere were locks on the door\u201d to the garage and that defendant \u201chad to open the locks on the door to let\u201d Lowe in to the garage. Lowe also stated that \u201cthe children had no keys to the locks to the garage [.]\u201d Both the door to the master bedroom and the door to the closet were open when police searched the home. Kimm stated that the door to the master bedroom was not locked when she was home and that the children had access to the bedroom. Kimm also acknowledged that there was no lock on the closet and that she and defendant normally stored marijuana in that closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained in the searches. Defendant asserted that the police needed a warrant to obtain the EWEB records because he had a privacy right in those records. Because the police did not get a warrant (and no exception justifying a warrant-less search applied), defendant reasoned, they conducted an illegal search when they obtained the power usage information. Defendant also argued that the court should suppress the power usage records for the independent reason that the subpoena was unlawful. In defendant\u2019s view, without the power usage information that Lowe included in his affidavit to the court requesting the search warrants, there was not probable cause to support the warrants. Defendant argued in the alternative that, even with the power usage information, the affidavit failed to establish probable cause. Finally, defendant contended that the illegality of the Beech Place search vitiated any consent that he gave to search the Ferry Street residence. At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, defendant elicited testimony from Montgomery tending to establish that Montgomery had not presented defendant\u2019s case to the grand jury that was sitting at the time and that, therefore, the grand jury had not directed Montgomery to issue the subpoena for the EWEB records.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The state opposed defendant\u2019s motion, arguing that he had no privacy right in the usage records, that the subpoena was lawful, that Lowe\u2019s affidavit established probable cause to issue the search warrants, and that defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>consent to search the Ferry Street residence was valid. The trial court agreed with the state, rejecting all of defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">At trial, Kimm testified that she lived at the Beech Place home with defendant and her two children. She stated that defendant was not the children\u2019s father and that he had been her boyfriend for the past four years. According to Kimm, defendant \u201csometimes\u201d picked up the children after school and dropped them off places, \u201coccasionally * * * baby-s [a]t\u201d them, and took care of them when Kimm worked out of the home, including at times during the month of February 2011. Kimm also testified that defendant cared for her children once for \u201c[a] couple days\u201d when Kimm traveled to Hawaii but did \u201cnot really\u201d \u201chave any say over what they did during that time period [.]\u201d Kimm stated that defendant had \u201czero control\u201d over the children; that, although \u201che might watch them from time to time[,]\u201d \u201c[h]e has no say in what they do and how they live their lives.\u201d In Kimm\u2019s view, because her name was on the lease for the Beech Place residence, defendant lacked authority to keep her or her children from staying there.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for judgments of acquittal on the two counts of first-degree child neglect, ORS 163.547(l)(a)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant argued that, given Kimm\u2019s testimony as to his lack of authority over her children, the state failed to adduce sufficient evidence that defendant had the requisite \u201ccustody or control\u201d of the children. Defendant also contended that there was insufficient evidence that the children were ever \u201cin the immediate proximity\u201d of the drug manufacturing, because defendant grew the marijuana in the garage, which was partitioned from the home by a wall and locked door and which the children could not access. Defendant also moved for judgments of acquittal on the various counts involving hashish, LSD, and psilocin mushrooms. Defendant argued as to all of those counts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>there was \u201csimply no evidence that they belonged to [defendant] rather than to [Kimm].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The state, citing <em>State v. Mack, </em>219 Or App 119, 183 P3d 191, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 301 (2008), argued that defendant had \u201ccontrol\u201d of the children because he had control of the residence where they lived with their mother and defendant. The state argued that there was sufficient evidence of \u201cimmediate proximity\u201d because there were \u201cdrugs that had been manufactured\u201d in a closet that the children could enter, and because the children could also enter the locked garage. With regard to the hashish, LSD, and psilocin mushroom charges, the state argued that there was sufficient evidence to survive defendant\u2019s motion for judgments of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motions. As to the child-neglect charges, the court observed that there was no issue that defendant had custody, and so the issue was whether he had control over the children. The court concluded that, under <em>Mack, </em>defendant had sufficient control. The court did not specifically address defendant\u2019s argument regarding \u201cimmediate proximity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The state subsequently requested a special jury instruction that reflected its interpretation of \u201ccontrol\u201d as used in the child-neglect statute. Defendant objected to the instruction as legally incorrect and proposed an alternative instruction that would have stated that \u201ca person has control of a child either by virtue of the relationship to the child or by virtue of the person\u2019s ability to exclude the child from [] premises.\u201d In the alternative, defendant argued that no instruction on \u201ccontrol\u201d should be given because the state\u2019s proposed instruction was too \u201cbroad.\u201d The court denied defendant\u2019s proposed alternatives and delivered the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201cA person has control of a child either by virtue of their relationship to the child or by virtue of the person\u2019s ability to control the premises where the child is physically present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts, and the court sentenced defendant to 55 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>II. MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">We begin with defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, regarding the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the evidence. We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress for errors of law, and we are bound by the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings that are supported by sufficient evidence in the record. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We first consider whether defendant had a right to privacy in the information that Lowe obtained from EWEB pursuant to the subpoena. Whether a constitutionally protected privacy interest exists is a question of law. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>340 Or 319, 336, 131 P3d 173, <em>cert den, </em>549 US 1079 (2006). Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in pertinent part, \u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure ***.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As its terms indicate, Article I, section 9, applies only when government officials engage in a \u201csearch\u201d (or, not relevant here, a \u201cseizure\u201d). <em>State v. Howard/Dawson, </em>342 Or 635, 639, 157 P3d 1189 (2007). A \u201csearch\u201d occurs when a person\u2019s privacy interests are invaded. <em>Id. </em>at 640. Under the Oregon Constitution, a person may have a constitutionally protected privacy interest even when there is no physical or sensory invasion into the person\u2019s own possessions or space. <em>Johnson, </em>340 Or at 336. However, if \u201cthe government conduct did not invade a privacy interest, then no search occurred; Article I, section 9, is not implicated, and the inquiry is concluded.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>237 Or App 351, 355, 239 P3d 1002 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Applying the above principles, the Supreme Court held in <em>Johnson </em>that, under the Oregon Constitution, a defendant has no right to privacy in cell phone usage records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>maintained by the defendant\u2019s cellular service provider. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that he had a privacy interest in those phone records because \u201cthey pertained to his activities and transactions in areas that the legislature has recognized as private.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>340 Or at 335. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">\u201cDefendant clearly had a cognizable privacy interest in the <em>content </em>of his telephone calls. <em>See </em>ORS 133.724 (setting out requirement that police obtain judicially issued warrant to intercept a telephonic communication). However, we cannot identify a source of law that establishes that defendant also had some interest in keeping private any records kept by a third party, his cellular telephone provider, respecting his cellular telephone usage. The cellular telephone provider generated and maintained those records from the provider\u2019s own equipment and for the provider\u2019s own, separate, and legitimate business purposes (such as billing). * * * Neither are we aware of any principle that would prevent the cellular telephone provider from responding to a proper subpoena.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 336 (emphasis in original). The court thus held that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of his phone usage records. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In <em>State v. Delp, </em>218 Or App 17, 27, 178 P3d 259, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 317 (2008), relying on <em>Johnson, </em>we held that the defendant did not have a protected privacy interest in subscriber information held by his Internet service provider. We reasoned that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">\u201cas in <em>Johnson, </em>the information that the government obtained from [the service provider] was independently maintained by [the service provider] for its own purposes. Thus, the question, as in <em>Johnson, </em>is whether a source of law establishes that defendant has some interest in keeping private the information maintained by a third party respecting his Internet usage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-9\"><em>Delp, </em>218 Or App at 25. Because the defendant failed to direct the court to any such source of law, and we were unable to identify \u201cany principle that would prevent [the service provider] from responding to a proper government subpoena concerning his subscriber information,\u201d we concluded that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>to suppress evidence obtained as a result of that subpoena. <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">For the same reasons, we hold here that defendant has failed to establish that he has a constitutionally cognizable privacy interest in the \u201cpower subscriber information, power records, and method of payment for the past 2 years\u201d that the state requested and obtained pursuant to the subpoena. The record indicates that, as in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Delp, </em>the information was \u201cgenerated and maintained\u201d by a third-party utility provider, EWEB, for the provider\u2019s \u201cown, separate, and legitimate business purposes (such as billing).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Defendant does not dispute the outcomes in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Delp </em>or the reasoning underlying those decisions. Nor does he direct us to any \u201csource of law establish [ing] that [he] has some interest in keeping private the information maintained by a third party respecting his [power] usage.\u201d Instead, defendant attempts to distinguish the power usage records here from the records in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Delp. </em>Defendant contends that, unlike the \u201cnoncontent\u201d records at issue in those cases, \u201cutility records disclose details about a person\u2019s home \u2014 his or her sanctuary protected by constitutional privacy guarantees.\u201d He argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\u201c[u]tility usage may disclose when a person has houseguests, when an apartment is occupied by a number of tenants in excess of the provisions of the lease, when someone grows exotic orchids, when someone has an excessive number of electronics and refuses to make power-saving efforts, or \u2014 even\u2014when someone is growing marijuana. Those details are not otherwise knowable without a physical intrusion into the protected area of the home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">We disagree with the assertion that the records here are somehow more revealing than the records at issue in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Delp. </em>To the contrary, the information from EWEB indicated little more than the addresses of the Beech Place and East 32nd residences and how much electricity each home used per month for the two years preceding the subpoena. The utility records arguably reveal less information about defendant\u2019s conduct than the cell phone and Internet usage records at issue in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Delp, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>respectively, presumably did. We thus conclude that defendant had no constitutionally cognizable privacy right in the EWEB records or the information contained in them and that, therefore, the state did not need to get a warrant to obtain those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the state obtained the subpoena unlawfully. According to defendant, the assistant district attorney who issued the subpoena did so without having been directed to by the grand jury. Defendant argues that a prosecutor has no authority under ORS 136.563 to issue a subpoena without such direction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, contends defendant, the subpoena is not authorized. Defendant cites <em>State ex rel Frohnmayer v. Sams, </em>293 Or 385, 388, 648 P2d 364 (1982), in which the Supreme Court discussed ORS 136.563, and <em>State v. Burleson, </em>342 Or 697, 705, 160 P3d 624 (2007) (stating that \u201cthe grand jury, not the prosecutor, is the actor that drives the investigative process of the grand jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The state counters that ORS 136.563 authorized the subpoena and, in any case, under ORS 136.432, any violation of ORS 136.563 would not authorize the exclusion of the EWEB records. We agree with the state\u2019s alternative argument and, therefore, do not reach the argument regarding the prosecutor\u2019s authority to unilaterally issue a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Under ORS 136.432,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\u201c[a] court may not exclude relevant and otherwise admissible evidence in a criminal action on the grounds that it was obtained in violation of any statutory provision unless exclusion of the evidence is required by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">\u201c(1) The United States Constitution or the Oregon Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">\u201c(2) The rules of evidence governing privileges and the admission of hearsay; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">\u201c(3) The rights of the press.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Defendant does not contend that the power usage records are not relevant or that they are not \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d Instead, defendant relies on his argument that the state violated his constitutional right to privacy in obtaining those records. We have already discussed and rejected that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Defendant also argues that ORS 136.432 does not apply because the prosecutor did not \u201cviolate\u201d ORS 136.563 in issuing the subpoena; the prosecutor merely \u201cact[ed] in the absence of any authority.\u201d We disagree. The assistant district attorney who issued the subpoena expressly testified that ORS 136.563 authorized him to issue the subpoena in the manner in which he did. And defendant\u2019s own argument, including his discussion of <em>Sams </em>regarding the primacy of the grand jury over the prosecutor with regard to the subpoena power, is rooted firmly and exclusively in statutory law. Accordingly, we reject the semantic distinction that defendant seeks to draw. Assuming, without deciding, that the prosecutor violated ORS 136.563, we conclude that the trial court nevertheless properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the power usage records under ORS 136.432.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We briefly address defendant\u2019s remaining arguments regarding the sufficiency of the affidavit in support of the warrants to search the residences. First, defendant argues that, even with the power usage information, the facts in the affidavit do not establish probable cause. Under ORS 133.555(2), before issuing a warrant, a judge must find that \u201cthere is probable cause to believe that the search will discover things specified in the application.\u201d \u201cProbable cause\u201d exists when a reasonable person would believe that it is more likely than not that the things specified in the application will be found. <em>State v. Lynch, </em>119 Or App 97, 100, 849 P2d 556 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We have held, in the context of challenges to marijuana manufacture and distribution convictions, that probable cause existed when \u201cthe affidavit stated * * * that electrical usage at the house had increased substantially since defendant had moved in, and that a police officer familiar with how marijuana is grown indoors had smelled marijuana while standing near the house.\u201d <em>Lynch, </em>119 Or App <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>at 100. We similarly held in <em>State v. Darroch, </em>117 Or App 185, 188-89, 843 P2d 978 (1992), that the affidavit there was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. In <em>Darroch, </em>the affidavit stated that the defendant\u2019s home had covered windows, the electric power usage for the residence was high relative to its size, and the affiant had not observed any activity on the premises that would explain the consumption of so much electric power. <em>Id. </em>The affidavit also included the fact that the affiant had seen a large number of bags of potting soil or fertilizer and several large plastic buckets, both of which were commonly used to grow marijuana, as well as the fact that the defendant had a prior drug possession conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 189. With the exception of the plastic buckets, the affidavit in this case contains the same information that we held in <em>Lynch </em>and <em>Darroch </em>was sufficient to establish probable cause. We thus readily conclude that probable cause supported the warrants to search the residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Defendant\u2019s additional argument \u2014 that the warrants were invalid because the facts in the affidavit were consistent with lawful activity \u2014 is not well taken. It is true that we have previously concluded that facts \u201cindicating the presence of an illegal marijuana-growing operation\u201d did not, by themselves, constitute probable cause when the facts \u201c[a]re also consistent with lawful activity.\u201d <em>State v. Christen/Hankins, </em>79 Or App 774, 783, 720 P2d 1303 (1986). However, such facts, when combined with other facts <em>not </em>consistent with lawful activity <em>(e.g., </em>in <em>Christen/Hankins, </em>an informant\u2019s tip that illegal drug manufacturing was taking place at a specific location), can establish probable cause. <em>Id. </em>Here, there is evidence inconsistent with lawful activity, including Lowe\u2019s observation of \u201cthe overwhelming odor of fresh marijuana\u201d emanating from the East 32nd residence, which was not a registered grow site. There was a sufficient basis from which the magistrate could find probable cause to believe that there was evidence of defendant\u2019s criminal activity on the premises searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In his last argument pertaining to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, defendant argues that his consent to search the Ferry Street residence was not \u201cvoluntary\u201d because it was derived from the state\u2019s prior unlawful conduct. Given our rejection, above, of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>arguments as to the validity of the subpoena and the search warrants, however, the necessary premise of defendant\u2019s consent argument has evaporated. The trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">III. CHILD-NEGLECT CONVICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We turn to defendant\u2019s two assignments of error regarding his conviction on two counts of first-degree child neglect. Defendant contends that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for judgment of acquittal and delivered an incorrect and prejudicial jury instruction regarding an element of the offense. The indictment, which tracked the statutory language of ORS 163.547(l)(a)(B), alleged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cdefendant, on or about February 9, 2011, in Lane County, Oregon, having custody or control of * * * a child under 16 years of age, did unlawfully and knowingly allow the child to stay in and upon premises and in the immediate proximity where controlled substances were being criminally manufactured for consideration and profit [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Defendant argues that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that he had \u201ccontrol\u201d of Kimm\u2019s children or that he allowed them to stay in the \u201cimmediate proximity\u201d of the criminal manufacturing of controlled substances. Defendant also argues that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction regarding \u201ccontrol\u201d misstated the law and permitted the jury to reach an erroneous result.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">A. <em>Instructional error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">We begin by examining the court\u2019s jury instruction. We review for legal error. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>329 Or 327, 333, 986 P2d 1160 (1999). A trial court commits reversible error when it incorrectly instructs the jury on a material element of a claim or defense and that instructional error permits the jury to reach a legally erroneous result. <em>Wallach v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>344 Or 314, 326, 329, 180 P3d 19 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, the court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">\u201c[a] person has control of a child either by virtue of their relationship to the child or by virtue of the person\u2019s ability to control the premises where the child is physically present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The trial court agreed with the state\u2019s argument that our previous decision in <em>Mack </em>supported such an instruction. According to the state, in <em>Mack, </em>we squarely addressed the issue of whether an individual\u2019s control over premises grants that person \u201ccontrol\u201d of children on those premises for purposes of ORS 163.547 and answered that question in the affirmative. In defendant\u2019s view, <em>Mack </em>and the lone case upon which the court in <em>Mack </em>relied, <em>State v. Reiland, </em>153 Or App 601, 958 P2d 900 (1998), are not as decisive as the state argues. We agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In <em>Reiland, </em>the defendant was convicted of four counts of first-degree child neglect and four counts of endangering the welfare of a minor, ORS 163.575(l)(b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after the police found marijuana in her home. 153 Or App at 603. The marijuana belonged to the defendant\u2019s spouse. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendant argued that her conviction on the child-neglect counts should have merged with her conviction on the child-endangerment counts because each of those statutes did not require proof of an element that the other did not. <em>Id. </em>at 603-04 (citing <em>former </em>ORS 161.062(1) (1997), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws, 1999, ch 136, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state argued that the convictions should not merge because \u201cthere exists a significant difference between the child-neglect element of \u2018allowing\u2019 a child \u2018to stay\u2019 on \u2018premises\u2019 and * * * the endangering element of\u2018permitting\u2019 a child to \u2018enter or remain in a place.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604 (omission in original). We agreed with the defendant and reversed and remanded for entry of judgment merging the convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We note that both the law and the facts at issue in <em>Reiland </em>are distinct from those at issue here. The defendant in <em>Reiland </em>was the mother of the children involved and lived with them in the home; it was undisputed that she had \u201ccustody\u201d of those children. Thus, <em>Reiland </em>did not reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the question presented in this appeal \u2014 whether a <em>nontaxexit </em>who indisputably does <em>not </em>have custody of a child has \u201ccontrol\u201d of that child \u2014 and, indeed, involved a different element of child neglect than is at issue here. The relevant legal inquiry in <em>Reiland </em>involved whether the word \u201cpermit\u201d in the child-endangerment statute denotes the same thing as the word \u201callow\u201d does in the child-neglect statute. A defendant\u2019s conduct in \u201callowing]\u201d a child to stay on certain premises is <em>a different element </em>of the crime of child neglect than \u201chaving custody or control of a child.\u201d <em>Mack, </em>219 Or App at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Reasoning that \u201c\u2018allow\u2019 and \u2018permit\u2019 are synonyms\u201d and that \u201cto \u2018permit\u2019 something, one must have authority to forbid it [,] \u201d we concluded in <em>Reiland </em>that \u201c[t]he owner of the place where drugs are being sold or used has <em>authority </em>over the child by virtue of the person\u2019s ownership of the place, just as others have <em>authority </em>over the child by virtue of their positions as parent, guardian, teacher, or public official.\u201d 153 Or App at 604-05 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). Relatedly, we stated that \u201ca person with custody or control of a child certainly does have the authority to prohibit the child from remaining in a place, notwithstanding the fact that the person has no authority over the place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. However, it is important to note what we did <em>not </em>state in <em>Reiland: </em>we did not state that ownership of premises gives a person \u201ccontrol\u201d of a child as that term is used with regard to the first element of ORS 163.547, \u201chaving custody or control of a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In <em>Mack, </em>we addressed whether the defendant had \u201ccontrol,\u201d as required by ORS 163.547(1)(a)(B), of his girlfriend\u2019s child, who lived with him and his girlfriend in a residence that belonged to the girlfriend. The defendant in <em>Mack </em>was found guilty of, among other offenses, first-degree child neglect after police discovered evidence of illegal marijuana distribution in the residence. 219 Or App at 121-22. The defendant had his own room that he kept locked and generally prohibited the girlfriend from entering. <em>Id. </em>Evidence of the defendant\u2019s illegal drug activity was found primarily in his room, but also in the garage and kitchen. <em>Id. </em>at 122-23. The indictment alleged that the defendant allowed the child to stay in the residence, but the record established that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the \u201cdefendant had no authority to exclude [the child] from being present at [the girlfriend\u2019s] residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">On appeal, the defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence that he had \u201ccontrol\u201d of the child. The state countered that he possessed the requisite control of the child by virtue of his control of the premises. We reversed his child-neglect conviction. We rejected <em>Reiland </em>as controlling precedent because, despite the defendant\u2019s control over his room in the residence, the \u201cdefendant was neither [the child\u2019s] custodian, nor did he have the authority to exclude [the child] from [the girlfriend\u2019s] residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we went on to make the following observation, upon which the state and the trial court in this case relied, concerning whether the evidence established that the defendant could control the child\u2019s whereabouts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201cThat conclusion leads to another observation. As stated above, the only contested issue based on the allegations in the indictment and the stipulated facts was whether defendant could <em>control </em>the whereabouts of [the child] while the drug activities occurred on the premises. If defendant were vested with control over the premises, then it would follow that he had the authority to allow or not allow [the child] to be on the premises. But if he did not have authority to control [the child]\u2019s person and had no ability to control [the child]\u2019s presence on the premises, then he cannot be said to have had control of [the child] for purposes of the statute. In other words, the first and second elements of the offense, in light of the stipulated facts in this case, become conflated into one element for purposes of determining whether the state proved the allegations of first-degree child neglect. Because there is no evidence in the stipulated facts or an available inference from the stipulated facts that would permit a rational factfinder to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant exercised control over [the child]\u2019s person or had the authority to exclude [the child] from the [girlfriend\u2019s] residence, it follows that the trial court erred when it convicted defendant of first-degree child neglect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 129 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). In short, we relied on <em>Reiland </em>for the suggestion in <em>Mack </em>that, if the defendant could have controlled the whereabouts of the child \u2014 that is, the child\u2019s exclusion from the premises\u2014 through control over the premises, that fact would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>permitted the conclusion that the defendant had control of the child for purposes of the child-neglect statute. We did not undertake an analysis of that statute\u2019s text, context, or legislative history. We do so now. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 164, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (when interpreting a statute, \u201c[flirst, the court examines the text and context of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The child-neglect statute applies only to \u201cperson [s] having custody or control of a child under 16 years of age\u201d who engage in certain prohibited conduct. ORS 163.547(l)(a). There is no dispute that defendant here did not have custody of the children. Defendant argues that the trial court misstated the law when it instructed the jury that <em>\u201c[a] person has control of a child </em>either by virtue of their relationship to the child or <em>by virtue of the person\u2019s ability to control the premises where the child is physically </em>present.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The legislature has not defined \u201ccontrol\u201d as that term is used in ORS 163.547(l)(a). In assessing the meaning of \u201ccontrol\u201d for purposes of that statute, we must therefore determine the meaning of that word most likely intended by the legislature. <em>Polacek and Polacek, </em>349 Or 278, 284, 243 P3d 1190 (2010). We begin by considering the statutory text and context, which are the best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171. As to the text, we typically give words of common usage their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). \u201cA statute\u2019s context includes other provisions of the same or other related statutes, the pre-existing statutory framework within which the statute was enacted, and prior opinions of this court interpreting the pertinent statutory wording.\u201d <em>Polacek, </em>349 Or at 284. We may also look to legislative history to inform our examination of the statutory context. <em>State v. Blair, </em>348 Or 72, 80, 228 P3d 564 (2010). Regarding legislative history, the Criminal Law Revision Commission\u2019s official commentary to the Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, when relevant, is deemed particularly persuasive. <em>State v. White, </em>341 Or 624, 639 n 7, 147 P3d 313 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">With those principles in mind, we begin with the ordinary meaning of \u201ccontrol.\u201d The dictionary defines the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>noun form of \u201ccontrol\u201d \u2014 the form used in the statute \u2014 to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">\u201cthe act or fact of controlling &lt;man\u2019s increasing ~ over nature&gt; : power or authority to guide or manage : directing or restraining domination cunder parental ~&gt; &lt;the car went out of ~ on a curve&gt;.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>496 (unabridged ed 2002) (boldface in original). \u201cControlling\u201d is defined, in turn, by reference to the verb form of \u201ccontrol,\u201d which means,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201c(1) : to exercise restraining or directing influence over : REGULATE, CURB &lt;~ one\u2019s anger&gt; <em>&lt;controlling </em>her interest in the enterprise&gt; (2): to have power over : RULE &lt;a single company ~s the industry&gt;.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\"><em>Id. </em>(capitalization, italics, and boldface in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">As an initial matter, we discern nothing in the plain meaning of \u201ccontrol\u201d that necessarily forecloses the notion that a person who does not have custody of a child may yet, by right of that person\u2019s control over some premises, have \u201ccontrol\u201d over a child. But, acknowledging that, in some factual scenarios, ownership rights and the ability to exclude others from premises may amount to some form of control of children on those premises is a far cry from the conclusion that an individual\u2019s ability to have any type of control over premises imputes to that individual, as a matter of law, \u201ccontrol of a child\u201d on those premises. Nor does it necessarily resolve the question of what the legislature intended \u201ccontrol of a child\u201d to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">We turn to an examination of the statutory text in context and the legislative history. The first child-neglect statute, ORS 163.545, was passed as part of the 1971 overhaul of the Oregon Criminal Code, along with other relevant provisions: ORS 163.535, \u201cAbandonment of a child,\u201d and ORS 163.555, \u201cCriminal nonsupport.\u201d At that time, ORS 163.545(1) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\"><em>\u201cA person having custody or control of a child </em>under 10 years of age commits the crime of child neglect if, with criminal negligence, he leaves the child unattended in or at any place for such period of time as may be likely to endanger the health or welfare of such child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>(Emphasis added.) \u201cAbandonment of a child\u201d was defined by ORS 163.535(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">\u201cA person commits the crime of abandonment of a child if, <em>being a parent, lawful guardian or other person lawfully charged with the care or custody of a child </em>under 15 years of age, he deserts the child in any place with intent to abandon it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">(Emphasis added.) \u201cCriminal nonsupport\u201d was defined under ORS 163.555(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\u201cA person commits the crime of criminal nonsupport if, <em>being the parent, lawful guardian or other person lawfully charged with the support of a child </em>under 18 years of age, born in or out of wedlock, he refuses or neglects without lawful excuse to provide support such child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">With the exception of a few minor amendments that are not germane to our discussion, ORS 163.535 and ORS 163.555 \u2014 abandonment and criminal nonsupport, respectively \u2014 have remained unchanged. However, in 1991, the legislature did amend ORS 163.545, the child-neglect statute, to specify that the conduct prohibited by that statute constitutes child neglect <em>in the second degree. </em>Or Laws 1991, ch 832, \u00a7 2. \u201cThe 1991 amendment was necessary because the legislature created a new crime that year\u2014 child neglect in the first degree, ORS 163.547 \u2014 to prohibit persons from allowing children under 16 to be around certain illegal activities involving controlled substances.\u201d <em>State v. Drown, </em>245 Or App 447, 463 n 7, 263 P3d 1057 (2011). Thus, although first-degree child neglect described in ORS 163.547 criminalizes different conduct than ORS 163.545, it still applies, as ORS 163.545 did and still does, only to \u201cperson [s] having custody or control of a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The significance of the foregoing observations lies in the difference between the categories of offenders to which those various criminal statutes concerning the welfare of children apply. As we have highlighted, the offense of child neglect \u2014 whether in the first or second degree \u2014 applies only to persons \u201chaving custody or control of a child,\u201d whereas child abandonment and criminal nonsupport apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201cparent [s], lawful guardian [s] [,] or other person [s] lawfully charged with,\u201d in the case of abandonment, \u201cthe care or custody of a child,\u201d or, in the case of criminal nonsupport, \u201cwith the support of a child.\u201d From that fact, we conclude that the legislature intended \u201chaving custody or control\u201d to mean something distinct from \u201cbeing a parent, lawful guardian [,] or other person lawfully charged with\u201d a specific duty with respect to a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The Criminal Law Revision Commission\u2019s commentary to the child neglect statute directly addresses and supports that distinction. According to that commentary, the commission</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201cintended [ORS 163.545] to complement the sections on child abandonment and criminal nonsupport by providing coverage for situations involving criminal neglect. The crucial issue here is not whether the child was deserted or left without nominal support, but whether it was left unattended under circumstances likely to endanger its health or welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018custody or control of a child\u2019 extends the reach of the section beyond the child\u2019s parent or guardian; it includes the temporary custodian, <em>e.g., </em>baby-sitter, relative, teacher.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 174, 176 (July 1970). Also relevant, the commission stated in the commentary regarding the criminal nonsupport statute that that statute \u201cmakes it a crime for a parent or a person <em>in loco parentis </em>of a child less than 18 years old to intentionally fail or refuse to provide support for such child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 175, 177. Thus, as relevant to this dispute, the offense of child neglect is complementary to the offenses of abandonment and criminal nonsupport, yet distinguishable from those statutes on two bases: the conduct prohibited and the category of offenders to which it applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">As to the latter distinction, it is evident from the commentary quoted above that the drafters intended the category of offenders to which the child-neglect statute applies to be broader than the category to which the abandonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and nonsupport statutes apply.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, and most significantly, the commentary clarifies that the particular manner in which the drafters broadened the \u201creach of [the child-neglect statute] beyond the child\u2019s parent or guardian,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the target of the abandonment and nonsupport offenses, was to \u201cinclude!] the temporary custodian, <em>e.g., </em>baby-sitter, relative, teacher.\u201d Based on that part of the commentary, we conclude that the category of \u201cthe temporary custodian\u201d represents the only additional group \u2014 that is, beyond parents or those in the position of parents, as contemplated in the other statutes \u2014 to fall within the child-neglect statute\u2019s extended reach. In other words, we do not understand the commentary as providing that temporary custodians are but <em>one example </em>among others encompassed by the child-neglect statute\u2019s broader scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">To summarize, certain offenses concerning the welfare of children <em>{e.g., </em>abandonment and nonsupport) apply only to parents or persons <em>in loco parentis </em>to children. The child-neglect statute similarly applies to such individuals; it <em>also </em>applies, unlike the other statutes, to \u201ctemporary custodians,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>those who are not \u201clawfully charged with\u201d the care, custody, or support of a child but who nevertheless have \u201ccontrol\u201d of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Having determined that the legislature intended the phrase \u201chaving * * * control of a child\u201d as used in ORS 163.547(1)(a) to refer to \u201ctemporary custodian[s],\u201d we further conclude that, as defendant argues, the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that \u201c[a] person has control of a child * * * by virtue of the person\u2019s ability to control the premises where the child is physically present\u201d misstated the law. We therefore disavow our suggestion in <em>Mack </em>that the ability to exclude a child from the premises is equivalent to \u201ccontrol of a child\u201d under ORS 163.547. Depending on the facts of a given situation, it may be that a person with control over certain premises can also be found to be the temporary custodian of a child on those premises. In some circumstances, an individual\u2019s status as a child\u2019s temporary custodian may even derive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>inextricably from that individual\u2019s control over, and ability to exclude persons from, those premises. However, undoubtedly, in numerous contexts, a person will have some control over premises yet in no way qualify as the temporary custodian of children on those premises. In other words, evidence of some kind of ability to control premises may be relevant to establish, but insufficient by itself to impute as a matter of law, \u201ccontrol of a child\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.547(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Because the trial court\u2019s instruction is directly at odds with that conclusion, it misstated the law in a way that would have allowed the jury to conclude that defendant had \u201ccontrol\u201d of the children even though he may not have been their temporary custodian. Because we reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to judgments of acquittal, as we explain in our discussion below, and given our construction of the statute, we reverse and remand defendant\u2019s convictions for child neglect in the first degree. <em>See Wallach, </em>344 Or at 322 (noting that, pursuant to ORS 19.415(2), \u201c[n]o judgment shall be reversed or modified except for error substantially affecting the rights of a party\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 329 (\u201c[W]hen a trial court incorrectly instructs the jury on an element of a claim or defense and when that incorrect instruction permits the jury to reach a legally erroneous result, a party has established that the error substantially affected its rights within the meaning of ORS 19.415(2).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">B. <em>Motion for judgment of acquittal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We turn now to defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for judgment of acquittal on the child-neglect counts. On review of a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we determine whether a reasonable trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, could find that the state proved each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994). Defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence that defendant had \u201ccontrol\u201d of Kimm\u2019s children, under a correct understanding of ORS 163.547(l)(a), and that there was insufficient proof that he allowed the children in the \u201cimmediate proximity\u201d of the growing operation as required under ORS 163.547(l)(a)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>As to the first argument, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to conclude that defendant had \u201ccontrol\u201d of the children under the proper understanding of that phrase, as set out in our analysis above. Defendant argues that Kimm\u2019s testimony that he had \u201czero control\u201d over the children and \u201cno say in what they do and how they live their lives\u201d forecloses the possibility of finding that he had such control. However, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, as we must, that testimony by itself is not enough to overcome other evidence presented at trial that would permit a rational factfinder to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the requisite control. For example, the children had been residing with defendant for four years, since the ages of approximately 7 and 10 years of age. Kimm had also left the children under defendant\u2019s care when she traveled out of state and at various other times, including specifically during the month of February 2011. We therefore conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant had \u201ccontrol\u201d over Kimm\u2019s children on or about February 9, 2011, as alleged, and that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s MJOA on the child-neglect counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">We turn to defendant\u2019s second argument. Defendant emphasizes that the state charged him with allowing the children to stay in \u201cthe immediate proximity where controlled substances were being criminally <em>manufactured\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In defendant\u2019s view, the \u201cmanufacture\u201d of marijuana consists of the growing of marijuana, and \u201c[t]he only evidence was that the marijuana was growing in the garage and was separated from the residence by two locked doors to which the children had no keys.\u201d According to defendant, the evidence showed that he excluded the children from the garage, where the marijuana grew, and thus they were never in the immediate proximity of drug manufacturing. Defendant points to the following dictionary definitions of \u201cimmediate\u201d and \u201cproximity\u201d as support for his argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">\u201c\u2018Immediate\u2019 means * * * \u2018being near at hand : not far apart or distant chid the money in the ~ neighborhood:^\u2019 \u2018directly touching or concerning a person or thing cthe child\u2019s <em>immediate </em>world is the classroom&gt;* * *.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>Dictionary </em>1129 (unabridged ed 2002). \u2018Proximity\u2019 means \u2018the quality or state of being proximate, next, or very near (as in *** place ***)***: NEARNESS.\u2019 *** \u2018[P]roximate\u2019 means \u2018very near : immediately adjoining : CLOSE ***.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 1828.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">(Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The state counters that, even if defendant\u2019s marijuana \u201coperation\u201d was confined to the garage, the evidence was nevertheless sufficient for a rational juror to find that the children were in the immediate proximity of the operation. The state also argues, in the alternative, that defendant\u2019s manufacture of marijuana consisted not only of growing plants but also processing them, weighing and packaging them, and distributing them for profit. When understood in that manner, contends the state, the evidence establishes that instrumentalities of defendant\u2019s manufacture of marijuana <em>(e.g., </em>bags of marijuana, the digital scale, and boxes) were located in the immediate proximity of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Assuming, without deciding, that defendant\u2019s marijuana manufacturing was limited to the garage, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence that the children, by residing in the home, were in the immediate proximity of that manufacturing operation. There are two problems with defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">First, defendant\u2019s assertion that the children did not have access to the garage and the marijuana-growing room in it is not supported by the evidence. That evidence indicated only that \u201cthere were locks on the door\u201d to the garage and that, on the evening of the police search, defendant had to unlock the door to the garage to let Lowe in. It does not necessarily follow that the garage was always or even usually locked. It hardly matters, then, that \u201cthe children had no keys to the locks to the garage [.]\u201d Second, the very definitions of \u201cimmediate\u201d and \u201cproximity\u201d adduced by defendant indicate that actual access is not required for immediate proximity to exist. Those definitions show, instead, that one may be in \u201cimmediate proximity\u201d to something if they are \u201cvery near\u201d or \u201cnot far apart\u201d from that thing. The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the child-neglect counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>IV. UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF LSD</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">In his remaining six assignments of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on Counts, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 \u2014 unlawful manufacture of hashish, unlawful delivery of hashish, unlawful possession of hashish, unlawful possession of LSD, and unlawful possession of psilocin mushrooms, respectively. We reject defendant\u2019s arguments as to all but Count 9 without discussion. As to Count 9, the state concedes that the evidence did not support defendant\u2019s conviction for unlawful possession of LSD, ORS 475.840.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The state\u2019s concession is well taken: an individual\u2019s mere proximity to drugs is not sufficient to prove possession when other individuals are also in proximity to the drugs. <em>State v.

Because the state did not present any other evidence linking defendant to the LSD, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Convictions for first-degree child neglect, ORS 163.547, reversed and remanded; conviction for unlawful possession of LSD, ORS 475.840, reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\"> More specifically, defendant was charged with and found guilty of child neglect in the first degree, ORS 163.547 (Counts 1 and 2); unlawful manufacture of marijuana, ORS 475.856 (Counts 3, 4, and 5); unlawful manufacture of hashish, ORS 475.856 (Count 6); unlawful delivery of hashish, ORS 475.860 (Count 7); unlawful possession of hashish, ORS 475.864 (Count 8); possession of LSD, ORS 475.840 (Count 9); possession of psilocin mushrooms, ORS 475.840 (Count 10); unlawful delivery of marijuana for consideration, ORS 475.860 (Count 11); and unlawful possession of more than one ounce of marijuana, ORS 475.864 (Count 12).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\"> In relevant part, ORS 163.547(l)(a)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cA person having custody or control of a child under 16 years of age commits the crime of child neglect in the first degree if the person knowingly leaves the child, or allows the child to stay *** [i]n or upon premises and in the immediate proximity where controlled substances are criminally delivered or manufactured for consideration or profit * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\"> On appeal, defendant invokes the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution in his privacy-interest argument.
