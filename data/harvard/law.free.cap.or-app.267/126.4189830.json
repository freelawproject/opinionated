J.</author>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Petitioner seeks review of an order of the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (the board), postponing his parole release date for 10 years on the ground that he had <em>\u201ca </em>present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community,\u201d ORS 144.125(3)(a), and that it was not reasonable to expect that petitioner would be granted release before 10 years from his current projected release date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On review, petitioner contends, among other things, that (1) the \u201cboard has not offered a rational, fair, or principled explanation\u201d for applying 1984 legal standards in determining whether he had the requisite present severe emotional disturbance in light of its prior practice of applying the 1988 legal standards to him and (2) substantial evidence does not support one of the factors on which the board relied in postponing petitioner\u2019s parole release date for 10 years. As amplified below, we reject both of those dispositive contentions. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">A detailed recitation of the historical facts giving rise to this case would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. It is sufficient to note that, in 1975, petitioner murdered a young mother in front of two of her children, after having raped the same woman a couple of weeks earlier in her home at gunpoint. After driving the woman and her children to a secluded location, he stabbed the woman repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and placed her body on the floor board of the car at the feet of her children. Eventually, petitioner beheaded the woman, who may have still been alive at the time. Petitioner buried her body in gravel near the car and left with her head. The children \u2014 an infant and a two-year-old \u2014 were eventually found in the car. The two-year-old was in a semicatatonic state, softly crying for his mother.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner pleaded guilty to the rape and murder and was sentenced under the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d system to life in prison for the murder conviction and a consecutive 20-year sentence for the rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Thereafter, in 1977, the legislature replaced the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d system with a new sentencing system known as the \u201cmatrix.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201c[a]fter the legislature adopted the matrix system, the board adopted a policy under which it would permit inmates like petitioner, who were serving indeterminate sentences [under the discretionary system], to elect to be treated under the new matrix system. Over time, as the board amended its rules pertaining to the implementation of the new system, the board applied a policy under which it would consider each inmate\u2019s eligibility for release according to the statute and rules in effect when the inmate committed his or her crimes. For inmates who committed their crimes before the adoption of the matrix system and later elected to be treated under that system, the board applied a policy of determining the inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole according to the statute and rules in <em>effect at the time of the inmate\u2019s election into the matrix </em>system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Gordon v. Board of Parole, </em>343 Or 618, 622-23, 175 P3d 461 (2007) <em>(Gordon I) </em>(emphasis added). As pertinent here, under the matrix system, once the board sets an inmate\u2019s initial parole release date, the board may postpone that date only if, among other reasons, the inmate has \u201ca present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d ORS 144.125(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Although the parties agree that the matrix system applies to this case, they disagree as to when petitioner elected into that system. That is so because of the complex procedural circumstances underlying petitioner\u2019s elections. As do the parties, we take our description of those circumstances from <em>Gordon I.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">\u201cIn August 1984, petitioner made *** an election [into the matrix system]. The form that petitioner signed to effectuate that election recited, T am aware that once I choose to receive a firm release date under the matrix, I cannot later request to be considered under the former \u201cdiscretionary\u201d system.\u2019 The board conducted a hearing on the day petitioner made that election. It applied the matrix rules and, although the board could have denied petitioner release on parole entirely, it unanimously decided to set an initial release date of March 15, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">\u201cPetitioner sought administrative review of and ultimately attempted to appeal that decision. In the course of that appeal, the board discovered that the hearing to set petitioner\u2019s initial release date had not been recorded. The board therefore set another hearing for November 7, 1984, for the purpose of redetermining the \u2018facts and findings\u2019 made at the earlier hearing. The record is unclear as to whether a hearing actually took place on November 7. However, on November 14, 1984, the board issued an order continuing the matter and stating,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201c\u2018Board actions of 8/10/84 and 11/7/84 are VOID. Refer to analyst for recomputation of History/Risk score and material to be considered by the Board is to be disclosed to the inmate. Reschedule upon completion.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201cThe matter was continued on two subsequent occasions<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> and petitioner eventually appeared before the board on May 15, 1985. In response to petitioner\u2019s attempt to clarify his position with regard to the August 1984 order setting his initial release date, the presiding board member, Aronson, asked petitioner whether he wanted to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>considered under the matrix system. Petitioner responded no, adding that he considered himself to remain subject to the discretionary system, because the earlier order setting his release date was invalid. Aronson agreed with that assessment and then asked petitioner whether he \u2018want[ed] to go under the discretionary system.\u2019 Petitioner responded in the affirmative. Aronson then presented petitioner with a document, explaining that, if petitioner signed it, \u2018we\u2019ll leave you under the discretionary system.\u2019 Petitioner signed that document, and Aronson recapitulated, \u2018[Y]ou will note on the record that [petitioner] now is [sic] chosen to remain under the discretionary system. You are aware that you still have the option to go back?\u2019 Petitioner again responded in the affirmative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">\u201cOn May 20,1985, the board issued an order stating that petitioner \u2018signed [an] application for purpose of remaining under the Discretionary System\u2019 and setting a parole hearing date of September 2005. In that order, the board cited the criteria listed in <em>former </em>ORS 144.175 (1975). The board later amended that order to include reference to a review hearing in October 1986. In January 1986, the board issued another order clarifying that the reason for the October 1986 review hearing was that \u2018[t]his inmate is under the Discretionary System. That dictates that he must be seen every two (2) YEARS.\u2019 The board issued several additional orders between January 1986 and December 1987, all confirming that petitioner remained subject to the discretionary system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cIn August 1988, petitioner signed and submitted another request to be considered under the matrix system. Again, the form that petitioner signed to effectuate that election recited, T am aware that once I choose to receive a firm release date under the matrix, I cannot later request to be considered under the former \u201cdiscretionary\u201d system.\u2019 In response to petitioner\u2019s election, the board conducted a hearing on January 10, 1989, to determine whether to set an initial release date. A three-member majority of the board, after considering petitioner\u2019s criminal history, the seriousness of his crime, and various aggravating factors, set an initial release date of March 15, 2000, following 294 months in prison. One board member would have required petitioner to serve 300 months in prison, and one member would have denied parole release entirely because of the particularly violent nature of petitioner\u2019s crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201cIn August 1989, the board advanced petitioner\u2019s release date by seven months. ORS 144.122(l)(a) (permitting the board to reset release date to an earlier date if it finds that petitioner has demonstrated \u2018an extended course of conduct indicating outstanding reformation\u2019). The board set a new release date of August 15, 1999.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 623-25 (footnote omitted; third through eighth brackets in <em>Gordon I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In sum, as recounted by the Supreme Court in <em>Gordon I, </em>petitioner elected into the matrix system twice\u2014 once in 1984 and again in 1988. As noted above, 267 Or App at 130, the parties in this judicial review proceeding \u2014 as in <em>Gordon I </em>and in subsequent cases concerning the postponement of petitioner\u2019s parole release date \u2014 disagree as to whether the board may rely on petitioner\u2019s 1984 election or his 1988 election in determining whether to postpone petitioner\u2019s parole release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u201cThe date of petitioner\u2019s election into the matrix system is significant because it affects the information on which the board may rely in determining whether petitioner has a present severe emotional disturbance for purposes of ORS 144.125(3)(a).\u201d <em>Gordon v. Board of Parole, </em>266 Or App 405, 407, 338 P3d 185 (2014) <em>(Gordon III). </em>Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">\u201c [i] f [petitioner] elected into the matrix system in 1984, the board may rely on \u2018both a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis and other pertinent evidence in the record\u2019 \u2014 that is, all evidence in the record. <em>See Weidner v. Armenakis, </em>154 Or App 12, 20, 959 P2d 623, <em>vac\u2019d and rem\u2019d, </em>327 Or 317 (1998), <em>dismissed by order </em>July 13, 1998, <em>reasoning readopted and reaffirmed in Merrill v. Johnson, </em>155 Or App 295, 964 P2d 284, <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 40 (1998).<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> However, if petitioner did not opt into the matrix system until 1988, the board could rely only on the psychological evaluation in determining whether he has a present severe emotional disturbance. <em>See Peek v. Thompson, </em>160 Or App 260, 265-66, 980 P2d 178, <em>rev dismissed, </em>329 Or 553 (1999). That is so because an administrative rule, which was in effect during that time, imposed \u2018a greater limit on the [b] oard\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>authority to extend a release date.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 265; see <em>generally id. </em>at 264-66 (discussing OAR 255-60-006 (1988), which provided in part that, \u2018[i]f the evaluation does not make a finding of a severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community, the Board shall affirm the parole release date and set parole conditions\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><em>Gordon III, </em>266 Or App at 407-08 (footnote omitted; fourth and fifth brackets in <em>Gordon III).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The parties\u2019 longstanding disagreement concerning whether the board may rely on petitioner\u2019s 1984 election and, in turn, postpone his parole release date under the <em>Weidner </em>standard \u2014 or whether it must rely on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election and, in turn, postpone his release date under the <em>Peek </em>standard \u2014 began with <em>Gordon I. </em>For that reason, we recount in some detail the circumstances giving rise <em>to </em>that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">As noted, the board ultimately established an August 15, 1999, release date for petitioner. <em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 625. Before that date, the board had petitioner evaluated by a psychologist, who provided the board with a report of his evaluation. <em>Id. </em>The board determined that petitioner had the requisite present severe emotional disturbance and postponed his release date for two years. <em>Id. </em>at 626. Petitioner sought administrative review, contending, among other things, that the board lacked authority to postpone his release date \u201cbecause [the psychologist\u2019s] report did not support such a finding.\u201d Id. In June 1999 \u2014 approximately two months after we had decided <em>Peek </em>\u2014 the board issued an order, applying the <em>Weidner </em>standard and rejecting petitioner\u2019s contentions. <em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 627. In other words, the board did not rely solely on the psychologist\u2019s report, but, instead, after examining the \u201creport, together with its exit interview of petitioner and other documents presented at the hearing,\u201d the board determined that petitioner \u201csuffered from a present severe emotional disturbance such as to justify deferring his parole release date for two years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Thereafter, the board, on its own motion, reconsidered its June 1999 order. <em>Id. </em>On July 25, 2000, the board issued another order, explaining, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u201cTt is the board\u2019s policy for discretionary inmates who opt into the matrix system to apply the rules in effect at the time the inmate opts into the matrix system. <em>[Petitioner] opted into the matrix system on 8127188. </em>The Peek decision applies to the rules in effect when [petitioner] opted into the matrix system. The board has now reconsidered this case under the Peek decision. The board considered the psychological evaluation as a whole and finds that it constitutes a finding of a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the community.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 629 (brackets in <em>Gordon I; </em>emphasis added) (quoting board\u2019s July 2000 order).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Petitioner then filed a habeas corpus petition, challenging the postponement of his parole release date in the July 2000 order. The circuit court determined that the board\u2019s order comported with the <em>Peek </em>standard and dismissed the petition in February 2001. <em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 630. Petitioner appealed, and we held oral argument in February 2003. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In the meantime, the two-year postponement of petitioner\u2019s release date had neared its end. <em>Id. </em>The board requested a new psychological evaluation. <em>Id. </em>On May 2, 2001, the board reaffirmed that petitioner had opted into the matrix system in 1988 and again postponed petitioner\u2019s release date for another two years under the <em>Peek </em>standard. <em>Id. </em>Petitioner sought administrative review. <em>Id. </em>In its May 29, 2001, order on review, the board affirmed its decision to postpone petitioner\u2019s release date; however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201c[t]his time * * * the board offered an entirely new explanation: according to the board, <em>the </em>Peek <em>rule did not apply to petitioner because he had first elected to be considered under the matrix rules in 1984, </em>before the <em>Peek </em>rule had been promulgated, and under the 1984 rules, the board was entitled to base its decision to defer petitioner\u2019s release on all information available to it at the time of the hearing. In reversing its reasoning, the board informed petitioner that, because petitioner first attempted to opt into the matrix system in 1984, the board was required to apply the 1984 rules, because \u2018[i]t would be an equal protection violation to allow discretionary system offenders to intentionally place themselves in a more favorable position for release when other offenders cannot.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 630 (second brackets in <em>Gordon I; </em>emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Thereafter, in April 2003, the board withdrew its July 2000 order, and two months later \u2014 in June 2003 \u2014 the board issued a final order affirming its decision to postpone petitioner\u2019s August 1999 release date. <em>Id. </em>at 631. In that June 2003 order, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">\u201c\u2018In [the July 2000 order], the board erroneously applied the rules in effect the second time [petitioner] opted into the matrix system on August 27, 1988. This was incorrect. [Petitioner] initially opted into the matrix system on August 10, 1984. He then reconsidered and requested that he be returned to the discretionary system on May 20, 1985. On August 27, 1988, [petitioner] submitted a request to once again have his case considered under the matrix system. It is the board\u2019s policy, when an offender opts into the matrix system on more than one occasion, to consider the laws in effect at the time that the offender first opts in. The board failed to do so in [petitioner\u2019s] case. To do otherwise would allow offenders under the discretionary system to place themselves in a more favorable position with regard to the board\u2019s rules than they would otherwise be by opting in and out of the matrix system.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"><em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 631 (brackets in <em>Gordon I). </em>In other words, inconsistently with the policy stated in its July 2000 <em>order </em>\u2014 viz., to apply the legal standards in effect at the time the inmate opts into the matrix system \u2014 the board ultimately announced a different policy in its June 2003 order\u2014 <em>viz., </em>to apply the legal standards in effect at the time that an inmate with multiple elections first opts into the matrix system.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In light of the new 2003 order, we dismissed the habeas appeal as moot because the effective order postponing petitioner\u2019s release date was no longer the July 2000 order that was the subject of that appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 631 n 10. Petitioner sought judicial review of the June 2003 order, and we affirmed without opinion. <em>Gordon v. Board of Parole, </em>207 Or App 435, 142 P3d 125 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>343 Or 618, 175 P3d 461 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Petitioner then sought review in the Supreme Court. On review, he contended that the board\u2019s June 2003 order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u201crepresented an arbitrary and <em>ad hoc </em>decision designed to avoid an outcome that the board did not desire, <em>viz., </em>that petitioner be released on parole on his 1999 release date.\u201d <em>Gordon </em>/, 343 Or at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In addressing the June 2003 order, the Supreme Court noted that appellate courts review board orders using the standards set out in the Administrative Procedures Act <em>(APA) </em>\u2014 viz., ORS 183.482(8).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court identified the dispositive issue as whether, under ORS 183.482(8)(b)(B), \u201cthe board, in its June 2003 order, exercised its discretion in a manner \u2018inconsistent with an agency rule, an officially stated agency position, or a prior agency practice,\u2019 and did not adequately explain the inconsistency.\u201d <em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In resolving that issue, the Supreme Court explained that the July 2000 and May 2, 2001, orders\u2014 which stated that petitioner had elected into the matrix in 1988 and was subject to the <em>Peek </em>standard \u2014 reflected \u201cthe board\u2019s interpretation of its stated policy \u2018to apply the rules in effect at the time the inmate opts into the matrix system\u2019 to require the application of the rules in effect at the time of an inmate\u2019s most recent, or effective, election. At the least, they reflect an agency practice to do so.\u201d <em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 634. By contrast, in the June 2003 order on review in <em>Gordon I, </em>\u201cthe board announced a policy under which it would apply to parole release decisions the rules in effect the first time an inmate opts into the matrix system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given that difference, the Supreme Court held that the June 2003 order was \u201cinconsistent with an agency rule, an officially stated agency position, or a prior agency practice\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>under ORS 183.482(8)(b)(B). <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Nevertheless, the court explained that such an inconsistency did not, by itself, make the June 2003 order \u201cimpermissible or unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634. Rather, as the court reasoned, \u201can inconsistent order is subject to remand by the court only if the inconsistency is not explained by the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634-35 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Ultimately, the court rejected both of the board\u2019s proffered explanations for its policy of applying the rules in effect at the time of an inmate\u2019s first election into the matrix system. The court first rejected the board\u2019s explanation that the policy was necessary because \u201cit would be an equal protection violation to allow discretionary system offenders to intentionally place themselves in a more favorable position for release when other offenders cannot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635 (internal quotation marks omitted). In rejecting that proffered rationale, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cHere, the board\u2019s choice was to apply the rules in place either when petitioner opted into the matrix system temporarily in 1984 or permanently in 1988. Applying the latter set of rules neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, and the board rationally could have concluded that applying the rules in place when petitioner permanently opted into the matrix system in 1988 would result in the same treatment as other inmates coming into the matrix system on that date. The board\u2019s stated rationale that equal protection required it to apply the 1984 rules to petitioner is simply wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\"><em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Similarly, the Supreme Court also rejected the board\u2019s related explanation that the policy prevented inmates from placing themselves \u201cin a more favorable position\u201d with respect to other inmates by opting into and out of the matrix system. <em>Id. </em>at 636. The court explained that \u201c[a] board rule that requires application of one set of rules versus another set (be they the rules in effect at the time of the first election or the rules in effect at the time of the most recent election) does nothing to minimize or eliminate\u201d inequality and that here \u201c[t]he board has not shown that treating petitioner as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>subject to the 1988 rules rather than the 1984 rules actually or potentially would place him in a more favorable position with respect to any other inmate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Finally, the Supreme Court noted that the \u201coverarching theme\u201d embodied in the board\u2019s contentions was that its change in policy \u201cwas necessary to correct an error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Characterizing that contention as \u201cbootstrapping,\u201d the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201cIt is apparent from the orders that the board issued with respect to petitioner <em>before </em>May 29,2001, in which it applied the rules in effect when petitioner made his 1988 election into the matrix system, that there was no \u2018error\u2019 until the board announced the new, first-election-counts policy, in 2001. That new policy <em>created </em>rather than corrected any arguable error in the earlier orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 637 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In sum, the Supreme Court held that, because \u201cthe June 2003 order, reflecting the board\u2019s \u2018policy\u2019 to use the rules in effect at the time of an inmate\u2019s first election, is inconsistent with a prior board practice and * * * the board has not offered a rational, fair, or principled explanation for the inconsistency!,]\u201d the board \u201cabused its discretion under ORS 183.482(8)(b)(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, pursuant to ORS 183.482(8)(b)(B), the court \u201cremand[ed] this case to the board <em>to permit it to provide, if it can, a rational, fair, and principled explanation </em>for departing from its practice of relying on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">On remand, in Board Action Form 14 (BAF 14), the board (1) proffered a new explanation for departing from its practice of relying on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election, and (2) then relying on petitioner\u2019s 1984 election, postponed his parole release date under the <em>Weidner </em>standard. Alternatively, the board reasoned that, even if petitioner were correct that the board had to rely on his 1988 election, it had properly postponed his parole release date under the <em>Peek </em>standard. Petitioner sought judicial review, which culminated in <em>Gordon II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">In <em>Gordon II, </em>we held that, even assuming, without deciding, that petitioner were correct that his 1988 election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>controlled \u2014 and thus <em>Peek </em>rather than <em>Weidner </em>applied\u2014 the board had not erred in postponing petitioner\u2019s release because its finding that petitioner\u2019s psychological evaluation demonstrated that he had a present severe emotional disturbance that constituted a danger to the health or safety of the community was supported by substantial evidence, satisfying the <em>Peek </em>standard. 246 Or App at 612-13. Accordingly, in <em>Gordon II, </em>we did not address the legal adequacy of the board\u2019s explanation in BAF 14 for departing from its practice of relying on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election. <em>Id. </em>at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The adequacy of that explanation \u2014 which the board has incorporated into subsequent orders postponing petitioner\u2019s parole release date \u2014 has been an issue in other, subsequent, judicial review proceedings involving petitioner. <em>See, e.g., Gordon III, </em>266 Or App 405 (concerning the board\u2019s order postponing petitioner\u2019s parole release date for two years from 2009 to 2011). However, until now, we have never addressed the adequacy of that explanation. <em>See id. </em>at 412 (concluding that, even if petitioner were correct that the <em>Peek </em>standard applied, the board properly postponed his parole release date under that standard); <em>Gordon II, </em>246 Or App at 607 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Against that historic backdrop, we return to the procedural facts giving rise to this judicial review proceeding. In February 2011, the board conducted an exit interview with petitioner. Before the hearing, the board received a psychological evaluation from Dr. Templeman. In that evaluation, Templeman rendered the following opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201cDennis Gordon is now a 62-year-old man who clearly has met criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder for many years, with criminal activities and incarcerations even prior to his index crime. After 35 years he still minimizes his initial aggression toward his victim when he raped her and still attributes her murder to psychological processes over which he had no control. Indeed he still practically blames the victim for her own death, claiming he had \u2018no choice\u2019 after she had testified against him to a grand jury. He now claims that he apologized to her before he killed her, which is frankly ludicrous. His psychological explanations are apparently borrowed from the opinions of an earlier psychologist he saw for treatment in prison. I find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>little evidence that either of his crimes were motivated by [post-traumatic stress disorder] symptoms. His report of the rape itself is quite discrepant from the victim\u2019s, and his returning to Roseburg \u2018out of fear\u2019 is also discrepant from the threats he made to the victim about coming back for her if she disclosed the crime. Thus, he continues to rationalize a very heinous crime in a self-serving manner. While his behavior has been well adjusted in prison over the past 30 years, his parole plans are still vague and he shows no genuine interest in treatment. If released he will have no interpersonal support, nor does he think he needs much. He is prepared to start casual relationships with women when he is released, without much thought about the emotional complexities of such relationships. <em>Thus he is still thinking like an Antisocial Personality </em>Disorder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Ultimately, in Board Action Form 18, the board relied on petitioner\u2019s 1984 election, applied the <em>Weidner </em>standard, and determined that, based on Templeman\u2019s \u201creport and diagnosis, coupled with all the information that the Board is considering,\u201d petitioner had a present severe emotional disturbance that constituted a danger to the health or safety of the community. Further, relying on OAR 255-062-0016, the board found that \u201cit is not reasonable to expect that [petitioner] will be granted a firm release date before 10 years from [his] current projected release date.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In doing so, the board relied on six of the nonexclusive factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>denominated in the <em>rule </em>\u2014 viz., OAR 255-062-0016(2), (4), (6), (9), (11), and (12). Accordingly, the board postponed petitioner\u2019s parole release date for 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Petitioner sought administrative review. In Administrative Review Response 17, the board rejected petitioner\u2019s contentions that it had erred in postponing his release date. In doing so, the board offered two alternative rationales, each of which it deemed to be independently sufficient to support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><em>First, </em>the board rejected petitioner\u2019s contention that it had erred in \u201cdetermining that [his] matrix opt-in date is 1984\u201d rather than the date of his \u201clater matrix election *** in 1988\u201d and, in turn, in applying the <em>Weidner </em>standard in determining whether to postpone his release date. In doing so, the board incorporated the reasoning in BAF 14 to explain why it was relying on petitioner\u2019s 1984 election into the matrix rather than his 1988 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Specifically, in BAF 14, the board noted that, because of the \u201cprospective\u201d nature of a parole decision, it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201cshould be based on as much information as lawfully possible to determine, among other things, the offender\u2019s understanding of the commitment offenses, the identification of static and dynamic risk factors, and the ability of the offender to be adequately supervised in the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Further, the board explained that, before the court decided <em>Peek, </em>\u201can offender could opt in and opt out without it making a substantive difference.\u201d However, after <em>Peek </em>was decided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>there was \u201ca possibility\u201d that \u201ctwo substantive standards\u201d\u2014 <em>viz., </em>the <em>Weidner </em>standard or the <em>Peek </em>standard \u2014 could apply to an inmate. Under that circumstance, the board explained that it <em>\u201cwill choose the standard that provides the most information </em>available,\u201d <em>viz., </em>the <em>Weidner </em>standard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">In applying the <em>Weidner </em>standard, the board considered the \u201centire record,\u201d including Templeman\u2019s diagnosis and statements that petitioner made during the hearing. In sum, the board explained that it had considered the evidence that petitioner had submitted but that it had not found \u201cthat credible evidence outweighed evidence that [petitioner has] a present severe emotional disturbance such that [he] remain [s] a danger to the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>Second, </em>and alternatively, the board reasoned that, even if (as petitioner contends) his 1988 election controlled, implicating the <em>Peek </em>standard, it would find that he suffered from the requisite present severe emotional disturbance \u201cbased solely on Dr. Templeman\u2019s psychological report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Petitioner also raised various challenges before the board pertaining to the deferral of his parole release date for 10 years. As pertinent to the issues raised on judicial review, petitioner contended that one of the factors on which the board had relied \u2014 that is, that he \u201cdemonstrated lack of effort to address criminal risk factors of substance abuse problems,\u201d OAR 255-062-0016(6) \u2014 was not supported by substantial evidence. The board rejected those contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Petitioner sought judicial review. On review, petitioner challenges both of the board\u2019s rationales for postponing his release date. As explained below, we conclude that the board did not err in postponing petitioner\u2019s release date based on its first rationale, which was predicated on its reliance on petitioner\u2019s 1984 election and application of the <em>Weidner </em>standard. That conclusion obviates the need to address petitioner\u2019s contentions that are predicated on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>applicability of the 1988 legal standards. We also reject petitioner\u2019s contention that the substantial evidence does not support one of the factors on which the board relied in postponing his parole release date for 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Before turning to petitioner\u2019s substantial evidence challenge, we begin by addressing petitioner\u2019s contentions pertaining to the board\u2019s reliance on his 1984 election and application of the <em>Weidner </em>standard in determining whether to postpone his parole release date. Those contentions are predicated on two interrelated propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">First, petitioner posits that his \u201c1984 election [into the matrix system] was not effective.\u201d Specifically, he asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cPetitioner attempted to opt into the matrix system in 1984. However, the board subsequently voided the order reflecting petitioner\u2019s intent to do so. Petitioner and the board continued to apply the discretionary system until petitioner opted into the matrix system in 1988.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Second, petitioner posits that the board\u2019s explanation for departing from its practice of relying on his 1988 election and applying the <em>Peek </em>standard in determining whether to postpone his release date was inadequate. Specifically, petitioner contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">\u201cThe board\u2019s explanation that it prefers to use rules that are more beneficial to the board \u2014 those that do not limit the information that the board may rely upon in making its release decision \u2014 -is not a rational[], fair, or principled explanation for the inconsistency. The board may not arbitrarily apply those rules that it deems to be more favorable. Rather, an inmate is subject to one set of rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">In sum, noting that the board\u2019s explanation \u201cappears to be an expression of regret in adopting the 1988 rules in the first instance,\u201d petitioner reasons that, \u201c[b]ecause the board consistently applied 1988 rules to petitioner\u2019s case, it cannot subsequently change its policy and apply 1984 rules because it no longer likes the limitation that the board placed on itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">The board remonstrates that \u201c [p] etitioner\u2019s 1984 election to proceed under the matrix was effective\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201c[t]he board\u2019s explanation for using the 1984 standard is fair and rational.\u201d More particularly, the board contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">\u201cThe board\u2019s explanation of its reasons for applying the standard in effect in 1984 rather than the 1988 standard is rational. When faced with a choice between two standards, the board opts for the standard that provides it the most information possible in making its decision. As interpreted by this court, the 1984 standard allows the board to consider much more information in making its decision than would be permitted under the 1988 standard. The board best serves its own functions when it has access to the most possible relevant information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The parties\u2019 competing contentions concerning whether petitioner\u2019s 1984 election into the matrix system was operative for these purposes are not new. In fact, those contentions were raised in the parties\u2019 Supreme Court briefs in <em>Gordon 1</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although the Supreme Court did not expressly address whether petitioner\u2019s 1984 election was effective, it implicitly determined that it was. That is so for two interrelated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">First, not only was the Supreme Court clearly aware of the circumstances surrounding petitioner\u2019s 1984 and 1988 elections into the matrix system and the parties\u2019 dispute as to the significance of those circumstances, but throughout its opinion the court appeared to recognize that both elections were effective. <em>See, e.g., Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 635 (\u201cHere, the board\u2019s choice was to apply the rules in place either when petitioner opted into the matrix system temporarily in 1984 or permanently in 1988.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 636 (\u201cIt is entirely within the board\u2019s control to avoid any potential unfairness in the future, if and when the board is confronted with a parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>release decision <em>for another inmate who has opted into the matrix system more than once.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Second, and even more significantly, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the board \u201cto permit it to provide, if it can, a rational, fair, and principled explanation for departing from its practice of relying on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637. If the 1984 election were ineffective, and the 1988 election categorically conclusive, the remand so framed would have been gratuitous. In other words, had the 1988 election been the only effective election, the board, on remand, could not have offered any explanation for departing from its prior practice because, consistently with <em>Peek, </em>the <em>Peek </em>standard would necessarily have controlled \u2014 and no \u201cexplanation\u201d could have demonstrated otherwise. Accordingly, we reject petitioner\u2019s contention that the 1984 election was ineffective and turn to the remaining <em>issue </em>\u2014 viz., whether the board offered an adequate explanation for departing from its practice of relying on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In <em>Gordon I, </em>the Supreme Court explained the legal principles that circumscribe our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201cThe standards of review set out in ORS 183.482(8) reflect a legislative policy, embodied in the APA, that decisions by administrative agencies be rational, principled, and fair, rather than <em>ad hoc </em>and arbitrary. <em>See generally Martin v. Board of Parole, </em>327 Or 147, 957 P2d 1210 (1998) (requiring board adherence to principles set out in ORS 183.482(8), including principle that orders reflect rational connection between agency\u2019s reasoning and its conclusions); <em>Drew v. PSRB, </em>322 Or 491, 499-500, 909 P2d 1211 (1996) (\u2018in addition to the statutory requirement that findings be supported by substantial evidence, agencies also are required to demonstrate in their opinions the <em>reasoning </em>that leads the agency from the <em>facts </em>that it has found to the <em>conclusions </em>that it draws from those facts\u2019) (emphases in original). In <em>Green v. Hayward, </em>275 Or 693, 552 P2d 815 (1976), this court further explained the reasons for such requirements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201c\u2018If there is to be any meaningful judicial scrutiny of the activities of an administrative agency \u2014 not for the purpose of substituting judicial judgment for administrative judgment but for the purpose of requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the administrative agency to demonstrate that it has applied the criteria prescribed by statute and by its own regulations and has not acted arbitrarily or on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis \u2014 we must require that its order clearly and precisely state what it found to be the facts and fully explain why those facts lead it to the decision it makes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><em>\u201cId. </em>at 706-08, <em>quoting The Home Plate, Inc. v. OLCC, </em>20 Or App 188, 190, 530 P2d 862, 863 (1975). Although the court in <em>Green </em>was referring to the requirement in ORS 183.482(8)(c) that agency orders be supported by substantial evidence, that reasoning applies equally to our review of agency orders under ORS 183.482(8)(b)(B).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 633-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Applying those principles here, we conclude that the board has offered a \u201crational, fair, and principled explanation for departing from its practice of relying on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637. As the board explains, before we decided <em>Peek, </em>a single legal standard applied in determining whether an inmate has a present severe emotional disturbance. In other words, the legal standard applied by the board remained constant regardless of whether an inmate opted into the matrix system more than once. However, after we decided <em>Peek, </em>the legal standard differed depending on when the inmate elected into the matrix system.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As a result, an inmate with multiple elections could be subject to different substantive legal standards depending on the dates of the inmate\u2019s elections. Under that circumstance, and in light of the nature of a parole decision, the board has chosen to rely on the election that allows the board to consider the \u201cmost information available.\u201d That \u2014 as petitioner\u2019s attorney acknowledged at oral argument \u2014 is a \u201crational, fair, and principled explanation\u201d for the board\u2019s policy choice. <em>Gordon I, </em>343 Or at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Nevertheless, petitioner contends that, even if the board\u2019s policy choice is \u201crational,\u201d the board\u2019s application of that policy here is arbitrary. Significantly, however, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Gordon I, </em>the board\u2019s issuance of an order that is inconsistent with an earlier policy or practice \u201cdoes not make [that order] impermissible or unlawful.\u201d 343 Or at 634. Instead, \u201cunder ORS 183.482(8)(b)(B), an inconsistent order is subject to remand by the court only \u2018if the inconsistency is not explained by the agency.\u2019\u201d <em>Gordon </em>I, 343 Or at 634-35. As we have explained, the board has now adequately explained the policy choice underlying its decision to depart from its practice of relying on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Thus, we conclude that the board\u2019s explanation for departing from its practice of relying on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election into the matrix system is \u201crational, fair and principled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637. Further, on review, petitioner does not contend that, if the board properly relied on his 1984 election and applied the <em>Weidner </em>standard, its application of that standard was otherwise erroneous. For that reason, we conclude that the board did not err in postponing petitioner\u2019s parole release date on the ground that he suffered from \u201ca present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community,\u201d ORS 144.125 (3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Having so concluded, we turn to petitioner\u2019s remaining contention concerning whether substantial evidence supports one of the factors on which the board relied in postponing his parole release date for 10 <em>years </em>\u2014 viz., OAR 255-062-0016(6), which concerns the \u201c[i]nmate\u2019s demonstrated lack of effort to address criminal risk factors of substance abuse problems.\u201d In explaining its reliance on that factor, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">\u201cThe Board finds that the inmate consistently identified alcohol consumption and intoxication as being an element of all his crimes. In particular, he stated that he had consumed alcohol immediately before both the rape and murder. <em>The Board finds the inmate has failed to seriously recognize this risk factor and seek effective intervention. </em>Inmate states that he did not attend any sort of alcohol treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>program until 1996. Currently he has been attending Alcoholics Anonymous [(AA)] for approximately one year, stating that he \u2018doesn\u2019t get a lot out of it\u2019 but goes because, \u2018he likes talking to people.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">(Emphasis added.) In challenging that determination, petitioner correctly notes that he \u201cis not presently diagnosed as having a substance abuse problem\u201d and he has \u201ccompleted multiple treatment programs, and continues to seek weekly assistance.\u201d Nevertheless, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding concerning OAR 255-062-0016(6). <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8)(c) (\u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">During the exit interview hearing, the board engaged petitioner in an extended colloquy concerning his substance abuse. When asked why he was \u201cin AA now,\u201d petitioner responded, \u201cI\u2019m in AA because * * * I like talking about problems.\u201d That response prompted the board to ask petitioner whether he is an alcoholic. Petitioner stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">\u201cI have \u2014 yes, I am an alcoholic. I\u2019ve had \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m an alcoholic in that I realize that when I drink \u2014 I might go two or three years without a drink. I don\u2019t crave it. I don\u2019t desire it. But I realize I cannot handle the [e]ffects of alcohol when I get drunk[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Further, in discussing his relapse prevention plan if released, petitioner stated, \u201cI don\u2019t not drink because I\u2019m trying to fight an addiction. I don\u2019t drink because I don\u2019t want to drink anymore. I have no desires to drink anymore. And I know that I never will drink again or use marijuana or any other substance.\u201d That statement prompted the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">\u201c[Board Member]: *** How will you be sure of that because you\u2019ve told us basically one of the primary reasons you committed this crime is because you were drunk. It doesn\u2019t give us a lot of security that basically when one of those time periods comes up and you suddenly fall off the wagon, you\u2019re not going to start committing crimes or start doing antisocial things. What security is there that you have a plan to keep you from doing that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201c[Petitioner]: *** [Y]ou\u2019re asking me to give you an answer to what I think you know there is no absolute correct answer. * * * [T]he bottom line is I\u2019m not going to drink. I\u2019m not \u2014 I never had \u2014 when I was on parole last time I was drunk and I threatened to kill a police officer at 2:00 in the morning. At that time my parole officer * * * just told me, \u2018Well, stop using drink \u2014 stop drinking.\u2019 And I quit drinking. But it wasn\u2019t a requirement on parole not to drink at that time. And I didn\u2019t drink anymore while I was on parole. I just cut it loose, you know. And two years later when I got off parole, I went out and I \u2014 I went on a binge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We conclude that, viewed in its entirety, that colloquy permitted the board to find that petitioner \u2014 who \u201cconsistently identified alcohol consumption and intoxication as being an element of all his crimes\u201d \u2014 \u201chas failed to seriously recognize this risk factor and seek effective intervention.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the board\u2019s finding concerning petitioner\u2019s \u201cdemonstrated lack of effort to address criminal risk factors of substance abuse problems.\u201d OAR 255-062-0016(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In sum, we conclude that the board\u2019s explanation for departing from its practice of relying on petitioner\u2019s 1988 election into the matrix system is adequate and that substantial evidence supports one of the factors on which the board relied in postponing his parole release date for 10 <em>years </em>\u2014 viz., OAR 255-062-0016(6). Accordingly, we affirm the board\u2019s order postponing his parole release on the ground that he had \u201ca present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community,\u201d ORS 144.125(3)(a), and that it was not reasonable to expect that petitioner would be granted release before 10 years from his current projected release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\"> As pertinent here, ORS 144.125(3)(a) was amended in 2009 to permit the board to postpone a parole release date for up to 10 years if the board finds that an inmate has the requisite present severe emotional disturbance. Or Laws 2009, ch 660, \u00a7 3. Further, in 2009, the legislature also enacted ORS 144.280, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201c[(l)](b) The board may not grant the prisoner a hearing that is more than two years from the date parole is denied unless the board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that the prisoner would be granted parole before the date of the subsequent hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Or Laws 2009, ch 660, \u00a7 2. Thereafter, the board promulgated administrative rules to implement that legislation. <em>See generally </em>OAR ch 255, div 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Although petitioner contends that the board erred in applying those statutes and the newly promulgated rules, the success of that contention depends on the correctness of a subsidiary <em>premise </em>\u2014 viz., that the board erred in applying the 1984 legal standards. As explained below, 267 Or App at 144-47, we conclude that the board did not so err. Accordingly, we refer to the current version of the statutes and rules for convenience.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\"> For a more detailed description of petitioner\u2019s crimes, see <em>Gordon v.
