J.</author>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for delivery of marijuana, ORS 475.860. He asserts that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury on the charge of delivery of a controlled substance because that instruction was an impermissible comment on the evidence in violation of ORCP 59 E and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that defendant failed to preserve the arguments that he now raises on appeal and, even assuming without deciding that any' error was plain, we decline to exercise our discretion pursuant to <em>Ailes v. Portland </em>Meadows, <em>Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991), to correct it in this case. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The circumstances pertaining to defendant\u2019s conviction, as substantiated by the state\u2019s evidence at trial, are as follows. In April 2012, Officer Flowers stopped defendant for speeding on Highway 22 in Marion County. Ultimately, Flowers impounded the car, a Dodge Neon (Dodge), and another officer conducted a \u201cquick inventory search.\u201d The inside of the car was \u201creal dirty,\u201d but the officer did not discover anything unlawful. Flowers then called Rino Recovery and Towing to tow the Dodge, and the owner of the towing company, Rinerson, secured it in his impound building.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">A couple of days later, Rinerson received several telephone calls from a man who wanted to retrieve his cell phone from inside the Dodge. Sometime after that, defendant asked his ex-girlfriend, Martin, if she wanted to come with him \u201cto look at cars.\u201d Martin reluctantly agreed, and they drove in her car to Salem. During the drive, defendant told Martin that \u201che had a large amount of marijuana in his [Dodge] and that he was going to sell it and make all this money [,] and he was going to help [her] out.\u201d Defendant then asked Martin to go to the tow lot as \u201chis driver\u201d and \u201cpick up the car.\u201d Martin refused, and told defendant to get out of her car. Martin then drove away and called Rinerson at the tow company, telling him that there were \u201ctwo or three pounds of marijuana\u201d in the Dodge. Rinerson then called the police, and Officer Bird responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>At the tow lot, Rinerson told Bird that a woman had called and told him that there was possibly marijuana in the Dodge. Bird looked in the Dodge, but he could not see or smell any marijuana. Around that time, defendant arrived at the tow lot and told Rinerson that he wanted to get his cell phone out of the Dodge. Rinerson gave defendant the cell phone, but explained that he could not release the car to defendant without a licensed driver and the car\u2019s registration. Bird then asked defendant whether there was marijuana in the car. Defendant denied knowing anything about marijuana and, when Bird asked for consent to search the Dodge, defendant responded that \u201che didn\u2019t care, [and that] it wasn\u2019t his car.\u201d Defendant then left, and Bird searched the car. On the floorboard of the back seat underneath a pile of wet jeans, Bird discovered a white plastic grocery bag \u201cthat was full of marijuana buds and a couple of smaller Ziploc bags that had marijuana in them as well.\u201d Bird later testified that, in his experience, a typical user quantity of marijuana is less than an ounce. In total, the marijuana found in the Dodge weighed 13.4 ounces.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">At trial, defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that the marijuana was not his. In his opening statement, defense counsel argued only that \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence that my client put the marijuana in the car.\u201d In his closing argument, defense counsel reiterated that \u201cthe bottom line is, it\u2019s not [defendant\u2019s] car. He borrow [ed] it from somebody else. And the bottom line is there\u2019s no evidence in the case whatsoever tying [defendant] to the marijuana in the car or delivery of marijuana * * * \u201d Defense counsel reminded the jury that defendant had told the officer that the marijuana was not his. Finally, counsel read to the jury the instruction that \u201cmere presence in the vehicle where the marijuana is found by a later search, even if the defendant has knowledge of the activity, is not sufficient to *** find[] that the defendant is guilty of delivery of a controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">At the close of the evidence, the trial court gave the jury the instruction on delivery<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the following special instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\u201cAn example of a substantial step includes, but it is not limited to, possession of a large amount of a controlled substance not for personal use, but consistent instead with trafficking in controlled substances. Thus, under Oregon law, possession with intent to deliver constitutes delivery even when no actual transfer is shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">After the jury retired, defendant excepted to that special instruction for two reasons. First, defendant argued that the initial sentence \u2014 the example of a substantial step \u2014 was \u201cambiguous and could lead to an incorrect result.\u201d Second, defendant challenged the last sentence \u2014 \u201cpossession with intent to deliver constitutes delivery even when no actual transfer is shown\u201d \u2014 contending that it violated his right to due process. Specifically, defendant argued that \u201cthe courts * * * in some cases say that that\u2019s the law, but I believe that that should be objected to, and maybe the courts will reconsider that at some point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In response, the state took the position that the example of a substantial step was \u201can accurate statement of the law, based on the case of\u2019 <em>State v. Alvarez-Garcia, </em>212 Or App 663, 159 P3d 357 (2007), and that the last sentence was \u201cproper\u201d because it was \u201can exact recitation of the statutory language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Ultimately, the court stated that giving the instruction was proper and that it thought that the state was \u201ccorrect as to the case law.\u201d Defendant was found guilty of delivery of marijuana, ORS 475.860.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by giving the aforementioned special instruction. Specifically, defendant now argues that (1) the instruction constituted an \u201cimproper comment on the evidence\u201d in violation of ORCP 59 E;* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the instruction deprived him of due process by \u201cinstructing the jury to draw an inference against the defendant thereby shifting the burden of proof from the state to the defendant.\u201d Defendant acknowledges that he \u201cdid not make as detailed of an argument below as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>he does now on appeal,\u201d but he argues that he adequately preserved the argument because he \u201cidentified the portion of the state\u2019s special instruction that formed the basis of his objection\u201d and \u201ccited the correct source of law for his due process argument on appeal.\u201d Defendant further argues that, even if we determine that he did not preserve his argument, we should review the alleged error as \u201can error of law apparent on the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), and exercise our discretion pursuant to <em>Ailes </em>to correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The state responds that defendant failed to preserve his present challenge and that the purported error is not reviewable as plain error, because a reasonable dispute exists about whether the instruction was erroneous. The state further contends that, in any event, we should not exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion, because any alleged error was harmless in that there was no actual dispute or confusion at trial as to whether the 13.4 ounces of marijuana packaged in individual baggies amounted to a substantial step toward delivery \u2014 rather, the dispute was over whether the marijuana belonged to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We begin our analysis with preservation. As a general rule, claims of error that were not raised before the trial court will not be considered on appeal. <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 548, 258 P3d 1228 (2011). The purpose of preservation is \u201cto advance goals such as ensuring that the positions of the parties are presented clearly to the initial tribunal and that parties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument.\u201d <em>State v. Whitmore, </em>257 Or App 664, 666, 307 P3d 552 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we will review an issue advanced by a party on appeal as long as that party provided \u201cthe trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that [was] specific enough to ensure that the court [could] identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction [was] warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000); ORCP 59 H(2) (a party \u201cmust identify with particularity the points on which the exception is based\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We have held that, for purposes of preserving an error, \u201cit is essential to raise the relevant issue at trial, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>less important to make a specific argument or identify a specific legal source with respect to the issue raised.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>328 Or 116, 122, 970 P2d 215 (1998). Although there is some degree of liberality to the preservation requirement, the requirement is not meant to be \u201ca cursory search for some common thread, however remote, between an issue on appeal and a position that was advanced at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, when determining if an issue has been adequately preserved for review, the appropriate focus \u201cis whether a party has given opponents and the trial court enough information to be able to understand the contention and to fairly respond to it.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>350 Or at 552. We conclude that defendant did not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">As noted, at trial, defendant made two exceptions to the jury instruction. <em>See </em>267 Or App at 689. Defendant\u2019s first exception was (again) that the example of a substantial step in the instruction was \u201cambiguous\u201d and \u201ccould lead to an incorrect result.\u201d Now, on appeal, defendant presents a precise and nuanced argument that the instruction is an \u201cimproper comment on the evidence\u201d in violation of ORCP 59 E \u2014 and relies on his first exception at trial as preserving that challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Defendant\u2019s present, appellate challenge is qualitatively different from his first exception at trial. In particular, defense counsel never referred to the instruction being an \u201cimproper comment on the evidence\u201d or made any reference to ORCP 59 E. Nor did trial counsel explain the basis for his exception in such a manner that would have alerted the trial court to consider whether the instruction was, in fact, an improper comment on the evidence. <em>Compare State v. Naudain, </em>254 Or App 1, 8, 292 P3d 623 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 788 (2013) (instructional error preserved where substance <em>of </em>counsel\u2019s comments did alert trial court as to \u201cimproper comment on the evidence\u201d-based challenge).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that defendant did not adequately preserve his first appellate challenge to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">We turn to whether defendant\u2019s second exception at trial preserved his appellate contention that the instruction violated due process by improperly \u201cshifting the burden of proof from the state to the defendant.\u201d Again, we conclude that defendant failed to preserve his appellate challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">At trial, in objecting to the second sentence of the instruction \u2014 \u201cpossession with intent to deliver constitutes delivery even when no actual transfer is shown\u201d \u2014 defense counsel made a single, generic reference to due process. The totality of counsel\u2019s exception in that regard was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201cI would object to [the second sentence of the instruction], based on the United States Constitution due process. I think that \u2014 and the courts I know in some cases say that that\u2019s the law, but I believe that that should be objected to, and maybe the courts will reconsider that at some point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Defendant did not assert, as he does now, that the instruction, in its entirety, deprived him of due process of law because it instructed \u201cthe jury to draw an inference against the defendant thereby shifting the burden of proof from the state to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">As noted above, the question of preservation does not entail \u201ca cursory search for some common thread, however remote, between an issue on appeal and a position that was advanced at trial.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>328 Or at 122. Although defendant referred to \u201cdue process\u201d generically, the gravamen of his objection was simply that he disagreed with the case law that establishes that the crime of delivery can be shown even in the absence of actual transfer. Counsel did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>not argue \u2014 as defendant does now \u2014 that the instruction was improper because it required the jury to draw a particular inference against defendant. <em>See, e.g., State v. Graves, </em>264 Or App 358, 367, 332 P3d 319 (2014) (fleeting references to \u201chearsay\u201d in the trial court were not sufficient to alert the trial court and the state to the \u201c\u2018layered hearsay\u2019\u201d argument that the defendant raised and developed on appeal). Accordingly, defendant\u2019s general reference to the legal concept of \u201cdue process\u201d was insufficient to preserve his appellate challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">We proceed, then, to defendant\u2019s alternative contention that we should review and remedy the purported instructional error as plain error. As noted, the parties dispute whether the asserted error satisfies the requisites of an \u201cerror of law apparent on the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), and, specifically, whether the alleged error was \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (to constitute plain error, the error must satisfy three criteria: (1) it must be one \u201cof law\u201d; (2) it must be \u201capparent,\u201d which means \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) it must appear \u201con the face of the record,\u201d so that we \u201cneed not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We need not, and do not, resolve that matter, because, even assuming, without deciding, that the alleged instructional error was plain error, we decline to exercise our discretion pursuant to <em>Ailes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">As the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Ailes, </em>\u201c[a] court\u2019s decision to recognize unpreserved or unraised error in this manner should be made with utmost caution. Such an action is contrary to the strong policies requiring preservation and raising of error.\u201d 312 Or at 382. \u201cThe criteria we must apply ensure that review of plain error will be the exception, and not the rule. Those criteria ensure that the appellate courts will bypass principles of preservation only in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Jury, </em>185 Or App 132, 138-39, 57 P3d 970 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 504 (2003). In determining whether to exercise our discretion, we generally consider \u201cthe competing interests of the parties, the nature of the case, the gravity of the error, and the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Here, we decline to exercise our discretion, because to do so in these circumstances would substantially subvert principles of preservation without materially promoting the interests of justice. In that regard, we emphasize two salient facts. First, defendant\u2019s sole theory of defense was that the 13.4 ounces of marijuana found in the Dodge <em>was not his. </em>The challenged instruction had no bearing on the jury\u2019s consideration and determination of that dispositive fact. Defendant never contended that, even if the jury found that the marijuana was his marijuana, jurors could, or should, nevertheless decline to find the requisite intent to deliver. Second, the substance of the challenge defendant raises on appeal was available to counsel as of the time of defendant\u2019s (2012) trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given the nature of the defense in this case and the availability of a colorable exception to the instruction, if defendant would have raised his present challenge at trial, it is entirely plausible that, to avoid potential reversible error, the trial court would have modified the instruction accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In sum, the purported error was not preserved, and, even if assumed to be plain error, we decline to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\"> \u201cDelivery. Deliver or delivery. The actual, constructive, or attempted transfer from one person to another of a controlled substance.

We rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>state\u2019s nonpreservation argument, concluding that the defendant adequately preserved his argument because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">\u201c[i]n essence, the basis for defendant\u2019s objection at trial was that the instruction impermissibly instructed the jury on how the evidence of the robbery related to the legal issue of self-defense and that it implicitly instructed the jury to draw an inference against defendant that shifted the burden of proof from the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 8 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b716-6\"> <em>Cf.
