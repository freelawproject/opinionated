J.</author>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Petitioner, who pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death, appeals the dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief. Petitioner argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the post-conviction court erred in denying his allegation that criminal trial counsel were constitutionally inadequate in advising him to plead guilty to aggravated murder without securing, in return, a guarantee that the state would not seek the death penalty. We reject without extended discussion all of petitioner\u2019s challenges to the denial of post-conviction relief except those which pertain to that issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the post-conviction court did not err in concluding that petitioner failed to establish that counsel were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>constitutionally inadequate with respect to the guilty plea. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">We begin with an overview of the facts and the protracted procedural history of the underlying criminal proceedings, as recounted by the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s final opinion on direct review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">\u201cOn September 3, 1988, the bodies of two women were found in a remote area near Coquille. Both women, who had been dead for two or three days, were nude from the waist down. They had been tied together at the wrists and shot in the head from close range with a shotgun. Police found a great deal of physical evidence at the scene, including tire tracks from a small automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cInvestigators eventually determined that the victims [who were identified as Kathrin Reith and Unna Tuxen] were from West Germany. A week after the bodies were discovered, two witnesses separately came forward to report that defendant [David Lynn Simonsen] had said that he and a man named Jeff Williams had been involved in shooting two women with a sawed-off shotgun. On September 11, 1988, police arrested defendant. After being advised of his rights, defendant gave two statements confessing that he and Williams had abducted, raped, and murdered the women. As a result of defendant\u2019s confessions, investigators eventually recovered significant evidence implicating defendant, including the suspect automobile and the murder weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">\u201cAfter being charged with two counts of aggravated murder, defendant pleaded guilty. The trial court conducted a penalty-phase proceeding. The jury answered the penalty-phase questions put to it in the affirmative, and the trial court sentenced defendant to death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">\u201cOn October 4, 1990, on automatic review, this court affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions, but vacated the sentence of death, because the jury was not presented with the \u2018fourth question\u2019 under ORS 163.150 (1989). <em>State v. Simonsen, </em>310 Or 412, 798 P2d 241 (1990) <em>(,Simonsen I).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">\u201cOn remand, defendant again was sentenced to death. However, on automatic review of that sentence, this court held that the state had obtained evidence against defendant in violation of his right against self-incrimination under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution. <em>State v. Simonsen, </em>319 Or 510, 514, 878 P2d 409 (1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>(Simonsen II). </em>Accordingly, this court again vacated the sentence and remanded the case for a third penalty-phase proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><em>State v. Simonsen, </em>329 Or 288, 290-91, 986 P2d 566 (1999), <em>cert den, </em>528 US 1090 (2000) <em>(Simonsen III) </em>(some internal citations omitted). On remand, a jury sentenced petitioner to death for a third time. That sentence was affirmed by the Oregon Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 290.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Having exhausted his direct appeals, petitioner initiated this action in 2000. The post-conviction court denied relief, carefully analyzing and rejecting each of petitioner\u2019s claims in a comprehensive (indeed exhaustive) letter opinion, followed by a formal judgment and 37 pages of factual findings and legal conclusions distilled from the original letter opinion. Petitioner appeals, alleging, in part, that he received inadequate assistance of counsel with respect to his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We now turn to those allegations pertaining to the guilty plea. Petitioner alleged that he received inadequate and ineffective assistance during the original criminal proceedings, because trial counsel Earl R. Woods and William D. Dials improperly</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">\u201ccounseled, advised, and persuaded Petitioner to plead guilty to two counts of Aggravated Murder thereby foregoing and waiving his right to a jury determination as to his guilt of the criminal offenses of Aggravated Murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Petitioner\u2019s opening and supplemental trial memoranda amplified that allegation, alleging that it was <em>per se </em>ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cto permit [petitioner] to plead guilty to two counts of Aggravated Murder without the District Attorney taking the penalty of death off the table.\u201d Petitioner also argued that that advice was constitutionally deficient given the timing of the plea agreement and trial counsel\u2019s alleged failure to conduct a forensic investigation, to further explore petitioner\u2019s competency, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>litigate the admissibility of the inculpatory statements. In addition, petitioner alleged that counsel failed to explain the consequences of pleading guilty to him and either omitted or misrepresented the content of the plea agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">\u201cPetitioner * * * was under the impression that upon a plea to the two counts of murder, the attendant circumstances of the crime, including the gruesome details and the claimed rapes of the two victims, would not be presented to the jury when it considered his sentence. Woods and Dials\u2019 failure to advise the Petitioner of the implications and ramifications of his pleas of guilty to the two charges of Aggravated Murder renders their legal representation Constitutionally inadequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">As pertinent to our review, the post-conviction court rendered the following findings concerning those allegations:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\u201c1. Petitioner\u2019s testimony in this proceeding, offered through his deposition, was not credible. Except as specifically noted, this court does not accept his testimony to be true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201c2. The testimony of petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was credible. This court accepts as true the [deposition] testimony of Earl Woods * * *. This court also accepts as true the testimony of William Dials * * * insofar as it corroborates the testimony of Earl Woods. This court does not find persuasive any legal conclusions or intimations by Dials that either he or Woods provided petitioner with constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">\u201c22. Both Woods and Dials met with petitioner \u2018quite often\u2019 and \u2018on a regular basis\u2019 and reviewed all of the police reports concerning the homicides with petitioner. Woods felt that he got to know petitioner \u2018fairly well.\u2019 Although Woods felt petitioner was a \u2018fairly quiet guy,\u2019 he also felt petitioner was \u2018actually fairly bright, fairly articulate.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">\u201c23. Petitioner informed Woods that the statements he made to the police after his arrest were accurate and voluntarily given. Petitioner denied being under the influence of any controlled substances when he spoke to the police. Woods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>found petitioner to be candid and forthright regarding his involvement. Petitioner also never wavered from his position that he shot and killed the victims at Williams\u2019 request. Woods once suggested to petitioner that Williams may have been the shooter after all, but petitioner denied it, reaffirming that he had been the one to shoot the victims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">\u201c24. Petitioner failed to provide <em>Simonsen I </em>trial counsel with any reason to doubt the accuracy of his own statements or the investigation conducted by the state. Trial counsel reviewed the entire discovery with petitioner, who confirmed it was accurate. Petitioner provided consistently accurate information to the police about the murders that matched the evidence left at the crime scene. Petitioner confessed in three separate police interviews that he shot the victims at Williams\u2019 request. Petitioner also continued to represent himself as the shooter to friends and family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u00ab\u2021 \u2021 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\u201c30. Woods and Dials were aware that the prosecution would not agree to any other potential resolution other than asking the jury to determine whether to impose the death sentence. During <em>Simonsen I, </em>the only two sentencing options for aggravated murder were the death sentence or a life sentence with the opportunity for parole after 30 years. The prosecution was not open to resolving petitioner\u2019s case with a sentence that provided him with an opportunity for parole. At the same time, petitioner was not interested in agreeing to a sentence that did not provide an opportunity for parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">\u201c31. Woods and Dials spoke to petitioner [about] how best to present his case to the jury for the best possible outcome. They reached the conclusion that their efforts would best be spent focusing on petitioner\u2019s penalty phase, as they had no reason to believe they had a legal or factual basis to contest petitioner\u2019s guilt. Woods felt petitioner would have a <em>better </em>chance of avoiding the death penalty if petitioner pleaded guilty and accepted legal responsibility for the murders. Petitioner was agreeable to pleading guilty and having Woods and Dials focus their efforts on the penalty phase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">\u201c32. <em>Simonsen I </em>trial counsel negotiated a number of plea conditions that, in their opinion, increased the possibility that the jury would not impose the death sentence.' * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\u201c33. Consistent with the agreed-upon trial strategy and negotiated plea deal, petitioner pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated murder. Prior to pleading guilty, petitioner executed a lengthy plea petition that addressed the waiver of legal rights and possible resulting consequences accompanying a guilty plea. Prior to pleading guilty, the trial court also engaged petitioner in a lengthy plea colloquy with petitioner to confirm that he understood his waiver of rights and potential consequences contained in the plea petition. Petitioner agreed that he understood the contents of his plea petition. Petitioner also confirmed that he was satisfied with <em>Simonsen I </em>trial counsel\u2019s advice and representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">(Internal citations and footnotes omitted; emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Based on those and other findings, the post-conviction court determined that trial counsel had developed a reasonable trial strategy, noting that petitioner\u2019s allegation \u201ccan be read two ways: either trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective <em>as a matter of law </em>when they advised petitioner to plead guilty to crimes that still left him eligible for a death sentence, or that trial counsel were unreasonable under the particular facts of petitioner\u2019s case in advising petitioner to plead guilty.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Under either approach, the court explained, \u201cpetitioner has failed to prove this allegation to be true.\u201d More specifically, the post-conviction court reached the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">\u201c78. With respect to resolution of petitioner\u2019s guilt, <em>Simonsen I </em>trial counsel cannot be regarded as constitutionally ineffective <em>as a matter of law </em>because they advised petitioner to plead guilty to crimes that still left him eligible for the death sentence. Numerous jurisdictions, including the Supreme Court of the United States, have recognized that trial counsel can reasonably conclude that the best chance of avoiding the death penalty for a capital client is to acknowledge guilt and focus on reasons why the jury should not impose the death penalty during the mitigation/penalty phase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\u201c79. <em>Simonsen I </em>counsel reasonably concluded that litigating petitioner\u2019s guilt would only serve to emphasize the brutality of the murders to the jury, which trial counsel wanted to <em>avoid </em>doing. By negotiating petitioner\u2019s guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>pleas, trial counsel negotiated a number of conditions that, in their opinion, increased the possibility that the jury would not impose the death sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\">\u201c80. In light of petitioner\u2019s agreement to plead guilty, <em>Simonsen I </em>counsel also reasonably concluded to withdraw the motion to suppress [a recorded confession] in exchange for the state\u2019s agreement to withdraw their motion for a jury view of the crime scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">\u201c81. Additionally, as a result of petitioner\u2019s guilty pleas, trial counsel were able to argue to the jury that they should not impose the death sentence because petitioner had taken responsibility for the murders. Given trial counsel\u2019s reasonable determination that they had no basis to suppress petitioner\u2019s detailed confessions and that chances for acquittal with respect to aggravated murder were slim, they reasonably advised petitioner to plead guilty to two counts of aggravated murder in the hopes to help petitioner escape a death sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">(Internal citations omitted; emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">On appeal, petitioner challenges the post-conviction court\u2019s rejection of his claim that he received inadequate assistance in connection with the advice to plead guilty without a death penalty waiver. That challenge implicates three separate, but related, theories of purported inadequacy. <em>First, </em>advice to plead guilty to a capital crime without the prosecution agreeing to waive the death penalty constitutes inadequate assistance of counsel as a matter of law (the \u201ccategorical\u201d theory). <em>Second, </em>under the circumstances here, trial counsel\u2019s plea strategy rendered their performance constitutionally inadequate (the \u201cas-applied\u201d theory). <em>Third, </em>in all events, trial counsel failed to adequately inform petitioner of the details of the plea deal and the consequences of pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">In reviewing the post-conviction court\u2019s resolution of those matters, we are bound by its factual findings that are supported by evidence in the record. <em>Stroup v. Hill, </em>196 Or App 565, 568, 103 P3d 1157 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 432 (2005). To obtain post-conviction relief on a state constitutional claim of inadequate assistance of counsel, petitioner must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts demonstrating that trial counsel failed to exercise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>professional skill and judgment necessary to \u201cdiligently and conscientiously advance the defense\u201d and that he was prejudiced as a result of that failure. <em>Krummacher v. Gierloff, </em>290 Or 867, 874, 883, 627 P2d 458 (1981). To be entitled to relief under the federal constitution, petitioner must show that trial counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness * * * under prevailing professional norms\u201d and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 US 668, 688, 694, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We begin with the first, categorical proposition: Does advising a defendant to plead guilty to aggravated murder without securing a guarantee that the state will not seek the death penalty necessarily violate the constitutional standard of competent representation? Petitioner contends \u201cthat it was <em>per se </em>ineffective assistance of counsel to permit [him] to plead guilty to two counts of aggravated murder while the possibility of a death sentence remained,\u201d an approach considered \u201cill-advised\u201d by \u201cexperienced capital practitioners.\u201d The state remonstrates that petitioner\u2019s categorical challenge is unavailing as a matter of law \u2014 and invokes authority from other jurisdictions that have recognized that, depending on the particular circumstances of a case, trial counsel can provide adequate representation despite advising a client to plead guilty without a plea bargain waiving the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">As explained below, we conclude that advising a capital client to plead guilty notwithstanding the possibility that the penalty phase may result in a death sentence does not render legal representation categorically inadequate. Although no Oregon appellate court has confronted this issue, other jurisdictions are in agreement, and no legal authority that we are aware of suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Under federal law, <em>Strickland </em>establishes the contours of a defendant\u2019s right, under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, to effective counsel in the trial setting, including the plea-bargaining process. <em>See Lafler v. </em>Cooper, ___ US ___, 132 S Ct 1376, 1384, 182 L Ed 2d 398 (2012). In general, under <em>Strickland </em>\u2014 and subject only to narrow exceptions for cases partaking of structural error,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or something akin to structural error<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 the propriety of post-conviction relief is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. As nearly as we can determine, no jurisdiction has held that advising a client to plead guilty notwithstanding the possibility of a death sentence is categorically unreasonable <em>under^Strickland. </em>Rather, the consensus of authority is that the reasonableness of such advice and representation is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>Florida v. Nixon, </em>543 US 175, 125 S Ct 551, 160 L Ed 2d 565 (2004), albeit arising in a different procedural posture, corroborates such an approach. In that case, the petitioner, who had been sentenced to death, sought and obtained post-conviction relief from the Florida Supreme Court on the ground that trial counsel had conceded his guilt without his express consent. The United State Supreme Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">In the predicate criminal case in <em>Nixon, </em>there was overwhelming evidence \u2014 including a detailed confession\u2014 that the petitioner had kidnapped and brutally murdered a woman who gave him a ride after his car broke down, and prosecutors were unwilling to recommend a sentence other than death. Rather than contest the state\u2019s case, trial counsel decided to concede the petitioner\u2019s guilt in order to preserve credibility with the jury for the penalty phase. <em>Id. </em>at 179-81. Although trial counsel explained that decision to the petitioner several times, the petitioner neither verbally approved nor protested that decision. On post-conviction review, the Florida Supreme Court set aside the plea due to the lack of express consent to the concession strategy, reasoning that a concession of guilt requires the same level of consent as a formal guilty plea and that such an error is presumed to be prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that the petitioner\u2019s challenge was properly evaluated under <em>Strickland </em>and that an alleged failure by counsel to obtain a client\u2019s express consent to a strategy to concede guilt at the guilt phase of a capital trial does not automatically render that performance deficient. <em>Id. </em>at 189-93. In so holding, the Court discussed at length the strategic reasons for admitting guilt to a capital crime when the prosecution will not accept any plea bargain that removes the death penalty from the picture:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">\u201c [T]he gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding\u2019s two-phase structure vitally affect counsel\u2019s strategic calculus. Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant\u2019s guilt is often clear. Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous. <em>In such cases, avoiding execution may be the best and only realistic result possible\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 190-91 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Noting that a strategy challenging the prosecution\u2019s case in the guilt phase can have dire implications for the sentencing phase, the Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">\u201cCounsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trial\u2019s penalty phase, at which time counsel\u2019s mission is to persuade the trier that his client\u2019s life should be spared. Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course. In this light, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a \u2018useless charade.\u2019 Renowned advocate Clarence Darrow, we note, famously employed a similar strategy as counsel for the youthful, cold-blooded killers Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 191-92 (internal citations omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 US 648, 656 n 19, 104 S Ct 2039, 80 L Ed 2d 657 (1984)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Thus, depending on the totality of circumstances, acknowledging guilt <em>can </em>be a tenable capital defense strategy, especially where \u201cthe evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.\u201d <em>Nixon, </em>543 US at 191. In such circumstances, advising a capital client to plead guilty where the state has not waived the death penalty may be a \u201ctactically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>advantageous\u201d choice that falls within <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 187.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">It is also true, however, that, as the <em>Nixon </em>court noted, \u201cpleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant\u201d because it \u201crelinquishes trial rights\u201d and \u201cincreases the likelihood\u201d that aggressive evidence of guilt will be introduced during the sentencing phase, \u201cso that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors\u2019 minds as they deliberate on the sentence.\u201d 543 US at 191 n 6. Those considerations inform and circumscribe, rather than categorically proscribe, the propriety of an unconditional plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\u00d3ur conclusion that the plea strategy in this case is not <em>per se </em>unreasonable is also informed by the American Bar Association (ABA) standards, which the United States Supreme Court recognizes \u201care guides to determining what is reasonable, but they are <em>only </em>guides.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 US at 688 (emphasis added). The contemporaneous ABA Guidelines at the time of petitioner\u2019s plea provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201cIn non-capital cases, the decision to enter a plea of guilty rests solely with the client. When the decision to plead guilty is likely to result in the client\u2019s death, however, counsel\u2019s position is unique. If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the client\u2019s trial rights. In California at least, a defendant cannot plead guilty over the objection of the attorney, giving counsel a tremendous responsibility for the client\u2019s life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">\u201cIn other words, counsel must strive to convince a client to overcome natural emotional resistance to the idea of standing in open court and admitting guilt of what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>charged as a capital offense if that will save the client\u2019s life. Conversely, counsel must strive to prevent a (perhaps depressed or suicidal) client from pleading guilty where there is a likelihood that such a plea will result in a death sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">ABA, <em>Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, </em>commentary to 11.6.3 (1989).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The gravamen of that guideline was, again, that, although an unconditional plea is exceptional in capital cases \u2014 that is, a tactic that counsel should be \u201cextremely reluctant\u201d to advise and participate in \u2014 there can be circumstances in which it is reasonable as being in the client\u2019s best interests. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Having rejected petitioner\u2019s \u201ccategorical\u201d theory, we proceed to the \u201cas applied\u201d approach: In the circumstances of this case, was it beyond the range of reasonable tactical choices to advise petitioner to plead guilty without the state\u2019s agreement not to seek the death penalty? Petitioner argues that trial counsel\u2019s strategy was ill-advised, that the process was rushed, and that he received no meaningful benefit in exchange for pleading guilty. The state counters that trial counsel provided reasonable justification for their advice and that the post-conviction court\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>We conclude that the post-conviction court did not err in rejecting petitioner\u2019s \u201cas applied\u201d challenge. The post-conviction court\u2019s extensive factual findings \u2014 which petitioner does not contest \u2014 are well-supported by the record, and its conclusions are well-reasoned and legally sound.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s appellate argument rests primarily upon selective excerpts of deposition testimony and, as we will explain, the inferences that he urges from that testimony are inconsistent with the record, as well as the post-conviction court\u2019s factual findings \u2014 particularly its credibility findings. Before addressing petitioner\u2019s specific arguments, however, we summarize the salient circumstances, as found by the post-conviction court, which underlay trial counsel\u2019s advice that petitioner plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><em>First, </em>trial counsel, Woods and Dials, knew that the case against petitioner was overwhelming. Before he was arrested, petitioner not only confessed his guilt to friends on two separate occasions but also, once in custody, he gave police a detailed statement confessing to the murders. In his statement to the police, petitioner acknowledged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">\u201c[h]e and [his codefendant] Williams had recently been in California on a drug-related trip, during which Williams drove his pickup truck. They returned to Oregon on August 31. On their way back, but still in California, they picked up two young, foreign women hitchhiking their way north. While the women rode in the back of the pickup truck, Williams spoke with petitioner about robbing, raping, and shooting them. Williams stated that after robbing and raping them, shooting the victims would \u2018be easy.\u2019 Once in Oregon, Williams headed inland and began looking for an isolated place to rob and rape the women. Williams drove up a dirt road, ultimately finding a remote place near some power lines. Williams raped the smaller of the two women, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>later identified as Reith, while petitioner \u2018had fun\u2019 with the larger woman, identified as Tuxen. Williams bound the victims together with a rope. Williams then handed petitioner a sawed-off shotgun, which petitioner used to shoot both victims in the face. The victims were looking him in the eye when he shot them. He shot the \u2018little\u2019 victim first in the head, then shot the other, larger victim. On his way back to Williams\u2019 truck, petitioner found a package of English muffins and threw them off the side of the road into some brush. He and Williams then departed with the victims\u2019 possessions still in Williams\u2019 truck bed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">That confession was corroborated by the medical examiner\u2019s report, details from the crime scene, and evidence recovered from Williams\u2019s truck \u2014 and, based on petitioner\u2019s statements, the police were able to locate the murder weapon. In addition, petitioner made inculpatory statements to his attorneys, his girlfriend, and others. At no time during the original proceedings did petitioner ever give his attorneys any reason to doubt his confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Given that overwhelming and irrefutable evidence that petitioner had murdered two victims after sadistically raping one of the women, and lacking a viable defense, counsel concluded that the chances of an acquittal were extremely low and that their efforts were better focused on avoiding the death penalty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As Woods testified: \u201cThis was not a whodunit * * * every bit of evidence that I remember was consistent with [petitioner\u2019s confessions]. *** [0]ur strategy shifted fairly early on to \u2018We\u2019ve got to save this guy from the death penalty.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\"><em>Second, </em>there was no prospect of the state agreeing not to seek the death penalty. In 1988, there was no \u201ctrue life\u201d sentencing option; rather, at the time, the only possible sentences for aggravated murder were life imprisonment <em>with a possibility of parole </em>or a death sentence. Woods \u2014 a former Coos County district attorney who was very familiar with the prosecutors, the trial judge, and the tendencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>of Coos County juries \u2014 knew that the state would seek the death penalty and would not bargain for a life sentence. Those circumstances led him to decide that \u201clitigating petitioner\u2019s guilt would only serve to emphasize the brutality of the murders to the jury\u201d and that pleading guilty was the best way to demonstrate remorse to the jury and attempt to shift the focus from the details of the crime to petitioner\u2019s story.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><em>Third, </em>consistently with those goals, the plea agreement included a number of concessions, which trial counsel believed \u201cincreased the possibility that the jury would not impose the death sentence.\u201d The prosecution dismissed all charges except the two counts of aggravated murder, withdrew the state\u2019s motion for a jury view of the crime scene, and stipulated that petitioner gave a detailed, truthful confession to the police and that the murders \u201cmay well have remained unsolved\u201d if not for petitioner\u2019s cooperation. The parties also agreed to allow two officers to give hearsay testimony in place of the live testimony of numerous witnesses, including two witnesses who saw petitioner with the victims just before the murders, a forensic expert, the victims\u2019 family members, and eight burglary victims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Petitioner\u2019s arguments challenging the reasonableness of the plea advice are based largely upon certain of Dials\u2019s statements during the post-conviction proceedings. However, the post-conviction court specifically discredited Dials\u2019s statements to the extent that they conflicted with Woods\u2019s testimony. For example, although petitioner highlights Dials\u2019s testimony that Dials disagreed with the decision to plead guilty and skipped the plea hearing \u201cin protest\u201d as evidence that the advice was unreasonable, that assertion is inconsistent not only with Woods\u2019s testimony, but also with Dials\u2019s own testimony. Woods testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>was not aware of any disagreement over the plea agreement. When asked whether he agreed with Woods\u2019s assessment that the plea deal was a good idea, Dials responded that, although he had concerns with the strategy, he did not disagree with Woods \u2014 and, in fact, repeatedly defended the decision to plead petitioner guilty as the only way to make the jury realize that defendant had taken responsibility and deserved to be spared from death.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Petitioner also invokes Woods\u2019s statement, from a 2009 affidavit, that he \u201cthought [at the time of the plea] that entering the plea would persuade * * * [the state] into offering life imprisonment.\u201d Based on that statement, petitioner posits that \u201c[fjorgoing a guilt phase trial on the vague hope that the state would drop the death penalty is not the actions of adequate or effective counsel.\u201d Whatever the validity, or accuracy, of Woods\u2019s recollection, 20 years after the operative events, it does not alter the contemporaneous circumstances, as found by the post-conviction court, that objectively justified counsel\u2019s advice, including the \u201cenormous amount of evidence\u201d of petitioner\u2019s guilt, the fact that the state was going to pursue the death penalty in all events, and the inclusion in the plea agreement of several concessions that the post-conviction court found \u201cincreased the possibility that the jury would not impose the death sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In sum, given the horrific nature of the murders, the damning evidence of petitioner\u2019s guilt, the prosecution\u2019s refusal to bargain over the death penalty, and the inclusion of certain, potentially useful, concessions in the plea agreement, trial counsel\u2019s advice to plead guilty without a death penalty waiver did not amount to constitutionally inadequate assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Finally, we briefly address petitioner\u2019s third challenge\u2014 <em>viz., </em>that trial counsel provided inadequate assistance by failing to inform him of the details of the plea agreement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the possible consequences of pleading guilty. <em>See Purdy v. U.S., </em>208 F3d 41, 44-45 (2d Cir 2000) (counsel should inform the defendant of the terms of the plea offer, the strengths and weakness of the case against him, and the alternative sentences to which he will most likely be exposed); <em>Gonzalez v. State of Oregon, </em>340 Or 452, 457-58, 134 P3d 955 (2006) (counsel must inform client of the risks and consequences of a criminal plea, including the maximum and minimum possible sentences). That contention fails because it is premised entirely upon petitioner\u2019s own testimony during the post-conviction proceedings \u2014 testimony that the post-conviction court found to be wholly incredible.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The post-conviction court properly denied post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-5\"> Consideration of the substance of petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error (pertaining to alleged <em>ex post facto </em>and other violations flowing from the imposition of a sentence of death based on a statutory scheme enacted after commission of the crime) is procedurally barred under <em>Palmer v. State of Oregon, </em>318 Or 352, 362, 867 P2d 1368 (1994), both because petitioner failed to plead facts necessary to establish a basis for obtaining post-conviction relief and because that claim was previously raised, and rejected, on direct review. <em>See State v. Simonsen, </em>329 Or 288, 301-02, 986 P2d 566 (1999), <em>cert den, </em>528 US 1090 (2000) <em>(Simonsen III); </em>ORS 138.550(2). In all events, even if it were reviewable, that claim would fail on its merits. <em>See State v. Rogers, </em>352 Or 510, 512 n 2, 288 P3d 544 (2012); <em>State v. Wagner, </em>309 Or 5, 786 P2d 93 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We reject on the merits, without further discussion, petitioner\u2019s battery of other allegations pertaining to the performance of trial counsel in both the original criminal proceedings and penalty phase <em>(State v. Simonsen, </em>310 Or 412, 798 P2d 241 (1990) <em>(Simonsen I)) </em>and the third penalty phase retrial <em>(Simonsen III), </em>including: assignments of error 2.A (claim that trial counsel failed to investigate the crime scene); 2.B (claim that trial counsel failed to properly assess and litigate petitioner\u2019s cognitive ability, including the effects of long-term methamphetamine abuse, with respect to petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial, and with respect to petitioner\u2019s ability to assess and understand the plea offer); 3.A (claim that trial counsel failed to pursue and allow sufficient time for forensic investigation); 3.B (claim that trial counsel failed to investigate and litigate influence of codefendant over petitioner); 3.C (claim that trial counsel failed to appropriately litigate petitioner\u2019s competency); and 2.D and 3.D (claims that cumulative effect of errors by trial counsel in <em>Simonsen I </em>and <em>III </em>rendered those proceedings fundamentally unfair).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">As for petitioner\u2019s five other state and federal constitutional claims (alleging violation of right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, due process violations, and purported unconstitutionality of Oregon\u2019s death penalty scheme, including alleged violation of separate vote requirement), those claims fail on multiple grounds: Not only are they insufficiently developed as well as procedurally barred \u2014 under ORS 138.550(2) and <em>Palmer, </em>318 Or at 362 \u2014 but, even if somehow cognizable, they lack substantive merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\"> Aggravated murder trials are typically divided into separate guilt and penalty phases. When a defendant pleads guilty, as petitioner did here, a jury is impaneled and sworn for a penalty-phase proceeding only. <em>State v.

Within hours of their arrests, each confessed to kidnapping, albeit accusing the other of actually perpetrating the murder. Knowing that they would inevitably be condemned to death by a jury, Darrow surprised the prosecution when his clients pleaded guilty on the morning of the trial, shifting the sentencing decision to the judge alone. Darrow, a lifelong opponent of capital punishment, elicited psychiatric expert testimony to argue that Leopold and Loeb were so mentally abnormal that they could not be blamed for the murder. Ultimately, the court imposed life sentences for murder on each defendant. Loeb was killed by a fellow inmate in 1936, and Leopold was released on parole in 1958.

In that context, the Court in <em>Nixon </em>concluded that a concession of guilt is not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea and refused to extend that strict requirement to an attorney\u2019s concession of his client\u2019s guilt during the guilt phase of a capital trial. <em>Id. </em>at 188.

Dials confirmed in his testimony that Woods made court appearances and visited with the client more frequently \u2014 and acknowledged that, on the day of the plea hearing, he had a scheduling conflict that required him to be in Bend, and that he had decided to skip the plea hearing rather than cancel his other engagement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\"> Given that petitioner, as the proponent of post-conviction relief, had the burden of proof and persuasion, the post-conviction court\u2019s rejection of his testimony is, by itself, dispositive.
