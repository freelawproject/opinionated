Following a consolidated jury trial, defendant was found guilty on all charges related to A and not guilty on the single charge related to K. Defendant appeals the resulting judgment of conviction for two counts each of sodomy in the first degree, ORS 163.405, and sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427. First, he argues that the trial court erred by admitting A\u2019s hearsay statements under OEC 803 (18a) (b) because the state failed to satisfy the notice requirements of that statute; we reject that assignment of error without discussion. Second, he assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure to strike, <em>sua sponte, </em>certain testimony by one of the state\u2019s witnesses. The state elicited the testimony without defendant\u2019s objection, but, according to defendant, it amounted to an impermissible comment on A\u2019s credibility. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that defendant has not established that the trial court committed plain error. We thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We state the facts necessary to provide context for the testimony at issue on appeal. K told her mother that defendant \u201ctickles me down there [,]\u201d pointing to her vagina. K\u2019s mother took her to Liberty House, a child abuse assessment center, where she was interviewed. No charges were filed against defendant at that time. Subsequently, A told her mother that defendant made her put his penis in her mouth and touch his genitals. A\u2019s mother filed a report with the police, who referred A to Liberty House. There, A repeated the abuse allegations to a Liberty House interviewer, Mills. A\u2019s physical exam did not reveal physical signs of abuse. A police investigation ensued. The detective assigned to the case did not interview A because \u201c[t]he interview had already been conducted by Liberty House [.]\u201d Defendant was ultimately arrested and charged with various counts of sexual abuse and sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">At trial, the victims and Mills testified on behalf of the state. On appeal, defendant challenges for the first time the trial court\u2019s failure to strike a portion of Mills\u2019s testimony. In evaluating whether the trial court plainly erred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cwe must consider the entire context\u201d in which the challenged comments were given. <em>State v. Corkill, </em>262 Or App 543, 544, 325 P3d 796, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 751 (2014). We thus describe the trial proceedings involving Mills\u2019s testimony in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Mills, a \u201cnationally certified counselor,\u201d stated that at Liberty House his \u201cspecialty or * * * expertise\u201d was interviewing complainants. Mills estimated that he had interviewed \u201ca couple hundred\u201d children aged five or six years old. On direct examination, the prosecutor asked Mills to describe the specificity of A\u2019s disclosure of abuse during his interview of her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] Was this a descriptive disclosure, not so descriptive disclosure? How would you describe it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201cA. I would \u2014 the\u2014I\u2019m in court and I\u2019m being honest. The word that comes to my mind is this is a solid description from a child this age. I would say that her development seemed solid enough. And I have talked with kids of this age who have given less description than she did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">On cross-examination, defendant questioned Mills, in part, concerning false accusations by children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Okay. Now, you had testified that you have interviewed hundreds of children. And have you, through your experience of these interviews of hundreds of children, encountered incidences where the children had made false accusations against the person of interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">\u201cA. Because I\u2019m in court and I just want to be clear, I have probably interviewed a total of 3(00) to 400 kids. Of that I can\u2019t give you a definite number of, you know, how many are five or six. But I would say at least 100 to probably 200 just so I\u2019m clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">\u201cIn terms of kids making a false or \u2014 by false accusation; at Liberty House we don\u2019t make judgments or determinations about statements. Whether in the end whoever that\u2014 whoever the end group is or person is outside of Liberty House that makes the determination if it\u2019s true or not; we don\u2019t do that. We simply gather whatever information we can, and then report back, like put it in the report and do these sorts of things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u201cQ. And if you feel that misconduct has occurred, is this something that you would then refer to the District Attorney\u2019s Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>We send our reports back to the referring agencies. And I think technically those agencies then refer on to the DA\u2019s office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Defendant also attempted to question Mills about whether a child\u2019s statement that he or she wanted to return to the alleged abuser is a factor in determining whether abuse has occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] What about a child, in your experience, have you had a child that says that they actually want to return to the people or the place where the alleged incidences occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. And is that a factor in your analysis of determining whether or not abuse did or did not occur?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">However, the prosecutor objected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] Your Honor, I don\u2019t think that he can talk about his analysis of whether or not something did or did not occur. I don\u2019t think a witness can talk about whether or not they think something did or did not occur under <em>[State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009)]. And that would probably open some doors to evidence defense counsel doesn\u2019t want me to put in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Defendant then abandoned that line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">On redirect, Mills gave the testimony that defendant argues impermissibly commented on A\u2019s credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] And as far as false accusations, based on your training and experience, statistically what is the average of false accusations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-14\">\u201cA. The exact numbers, from my experience, are unclear. Excuse me. What is clear is that children rarely lie about these things. And over \u2014 I believe it\u2019s over 95 percent of the time when child \u2014 when a child discloses information about being sexually abused, it\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">\u201cQ. Over 95 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>\u201cA. I believe the statistic at Liberty House is 96 to 98 percent of the time when a child makes a disclosure about abuse, there\u2019s truth to it. Some of those details that we talked about, maybe numbers of times or exactly where this happened when might be a little bit confusing for a child of [A\u2019s] age. But\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">\u201cQ. The generality of abuse is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cA. Generality, correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In the state\u2019s rebuttal to defendant\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor called the jury\u2019s attention to the disputed testimony. In particular, the prosecutor argued that, \u201cstatistically,\u201d there was a 95 percent chance that the victims were telling the truth. As noted above, the jury found defendant guilty on all counts related to A and not guilty on the single count related to K.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">On appeal, defendant argues that Mills impermissibly vouched for A\u2019s credibility when he testified that \u201cthe statistic at Liberty House is 96 to 98 percent of the time when a child makes a disclosure about abuse, there\u2019s truth to it.\u201d According to defendant, the trial court\u2019s failure to strike that testimony was \u201can error of law apparent on the <em>record\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., plain error \u2014 that we should exercise our discretion to correct. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d). The state counters that there is a \u201creasonable dispute about whether Mills vouched for A\u2019s credibility\u201d given his testimony that \u201cat Liberty House we don\u2019t make judgments or determinations about statements. Whether * * * it\u2019s true or not; we don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">An error is plain if it is a legal error that is obvious <em>(i.e., </em>not reasonably in dispute) and the court need not go outside the record or select among competing inferences to discern it. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). Only if we conclude that an asserted error is plain do we determine whether to exercise our discretion to address the error. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991). In this case, we agree with the state that the asserted error was not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Our recent decision in <em>Corkill </em>is instructive. There, the prosecutor asked the defendant at various points in his testimony whether the police officer witnesses were lying; without objection, the defendant gave affirmative answers. <em>Corkill, </em>262 Or App at 548-49. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court plainly erred in allowing vouching testimony, despite the lack of any defense objection. <em>Id. </em>at 549. We concluded that the trial court did not have a duty \u201cto <em>sua sponte </em>preclude the prosecutor from asking whether prosecution witnesses were lying.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544. We held that the defendant\u2019s \u201cunpreserved argument present [ed] no basis for reversal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">We began our analysis in <em>Corkill </em>by noting that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">\u201cin most circumstances [,] it is beyond dispute that such questioning is objectionable, and that any responsive testimony commenting on the credibility of another witness would be inadmissible if it were objected to. That does not necessarily mean, however, that it is beyond dispute that a trial court must always intervene <em>sua sponte </em>to prevent that kind of evidence from reaching the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 552. In other words, we explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201c[w]hen, as here, the claimed \u2018plain error\u2019 is associated with a trial court not having <em>sua sponte </em>interrupted a line of questioning (or not having excluded the resulting evidence <em>sua sponte), </em>the existence of any error does not depend solely on whether \u2014 as an abstract matter \u2014 the lawyer\u2019s questions or the elicited answers would have been inadmissible if they had been objected to. Rather, any \u2018plain error\u2019 must relate to the trial court having not taken affirmative steps to intervene in the parties\u2019 litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 551. We then offered the following summary of relevant precedent that is equally pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">\u201c[T]he cases in which we have held that trial courts are obligated to exclude evidence in the absence of an objection \u2014 and plainly err if they do not \u2014 all share an important characteristic that is not present here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">\u201cEach of the cases in which we have held that a trial court should have excluded evidence <em>sua sponte </em>*** has involved true \u2018vouching\u2019 evidence, that is, one witness\u2019s testimony that he or she believes that another witness is or is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>not credible, which a party offers to bolster or undermine the veracity of that other witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In this case, Mills\u2019s testimony did not run afoul of the prohibition on true vouching when he testified, \u201cI believe the statistic at Liberty House is 96 to 98 percent of the time when a child makes a disclosure about abuse, there\u2019s truth to it.\u201d Mills stopped short of stating that A was like the 96 to 98 percent of Liberty House complainants whose reports were truthful. <em>Cf. State v. Remme, </em>173 Or App 546, 558, 23 P3d 374 (2001) (stating that it is impermissible for a witness to \u201c\u2018connect the dots\u2019 explicitly by [giving] testimony relating [a general] phenomenon\u2019s specific application to a particular witness\u2019s testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Although \u201cstatements that fall short of such overt vouching also may be impermissible,\u201d <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 357, 234 P3d 117 (2010), it is not apparent that Mills even indirectly connected the statistic that he cited to A\u2019s report of abuse or its purported veracity. Instead, the testimony by Mills more closely resembles the kind of \u201cgeneral information *** indicating] that [a general class of witnesses] is or is not\u201d credible that we approved in <em>State v. Preuitt, </em>255 Or App 215, 221, 296 P3d 648, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 868 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In short, \u201cbecause the evidence in question here was not clearly vouching for [A\u2019s] credibility * * * but was more akin to permissible testimony,\u201d State v. <em>Wilson, </em>266 Or App 481, 495, 337 P3d 990 (2014), we agree with the state that there is a reasonable dispute as to whether Mills impermissibly vouched for A. Thus, the trial court did not plainly err by not <em>sua sponte </em>striking the disputed testimony at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
