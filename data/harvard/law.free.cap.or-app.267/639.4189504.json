J.</author>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">This case is on remand from the Oregon Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>Hall v. Speer, </em>244 Or App 392, 261 P3d 1259 (2011) <em>(Hall I), </em>and remanded for reconsideration in light of its decision in <em>Zimmerman v. Allstate Property and Casualty Ins., </em>354 Or 271, 311 P3d 497 (2013). <em>Hall v. Speer, </em>354 Or 699, 319 P3d 696 (2014) <em>(Hall II). </em>On remand, the dispositive issue is whether plaintiff \u2014 who prevailed in an action against her insurer, defendant Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate), for under-insured motorist (UIM) benefits \u2014 provided Allstate with a \u201cproof of loss\u201d more than six months before Allstate accepted coverage and consented to binding arbitration such that she is entitled to attorney fees under ORS 742.061. Although, in <em>Hall I, </em>we concluded that the trial court had erred in determining that plaintiff had not provided a timely proof of loss, the Supreme Court in <em>Zimmerman </em>clarified the principles governing that inquiry in the context of a UIM claim. For the reasons explained below, we now conclude that, under <em>Zimmerman, </em>the information that plaintiff provided to Allstate was insufficient to trigger an obligation to investigate a UIM claim. Thus, plaintiff failed to provide Allstate with timely proof of loss, and she was not entitled to attorney fees under ORS 742.061. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">With three amplifications noted below, we take the facts and a description of the procedural history of this case from <em>Hall I.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\u201cThe relevant facts are undisputed. Plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident on September 16, 2006. She carried Allstate insurance that provided liability, personal injury protection (PIP), and UIM coverage. Two days after the accident, she informed Allstate that the accident had occurred and that she had been injured. On January 28, 2009, more than two years after learning of plaintiff\u2019s accident and after a number of events described below, Allstate sent plaintiff a letter acknowledging that it had \u2018accepted coverage\u2019 of her UIM claim, that the remaining issues were \u2018liability and damages,\u2019 and that, if Allstate and plaintiff could not reach a settlement, Allstate was \u2018also willing to submit to binding arbitration.\u2019 Plaintiff declined arbitration and ultimately won a jury verdict that exceeded Allstate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>settlement offer. She then petitioned for attorney fees pursuant to ORS 742.061.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201cThe date of Allstate\u2019s letter acknowledging coverage and offering arbitration is important because ORS 742.061 provides, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201c\u2018(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, if settlement is not made within six months from the date proof of loss is filed with an insurer and an action is brought in any court of this state upon any policy of insurance of any kind or nature, and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery exceeds the amount of any tender made by the defendant in such action, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees shall be taxed as part of the costs of the action and any appeal thereon. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u00ab&lt;* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">\u201c\u2018(3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to actions to recover uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits if, in writing, not later than six months from the date proof of loss is filed with the insurer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">\u201c\u2018(a) The insurer has accepted coverage and the only issues are the liability of the uninsured or under-insured motorist and the damages due the insured; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">\u201c\u2018(b) The insurer has consented to submit the case to binding arbitration.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">\u201cIn this case, no settlement occurred, and plaintiff\u2019s recovery exceeded Allstate\u2019s tender. Thus, Allstate could avail itself of the \u2018safe harbor\u2019 afforded by ORS 742.061(3) and avoid paying reasonable attorney fees only if its January 28, 2009, letter accepting coverage and offering to arbitrate occurred within six months of plaintiff\u2019s proof of loss \u2014 that is, only if plaintiff\u2019s proof of loss occurred after July 28, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">\u201cBefore that date, the following relevant events occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-12\">\u201c\u2022 September 18, 2006: Plaintiff informed Allstate that she had been injured in an accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-13\">\u201c\u2022 September 27, 2006: Plaintiff filled in and submitted to Allstate an application for PIP benefits that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Allstate had sent her, in which she described the accident-as well as her injuries. Except for its caption, the application for PIP benefits is in all relevant respects identical to the application for UIM benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">\u201c\u2022 Fall 2006: Allstate\u2019s PIP adjuster opened a file on plaintiff\u2019s case and noted that the allegedly at-fault driver carried liability insurance. The PIP adjuster did not inform the UIM adjuster of plaintiff\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201c\u2022 February 5, 2007: At Allstate\u2019s request, plaintiff was examined by an orthopedic surgeon, who reported that the September 2006 accident had caused significant injuries. [That report indicated that an MRI of plaintiffs left shoulder showed \u2018a very small partial thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon along its articular surface.\u2019 The surgeon noted that \u2018[t]he typical necessary treatment *** is physical therapy *** directed toward her left shoulder joint\u2019 and that he \u2018believe [d] that she should be seen in therapy twice weekly for the next six to eight weeks.\u2019 The surgeon also indicated that plaintiff \u2018may require one or two other corticosteroid injections.\u2019]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201c\u2022 May 24, 2007: Plaintiffs counsel wrote letters informing Allstate\u2019s PIP adjuster and its general liability adjuster that he represented plaintiff.1 <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201cPlaintiff argued to the trial court that the application for PIP benefits, together with the surgeon\u2019s report and counsel\u2019s letters to Allstate\u2019s adjusters, constituted proof of loss. Allstate took the position that, in a UIM case, the insurer does not have proof of loss until it knows the underinsured motorist\u2019s liability limit and the nature of the policyholder\u2019s injuries, knowledge that, in this case, plaintiff did not provide until just two months before Allstate\u2019s January 2009 acknowledgement of coverage and offer to arbitrate.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> The court agreed with Allstate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">\u201c\u2018Until the insurer received a communication that the liability insurance carried by the driver at fault was less than the claimed damages suffered by the plaintiff, the insurer had not received information sufficient to estimate its own liability under the underinsured motorist coverage. The initial report of medical injuries did not reveal damages likely to exceed mandated liability coverage. Because the insurer of the driver at fault was not obligated to reveal its limits to Allstate, Allstate was not able to make [an] estimation of its obligations by reasonable investigation. Until the insurer did receive that information, it had not received a \u2018proof of loss\u2019 covered by the underinsurance motorist provisions of the policy. As soon as it did, it acted appropriately.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\"><em>Hall I, </em>244 Or App at 394-96 (sixth brackets and omissions in <em>Hall I). </em>Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Parks v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>347 Or 374, 227 P3d 1127 (2009), <em>Scott v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins., </em>345 Or 146, 190 P3d 372 (2008), and <em>Dockins v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>329 Or 20, 985 P2d 796 (1999), we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201cthe information that Allstate had by May 24, 2007\u2014 20 months before it acknowledged coverage and offered to arbitrate \u2014 triggered Allstate\u2019s duty to make a reasonable effort to investigate and clarify its <em>possible </em>UIM obligations, and that Allstate made no such efforts. That information included notice that plaintiff had been in an accident; that plaintiff had incurred serious injuries as a result; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>at-fault driver was insured; and that plaintiff carried UIM insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><em>Hall I, </em>244 Or App at 399 (emphasis in original). In doing so, we rejected Allstate\u2019s contention that \u201can insurer <em>cannot </em>have enough information to estimate its obligations in a UIM case until it knows that the at-fault driver\u2019s liability insurance is inadequate to cover the insured\u2019s compensable expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397 (emphasis in original). We also rejected Allstate\u2019s argument that, in light of insurance carriers\u2019 policies not to disclose their insureds\u2019 policy limits, any duty to investigate was vitiated because \u201cany attempt to investigate and clarify plaintiffs UIM claim would not have provided Allstate with the information that it needed in order to determine its obligation \u2014 in particular, the at-fault driver\u2019s liability limits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399. Allstate sought review.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Thereafter, the Supreme Court decided <em>Zimmerman, </em>in which the court clarified the principles for determining what constitutes a \u201cproof of loss\u201d in the context of a claim for UIM benefits. For that reason, we describe <em>Zimmerman </em>in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">There, the plaintiff, Zimmerman, was injured in an automobile accident in December 2006. Zimmerman gave a recorded statement to Allstate, explaining that her car had been totaled, she had been injured, and the other driver (Alvis) had admitted liability and been cited by the police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, Zimmerman submitted a PIP application and a medical authorization form to Allstate, and, \u201c[i]n the following months, Allstate corresponded with Zimmerman or her attorney concerning medical records on a number of occasions.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>354 Or at 274. In December 2007, Zimmerman\u2019s treating physician informed Allstate that Zimmerman continued to suffer from neck and back pain and that x-rays showed a \u201creversed cervical spine\u201d; however, no further bills for medical expenses were submitted to Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In July 2008, Zimmerman\u2019s attorney sent a demand letter to Alvis\u2019s insurance company. In September 2008, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>an adjuster from Alvis\u2019s company \u201ctelephoned an Allstate employee to advise that Zimmerman would likely pursue a UIM claim against Allstate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Allstate and Zimmerman\u2019s attorney exchanged forms and correspondence concerning a UIM claim. Eventually, Alvis\u2019s company tendered its policy limits to Zimmerman, and Allstate contested Zimmerman\u2019s claim for an additional $75,000 in UIM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Following a jury trial, the trial court entered a judgment against Allstate for breach of its policy, and Zimmerman sought attorney fees under ORS 742.061. The trial court awarded Zimmerman attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">On appeal, we affirmed. Specifically, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">\u201cIt is undisputed by Allstate that, in this case, [Zimmerman] provided Allstate with the facts of the accident and her injuries by December 2007, information sufficient to trigger a duty to investigate, more than six months before Allstate accepted coverage and consented to submit the claim to binding arbitration on September 26, 2008.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\"><em>Zimmerman v. Allstate Property and Casualty Ins., </em>246 Or App 680, 681, 267 P3d 203 (2011), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>354 Or 271, 311 P3d 497 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">. On review, the Supreme Court explained that \u201cproof of loss\u201d is a term of art in the insurance industry and that \u201cwhat is sufficient to constitute a proof of loss under a policy depends on the type of insurance at issue.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>354 Or at 280. According to the Supreme Court, its</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">\u201ccases arising under ORS 742.061 and its predecessors have taken a pragmatic and functional, as opposed to strict and formalistic, approach in defining the term \u2018proof of loss.\u2019 It refers to any \u2018event or submission\u2019 that accomplishes the purpose of a proof of loss, that is, \u2018to afford the insurer an adequate opportunity for investigation, to prevent fraud and imposition upon it, and to enable it to form an intelligent estimate of its rights and liabilities before it is obliged to pay.\u2019 <em>Dockins[, </em>329 Or at 28-29]. This court has emphasized that insurers \u2018operate under a duty of inquiry.\u2019 <em>Parks [, </em>347 Or at 381], If a submission, by itself, is ambiguous or insufficient to allow the insurer to estimate its obligations, it nevertheless will be deemed sufficient if it provides enough information to allow the insurer \u2018to investigate and clarify uncertain claims.\u2019 <em>Dockins, </em>329 Or at 29.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>Zimmerman, </em>354 Or at 281-82. Noting that its prior decisions in <em>Parks, Scott, </em>and <em>Dockins </em>did not address the sufficiency of a submission to constitute a proof of loss in the UIM context, the court turned to an examination of the nature of that type of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The court explained that Oregon\u2019s UIM statute has adopted what is referred to as a \u201ccomparison of limits\u201d or \u201climits-to-limits\u201d approach. <em>Zimmerman, </em>354 Or at 287-88. Under that approach, a driver is \u201cunderinsured if the driver\u2019s liability limits are less than the injured person\u2019s liability limits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287. The court stated that it was worth emphasizing that (1) in the UIM context, \u201cthe threshold determinant is the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits [,]\u201d in the absence of which \u201cit cannot be determined whether that driver is underinsured\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe comparison of the tortfeasor\u2019s and the insured\u2019s liability limits produces only an insurer\u2019s <em>potential </em>UIM liability\u201d because \u201c[t]he insurer\u2019s <em>actual </em>UIM liability depends on the amount of the injured insured driver\u2019s damages and any payments that have been received from the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">With that understanding, the court in <em>Zimmerman </em>turned to the particular circumstances of that case. In that regard, Zimmerman contended that \u201cthe information that she provided [in her December 2006 accident report], <em>coupled with information that her doctor provided over a year later, </em>was sufficient to trigger an investigation that conceivably could have revealed at least a potential UIM claim [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The court rejected that contention. Although the Supreme Court indicated that \u201cit is not necessary that [a proof of loss] enable the insurer to determine precisely its obligations\u201d and that \u201cit is likewise not always necessary for the information to include the tortfeasor\u2019s precise limits,\u201d the court noted that, as of December 2007, there was no evidence that Allstate was aware of or could have acquired Alvis\u2019s policy limits or that Zimmerman\u2019s damages exceeded Alvis\u2019s policy limits. <em>Id. </em>at 291. In sum, the court reasoned that, as of December 2007, no \u201cinformation that Zimmerman supplied Allstate!] <em>suggest[ed] </em>that she would be bringing a claim for damages in excess of [Alvis\u2019s] liability limits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290 (emphasis added). Instead, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>\u201cNot until the September 2008 call from [Alvis\u2019s insurer] did Allstate learn of the <em>possibility </em>of a UIM claim. Assuming for the sake of argument that that call, combined with the information that Zimmerman had earlier provided, constituted information \u2018sufficient to enable [Allstate] to estimate its obligations\u2019 or at least \u2018to do so after a reasonable investigation,\u2019 <em>Scott, </em>345 Or at 156, that leads to the conclusion that the proof of loss was filed in September 2008, well within six months of Allstate\u2019s filing of its safe harbor letter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 291 (second brackets in Zimmerman; emphasis added). Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Zimmerman </em>and remanded the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">As noted, after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Zimmerman, </em>it vacated our decision in <em>Hall I </em>and remanded the case for reconsideration. In light of <em>Zimmerman, </em>we now conclude, as explained below, that the circumstances on which plaintiff relies to constitute her proof of loss were insufficient to trigger an investigation by Allstate because those circumstances did not even suggest to Allstate the possibility of a UIM claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Here, plaintiff contends that her application for PIP benefits and medical release, coupled with the surgeon\u2019s report and her attorney\u2019s May 2007 letters to the Allstate adjusters, constituted proof of loss. As explained above, 267 Or App at 643 n 1, those letters indicate only that the attorney represented plaintiff, asked that future correspondence be directed to him, and sought plaintiffs statements, copies of her medical records, accident photographs, and an updated ledger of medical expenses that Allstate had paid. Those circumstances \u2014 which did not even suggest to Allstate the possibility of a UIM claim \u2014 are materially indistinguishable from those in <em>Zimmerman </em>and, for that reason, were insufficient to trigger Allstate\u2019s obligation to investigate such a claim. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in concluding that plaintiff did not file a proof of loss more than six months before Allstate accepted coverage and consented to binding arbitration and, hence, did not err in denying plaintiff attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">1 In May 2006 \u2014 four months before the September accident that is the subject of this case \u2014 plaintiff had been in another automobile accident. Plaintiffs attorney sent one of the May 2007 letters to Allstate\u2019s PIP adjuster. That letter referenced both accidents and stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">\u201cWe have been retained to represent [plaintiff] concerning the above-referenced auto accidents. Please direct all future communication concerning these incidents to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">\u201cPlease also provide me with an updated ledger of all of the medical expenses that Allstate has paid concerning these incidents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">\u201cPlease call or write with any questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney sent the second letter to the general liability adjuster. That letter also referenced both accidents and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-12\">\u201cWe have been retained to represent [plaintiff] concerning auto accidents that occurred on 5/15/06 and 9/16/06.
