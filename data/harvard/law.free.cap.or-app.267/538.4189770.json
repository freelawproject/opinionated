On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to specifically instruct the jury that, to be guilty, defendant had to engage in a \u201cvoluntary act.\u201d We conclude that defendant was not entitled to his requested instruction and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Salem Police Officer Smith responded to a call of a domestic disturbance in which the suspect, defendant, had left the scene on foot. Defendant had a warrant out for his arrest at the time. Smith reported to a location at a field near a school, where he saw a person matching defendant\u2019s description. Smith called out to defendant, told him he was under arrest, and instructed him to show his hands and get down on the ground. Defendant said, \u201cNo.\u201d When Smith told defendant that there was a warrant out for defendant\u2019s arrest, defendant said, \u201cI know.\u201d According to Smith, defendant\u2019s eyes were red and watery, and defendant had a \u201cthousand [-] yard stare.\u201d Defendant turned to squarely face Smith in what Smith described at trial as a \u201cfighting stance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Smith operates a K-9 police dog unit and had a dog in his vehicle at the time. Smith called for back-up and warned defendant that, if he did not comply, the dog would be released from the car, and defendant would be bitten. Defendant said, \u201cSo?\u201d Smith repeated the warning and instructions to defendant several times, but defendant did not comply. Using a remote device, Smith opened the door to his vehicle, releasing the dog, and gave the dog an instruction to bite defendant. The dog chased defendant and bit him, knocking him off balance. Smith then approached and made physical contact with defendant in an attempt to subdue him and take him into custody. As the two men made contact, they slid partway down a slope, coming to rest with their feet elevated above their heads, with Smith on top of defendant. The men continued to wrestle, and the dog continued to inflict bites on defendant. Defendant was grabbing at Smith\u2019s head, neck, and waist. At some point, defendant hit Smith in the jaw with his wrist or forearm. Smith\u2019s mouth was open at that moment because he was talking to defendant. The impact of the strike slammed Smith\u2019s jaw shut.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Back-up officers arrived at the scene, and eventually they were able to take defendant into custody. Smith felt pain in his jaw for approximately two hours after the encounter. Smith testified that, on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the most extreme pain, Smith rated his pain at that time a five. He did not seek treatment for the injury. Defendant was treated for several dog bites.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The state charged defendant with assaulting a public safety officer, ORS 163.208.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before trial, defendant requested that the court issue Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction 1065, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201cFor criminal liability, Oregon law requires the performance of a voluntary act or omission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201c(1) Act \u2014 a bodily movement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201c(2) Voluntary act \u2014 a bodily movement performed consciously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">\u201c(3) Omission \u2014 a failure to perform an act the performance of which is required by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">\u201c(4) Conduct \u2014 an act or omission and its accompanying mental state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">\u201c(5) To act \u2014 either to perform an act or to omit to perform an act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">\u201c(6) Culpable mental state \u2014 means intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Defendant argued to the trial court that the instruction \u2014 at least an instruction incorporating subsections (2), (4), and (6) \u2014 was necessary because defendant would argue to the jury that his physical actions in striking Smith were involuntary under the circumstances. The state objected that defendant\u2019s requested instruction was potentially confusing and unnecessary. The trial court agreed, noting that defendant\u2019s instruction \u201cintroduces additional terms\u201d that were unrelated to other instructions or to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>elements of the charged offense. Instead, the trial court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">\u201cIn this case to establish the crime of assaulting a public safety officer, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following five elements: That the act occurred in Marion County, Oregon; that the act occurred on or about May 12, 2012; that [defendant] knowingly caused physical injury to [Smith]; that [defendant] knew [Smith] to be a peace officer; and [Smith] was acting in the course of official duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201cA person acts knowingly or with knowledge if that person acts with an awareness that his or her conduct is of a particular nature, or that a particular circumstance exists. When used in the phrase \u2018knowingly caused physical injury to * * *,\u2019 knowingly or with knowledge means that the Defendant was aware of the assaultive nature of his conduct. The term \u2018physical injury\u2019 means an injury that impairs a person\u2019s physical condition, or causes substantial pain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Defendant was convicted. On appeal, defendant\u2019s sole assignment of error is to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his requested \u201cvoluntary act\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">We review a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction for errors of law. <em>State v. Moore, </em>324 Or 396, 428-29, 927 P2d 1073 (1996). A defendant is generally entitled to have a jury instruction given if there is evidence to support it and if the instruction accurately states the law. <em>State v. Thaxton, </em>190 Or App 351, 356, 79 P3d 897 (2003). Failure to give a requested instruction is not reversible error, however, if the instruction that the trial court gave, \u201calthough not in the form requested, adequately covers the subject of the requested instruction.\u201d <em>State v. Tucker, </em>315 Or 321, 332, 845 P2d 904 (1993). If we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions, as a whole, were erroneous, we must determine whether defendant was prejudiced. <em>State v. Williams, </em>313 Or 19, 38, 828 P2d 1006, <em>cert den, </em>506 US 858 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is straightforward. The jury, he contends, could have found that defendant was off-balance and distracted by the dog during the struggle with Smith and, therefore, that defendant\u2019s \u201cflailing\u201d of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>arms did not constitute a \u201cvoluntary act.\u201d Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction, which described the meaning of \u201cknowingly,\u201d was inadequate because the jury could have found that defendant \u201cknew\u201d that his arms were coming into contact with Smith but also that defendant\u2019s \u201cact\u201d of flailing his arms was not \u201cvoluntary.\u201d The state responds that the evidence at trial did not support defendant\u2019s requested instruction, and that, in any event, the instructions that the trial court gave adequately covered the subject matter of the instruction that defendant wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">We do not necessarily agree with the state\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s instruction adequately covered the subject matter, <em>if </em>the evidence at trial supported defendant\u2019s instruction. The state argues that, because the jury was instructed that it had to find that defendant acted \u201cknowingly\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>was \u201caware of the assaultive nature of his conduct\u201d), then the jury could not have concluded that an involuntary act could suffice. The state\u2019s argument appears to conflate the mental state requirement, <em>i.e., mens rea, </em>with the requirement that any criminal conduct be voluntary, <em>i.e., actus reus, </em>foreclosing the possibility that a rational jury could ever find that a person was \u201caware\u201d of engaging in certain conduct without <em>voluntarily </em>engaging in that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We need not further consider that question, however, because the evidence in this case does not support defendant\u2019s requested instruction. Defendant relies entirely on the testimony of Smith and another officer, who described Smith\u2019s struggle with defendant. Defendant argues that, from that testimony, which included a description of the dog biting defendant and the two men sliding down the slope, the jury could have inferred that defendant\u2019s conduct toward Smith was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The problem for defendant is that Smith testified consistently and unequivocally that defendant was not \u201cflailing wildly\u201d and that their physical struggle \u201cwas definitely a fight.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Smith also testified that, after both men began to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>slip down the embankment, part of defendant\u2019s body became lodged against a sign post, which prevented the two men from sliding further, and that the strike to Smith\u2019s jaw came at some point after that. In short, the record contains no evidence refuting Smith\u2019s testimony that defendant, despite being knocked off balance, resisted Smith by intentionally engaging in physical contact and continuing to fight him throughout the duration of the encounter. Because the evidence does not support defendant\u2019s contention that he did not engage in a voluntary act, the trial court did not err in refusing to give defendant\u2019s requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-13\"> ORS 163.208(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-14\">\u201cA person commits the crime of assaulting a public safety officer if the person intentionally or knowingly causes physical injury to the other person, knowing the other person to be a peace officer * * *, and while the other person is acting in the course of official duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> During trial, the prosecutor and Smith had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201c[THE STATE:] I guess I want to be clear. When he is doing the things he is doing, grabbing your face, and your neck, and your \u2014 hitting you in the jaw, and whatnot, again, without talking about speculating on his mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>state, but what was your impression of what was going on there? Was he trying to get away from you? Was he just kind of flailing wildly? What was happening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">\u201c[OFFICER SMITH:] No, it was \u2014 it was definitely a fight. I am a defensive tactics instructor for the department, and we classify people that we arrest in three categories; no, maybe and yes. A yes person is; you are under arrest. They turn around and put their hands together. A no person is someone who does absolutely not want to go to jail, and they do actions or words that relay that. And then the maybe person is the one where you say you are under arrest, and they just kind of stand there and look at you, but they really don\u2019t do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cFrom the first command that I gave him to stop, that he was under arrest, he was a no person. I mean, there was no indication at all at any point that he was willing to give up.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
