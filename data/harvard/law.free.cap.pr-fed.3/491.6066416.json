Instead, he has now again pleaded the same matter that we have ruled upon already in the cause. However, the motion to strike the plea will not be granted, but the plea is hereby overruled, and the respondent is ordered to answer by Friday, April 3d, 1908, in default of which answer the substituted complainants shall have the right to forthwith take a rule <em>pro confesso </em>against the respondent, and shall thereafter have the right to offer such proofs as may satisfy the court, if he cau, that he is entitled to have the decree and the decree <em>pro confesso </em>in the original bill in cause No. 137 set aside, and said original cause reopened and retried, as he has prayed for by his said bill of review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
