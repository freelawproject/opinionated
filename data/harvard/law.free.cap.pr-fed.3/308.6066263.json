Tbe suit involves real estate valued anywhere from $4,750 to $6,000, and money damages anywhere from $10,000 to more than $15,000. The cause was commenced before the court and a jury at a regular term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>on tbe 3d of May, 1907. After some exhibits were introduced and a number of witnesses had testified, it became apparent that the principal question in the case was one of law, with reference to the construction of a will; so counsel for both sides agreed and stipulated in writing that the jury should be discharged and the balance of the evidence introduced before the court alone, who should then pass upon the whole case. Thereafter, on November 18 and 20, 1907, the balance of the evidence was heard orally before the court, several additional exhibits were introduced, and the case closed. Counsel for both parties have filed carefully prepared briefs. The stenographic notes of the evidence were written out, the exhibits arranged, and now, after having read the testimony in full, and carefully examined the exhibits, we feel prepared tp make the following statement of facts in the case:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The testator, Alejandro Cruz Le Oompte, was born in the house in question in about the year 1800, and lived there practically all of his life. He was the son of a Frenchman from Havre de Grace, France, and of a Spanish or Porto Rican mother, of Porto Rico. He was first married to Do\u00f1a Juana Loredo, who died in childbirth, the child dying with her, he having had no other children by her. Thereafter, he married one Mercedes Rodriguez, with whom he had no issue, and who was, at the time of the marriage, a widow with one child, the latter being then about ten years of age. This child\u2019s name, as she was baptised, was Maria del Carmen Josefa Colon, and she is the party through whom plaintiff claims. It appears that the testator also had a niece named Aurelia Le Compte de Gutierrez, and that these two girls lived with and were brought up by the testator and his said second wife, in the house in question, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>that tbe girls so continued to live there until tbeir marriage respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">It further appears that the niece, Aurelia, got married to \u25a0one Francisco Gutierrez in about the year 1868 or \u201969, and about a year thereafter gave birth to a male child who was named Arturo; and, when said child was about a year and a half old, the said Aurelia and her husband left for the city of Havana, in Cuba, and never returned. On the evidence it is disputed whether or not a second child, named Francisco Gutierrez, was born previous to her thus going to .Havana or whether such \u25a0child was born shortly after her arrival at Havana. It is fairly well established that this niece, Aurelia, died intestate in Cuba in the year 1892, some thirteen years after the death of the testator, leaving two children, neither of whom has ever, so far as the evidence shows, been in Porto Kico.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The testator, Alejandro Cruz Le Oompte, made his will here at San Juan, Porto Eico, on the 18th day of December, 1818, .and added a codicil thereto on the 21st day of June, 1879, a copy of which will and codicil in Spanish, with an English translation of each, will be found at the end of this opinion. He died, or at least the date of his burial was seven days later, on the 28th day of June of that year, at the age of seventy-nine years. His wife, Mercedes Eodriguez de Le Oompte, outlived him seventeen years, and outlived the said niece about four years, and was buried on the 12th of May, 1896, at Ponce, Porto Eico, at the age of eighty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">It is established beyond dispute that the testator was the undisputed owner of two houses on San Justo street, San Juan, Porto Eico, for a long time previous to and at the time of his death, and that for many years he had one of the houses rented to the predecessor in interest of the defendants, he and his fami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ly living in tbe other portion; but that, some few years before his death, the parties thus leasing the other portion of the build-in from him required the whole of it, and a lease was made to-them of the whole double house, for $90 per month, he and his. family moving out and going to live first on Sol street and after-wards on Luna street, in San Juan. The single building, in the first instance, and the double building when it was joined, as. aforesaid, have ever since been used as a famous caf\u00e9 and confectionery establishment known as \u201cLa Mallorqu\u00edna.\u201d ' A few years after the death of the testator, the tenants thus occupying it purchased the north half of the building from the widow of the testator. The tenants paid the rent to the testator in his-lifetime, first at the rate of $45 per month for half of the building, and later at the rate of $90 per month for the whole building, and after his death continued to pay the $90 per month to his widow, both while she lived here at San Juan and after she moved to Ponce, and continued so to do until they purchased the north half of the same from her. Thereafter, they continued to pay her $45 per month for the remaining or south half of the house for a time, at least, but it appears that the1 widow received the rent after she moved to Ponce through a-, firm of merchants living there, to whom the tenants in San. Juan transmitted it monthly for her account. It further appears that shortly after the death of the testator, or perhaps, after the removal to Ponce of his widow, as aforesaid, the latter' instructed the tenants to remit $16 per month out of the $45-rental of the south half of the said building, which she had been receiving monthly, to the niece, Aurelia, in Cuba, under a provision of the will that will be hereinafter referred to, which. ,they did and continued so to do thereafter, at least, up to the time of Aurelia\u2019s death, in 1892. It does not, however, appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>in evidence whether or not the tenants, after the death of Aurelia, in Cuba, in 1892, and up to the time of the death of the old lady, in 1896, increased the remittance to the latter at Ponce again to $45 per month, or continued to pay her only the $29,, but it is certain that the old lady did receive rent monthly from the tenants up to the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Immediately or shortly after the death of the old lady at Ponce, in 1896, her daughter, the aforementioned Maria del Carmen Josefa Colon, who was then a widow, although she had in the meantime been married to one Podriguez, made some, effort to continue (as the sole heir of her said mother) the collection of this rent for the south half of the house, but without success. She states that she did not make much effort in that, behalf, save efforts made through friends to have the tenants pay the rent to her, because, as she says, she is \u201can indifferent sort of a person,\u201d and intimates that she did not care to enter into controversies about the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">It is in evidence that, after the death of the testator, his widow could find no papers whatsoever among his effects to show his \u201cdominio\u201d ownership of the double building in question, although it does not appear whether such title papers were lost or what became of them. Of course, it was generally known in the community that her husband had been the owner of said building, having been born in it and lived in it nearly all his long life, besides having rented it for many years; so the widow, just before she sold the north half of the building, which was unquestionably hers under the will, procured, under date of May 21, 1885, before the local tribunals, a dominio title to that half, and was thus enabled to register and sell it, which she did under date of April 5, 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>It further appears that in November and December, 1899, tbe said tenants procured a local scrivener to apply for, and he .actually secured, an expediente posesorio to the remaining or south half of the house in question, in the name of these two Gutierrez boys (Arturo and Francisco), sons and heirs of Aurelia, who had, as stated, died in Cuba in 1892, But plaintiff denies that such scrivener or these defendants had any right or authority to apply for such expediente, and the lawyer or scrivener, when put upon the stand, confessed that he knew nothing of the Gutierrez boys, but just did the work for the tenants on being paid a hundred-dollar fee for his services. In answer to such statement of the plaintiff that defendants had no authority to procure this \u201cexpediente posesorio,\u201d defendants\u2019 counsel, at the close of the case, offered to prove: \u201cThe authority direct from these people, that is, people who were authorized to get this expediente posesorio from these two brothersbut the court closed the case, stating that, if it considered the same necessary, it would call for it later.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On the 22d of December, 1906, this Mar\u00eda del Carmen Josefa 'Colon y Rodriguez, stepdaughter of the testator, and daughter .and sole heir of his widow, as aforesaid, made a deed, for what it may be worth, of this south half of this building, together with the right to sue for and collect the uncollected rents for the ten or eleven years previous, to one Jos\u00e9 Jesus Pesquera Goenaga, and the latter in turn, twenty-seven days later, on January 18, 1901, transferred or deeded all the rights he thus obtained to the plaintiff, Joseph Bias Costello, who, after making a proper demand for the possession of the premises, and for payment of and an accounting as to the rents, and being refused in that behalf, filed this suit for a recovery and for damages, on the 4th day of February, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The answer of defendants, although filed in parts and crude in form, amounts to a general denial of the title or right to recovery at all of the plaintiff or his predecessors in interest, and sets up several statutes of limitation, including the five-year statute of limitation against the collection of the rents under \u00a7 1867, subdivision 2, of the local Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Counsel for defendants, in open court, during the trial, and in his brief, virtually abandoned all these pleas, save that as to straight-out lack of title, and lack of right of possession in the plaintiff, and as to the accounting for rents, and claimed title to the property in the Gutierrez boys under the same will as plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in interest claim title under; and further, by reason of this fact, claims the right to the possession as against plaintiff, who, he says, must recover on the strength of his own title, and not on the weakness of that of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Counsel for both parties in the last analysis really admit that the rights of the parties turn upon the construction to be given to the 12th clause of the will; but that this clause should be construed in the light of the will as a whole, and particularly in the light of the 6th, 13th, 15th, and 17th clauses, and the first legacy clause of the codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Counsel for plaintiff contends that the will should be construed in accordance with the Spanish law as it existed here in Porto Pico in 1878-9, at the time of the making of the will and the death of the testator. He cites us to Galindo, tomo 1, p. 309, to show that title passes by means of a will such as this is, but we do not see the importance of this, as that fact is not disputed, at least, as to the passing of title by such a will, if the phraseology used is sufficient. He also' cites us, as tending to throw light upon and give rules for the construction of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>a will, to Galindo, tomo 2, pp. 135-6, and to Escriobe, pp. 1189 and 1193, the latter commenting on the Partidas, leyes 7, 8, 9, tit. 4, y ley 34, tit. 9, part. 6. And also to Scaevola, tomo 13, pp. 328-330, 581 and 582, and art. 759, old Spanish code, or 747, new code, and quotes at great length in Spanish from all these works, with the hope of showing us that, in this-case, the niece, Aurelia, took no vested interest, either at the date of the making of the will or at the time of the death of the testator, and that the will was therefore conditional and contingent, and argues that Aurelia\u2019s death before that of the life tenant or renter was a defeasance of the estate as to her. He also quotes from arts. 391, 392, of the mortgage law, and Galindo, tomo 6, p. 239, and from a decision of our own in this court in the recent case of Par\u00e9s v. Reynes [2 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 402], and from various sentencias of the Supreme Court of Spain, to show that an expediente posesorio has no effect save as a mere notice that the possession is adverse, and that a dominio title will be applied for at the proper statutory time. With this latter contention we have no dispute; and as to the former contention, with reference to the will being conditional if construed according to Spanish law, we do not see any reason for construing it according to that law rather than according to American law.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">From a reading of the Spanish authorities thus to us cited, and from the investigations our work has caused us to make since going upon this bench, we fail to see, as we have in other opinions several times stated, that there is much, if any, fundamental difference between the rules of the civil and common law governing property rights generally, and particularly is this so regarding devises. This is not to be wondered at, when one considers that the civil law in reality is but the daughter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the common law but the granddaughter of the ancient Eoman law and institutes. Their basic principles are largely similar. Their' differences are radical in but few instances, and those .are well known, and are defined by the civil codes on the one side, and largely by customs and court decisions on the other. So we feel that, in supporting the views we shall here express by the decisions of our own courts, we shall not be departing from the settled law under either system.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Counsel for defandants quotes not a single authority in all his brief, confining himself in his argument to an effort to \u00a1show the actual intention of the testator. He contends that it is manifest, particularly from the 12th clause of the will, that the testator, as to the half of the house that is here in -question, separated the usufruct from the fee, and gave the whole of the usufruct for a time to his wife, while then at once -devising the fee thereof to his niece, Aurelia.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">It is not an easy matter to determine the settled law among American and English authorities as to the vesting of estates.' It is perhaps not too much to say that on this subject the case law is more or less bewildering, and this is added to largely by \"the statutory efforts of several of the states of the Union to .avoid the incongruities of the old English system regarding the .great variety of estates that obtained in that country under its feudal and primogeniture systems, such as fees, feoffments, com tingencies, remainders, reversions, etc. The Supreme Court of \u25a0the United States, especially in the construction of wills, has, ras we think, very sensibly avoided a good deal of this incongruity, and in many cases has simply rested its decision upon what was held to be the intention of the\u2019 testator, as gathered from the will itself. We quote from the syllabi of several cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>in exemplification of this, and which also show the law that we= think should be applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In the case of Eaton v. Brown, 193 U. S. 411, 48 L. ed. 730, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487, that court held: \u201cCourts do not incline-to regard a will as conditional, where it reasonably can be held, that the testator was merely expressing his inducement to make* it, although his language, if strictly construed, would express, a condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">And again, in McCaffrey v. Manogue, 196 U. S. 563, 49 L. ed. 600, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 319, it was held that \u201cthe policy of' the law in favor of the heir yields to the intention of the testator,, if clearly expressed or manifested. The rule of law that a devise of lands without words of limitation or description gives; a life estate only does not apply, and devises will be held to be; of the fee, where it is plain that the testator\u2019s intention was to-dispose of his whole estate equally between his heirs, and there-is no residuary clause indicating that he intended passing less; than all of his estate, and all of his heirs at law are devisees, under the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Also in Rodriguez v. Vivoni, 201 U. S. 371, 50 L. ed. 792, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475, which was a case that went up. from this court, it was held that \u201cremote explanations as to-the use and meaning of a word will be rejected when the will offers upon its face a different and more obvious one. The-words, \u2018sucesi\u00f3n, legitima,\u2019 in the will of a Porto Eican, held to mean \u2018issue,\u2019 and not \u2018lawful heirs.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">And again, in Cruit v. Owen, 203 U. S. 368, 51 L. ed. 227, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 71, it was held that \u201ca trust in a will in favor of testator\u2019s four daughters, and \u2018from and after their death\u2019 for the \u2018children of each of them,\u2019 and in which the idea of provision for the grandchildren is especially promi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>nent, will not be-construed by rigidly giving plurality to tbe pronoun \u2018their/ and as creating a joint tenancy, so that the last surviving daughter takes all the income, to the exclusion of the children of her sisters, previously deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">And again, in Traverse v. Reinhardt, 205 U. S. 423, 51 L. ed. 865, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 563, it was held that \u201cwhile the predominant idea of the testator\u2019s mind, when discovered, is to be heeded as against all doubtful and conflicting provisions which might defeat it, effect must be given to all the words of a will if, by the rules of law, it can be done; and the words, \u2018without leaving a wife or child or children\u2019 will not be construed as \u2018without leaving a wife and child or children,\u2019 notwithstanding a general dominant intent on the part of the testator that his real estate should descend only through his sons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">A perusal of Jarman on Wills, vol. 1, 6th ed. pp. 778 et seq., will convince anyone, we think, after reading the large number of cases there referred to and quoted from, that its doctrine is sound where it holds that where a testator, after giving an estate or interest for life to one person, proceeds to dispose of the ulterior interest in terms which, literally construed, would seem to make such ulterior interest perhaps depend on the fact of the prior interest taking effect, still it is considered that the testator merely uses these expressions of apparent contingency as descriptive of the state of events under which he conceives the ulterior gift will fall into possession. It will be seen that all of these authorities hold that in construing such wills the law is that the testator intended that the successive interests would take effect in the order in which they are expressed, and not with the design of making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tbe actual vesting of the posterior gift depend on the bene\u25a0ficiary of it outliving the beneficiaries of prior estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">See also Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 2d ed. vol. 24, pp. 388 et seq., under heading \u201cVested Remainders,\u201d and the large number of cases cited. The doctrine referred to is well sustained by the cases of Thomson v. Ludington, 104 Mass. 193, and Goddard v. Whitney, 140 Mass. 92, 3 N. E. 30, and cases there cited. See also Kingman v. Harmon, 131 Ill. 176, 117, 23 N. E. 430, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In Croxall v. Shererd (Den ex dem. Croxall v. Sherrerd) 5 Wall. 268, 18 L. ed. 572, it was held that \u201ca remainder is to be considered as vested when there is a person in being who would have an immediate right to the possession upon the \u25a0ceasing of the intermediate particular estate. And it is never to be held contingent when, consistently with intention, it can be held vested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In Doe ex dem. Poor v. Considine, 6 Wall. 458, 18 L. ed. 869, it was held: \u201cEstates in remainder vest at the earliest \u25a0period possible, unless there be a clear manifestation of the Intention of the testator to the contrary. And, in furtherance \u25a0of this principle, the expression 'upon the decease of A I give .and devise the remainder,\u2019 construed to relate to the time of the enjoyment of the estate, and not the time of the vesting in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">See also McArthur v. Scott, 113 U. S. 340, 28 L. ed. 1015, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 652, where it was held that, although the legal estate was directly vested in trustees for the benefit of minors for a time certain, that those minors took the equitable \u25a0estate <em>instanter </em>on the death of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">In Thaw v. Richie (Thaw v. Falls) 136 U. S. 519, 34 L. ed. 531, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1037, it was held that where \u201ca testator devised all his real and personal estate to his widow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>for life, in trust, for tbe equal benefit of berself and tbeir two children or the survivors of them; and devised all the property remaining at the death of the widow, to the children or the survivor of them in fee; and, if both children should die before the widow, devised all the property to her in fee, \u2014 \u25a0 held, that the widow took the legal estate in the real property for her life; that she and the children took the equitable estate therein for her life, in equal shares; and that the children took vested remainders in fee, subject to be devested by their dying before the widow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The difference between this latter case and the case at bar, as can be seen, is that the children were minors, and that the will specifically stated that, in case of their death, the estate should go to their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In the case at bar it is shown by the will and the evidence that the testator brought up several young girls in his family, and in his will he provided for one of them, who was then in a convent, yet he never mentions his stepdaughter, Maria del Carmen, who, the evidence shows, was in Santo Domingo at the time. Neither must it be forgotten that the evidence shows that this niece, Aurelia, was not present in Porto Pico, either at the time the will was made or at tbe time of the death of the testator, because she had departed for Cuba some eight or nine years before. It is also manifest that the testator had her welfare in mind, as well as that of her children, because in the 12th clause of his will he gives the $16 per month out of the rents to her, \u201cso that she may provide for her own support and that of her sons with the same.\u201d In the first granting clause of the codicil, evidently because Aurelia gets no income from the estate for two years after his death, he makes a direct legacy of 200 pesos in foreign currency to her. By the 13th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>clause of tbe will, it will be seen that he gives the north half of the house outright to his wife, and takes particular pains-to state that she may do as she pleases with it. From a careful examination of all the Spanish text in which it was drawn,, of the 12th clause of this will, we are of opinion that the testator gave the fee to Aurelia and gave to his wife only a life estate in the rents of the half of the house in question, but. limited that by requiring her to give $16 per month out of it. to Aurelia, the grantee of the fee, payment beginning two-years after his death. It seems to us that this is too plain for argument,' and we might have decided the matter in very few words were it not that counsel have been so zealous that we felt: we should give reasons for our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The 17th clause of the will, which makes his wife his universal heir, or what we call residuary legatee, is the usual clause that is put in nearly all Spanish wills, and it referred at the time this will was made, as we think, to whatever other .personal property was not disposed of in the will itself. He nowhere speaks of the fee in this property as going to his .wife.. Instead, it is \u201cde los alquileres,\u201d that is, of the rents, that bespeaks, and which his wife shall \u201cgoce y disfrute,\u201d that is,, enjoy and possess o-r disfruit or gather from. In the 13th clause he states that, without prejudice to the rights granted, to his wife in the 12th clause, he leaves her, as stated, the north, \u25a0half of the house \u201cwithout restriction or reserve.\u201d And in the 12th clause he states that, upon the death of his wife, this; house, that is, the south half, of which he was speaking, shall pass \u201cwithout any restriction\u201d to his aforesaid niece, Aurelia.. This use of words clearly indicates that he had already disposed of it with restrictions, and therefore that Aurelia was. .entitled, from the moment of his death, not alone to a vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>remainder, but to tbe actual fee, wbicb sbe could bave disposed of in ber own lifetime, subject to tbe widow\u2019s rental right, and wbicb, in tbe absence of having so done, went to ber heirs, Arturo and Francisco Gutierrez, or whoever ber heirs may in fact be, and did not revert to tbe widow of tbe testator under tbe clause making ber universal heir of tbe testator, or in any other manner.</p>\n<p id=\"AFR\">It would serve no useful purpose for iis to comment at length upon tbe equities of tbe particular parties to this suit. We shall therefore only refer to them in this incidental way. Carmen, the daughter of tbe widow, is no blood relation to tbe testator, while bis niece, Aurelia, of course is. Carmen\u2019s acquiescence for more than ten years in tbe refusal of tbe defendants to pay ber rent that surely was hers if ber contention is right is more or less of an indication that sbe, probably from tbe knowledge sbe bad of tbe testator\u2019s intention, gained, may be, from himself in bis lifetime, as well as from ber mother, did not bave much confidence in ber claim, .and the fact that, immediately before tbe bringing of this suit, sbe transferred ber so-called rights to this Mr. Pesquera and through him to tbe plaintiff Costello, by deeds that, to say tbe least, show they are more or less speculative ventures on the part of both those purchasers, does not add strength to ber claim. Of course there may bave been other reasons for ber acquiescence and long wait, and, if sbe is right in her contention, that should not militate against ber; but we think that it would do violence to tbe phraseology of the will and to tbe settled law to bold in ber favor. As said before, although sbe was brought up in the testator\u2019s bouse, and although sbe is a daughter of bis wife, for whom be appears, from tbe language of tbe 6th and other clauses of bis will, to bave bad deep affection, still be did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>even mention Carmen in the will, or make any bequest even in money or chattels to her, although he made, as will be seen, many bequests to other persons who it would be supposed ought not to have such a hold upon his affections as she should have had. The presumption might be indulged that he had no desire to make any bequest to her, or he may have thought that, as the heir of her mother, she would get more than her share of his estate, if any of it were left after the mother\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Were this a suit in equity and Carmen and Aurelia\u2019s heirs parties to the record, we would decree the fee in this property to the heirs of Aurelia Le Compte de Gutierrez; but it is a suit at law, in ejectment, and the defendants here, so far as we are at present informed, have no title at all to the premises, save such indefinite right, if any, as is given them by their mere possession. The plaintiff in such a suit must recover, if at all, on the strength of his own title, and not upon the weakness of his adversary\u2019s, and so we simply find for the defendants because the plaintiff has failed to make out his case. The judgment which shall be entered will therefore not vest any title in the defendants more than they now possess, if any. And that each of the parties shall pay their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Whether or not the premises, escheat or have escheated to the island, if the heirs of Aurelia are all dead, is matter for another tribunal, should the facts warrant any proceeding in that regard. Let a judgment be entered as here indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">TESTAMENTO Y CODICILO.</p>\n<p id=\"AWH\">OTORGADO POR D.

ALEJANDRO CRUZ LECOMTE Y RAMOS.'</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">NUMBER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY-FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In the city of Porto Rico, on the eighteenth day of December, 1878, before me, D. Demetrio Gim\u00e9nez y Moreno, notary of the college of the territory of this province, with residence and office open in its capital on Fortaleza street, house number thirty-six, and the witnesses that will be named at the end, appeared at his house, Luna street, number 68, where we met D. Alejandro Cruz Lecomte y Ramos, whose identity he proves with his c\u00e9dula de empadronamiento (personal certificate) issued on the 25th of February of the present year, by the Inspector Don Antonio Garabis, which he exhibits to me, and I return to him; I assure that I know the party, that he has stated to me that he is in the full use of his civil rights and \u25a0with the necessary legal capacity for the execution of this instrument, and said: That he was born in and is a resident of this capital, the legitimate son of Don Alejandro Francisco Lecomte, native of Havre de Gracia and of Marla de la Paz Ramos, both deceased; that he is married and of seventy-seven years of age; that he is somewhat indisposed in health, although in full control of his reasoning powers, good memory and natural understanding, believing and confessing the very high and ineffable mystery of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three distinct persons and only one true God, and all other mysteries and sacraments that are believed, preached, and taught by. our Holy Mother, the Roman Catholic Church, in which true faith and belief he has lived and intends to live and die; afraid of death, natural and -inevitable for all living creatures, but uncertain as to its hour, and so that when it comes it may not find him unprepared of a final will, so that this temporal matter might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>not prevent him, in such critical moments, from directing his fervent prayers to the Creator, and so that, at the end, his soul may be brought to His blessed presence, so, with full knowledge and conscience, he has \u25a0decided to make this his testament, being his last will, and that it may be in this public protocol, where he wants it to be made as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">First. \u2014 Commits his soul to God, our Lord, who created it from nothing, and who returns the body to the earth of which it was formed, which, after he dies, will be shrouded appropriately as his administrators may direct, burying him in the cemetery of the town where he dies, \u25a0and to whose care he leaves all other matters concerning his funeral, masses, and other religious services for the good of his soul, giving notice, notwithstanding, to the V. O.
