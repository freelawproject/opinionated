Specifically, Tug Valley contends the Secretary breached his statutory and constitutional duties by approving a state environmental regulatory program that included a board of review composed of individuals representing specific interest groups. In a separate claim brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Tug Valley also names certain state defendants, claiming that because the regulatory program implemented by these state officials relegated Tug Valley to an appeal before a biased review board, Tug Valley\u2019s constitutional due process rights as well as certain statutory rights were denied. The district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that under federal law, Tug Valley\u2019s complaint could only be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">In 1977, Congress passed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (\u201cSMCRA\u201d), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 et <em>seq., </em>which provides for comprehensive regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation of mined lands. After an initial period of direct regulation by the Department of the Interior, primary responsibility for the supervision of mining and reclamation activities is to be delegated to the individual states. This transfer of authority takes place when a state submits an acceptable regulatory program that is approved by the Secretary. Under section 503(a) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(a), the state program must demonstrate that the \u201cState has the capability of carrying out the provisions of this chapter and meeting its purposes through ... a State law which provides for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with the requirements of this chapter....\u201d Under section 503(b), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(b), the Secretary may not approve any state program \u201cuntil he has ... found that the State has the legal authority and qualified personnel necessary for the enforcement of the environmental protection standards.\u201d The accompanying regulations restate that the Secretary shall not approve a program unless it \u201cprovides for the State to carry out the-provisions and purposes of the Act\u201d and does not contain laws or regulations which would interfere with the Act. 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 732.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">One of the provisions of SMCRA, section 517(g), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1267(g), requires that \u201c[n]o employee of the State regulatory authority performing any function or duty under this chapter shall have a direct or indirect financial interest in any underground or surface coal mining operation.\u201d Pursuant to this provision, the Secretary promulgated regulations in 1977 defining \u201cemployee\u201d and \u201cdirect or indirect financial interest.\u201d \u201cEmployee\u201d was defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-13\">(a) any person employed by the State Regulatory Authority who performs any function or duty under the Act, and (b) advisory board or commission members and consultants who perform any function or duty under the Act, if they perform decision-making functions for the State Regulatory Authority under the authority of the State law or regulations. However, members of advisory boards or commissions established in accordance with state law or regulations to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>multiple interests are not considered to be employees ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-4\">\u201cDirect financial interest\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-5\">[mjeans ownership or part ownership by an employee of lands, stocks, bonds, debentures, warrants, partnership shares, other holdings and also means any other arrangement where the employee may benefit from his or her holding in or salary from coal mining operations. Direct financial interests include employment, pensions, creditor, real property and other financial relationships.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahe\">\u201cIndirect financial interest\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-6\">[mjeans the same financial relationships as for direct ownership, but where the employee reaps the benefits of such interests, including interests held by his or her spouse, minor child and other relatives, including in-laws residing in the employee\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">On March 3,1980, West Virginia presented to the Secretary its program for regulation of surface mining and reclamation. As an integral part of this program the state submitted the West Virginia Coal Mining and Reclamation Act of 1980, sections twenty-three and twenty-four of which create the Reclamation Board of Review (\u201cRBR\u201d), a body empowered to review any notice, order, or final determination of the state director of the Department of Natural Resources and any order of the Reclamation Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> W.Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-23 and -24. The RBR is composed of five members appointed by the Governor, who \u201cby reason of ... previous training and experience, can be classed as ... capable and experienced\u201d in the respective areas of coal mining, agriculture, forestry, engineering, and water pollution control. W.Va.Code \u00a7 20-6-23(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">On October 20, 1980, Secretary Andrus approved most of the West Virginia plan, including the RBR, but withheld final approval pending certain revisions in the proposed program. Tug Valley, which participated in the federal administrative proceedings leading up to approval, began this suit on December 19, 1980, charging that the Secretary\u2019s endorsement of the RBR violated the Constitution and federal law and that acts of state officials gave rise to a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. On January 21, 1981, Secretary Watt formally certified a revised West Virginia plan. Tug Valley then launched a second action, this one naming Secretary Watt, which was later consolidated with the original lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">Upon approving the RBR, Secretary Andrus responded to criticism raised in public hearings that the RBR violated the conflict of interest prohibitions of section 517(g) of SMCRA. 45 Fed.Reg. 69270 (1980). Noting that section 517(g) applied only to \u201cemployees,\u201d the Secretary cited 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5, which states that members of advisory boards or commissions established in accordance with state law or regulations to represent multiple interests are not to be considered employees. The Secretary concluded that the RBR was established to represent multiple interests; therefore, its members were exempt from the conflict rules of section 517(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">Tug Valley asserts jurisdiction to protest the Secretary\u2019s action under section 526(a)(1) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1276(a)(1), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-14\">Any action of the Secretary to approve or disapprove a state program . . . shall be subject to judicial review by the United States District Court for the District which includes the capital of the State whose program is at issue. Any action by the Secretary promulgating national rules and regulations ... shall be subject to judicial review in the United States District Court for the District of Colum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>bia .... A petition for review of any action subject to judicial review under this subsection shall be filed in the appropriate Court within sixty days from the date of such action, or after such date if the petition is based solely on grounds arising after the sixtieth day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">This provision gives a cause of action to \u201cany person who participated in the administrative proceedings and who is aggrieved by the action of the Secretary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Tug Valley\u2019s substantive claims are threefold. First, it contends the Secretary acted in violation of section 503 of SMCRA and 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5 by approving a state plan that included, contrary to the mandate of section 517(g) of SMCRA, an appeals review board composed of individuals with direct or indirect financial interests in underground or surface coal mining. Second, Tug Valley alleges that the Secretary\u2019s approval of this portion of the state program violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment by \u201cestablishpng] a system with inherent conflicts of interest.\u201d Third, Tug Valley contends that the implementation by state officials of the approved plan relegates it to an appeal before a biased review board in contravention of its fourteenth amendment and state constitutional due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">In defense the Secretary argues first that the district court for the Southern District of West Virginia lacked subject matter jurisdiction, since Tug Valley\u2019s challenge amounted to an attack on 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5, which under section 526(a)(1) of SMCRA could only be brought in the district court for the District of Columbia within sixty days of promulgation. Second, the state defendants maintain that Tug Valley failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">The district court dismissed the case below for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Concerning Tug Valley\u2019s statutory claim, the court agreed with the Secretary that since \u201cemployee\u201d is defined in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5 specifically to exclude \u201cmembers of the advisory boards or commissions established in accordance with state law or regulations to represent multiple interests,\u201d the conflict rules binding on state employees under section 517(g) would not apply to the RBR.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">The court went on to characterize Tug Valley\u2019s statutory claim as an attack on 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5 inasmuch as the regulation exempted advisory boards representing multiple interests from the conflict of interest prohibitions of section 517(g). Section 526(a)(1) of SMCRA specifically assigns jurisdiction over attacks on the Secretary\u2019s regulations to the district court for the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court then dismissed the entire case without addressing the constitutional claims against the Secretary and state defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">On appeal, Tug Valley disputes the district court\u2019s characterization of its suit as an attack on federal regulation 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5. On the contrary, Tug Valley maintains it seeks to enforce that provision. These contradictory characterizations stem from differing interpretations of \u00a7 705.5. Tug Valley relies on the first sentence of the regulation, which in effect subjects members of boards with decision-making functions under SMCRA to the conflict of interest prohibitions in section 517(g). The government relies on the second sentence of \u00a7 705.5, which exempts from conflict rules members of advisory boards created to represent diverse interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">Tug Valley urges that the Reclamation Board of Review is much more than a mere advisory board. It has the power to make findings resulting in affirmance or reversal of the orders of the director of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Department of Natural Resources or the Reclamation Commission. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra; </em>W.Va.Code \u00a7 20-6-24. The RBR\u2019s orders are self-enforcing. W.Va.Code \u00a7 20-6-25(b). Cases decided by the RBR may be appealed to the state courts, but they are subject to the narrow substantial evidence scope of review, not heard <em>de novo. </em>W.Va. Code \u00a7 20-6-26(e). These facts, according to Tug Valley, amply show that under 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5 members of the RBR perform critical decision-making functions under the Act and should therefore be subjected to the conflict of interest prohibitions of section 517(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">However forceful this argument as a normative proposition, the plain language of the regulation as well as the Secretary\u2019s comments in the public record pertaining thereto indicate that members of advisory boards representing multiple interests are exempt from conflict of interest restrictions, even where such boards have substantial authority under state law and SMCRA. Upon issuing \u00a7 705.5, the Secretary stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0E\">[T]he Department has clarified the term employee in \u00a7 705.5 to include advisory board or commission members and consultants who perform any function or duty under the Act, if they perform decision-making functions for the State Regulatory Authority under the authority of State law or regulations. <em>An exception </em>has been made for members of advisory boards or commissions which are established to represent multi-interests in accordance with requirements of State law or regulations. <em>This exception is necessary to avoid dismembering boards or commissions composed in such a manner as to represent divergent interests, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">42 Fed.Reg. 56061 (1977). Thus, while the first sentence of \u00a7 705.5 defines \u201cemployee\u201d to include any state decision-maker under the Act, the second sentence excludes decision-makers who happen to serve on multiinterest advisory boards. The Secretary evidently has determined that sound policy calls for preserving state mining and reclamation commissions representing diverse interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">In short, 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5 will not yield to Tug Valley\u2019s argument that the RBR is subject to section 517(g). Environmentalists may well object to the Secretary\u2019s exemption of boards representing multiple interests, but the proper procedure for pursuing their grievances is to petition the Secretary for amendment of the regulation and, if rejected, to seek judicial review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>30 C.F.R. \u00a7 700.12; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (1977). Tug Valley simply has no statutory ground for complaint under the existing regulatory scheme. Its challenge to the Secretary\u2019s approval of the RBR\u2014 approval which was entirely consistent with section 517(g) of the Act as elaborated under 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5 \u2014 can only be construed as an attack on \u00a7 705.5 itself. Therefore, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Tug Valley\u2019s statutory claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was proper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">In addition to the alleged violation of SMCRA, Tug Valley charges that the Secretary and the state defendants violate the fifth and fourteenth amendments by implementing a state law that, to quote Tug Valley\u2019s complaint, \u201cestablishes a system of inherent conflicts of interest which are violative of the due process clause .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The particular due process right alleged to have been infringed is Tug Valley\u2019s right to an impartial board of review. Although Tug Valley itself appears never to have suffered an adverse ruling from the RBR,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it contends that the Board \u201chas consistently acted in a fashion which shows its bias against citizen participation and environmental concerns.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Tug Valley rests on several Supreme Court cases upholding the right to an impartial tribunal. The seminal authority is <em>Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 47 5. Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927), in which the Court invalidated an ordinance that enabled judicial officers to profit monetarily from convicting defendants. - Subsequent cases cited by Tug Valley all involve allegations that judicial or quasi-judicial officers had pecuniary interests that infected their ability to render unbiased decisions. See <em>Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., </em>446 U.S. 238, 100 S.Ct. 1610, 64 L.Ed.2d 182 (1980); <em>Gibson v. Berryhill, </em>411 U.S. 564, 93 S.Ct. 1689, 36 L.Ed.2d 488 (1973); Ward v. <em>Village of Monroeville, Ohio, </em>409 U.S. 57, 93 S.Ct. 80, 34 L.Ed.2d 267 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">Here, in contrast, Tug Valley has not alleged that members of \u2022 the RBR have financial interests in the outcome of cases brought before them. Rather, the gist of Tug Valley\u2019s claim is that individuals trained and experienced in coal mining, agriculture, forestry, etc. and appointed to the RBR by the governor of West Virginia are inherently biased against environmental interests and may not therefore be allowed to sit in judgment on matters of ecological concern.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">These allegations do not state a constitutional violation. There is no due process right to have one\u2019s claims heard before a court purged of ideology. One is certainly entitled to a tribunal untainted by monetary inducements or evident personal bias,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but a litigant may not hold a judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>experience and education against him or her. A criminal defendant may be tried before a judge who was once a prosecutor, and a former legal aid attorney appointed to the bench may preside over a food stamp entitlement case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Under section 526(a)(1) of SMCRA, the district court for the Southern District of West Virginia had no jurisdiction to hear what amounted to an attack on federal regulation 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5, and the constitutional claim advanced by Tug Valley failed to state a cause of action. The judgment of the district court is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-10\">. Under the West Virginia act the director of the Department of Natural Resources approves all surface mining permits and issues notices of violations to operators who fail to comply with the statute or regulations or with permit conditions. W.Va.Code \u00a7 20-6-9. The director also hears appeals from the issuance of cessation orders by the surface mining reclamation inspectors. W.Va.Code \u00a7 20-6-16. The Reclamation Commission promulgates regulations implementing the Coal Mining and Reclamation Act, makes inspections, conducts hearings and designates areas unsuitable for surface mining. W.Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-7 and 20-6-22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-10\">. Tug Valley does not seriously dispute the fact that the RBR was created to represent multiple interests within the meaning of \u00a7 705.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b869-16\">. A desire for uniform interpretation of federal regulations explains this assignment of exclusive jurisdiction. <em>Cf. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c (Voting Rights Act); 42 U.S.C. (Supp. III) \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (Clean Air Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b870-5\">. Under section 526(a)(1) of the Act, Tug Valley could have challenged 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 705.5 within sixty days of promulgation by the Secretary in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Since the RBR was in existence at the time \u00a7 705.5 was issued, Tug Valley should have been on notice that Board members would not be subject to the conflict provisions of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\">. Furthermore, even if \u00a7 705.5 did include members of multi-interest commissions within the definition of \u201cemployee,\u201d Tug Valley would still have failed to state a claim under the statute. Section 517(g) bars state employees with duties under the Act from having any \u201cdirect or indirect financial interest in any underground or surface coal mining operation.\u201d W.Va.Code \u00a7 20-6-23(a) does not permit members of the RBR to have financial interests in coal mining enterprises. It simply states that the Board is to be composed of five members who by reason of previous vocation, employment, training, or affiliations can be classed as capable and experienced in the areas of coal mining, agriculture, forestry, engineering and water pollution control. These expertise qualifications in no way conflict with a prohibition against ownership of financial interests in coal mines. Also, in its complaint, Tug Valley does not charge individual members of the RBR with owning financial interests in coal mining operations in contravention of SMCRA. Thus, Tug Valley has completely failed to allege facts to show that the West Virginia Reclamation Board of Review as presently constituted vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>lates section 517(g), even assuming RBR members are \u201cemployees\u201d subject to the conflict rules of SMCRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b871-9\">. Tug Valley had one case pending before the RBR at the time this suit was begun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b871-10\">. Since Tug Valley has alleged elsewhere in its complaint that its members will suffer environmental harms from continued operation of the RBR, the organization has satisfied the requirement that it assert more than a \u201cgeneralized grievance\u201d in order to make out injury in fact. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498-99, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2204, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 735, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1366, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\">. We offer no opinion on the proposition that the experts selected to fill the five-member RBR would display inherent conflicts of interest and consistently align themselves in opposition to West Virginia environmentalists. We note, however, that W.Va.Code \u00a7 20-6-23(a) calls for the appointment of some whose specialties suggest compatibility with environmental concerns: forestry, agriculture, and water pollution control. The forestry and agriculture experts are expected, under the statute, to represent the \u201cgeneral public interest.\u201d Thus, on its face the statute appears to uphold environmental values.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b871-17\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144, 455(a) and (b) (1982):</p>\n<p id=\"b871-18\">\u00a7 144.
