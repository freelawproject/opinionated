LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b821-19\">In this case plaintiff appeals from a district court order reviewing a decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) denying plaintiff disability benefits after October 16, 1980. The principal issue to be decided by this Court is whether substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s decision. We believe that the Secretary\u2019s decision denying benefits after October 16, 1980 was supported by substantial evidence, and therefore will affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-20\">I. Statement of Case</p>\n<p id=\"b821-21\">Plaintiff filed an application for a period of disability insurance benefits with the Social Security Administration on April 14, 1980. Plaintiff claimed that a back injury prevented him from working after September 19, 1979. The Social Security Administration denied the application initially and again on rehearing. Pursuant to plaintiff\u2019s request, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) conducted a <em>de novo </em>hearing at which plaintiff appeared with counsel. On February 19, 1981 the ALJ granted plaintiff\u2019s application for disability benefits but for the period September 19, 1979 through October 16, 1980. The ALJ concluded that plaintiff \u201c[was] able to perform sedentary work activity\u201d as of October 16, 1980. (Tr. 22). Therefore, the ALJ found plaintiff not disabled beyond that period. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Plaintiff then sought review of the ALJ\u2019s decision in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. After evaluating the record and findings of the ALJ, the magistrate recommended that the ALJ\u2019s decision be affirmed. The magistrate stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-4\">The claimant apparently does not argue that the ALJ\u2019s findings and evaluation of his residual functional capacity for sedentary work were fundamentally wrong, but that they were incomplete because the ALJ did not give due consideration to his mental retardation as an impairment which, added to this physical impairments, effectively precluded him from engaging in the \u201cfull range\u201d of sedentary work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">(Appendix \u201cApp.\u201d B-13).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The magistrate further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">The findings of Dr. Spergel indicate that the limitations imposed by the claimant\u2019s mental retardation were not sufficiently restrictive to prevent him from engaging in several forms of sedentary work. (Tr. 189). Moreover, it appears that the ALJ gave due consideration to Dr. Spergel\u2019s report, in particular noting that Dr. Spergel did not believe that the claimant\u2019s limited mental ability would prevent him from engaging in a number of sedentary jobs. (Tr. 21-22).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">(App. B-15).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">The district court granted defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and adopted the Magistrate\u2019s Report. (App. El-1).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">II. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">At the time of the administrative hearing plaintiff was 84, had completed a sixth grade education, and was considered illiterate. His employment history included limited work as a trash collector, mover, dishwasher, janitor and grounds keeper. (Tr. 87). He worked as a grounds keeper at St. Agnes Hospital in Philadelphia until his accident, which occurred during the course of his employment. Plaintiff was injured, when he slipped and fell down a number of wet steps on September 19, 1979. (Tr. 48).</p>\n<p id=\"ATE\">Plaintiff underwent substantial medical evaluations and treatment. (Tr. 7-10, 105-207). He was eventually admitted to Riddle Memorial Hospital on February 18,1980 for the surgical removal of an injured disc. He was readmitted on March 3, 1980 for phlebitis which was successfully treated. (Tr. 117-32).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">The record contains a number of medical reports summarizing evaluations conducted by various physicians regarding plaintiff\u2019s medical condition. Dr. Erwin R. Schmidt, Jr., an orthopaedic specialist, concluded that plaintiff was disabled from performing his past maintenance work (Tr. 183), but found plaintiff capable of performing sedentary work. (Tr. 204). Similarly, Dr. Robert J. Doman concluded that plaintiff retained the functional capacity for sedentary work. (Tr. 192-95).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">Dr. Philip Spergel, a psychologist and vocational expert, also interviewed the claimant. Dr. Spergel found that the claimant was not only illiterate, but that he possessed a \u201cborderline range of intelligence.\u201d (Tr. 188). Dr. Spergel nevertheless found plaintiff capable of performing \u201call activities of daily living (dressing, bathing, etc.).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 187). He also concluded that plaintiff had a good range of motion in his hands, and that plaintiff could sit comfortably for several hours so long as he shifts positions. <em>(Id.). </em>Finally, Dr. Spergel reported that plaintiff admitted that he could lift up to ten pounds. <em>(Id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-15\">After evaluating plaintiff\u2019s mental and physical limitations, Dr. Spergel concluded that plaintiff was capable of work and identified specific sedentary jobs existing in the national economy within plaintiff\u2019s residual functional capacity. Dr. Spergel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOA\">Despite Mr. Olson\u2019s physical limitations resulting from his lumbosacral discomfort and his educational deficits, he still retains transferable skills. His upper extremity psychomotor functions are intact and his gross manipulative skills, aren\u2019t impaired. In addition, his visual organization is acceptable. He stated that he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>able to sit and stand for reasonable periods of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">(Id. at 190).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The issue in this case is whether substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s decision finding plaintiff <em>not </em>disabled after October 16, 1980. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) promulgates that \u201c[t]he findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d Courts have defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201c \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u2019 \u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>see also, Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 704 (3d Cir.1981), <em>pet. for reh. den., </em>650 F.2d 481 (3d Cir.1981); <em>Lewis v. Califano, </em>616 F.2d 73, 76 (3d Cir.1980); <em>Smith v. Califano, </em>637 F.2d 968, 970 (3d Cir.1981). Substantial evidence has also been defined as \u201cenough [evidence] to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury,\u201d <em>NLRB v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The process employed to determine whether plaintiff is entitled to benefits involves shifting burdens of proof. As this Court explained in <em>Rossi v. Califano, </em>602 F.2d 55 (3d Cir.1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-8\">There is a two-pronged test for social security act disability: (1) determination of the extent of disability; and (2) determination whether that impairment results in inability to engage in substantial gainful activity. A claimant satisfies [his] initial burden of proof by showing that [he] is unable to return to [his] customary occupation. <em>E.g., Stark v. Weinberger, </em>497 F.2d 1092 (7th Cir.1974); <em>Baker v. Gardner, </em>362 F.2d 864 (3d Cir.1966). Once [he] has made such a demonstration, the burden of proof shifts to the Secretary to show that the claimant given [his] age, education and work experience, has the capacity to perform specific jobs that exist in the national economy. <em>E.g., Lewis v. Weinberger, </em>541 F.2d 417 (4th Cir. 1976); <em>Hernandez v. Weinberger, </em>493 F.2d 1120 (1st Cir.1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">In the instant case it is undisputed that plaintiff satisfied his burden of establishing disability from September 19, 1979 to October 16,1980 as defined by the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5). In short, it is agreed that, at the very least, the plaintiff is a \u201cyounger (age 18^4),\u201d illiterate and unskilled individual who is unable to return to his past work.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">Once plaintiff met the above threshold requirement, the burden fell upon the Secretary to show claimant, considering age, education, mental and physical limitations and work experience \u201chas the capacity to perform specific jobs that exist in the national economy.\u201d <em>Rossi v. Califano, </em>602 F.2d at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">In determining whether plaintiff possesses the residual functional capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity, the Secretary may be guided by the regulations at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1501, <em>et seq. </em>The Social Security Administration adopted these guidelines to ensure consistency in the Secretary\u2019s resolution of disability claims. These regulations provide for a five-step sequential evaluation giving consideration to (1) whether the claimant is currently working; (2) the severity of his impairment; (3) the nature of his impairment; (4) his ability to do relevant past work; and (5) his ability to do any work. Additionally, these regulations provide medical-vocational guidelines and tables in 20 C.F.R. Sub-part P, Appendix 2, to be applied once the Secretary has established whether the claimant\u2019s maximum sustained work capability is limited to sedentary, light, medium or heavy work.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">Appellant makes two arguments. First, he argues that in completing the fifth step of the evaluation process the AU applied an incorrect legal standard. Second, he insists that the ALJ\u2019s finding of no disability beyond October 16, 1980 was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Appellant points specifically to Finding # 11 of the ALJ as evidence of the ALJ\u2019s alleged error. Finding # 11 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-4\">... 20 C.F.R. Section 404.1569 and Rule 201.23 Table No. 1 of Appendix 2, Sub-part P, Regulations No. 4, <em>direct </em>that, as of October 16, 1980, the claimant, considering his maximum sustained work capability, age, education, and work experience, be found \u201cnot disabled\u201d from that date ... (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">(Tr. 23). Appellant suggests that the ALJ failed to make any finding with regard to plaintiff\u2019s non-exertional impairment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which would have precluded the use of grids found in Section 404.1569 and Rule 201.23, Table No. 1 of Appendix 2, Subpart P, Regulation No. 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The existence of plaintiff\u2019s non-exertional impairment, appellant suggests, would operate to place plaintiff in between the various grids, and therefore the ALJ\u2019s use of the word \u201cdirected\u201d with regard to the effect of the regulations evidences a clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s contention. The ALJ in the instant case considered \u201call of the testimony given at the hearing and the documents contained in the exhibit file\u201d (Tr. 20) and made a decision supported by substantial evidence as required by law. (Tr. 20). Based upon a detailed and express evaluation of that evidence, the ALJ made twelve specific findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">FINDINGS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">1. That the claimant met the specific earnings requirements for disability insured status under the Act on September 19, 1979;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-11\">2. That the medical evidence of record establishes that the claimant has been treated for orthopedic impairment of the low back with surgery on February 18, 1979, and a later bout of thrombophlebitis of the right leg;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-12\">3. That, based on credibility and evidence of record, I do not find that the claimant\u2019s subjective symptoms, including those of pain, would have prevented him from engaging in substantial gainful work activity from October 16, 1980;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-13\">4. That the claimant\u2019s impairments prevented him from engaging in substantial gainful work activity, however, commencing on September 19, 1979, and continued for a period of at least 12 months, until October 16, 1980, but not thereafter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-14\">5. That the greater weight of the medical evidence establishes that these significant impairments lasted for a period of 12 months at a level of severity so as to cause the inability of the claimant to engage in substantial gainful activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-15\">6. That the claimant is unable to perform his past relevant jobs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-16\">7. That, as of October 16, 1980, the claimant had the maximum sustained work capability for sedentary work, as defined in section 404.1567 of Subpart P, Regulations No. 4;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-17\">8. That the claimant was bom on December 16, 1945, and is a younger individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>9. That the claimant completed the sixth grade in school, but is illiterate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-5\">10. That the claimant\u2019s past work activities did not impart skills that are transferable to work other than that previously performed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">11. That section 404.1569 and Rule 201.-23, Table No. 1 of Appendix 2, Sub-part P, Regulations No. 4, direct that, as of October 16, 1980, the claimant, considering his maximum sustained work capability, age, education, and work experience, be found \u201cnot disabled\u201d from that date, and through the date of this decision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">12. That the claimant was not under a \u201cdisability\u201d as defined in the Social Security Act, as amended, after October 16, 1980, and through the date of this decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">(Tr. 22-23).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">These findings indicate that the ALJ considered competing medical evidence, (see Finding # 5) as well as other evidence and resolved any conflict in evidence in favor of finding a 12-month closed period of disability instead of a period in excess of 12 months. Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s Report indicates that several doctors found plaintiff capable of performing sedentary work, one of whom, Dr. Spergel, identified specific sedentary jobs, existing in the national economy, for which plaintiff retained the residual functional capacity to perform. (Tr. 190). In short, these Findings and other evidence in the record constitute substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">As in many other social security cases which come before us, the instant claimant made a compelling argument about his disability; it could have persuaded some fact finders to rule in his favor. Where the record establishes beyond dispute that the claimant had a serious injury, has a \u201cborderline range of intelligence\u201d and is illiterate, and where an orthopedic specialist testified that claimant was incapable of performing his past maintenance work, certainly there is sufficient evidence to justify an award in his favor. But in view of the ALJ\u2019s specific findings and his detailed consideration of all of the evidence, including the combined effect of several impairments, we cannot say that as a matter of law the ALJ erred in resolving every major conflict in evidence against the claimant. Such is the nature of administrative adjudications and the constraints on our appellate review process. Thus, we will affirm the district court in upholding the ALJ\u2019s decision as supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\">. Appellant asserts that the non-exertional impairments which the ALJ failed to consider were enumerated in Dr. Spergel\u2019s report which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Mr. Olsen is presently functioning within the borderline range of intelligence (Full Scale I.Q. 75). There is a marked discrepancy between his verbal (I.Q. 82) and performance (I.Q. 69) scores suggestive of a moderate depressive reaction. Intersubtest scatter and pattern analysis reflect marked personal adjustment difficulties characterized by considerable anxiety. [Tr. 188],</p>\n<p id=\"ApCf\"><em>Quoted in, </em>Appellant\u2019s brief at 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-19\">. This would be the case primarily in either of two situations: an applicant falls between the various definitional categories established by the regulations (e.g., the individual can perform more than light but less than medium work), ... or an applicant has certain non-exertional impairments <em>(e.g., </em>a psychotic headache; a sensory or skin disorder) in addition to exertional limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-20\"><em>Santise v. Schweiker, </em>676 F.2d 925, 928, n. 9 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b825-12\">BECKER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHs\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">This Court has defined substantial evidence as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasoning mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 704 (3d Cir.1981). This oft-cited language is not, however, a self-executing formula for adjudication; our decisions make clear that determination of the existence <em>vel non </em>of substantial evidence is not a mere quantitative exercise. A single piece of evidence will not satisfy the substantiality test if the Secretary ignores, or fails to resolve a conflict created by, countervailing evidence. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 706 (ALJ must explain why certain evidence has been accepted and why other evidence has been rejected; there is a \u201cparticularly acute need\u201d for explanation when record contains conflicting probative evidence). Nor is evidence substantial if it is overwhelmed by other evidence, particularly certain types of evidence (e.g., that offered by treating physicians), or if it is not really evidence but a mere conclusion. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 can only be considered as supporting evidence in relationship to all the other evidence in the record.\u201d) (footnote omitted). The search for substantial evidence is thus a qualitative exercise without which our review of Social Security disability cases ceases to be merely deferential and becomes instead a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">I cannot agree that the Secretary\u2019s decision in this case is based on substantial evidence. In my view, the Secretary has failed to acknowledge, much less come to grips with, serious inconsistencies in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>record. The Secretary has ignored critical evidence. He has misinterpreted both the medical and vocational evidence. He has even misapplied the governing provisions of his \u201cgrid\u201d regulations. Under these circumstances, I believe that the majority has erred in affirming the district court\u2019s judgment in the Secretary\u2019s favor. <em>See Cotter v. Harris, supra, </em>642 F.2d at 704-06. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">It is undisputed that appellant, whose employment history is as a mover, gravedigger, groundskeeper, trash collector, and janitor, suffers from a severe and chronic lower-back syndrome and from anxiety; it is also undisputed not only that he can never return to heavy work, but also that he can never perform anything more strenuous than sedentary work. Moreover, it is agreed that appellant is a functional illiterate who reads at a second-grade level and who tests as retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">At the core of this case is the question whether substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that the appellant nevertheless retained a residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work \u2014 in particular, certain sedentary jobs existing in the national economy. The majority\u2019s affirmative conclusion depends primarily on the testimony of the Secretary\u2019s vocational expert, Philip Spergel, Ed.D., and two physicians, Robert J. Doman, M.D., a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation, and Erwin R. Schmidt, Jr., M.D., an orthopedic surgeon. This reliance, however, is misplaced. In upholding the Secretary\u2019s determination of non-disability under the grids, the majority relies upon Dr. Spergel\u2019s conclusion that the appellant \u201cretains transferable skills.\u201d This conclusion, however, which is necessary to put appellant\u2019s case within the grids, clashes with the finding of the Administrative Law Judge that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s past work activities <em>did not impart skills that are transferable </em>to work other than that previously performed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Neither the majority nor the Secretary has explained this inconsistency; in fact, there does not appear to be any support in the record for Dr. Spergel\u2019s conclusion that appellant possesses transferable skills. Dr. Spergel\u2019s report therefore cannot constitute substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">The Secretary also focuses on Dr. Spergel\u2019s assertion that appellant retains a residual functional capacity to perform twelve specific sedentary jobs existing in the national economy. These jobs include base brander, ampoule examiner, coil winder, marker, solderer-assembler, thermostat assembler, and electrical-accessories assembler. But this conclusion is at odds with the medical report of Samuel P. Ivins, M.D., the Secretary\u2019s own neurologist and psychiatrist, who opined that appellant, because of his condition, should be totally restricted from activities that would bring him in contact with moving machinery. The above jobs appear to involve such activity. The Secretary has not addressed this apparent inconsistency in the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">Ability to perform sedentary work also depends on whether the employee is sufficiently free from physical pain to enable him to focus on his labors. There is evidence in the record that appellant suffers from constant and severe pain upon even the most modest exertion. That evidence, if credited, obviously would reflect upon appellant\u2019s ability to perform the kinds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>jobs listed by Dr. Spergel. The ALJ\u2019s treatment of this contention is confined to one conclusory statement in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anf\">The evidence of record does not show that the claimant\u2019s impairments and symptoms, including those of pain, continued at a level of severity so as to preclude him from performing work activity beyond October 16, 1980.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">This off-hand dismissal of subjective pain does not pass muster under the decisions of this Court. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>687 F.2d 968, 972 (3d Cir.1981) (failure seriously to consider subjective evidence of pain can itself constitute grounds for reversal); <em>see Cotter v. Harris, supra, </em>642 F.2d at 704 (\u201cadministrative decision should be accompanied by a clear and satisfactory explication of the basis on which it rests\u201d). Relevant, too, is our admonition in <em>Dobrowolsky v. Califano, </em>606 F.2d 403, 409 (3d Cir.1979), that \u201c[tjestimony of subjective pain and inability to perform even light work is entitled to great weight, particularly when ... it is supported by competent medical evidence.\u201d It is so supported here, and there is no medical evidence advanced by the Secretary to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The Secretary relies heavily on the reports of Dr. Doman and Dr. Schmidt. Dr. Schmidt, a member of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, is appellant\u2019s treating physician. Dr. Doman\u2019s report, dated December 10, 1980, concludes that appellant can perform sedentary (though not light) work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although neither Dr. Schmidt\u2019s report of October 16,1980, nor his \u201cfunctional assessment\u201d of January 21, 1981, is inconsistent with Dr. Doman\u2019s conclusion, these reports must be considered in light of Dr. Schmidt\u2019s subsequent report dated March 18,1981, less than two months later. That report, which was submitted to the Appeals Council, states that \u201cMr. James Olsen is continuing under medical care [and] is <em>totally disabled for any </em>work, even sedentary. He is being admitted to a rehabilitation center in the very near future for further care.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Appeals Council totally disregarded this last report, stating only that Dr. Schmidt\u2019s assessment was \u201cnot supported by clinical findings.\u201d This pronouncement, however, completely ignores the fact (of record) that Dr. Schmidt was appellant\u2019s treating physician and that he had examined appellant a number of times. It also ignores the precept that a treating physician\u2019s opinion is entitled to substantial weight. <em>Cotter v. Harris, supra, </em>642 F.2d at 704; <em>cf. Bastien v. Califano, </em>572 F.2d 908, 912 (2d Cir.1978) (expert opinions of treating physician as to existence of disability are binding on fact-finder unless contradicted by substantial evidence to the contrary). The Secretary, therefore, without any basis in fact, has utterly disregarded critical evidence relating to appellant\u2019s inability to work on account of his back condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Finally, there are serious problems with the Secretary\u2019s application of the grids. In <em>Santise v. Schweiker, </em>676 F.2d 925, 934 (3d Cir.1982) (emphasis added), this Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">[I]t must be kept in mind that the grids do not govern \u2014 and indeed were not intended to <em>govern </em>\u2014 all disability cases. For example, the regulations specifically dictate that \u201ca conclusion of disabled or not disabled <em>is not directed\u201d </em>if an individual\u2019s vocational profile is not precisely contained in Appendix 2. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1569 &amp; Appendix 2, \u00a7 200.00(d); <em>see Thomas v. Schweiker, </em>666 F.2d 999, 1004 (5th Cir.1982) (\u201cuse of the Guidelines is inappropriate where their evidentiary underpinnings do not coincide <em>exactly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>with the evidence of disability appearing on the record\u201d (emphasis added)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The <em>Santise </em>Court explained further that, \u201c[i]f a claimant\u2019s characteristics do not fit neatly into one of the many categories defined by the tables, the ALJ <em>is permitted </em>to arrive at a conclusion as to disability <em>independent of, </em>but consonant with, the regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 928 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">In the present case, appellant\u2019s non-exertional impairment is undisputed. Even Dr. Spergel reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">Mr. Olson [sic] is presently functioning within the borderline range of intelligence (Full Scale I.Q. 75). There is a marked discrepancy between his verbal (I.Q. 82) and performance (I.Q. 69) scores suggestive of a moderate depressive reaction. Intersubtest scatter and pattern analysis [sic] reflect marked personal adjustment difficulties characterized by considerable anxiety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Nevertheless, the ALJ ignored appellant\u2019s non-exertional impairment and concluded instead that he was \u201cdirected\u201d by the regulations to find appellant not disabled. As we explicitly recognized in <em>Santise, </em>however, \u201cthe rules \u2018may not be fully applicable\u2019 where a claimant suffers from non-exertional, instead of or in addition to exertional, impairments.\u201d 676 F.2d at 934-35 (quoting 20 C.F.R., part 404, Appendix 2, \u00a7 200.00(e)). Thus, the regulations only \u201cdirect\u201d a finding of disabled or not disabled in those cases in which the claimant\u2019s impairment is strictly exertional and his/her individual profile coincides exactly with the guidelines. This is not such a case. Because Mr. Olsen\u2019s mental retardation represents a critical non-exertional impairment, the ALJ\u2019s failure to reach a conclusion independent of the grid regulations constitutes an application of an incorrect legal standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">The ALJ\u2019s error is even more obvious in light of our holding in <em>Burnam v. Schweik</em>er, 682 F.2d 456 (3d Cir.1982). Building upon <em>Santise, Burnam </em>declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-11\">Having determined on the basis of the grid that Burnam was not disabled based on his exertional impairments, the administrative law judge failed to follow the regulatory directive that he then consider \u201chow much [Burnam\u2019s] work capability [was] further diminished in terms of any types of jobs that would be contraindicated by [his] nonexertional limitations.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, \u00a7 200.-00(e)(2) (1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-12\">The administrative law judge thus erred in treating Burnam\u2019s exertional and nonexertional impairments separately and in then determining on the basis of the medical-vocational grid that substantial gainful work existed in the national economy that Burnam could perform. The administrative law judge, instead should have considered whether work existed for a person with the <em>combination </em>of impairments Burnam possessed. <em>See Gagnon </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>666 F.2d 662 (1st Cir.1981). Because the administrative law judge failed to consider Burnam\u2019s physical and mental condition as a whole, the Secretary\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 457-58. The ALJ here did not follow the teachings of <em>Burnam. </em>The closest that he came was in observing that Dr. Spergel had considered the combined effect of appellant\u2019s physical and mental impairments and in ultimately concluding that appellant could perform sedentary work. But even these statements are in derogation of <em>Burnam\u2019s </em>requirement that the <em>AU </em>(rather than the Secretary\u2019s witness) consider the claimant\u2019s physical and mental condition as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">Moreover, I note that appellant\u2019s profile fits almost four-square into a grid guideline that would <em>mandate </em>a finding of disability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Like the person in the example set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> appellant (who was 34 years old at the time of the 1980 administrative hearing) cannot perform a full range of sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The majority affirms the Secretary by the exercise of extreme deference, in apparent reliance upon what can be described only as colorable compliance with the obligations that this Court has imposed upon administrative law judges in Social Security disability cases. As I read the record, including the opinions of the ALJ and the Appeals Council, this colorable compliance masks an infidelity on the part of the ALJ and the Appeals Council to the demands of their respective roles at the <em>de novo </em>hearing and on review \u2014 the demand that they give meaningful and critical consideration to evidence, resolve serious conflicts in the evidence, and correctly apply the law. I do not go so far as to suggest that summary judgment should have been granted for appellant. In view of the considerations set forth above, however, I would vacate the judgment and remand the matter to the Secretary for resolution of the glaring inconsistencies in the record, for proper application of the grids, and for consideration of evidence improperly ignored, including Dr. Schmidt\u2019s latest report.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\">. The Secretary contends that Dr. Spergel\u2019s finding of \u201ctransferable skills\u201d does not conflict with the AU\u2019s finding because a \u201cfair reading\u201d of Dr. Spergel\u2019s report demonstrates that he is using the phrase \u201ctransferable skills\u201d to refer to skills retained despite appellant\u2019s impairments rather than to skills acquired and retained from past work activities. 1 find this attempted distinction unconvincing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\">. Nor has the Secretary addressed the conflict in Dr. Spergel\u2019s assertions (1) that \u201cSEPTA [public transportation] is available and is approximately 15 minutes from [appellant\u2019s] home,\u201d and (2) (on the very next page of the report) that \u201cMr. Olson [sic] is able to walk for two city blocks and then notes a burning sensation in his right leg. When this occurs, he must stop to rest.\u201d This conflict relates directly to the question whether appellant could maintain employment at any of the twelve jobs listed by Dr. Spergel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-7\">. \u201cSedentary\u201d and \u201clight\u201d work are terms of art, defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567. \u201cSedentary work\u201d involves \u201clifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1567(a). \u201cLight work,\u201d by contrast, \u201cinvolves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1567(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b827-13\">. Nor has the Secretary even begun to evaluate the impact upon employability of the condition known as arachnoiditis (inflammation of the spinal cord), from which appellant concededly suffers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b828-9\">. The majority suggests that, because the ALJ stated that he had considered \u201call the testimony given at the hearing and documents contained in the exhibit file,\u201d he was not \u201cdirected\u201d with regard to the effect of the regulations. With all respect, I believe that the ALJ\u2019s language speaks for itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\">. Section 201.00 (in 20 C.F.R.), which introduces Table No. 1 (containing criteria for determining disability), provides, in subsection (h), examples of individuals whose particular characteristics do not specifically meet any of the rules in Appendix 2 and for whom Table No. 1 is therefore not conclusive on the question of disability. Example 2 describes:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">An illiterate 41 year old individual with mild mental retardation (IQ of 78) is restricted to unskilled sedentary work and cannot perform vocationally relevant past work, which had consisted of unskilled agricultural field work; his or her particular characteristics do not specifically meet any of the rules in Appendix 2, because this individual cannot perform the full range of work defined as sedentary. In light of the adverse factors which further narrow the range of sedentary work for which this individual is qualified, a finding of disabled is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
