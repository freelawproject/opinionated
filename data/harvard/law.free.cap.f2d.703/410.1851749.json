(Raley\u2019s), seeks review of a Decision and Order of the National-Labor Relations Board (Board) issued June 29, 1981 under National Labor Relations Act \u00a7 10(f), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f) (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board found that Raley\u2019s had engaged in several unfair labor practices under sections 8(a)(1) and (2) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (2) (1976). These findings were based on Raley\u2019s conduct in the period preceding a 1979 representation election between the incumbent Independent Drug Clerks Association (IDCA) and the Retail Clerks Union (Retail Clerks). The Board ordered Raley\u2019s to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices and to post notices to that effect. The election was set aside, and an order directing a second election was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">We affirm all the unfair labor practice findings except the conclusion that Raley\u2019s violated section 8(a)(1) and (2) of the Act by announcing the existence of lawfully granted benefits in order to influence the election. We reverse this finding on the basis of the employer\u2019s free speech rights guaranteed by \u00a7 8(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (c) (1976), reverse the order of the associated remedial measures, and remand the election order to the Board for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">After considering the record as a whole, we accept the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s findings of fact (adopted by the Board) as being supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1976); <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 485, 71 S.Ct. 456, 463, 95 L.Ed. 456, 466 (1951). Because the Board and the Administrative Law Judge have provided an extensive discussion of the complex facts in this case, and because we summarily affirm most of the Board\u2019s conclusions, we repeat only the basic facts and those relevant to the issues that are discussed in detail in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">Raley\u2019s is engaged in the retail sale of food, drugs, and related products throughout Northern California. Since 1964, all its drugstore and Drug Center employees have been represented by the IDCA, which was certified in an election conducted by the Board. During its tenure, the IDCA has negotiated successive collective bargaining agreements, the most recent of which was in effect at all times relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">In April, 1979, various Retail Clerk locals began a campaign to organize Raley\u2019s Drug Center and drugstore employees and to oust the incumbent IDCA. Raley\u2019s has officially maintained a neutral posture between the two unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-17\">In June or July of 1979, Kay Sordillo, Secretary-Treasurer of the IDCA, called James Teel, Vice-President of Raley\u2019s, and requested that Raley\u2019s send an insurance representative to the stores to explain increased health and welfare benefits to the employees. Sordillo had received a number of questions from employees regarding their benefits, and it appeared that many of them were unaware of the precise nature and extent of those benefits. Teel contacted company counsel and then advised Sordillo that Raley\u2019s could explain its benefits but could not campaign on either union\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>In late April, 1979, Raley\u2019s granted increased health and welfare benefits to its California employees who were represented by the IDCA. Raley\u2019s Nevada employees, who were represented by the Retail Clerks, had been granted additional benefits in early April. The California employees received their benefits pursuant to a 1977 agreement between the IDCA and Raley\u2019s that guaranteed IDCA-represented employees any benefits granted to the Nevada workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In late July and early August, before the August 16 election, meetings were held at most of Raley\u2019s retail stores in order to explain the health and welfare benefits to the employees. Sordillo and Robert Gilbert, the insurance carrier\u2019s representative, were present at each of these meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The IDCA secured 106 of the 193 votes cast in the election, enough to maintain its representation. The Retail Clerks filed three cases with the NLRB charging that Raley\u2019s had committed unfair labor practices in connection with the election. After hearing a great deal of conflicting testimony, the Administrative Law Judge issued a Decision and Order that was adopted by the Board on June 29, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The Board reached the following conclusions regarding the unfair labor practice charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">1) By unlawfully interrogating employees about their union membership sympathies and activities, Respondent Raley\u2019s has violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1976).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">2) By threatening employees with discharge or discipline if they spoke to representatives of the Retail Clerks on company time while allowing representatives of the IDCA to freely campaign among the employees in all areas of the stores, Respondent Raley\u2019s has violated Section 8(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (2) (1976).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">3) By unlawfully announcing the granting of increased health and welfare benefits in order to induce the employees to select the incumbent IDCA as their bargaining representative and to discourage employee support for the Retail Clerks, Respondent Raley\u2019s violated Section 8(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (2) (1976).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">4) By removing campaign literature of the Retail Clerks from the employees\u2019 bulletin board while allowing literature from the incumbent IDCA to remain posted, the Respondent has violated Section 8(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (2) (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">Raley\u2019s was ordered to cease and desist from those practices and to take certain affirmative actions designed to effectuate the policies of the Act. The Board also directed that the August, 1979 representation election between the Retail Clerks Union and the IDCA be set aside and a new one be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">This case presents three issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-17\">I. Was there substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s unfair labor practice findings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-18\">II. May an employer violate Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by announcing and explaining lawfully granted benefits in order to influence an election?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-19\">III. What is the proper disposition of the election order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-20\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-21\">This section will consider the unfair labor practice issues, and will then address the question of the election order.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-22\">I. <em>The Unfair Labor Practice Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">The substantial evidence standard governs our review of the Board\u2019s finding of an unfair labor practice. We must affirm the Board\u2019s conclusions as to whether various unfair labor practices were committed if such a conclusion is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>NLRB v. Max Factor &amp; Co., </em>640 F.2d 197, 204 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 983, 101 S.Ct. 2314, 68 L.Ed.2d 840 (1981); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Prineville Stud Co., </em>578 F.2d 1292, 1296 (9th Cir.1978); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>see NLRB </em>v. <em>Mercy Peninsula Ambulance Service, Inc., </em>589 F.2d 1014, 1019 n. 8 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We summarily affirm all the Board\u2019s unfair labor practice findings except the one that Raley\u2019s violated section 8(a)(1) by announcing new health and welfare benefits in order to influence the outcome of the election. Although we accept for purposes of this analysis the Board\u2019s conclusion that Raley\u2019s timed the employee meetings regarding increased benefits so as to influence the voting, we reverse the finding of a violation of the Act because the announcement and explanation of lawfully granted benefits is a protected activity under section 8(c) of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Section 8(a)(1) of the Act makes it an unfair labor practice \u201cto interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7,\u201d which entitles employees to choose their own representatives. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158(a)(1) (1976). Section 8(c) affirms an employer\u2019s right to express \u201cany views, argument, or opinion\u201d without violating section 8(a)(1) as long as such expression contains \u201cno threat .of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (c) (1976); <em>see NLRB v. Four Winds Industries, </em>530 F.2d 75 (9th Cir.1976); <em>NLRB v. Raytheon Co., </em>445 F.2d 272 (9th Cir.1971). In <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), the Supreme Court established that \u201can employer is free to communicate to his employees any of his general views about unionism or any of his specific views about a particular union, so long as the communications do not contain a \u2018threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u2019 \u201d 395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. at 1942, 23 L.Ed.2d at 580 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c)). An employer\u2019s free speech rights apply in an election between two unions as in an organizational election. <em>See AFL v. NLRB, </em>308 U.S. 401, 411 n. 4, 60 S.Ct. 300, 305 n. 4, 84 L.Ed. 347, 353 n. 4 (1940). This court has stated that \u201cunfair labor practices predicated on speech must be scrutinized carefully and unless the speech is coercive \u2014 i.e. contains threats or promises \u2014 it is privileged.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Marine World USA, </em>611 F.2d 1274, 1277 (9th Cir.1980). An employer may attempt to influence the outcome of an election by presenting facts and even making predictions based on fact, as long as the employer avoids using its influence to interfere with employee rights of free association. <em>Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. at 1942, 23 L.Ed.2d at 580-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">An employer\u2019s preelection expression will always be closely scrutinized, because an employee\u2019s economic dependence on his employer increases the possibility of coercion or undue influence from otherwise innocuous statements. 395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. at 1942, 23 L.Ed.2d at 580-81. An employer may not grant benefits in the period preceding a union election in order to influence the outcome of that election. <em>NLRB v. Exchange Parts Co., </em>375 U.S. 405, 409, 84 S.Ct. 457, 460, 11 L.Ed.2d 435, 438-39 (1964). The question for the Board is whether the benefits were granted at that time \u201cin the normal course of business ..., or outside the normal course of business in an attempt to influence the outcome of the election.\u201d <em>Pedro\u2019s, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>652 F.2d 1005, 1008 (D.C. Cir.1981). <em>See Free-Flow Packaging Corp. v. NLRB, </em>566 F.2d 1124, 1129 (9th Cir.1978) (test is whether grant or denial of benefits conforms to \u201cstatus quo\u201d). The Board has recognized that Raley\u2019s did not grant increased benefits in order to influence an impending election. The insurance benefits were increased automatically as a consequence of an agreement made two years before to match the benefits given to the Nevada employees. The Board therefore found that Raley\u2019s did not violate section 8(a)(1) by granting the increased benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">The unfair labor practice finding in question was limited to Raley\u2019s communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>tive activities. We are thus presented with the bald question whether an employer can violate section 8(a)(1) by announcing and explaining lawfully granted benefits in order to influence an election. The Board argues that many cases have condemned the announcement of benefits in order to influence an election. But in the cases the Board relies on, \u201cannouncement\u201d invariably refers to cases where the grant and the announcement occurred together in the preelection period. For example, in <em>NLRB v. Styletek, Division of Pandel-Bradford, Inc., </em>520 F.2d 275 (1st Cir.1975), the court enforced an order based on violations of section 8(a)(1) in the announcement of wage increases two weeks before a union election. The court stated that \u201cthe Board is under no duty to permit [wage increases and associated benefits] to be husbanded until right before an election and sprung on the employees in a manner calculated to influence the employees\u2019 choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280. But there the benefits were granted and announced in a single stroke: the notice of wage benefits stated that the new wages would be reflected in the next pay checks. The Board had no reason in the <em>Styletek </em>case to analyze the announcement and the conferral of benefits separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Similarly, <em>J.P. Stevens &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>461 F.2d 490 (4th Cir.1972), enforced a Board order based on a finding that the employer violated section 8(a)(1) \u201cby <em>announcing </em>... the establishment, of an additional paid holiday two days before a scheduled Board election . ... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491. But the announcement in that case was obviously closely connected with the illegal decision to grant the benefit: the NLRB had upheld the announcement of a wage increase on the same occasion, where the wage increase was part of an industry-wide wage movement. <em>Id. </em>at 492; <em>see NLRB v. Carilli, </em>648 F.2d 1206 (9th Cir.1981) (implementation of new medical and dental insurance program during decertification procedures); <em>NLRB v. Miller Redwood Co., </em>407 F.2d 1366 (9th Cir.1969) (promises and grants of economic benefits during union organizational campaign).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">This court has previously overturned an unfair labor practice finding based on the mere communication of increased benefits. <em>NLRB v. Tommy\u2019s Spanish Foods, Inc., </em>463 F.2d 116 (9th Cir.1972) addressed a Board order that rested in part on a finding that the employer had unlawfully announced before an election that it was considering improving insurance benefits. The decision denied enforcement to that part of the order, quoting a Board member\u2019s dissenting opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">Just as an employer is free to rehearse for employees the benefits which they have previously received from the employer without a union, in order that they may evaluate the employer\u2019s past performance, so should an employer be permitted to notify employees of efforts in progress to improve the lot of the employees. Since it is uncontradicted that the Respondent\u2019s initial effort in the matter of increasing insurance predated the Union\u2019s appearance on the scene and, accordingly, cannot be characterized as simply a stratagem in response to the threat of unionism, I would find that Respondent\u2019s announcement of the contemplated insurance increase was permitted under Section 8(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\"><em>Tommy\u2019s </em>properly applied the rule that an employer\u2019s speech is protected under section 8(c) unless it contains threats or promises. The present case even more clearly falls under the protection of section 8(c), because Raley\u2019s announced benefits that were in place at the time. Such an announcement could not be a promise or a threat, because it refers only to benefits granted in the past. We therefore follow <em>Tommy\u2019s Spanish Foods </em>in holding that an employer\u2019s true statement about lawfully granted benefits is protected under section 8(c) and the rule in <em>Gissel Packing Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">II. <em>The Election Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">This court has jurisdiction to review an election order when, as in this case, that order is based entirely on unfair labor practice findings that are also on review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>Anja Engineering Corp. v. NLRB, </em>685 F.2d 292, 297 (9th Cir.1982). The Board here based its decision to order an election on all four of the unfair labor practice findings. Because we reverse one of those findings, we must remand the election order to the Board for reconsideration in light of the remaining unfair labor practice findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Section 8(c) protects the company\u2019s announcement of the increased health and welfare benefits. Therefore, the Board incorrectly found that this announcement violated section 8(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. We accordingly reject the unfair labor practice finding based on the Board\u2019s third charge, and accept the unfair labor practice findings on the first, second, and fourth charges. We enforce the order only insofar as it relates to the latter findings, and remand the election order to the Board for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">ENFORCEMENT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; ORDER REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-11\">. The Board\u2019s Decision, Order, and Direction of Second Election is reported at 256 N.L.R.B. 946 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\">. We note that, although the Board chose the word \u201cannouncement\u201d to describe the company\u2019s activity, the evidence indicates that the employee meetings in question were not the first time the fact of an increase in benefits was revealed to any employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\">. We would not take jurisdiction over the election order but for the decision in <em>Anja. </em>The Supreme Court has firmly established that an order directing an election in a representation proceeding is not a final order under \u00a7 10(f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f), and hence is not directly reviewable in the Court of Appeals. <em>Boire v. Greyhound Corp., </em>376 U.S. 473, 478-79, 84 S.Ct. 894, 897-98, 11 L.Ed.2d 849, 853-54 (1964); <em>AFL v. NLRB, </em>308 U.S. 401, 409-12, 60 S.Ct. 300, 304-06, 84 L.Ed. 347, 352-54 (1940); <em>NLRB v. Falk Corp., </em>308 U.S. 453, 458-59, 60 S.Ct. 307, 310-11, 84 L.Ed. 396, 398-99 (1940); <em>Associated Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>564 F.2d 271, 274-79 (9th Cir.1977); <em>accord, Charlie Rossie Ford, Inc. v. Price, </em>564 F.2d 372, 373 (9th Cir.1977). The statute provides for an indirect method of review of election orders: an employer who opposes the election order can refuse to bargain with the union that wins the election, and the election order is then reviewable under section 9(d) of the Act in a proceeding on the unfair labor practice charge of refusal to bargain. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(d) (1976); <em>see Boire v. Greyhound Corp., </em>376 U.S. 473, 476-77, 84 S.Ct. 894, 896, 11 L.Ed.2d 849, 852-53 (1964). <em>Anja\u2019s </em>exception to the rule of nonreviewability conflicts with decisions in five other Circuits and is contrary to dictum in this Circuit. <em>Graham Architectural Prods.
