Platt, <em>Judge, </em>adjudging her to be in contempt of court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a) (1976) for her refusal to give truthful and nonevasive answers to questions posed by a federal grand jury after being ordered to do so by the court, and ordering her imprisoned for so long as her refusal shall continue. Appellant chailenges the contempt order principally on the grounds that (1) \u00a7 1826(a) authorizes a contempt adjudication only with respect to witnesses who completely refuse to answer and not witnesses whose answers are \u201carguably evasive,\u201d and (2) the government failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Weiss\u2019s answers constituted deliberate refusals to answer. For the reasons below, we conclude that the adjudication of civil contempt should be reversed on the latter ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">The present appeal arises in the context of an ongoing grand jury investigation into suspected fraud by various individuals in the conduct of an operation called \u201cProject Joint,\u201d a project that obtained funds under the Comprehensive Employment Training Act (\u201cCETA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-999 (Supp. V 1981). The grand jury is inquiring into the possibility that Project Joint falsely claimed to have trained approximately 120 students between January 1977 and June 1978 when in fact it had trained none, and had obtained, by means of false documentation approximately one million dollars in federal moneys for the training of such nonexistent students. Weiss, the only person listed in Project Joint\u2019s books as a counselor from January 1977 through June 1978, was summoned to testify before the grand jury. On November 2, 1982, the district court signed an order granting her immunity from prosecution on the basis of her testimony. Weiss was not, however, immunized against prosecution for perjury, obstruction of justice, or any other crime stemming from untruthful testimony before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-16\">From the outset Weiss\u2019s testimony was less than enlightening. Weiss testified that she had worked for Project Joint, but when asked what kind of program Project Joint was, she stated, after conferring with her counsel outside the grand jury room, that since she was not an officer or administrator of the program she \u201creally couldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>speak for it.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (11/3/82 Tr. at 5.) Weiss stated that she could speak only in terms of what she did for Project Joint. Even this information, however, proved to be elusive. For example, although Weiss testified that she did \u201ccounseling,\u201d which involved \u201c[j]ob placement if I remember correctly\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 18), she stated that she did not remember the ages of the persons she counseled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">A ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">... [Cjounseling encompassed everything. It encompassed talking to students, it encompassed talking to parents, it encompassed finding placements. That is what I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">Q And for students of what kind of institution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">A I really worked in \u2014 I would like to see my counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">(Witness exits Grand Jury room.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">(Witness enters Grand Jury room.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">THE FOREMAN: We have a quorum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-12\">Q What is the answer to the last question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-13\">A I understand it was a school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-14\">Q For what age students?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-15\">A I would like to confer' with my counsel, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-16\">(Witness exits Grand Jury room.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-17\">(Witness enters Grand Jury room.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-18\">Q Do you know the answer to the last question, Ms. Weiss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-19\">A The best of my recollection, all ages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-20\">Q Seven and eight year olds were students at Project Joint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-21\">A You asked me how many people there were \u2014 what ages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-22\">Q Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-23\">A That were in a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-24\">Q I asked at Project Joint that you were counseling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-25\">A I am sorry. I misunderstood your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-26\">To my best recollection, I would remember adolescents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-31\">Q You mean children between the ages of 14 and 18 years old?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-32\">A It would really be hard for me to remember. I really don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-33\">Q You do not recollect that Project Joint was for adults and, in fact, only received money to train adults?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-34\">A I worked with adults and I worked with children. I worked with adolescents, these that had\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-35\">Q At Project Joint you worked with adolescents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-36\">A I counseled people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-37\">Q You counseled adolescents who were enrolled as Project Joint, is that your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-38\">A I would like to meet with my counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-39\">(Witness exits Grand Jury room.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-40\">(Witness returns to Grand Jury room.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-41\">Q What were the ages of your counselees at Project Joint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-42\">A I have seen a lot of people in all the years that I have counseled, and truthfully, it is very hard for me to decipher exactly which years I saw whom and what.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-43\">Q So it is your testimony you do not recall the ages of your cou[n]selees at Project Joint; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-44\">A Yeah....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-45\"><em>(Id. </em>at 14-17.) Nor could Weiss remember what she did to help the students find jobs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-46\">Q How long was the school term or training term for enrollees at Project Joint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-47\">A I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-48\">Q What were your duties as a counselor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-49\">A It\u2019s hard to remember specifically. Basically I saw people for many different reasons. They ranged from personal to placement \u2014 it\u2019s very hard for me to remember specifically what I did at that specific time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-50\">Basically, I did counseling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Q What did you counsel? You say placement, what did you do with the students with regard to placement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">A ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">There were all sorts of things. There were people looking for positions which I helped them find.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">Q What kind of positions were they looking for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">A I don\u2019t remember specifically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">Q ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">Did that entail calling prospective employers on behalf of the students?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">A I don\u2019t remember. This is the job in a nutshell, but I don\u2019t remember exactly what I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">Q Did that entail taking information from students about what their curriculum had been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">A I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">Q Did that entail testing of any sort with regard to their proficiency in some vocation or craft?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-14\">A It might have, but I don\u2019t specifically remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-28\">Q Did you have a list of employers who might potentially employ the students of the Project Joint Program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-29\">A I might have, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">(11/10/82 Tr. at 16-17.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-30\">Weiss also testified that she could not remember, <em>inter alia, </em>whether she had anyone working under her at Project Joint, whether there were other counselors, what size her office was, whether she shared that office with anyone else, or whether she kept any records of information obtained from her counselees. She did \u201cnot now\u201d recognize the completed Project Joint forms shown her, and stated that she could not say whether any of the handwriting or printing in which information had been filled in was done by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-31\">Although Weiss testified, after conferring with counsel, that her job at Project Joint was a full time job \u201c[t]o the best of [her] recollection,\u201d (11/3/82 Tr. at 33-34; <em>see also </em>11/10/82 Tr. at 24), she could not recall what her hours were, what she was paid, whether she was paid by the hour, what the address of Project Joint was, what her own home address was at the time, or the period during which she held the job.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>She would not say unequivocally even whether at the time she worked for Project Joint she was also finishing her college education.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Weiss, who was 34 years old at the time she first testified, was asked whether she had ever been hospitalized for mental illness, whether surgery she had undergone had impaired her mental functioning, whether she had suffered any physical trauma that would have affected her memory, and whether she was currently taking any mood-altering medication. She responded in the negative to each question. Weiss attributed her lack of memory with respect to Project Joint to the facts that she had had two other jobs since working for Project Joint, had counseled a large number of people, and her memories had fused; that she had been ill in the interim and had had personal problems that occupied her mind; and that her job had not been memorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">As some of the above transcript excerpts indicate, Weiss\u2019s testimony was profusely punctuated by her departures from the grand jury room to confer with her counsel. During her first appearance before the grand jury, for example, there was one forty-seven-minute period during which Weiss exited to confer with counsel seventeen times. The lengths of these conferences ranged from one to seven minutes. During this forty-seven minute stretch only thirty-one questions were put to Weiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">Weiss appeared before the grand jury four times. On November 24, 1982, after the third appearance, the government moved pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a) to have Weiss, along with one Rivka Feder, another witness called to testify with respect to Project Joint, held in civil contempt for giving evasive answers. A hearing was held on December 2, 1982, and the government indicated by checkmarks on the grand jury transcripts what answers it considered contumacious. After argument by counsel for Feder, the court instructed counsel for both witnesses to confer with the witnesses to determine whether their recollections could be refreshed and whether they would commence to cooperate with, rather than obstruct, the grand jury. Following that conference, the court directed Weiss</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOB\">to return to the Grand Jury and answer these questions that were posed to her, that have been checked off by the Government, with something other than \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-16\">(12/2/82 Tr. at 5.) After further colloquy, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-17\">THE COURT: I\u2019ve told the prosecutor to go back and ask these questions again, and I want a bona-fide attempt, and every indication of a bona-fide attempt that, A, she has gone through everything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>and searched out every possible source to answer these questions, and if she has no means in finding out the answers, if she explains it satisfactorily to the Grand Jury, they may or may not accept it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a lot more acceptable to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">MR. HEINEMANN: I only wish to clarify one thing, your Honor has suggested, and this was in the earlier argument, at least the portion of which I was present for, that your Honor believes that it is an obligation of the witness to search out means of refreshing her own recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">THE COURT: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\"><em>(Id. </em>at 8-9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Weiss returned to the grand jury on January 26, 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having originally characterized her counselees as students, Weiss now had difficulty answering questions calling them students or describing them as having \u201cparticipated\u201d in the program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">Q Now with regard to your duties as a counselor at Project Joint, did you actually see students who were participating in the program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">A I would like to speak to my attorney, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">Q It is now 3:41.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">You may be excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">(Witness leaves grand jury room and returns.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-14\">MS. NORDENBROOK: The witness has been out of the grand jury room for four minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-15\">THE FOREPERSON: I would remind you that you are still under oath; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-16\">THE WITNESS: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-17\">I saw people, but I don\u2019t know if students is the correct term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-18\">Q Were the people that you saw participating in the Project Joint program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-19\">A Let me speak to my attorney, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-21\">Q It is now 3:47. You may be excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-22\">(Witness leaves grand jury room and returns.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-24\">A I don\u2019t know if participation is the exact words. I don\u2019t remember the exact terms used, but most probably they were trainees or counselees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-25\">Q Were these trainees or counselees involved in the Project Joint program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-26\">A May I speak to counsel, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-27\">Q I would request that before you leave the grand jury room that the notes that you have before you remain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-28\">A Can I take this out with me now (indicating)? I just wrote the question out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-29\">A Yes, but you should return with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-30\">(Witness leaves grand jury room and returns.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-32\">A The answer to that is yes. Counsel instructed me to leave the notes outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-33\">(Ms. Nordenbrook leaves grand jury room and returns.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-34\">Q Can you name one trainee or counselee that you saw in that two and a half years that you worked at Project Joint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-35\">A I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-36\">Q You cannot name one trainee or counselee; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-37\">A I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-38\">Q Just to repeat my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-39\">What is the name of one counselee or trainee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-40\">A I would like to speak to my attorney, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-41\">Q You may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-42\">(Witness leaves grand jury room.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-43\">(Witness returns to grand jury room.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-44\">BY MS. NORDENBROOK: (continued)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-45\">Q Please let the record indicate that the witness has been gone from the grand jury room for nine minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-46\">A I answered your question to the best of my ability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Counsel has advised me that I have already answered your question, that it is improper for you to repeat your question to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">(1/26/83 Tr. at 3-6.) Immediately after this colloquy, when the Assistant United States Attorney informed Weiss that she was not permitted to record the grand jury\u2019s questions and take them out of the room to confer with her attorney, Weiss again conferred with counsel. Upon her return she refused to testify further under such a restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The government immediately renewed its application to have Weiss held in contempt. It took the position that the court had held the required hearing on December 2, 1982, and had at that time given Weiss the opportunity to purge herself of the contempt and that no further hearing was required. The court instructed the parties to appear the next morning, January 27, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">On January 27, the court, after hearing argument from counsel, held Weiss in contempt. With respect to Weiss\u2019s first appearance before the grand jury, on November 3,1982, the court found that Weiss had given 25 evasive answers and had claimed 19 failures of recollection. With respect to her second appearance, on November 10, the court found 27 additional evasive answers and 34 additional failures of recollection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court found that Weiss\u2019s responses followed a pattern that revealed their falsehood:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">After reading these Grand Jury minutes, I find that there was a pattern of conduct, of inability to remember and/or evasive answers as to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">One, the people she counselled \u2014 if any \u2014 as part of her work for Project Joint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">Two, what she counselled such persons about;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">Three, the names of any counselees and the ages of any counselles \u2014 parenthetically she was asked what ages, and she answered: Adolescents, and when it was pointed out that Federal funds are not to be used for that purpose, she switched to adults and then she couldn\u2019t remember what ages they were;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-14\">Four, the names of the persons with whom she worked in her office;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-15\">Five, the forms she completed or was required to complete;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-16\">Six, recognition of her printing or handwriting on documents bearing her name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-17\">Seven, the names and numbers of other counselors doing similar work to which she was doing or allegedly doing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-18\">Eight, any kind of a description of her duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-19\">Nine, any hours that she worked, the dates of her employment, and even the address at which her office was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-20\">The testimony that I read this morning in the November 24, 1982, and January 26, 1983 sessions, was a compounding of that pattern, to the point where she couldn\u2019t answer anything without running outside and talking to her counsel for some protracted period of time and the total effect is one of utter incredibility, utter falsehood and utter contempt for the Grand Jury and its processes, and indeed utter contempt for this Court, who has given her, Ms. Weiss, more than sufficient time in which to go before the Grand Jury and answer the questions put to her in a truthful manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-21\">(1/27/83 Tr. at 20-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-22\">Accordingly, the court sentenced Weiss as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-23\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-24\">Having held Ms. Weiss in contempt, I will sentence her to a period of six months in jail, or the duration \u2014 or the termination date of this Grand Jury, whichever occurs first, and I will tell Ms. Weiss that she holds the key to her release, by merely communicating with Ms. Nordenbrook that she is prepared to answer the questions fully and truthfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>that were put to her, which I don\u2019t believe has been done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><em>(Id. </em>at 32-33.) As to Weiss\u2019s ability to secure her release by recanting her prior refusals to give responsive answers, the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">THE COURT: ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">The recantation will not be deemed satisfactory, if after every question, or even after every tenth question, she insists upon running out and talking to her counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">She is going to go in there and give an accurate and correct statement of the truth without running in and out, because if she is going to run in and out, and have her counsel feed her answers that are evasive, and contemptuous, she might as well forget it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-8\"><em>(Id. </em>at 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">This appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Weiss contends principally that the contempt adjudication was beyond the court\u2019s power under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a), and that her contempt was not proven by clear and convincing evidence. We reject the former argument but find a certain merit in the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">II. APPLICABILITY OF \u00a7 1826(a) TO EVASIVE ANSWERS</p>\n<p id=\"AHJ\">Entitled \u201cRecalcitrant Witnesses,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">(a) Whenever a witness in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States refuses without just cause shown to comply with an order of the court to testify or provide other information, including any book, paper, document, record, recording or other material, the court, upon such refusal, or when such refusal is duly brought to its attention, may summarily order his confinement at a suitable place until such time as the witness is willing to give such testimony or provide such information. No period of such confinement shall exceed the life of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-14\">(1) the court proceeding, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-15\">(2) the term of the grand jury, including extensions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-16\">before which such refusal to comply with the court order occurred, but in no event shall such confinement exceed eighteen months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-17\">Weiss contends that, as a matter of law, a court has no power under \u00a7 1826(a) to hold in contempt as a recalcitrant witness a person who does not refuse outright to answer the grand jury\u2019s questions but rather gives answers that the court concludes are false or evasive. Given the traditional powers of the court to deal with obdurate witnesses and the types of conduct that historically have prompted the exercise of its contempt powers, we conclude that \u00a7 1826(a) reaches refusals to answer disguised as evasive responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-18\">A. <em>Sanctions for Contempt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-19\">Acts of willful disobedience to clear and unambiguous orders of the court constitute contempt of court. <em>Gompers v. Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., </em>221 U.S. 418, 441, 31 S.Ct. 492, 498, 55 L.Ed. 797 (1911). It is fundamental that the court has the power to deal with such disobedience in ways designed either to punish or to compel compliance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-20\">\u201cThe power to punish for contempts is inherent in all courts; its existence is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings, and to the enforcement of the judgments, orders and writs of the courts, .... \u201d <em>[Ex parte. Robinson, </em>86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 505, 510, 22 L.Ed. 205 (1873)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-21\">\u201cThe exercise of this power has a twofold aspect, namely: first, the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>punishment of the guilty party for his disrespect to the court or its order, and the second, to compel his performance of some act or duty required of him by the court, which he refuses to perform.\u201d <em>[In re Chiles, </em>89 U.S. (22 Wall.) 157, 168, 22 L.Ed. 819 (1874)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\"><em>Bessette v. W.B. Conkey Co., </em>194 U.S. 324, 327, 24 S.Ct. 665, 666, 48 L.Ed. 997 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">If the disobedient behavior is conduct of a continuing nature which the contemnor has the power to terminate, the court may choose to hold the contemnor in civil contempt and impose a sanction that is designed to coerce the contemnor to terminate his contumacious conduct. <em>E.g., Shillitani v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 364, 368, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 1534, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966). The sanction generally takes the form of a jail term or a monetary fine; but it is not intended to be punitive, and the court\u2019s order will normally provide that the imprisonment or fine is to end as soon as the contemnor ends his contumacious behavior. <em>See, e.g., id.; Gompers v. Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., supra, </em>221 U.S. at 441-42, 31 S.Ct. at 498; <em>In re Irving, </em>600 F.2d 1027, 1037 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 866, 100 S.Ct. 137, 62 L.Ed.2d 89 (1979); <em>In re Nevitt, </em>117 F. 448, 461 (8th Cir.1902) (civil contemnors \u201care imprisoned only until they comply with the orders of the court .... They carry the keys of their prison in their own pockets.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">If the court seeks to punish the contemnor for his past contumacy, it may treat the conduct as criminal contempt and impose a jail term or a monetary fine as vindication of the court\u2019s authority. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 (1976) (a federal court \u201cshall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, ... (3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\u201d). Since the sanction imposed following an adjudication of criminal contempt is designed to punish rather than to coerce obedience in the future, the court\u2019s order does not permit the contemnor to terminate the punishment by ending his contumacious behavior. <em>See Gompers v. Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., supra, </em>221 U.S. at 441-43, 31 S.Ct. at 498-99; <em>In re Irving, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Many forms of disobedience may be dealt with either as acts of civil contempt, or as acts of criminal contempt, or as both. <em>United States v. United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 299, 67 S.Ct. 677, 698, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947) (same \u201cconduct can amount to both civil and criminal contempt\u201d); <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>W.B. Conkey Co., supra, </em>194 U.S. at 329, 24 S.Ct. at 667 (\u201cIt may not be always easy to classify a particular act as belonging to either one of these two classes. It may partake of the characteristics of both.\u201d). The difference between civil contempt and criminal contempt, assuming voluntary conduct of a continuing nature, resides, therefore, in the character of the court\u2019s sanction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">Contempts are neither wholly civil nor altogether criminal .... [W]hether the proceedings be civil or criminal, there must be an allegation that in contempt of court the defendant has disobeyed the order, and a prayer that he be attached and punished therefor. It is not the fact of punishment but rather its character and purpose that often serve to distinguish between the two classes of cases. If it is for civil contempt the punishment is remedial, and for the benefit of the complainant. But if it is for criminal contempt the sentence is punitive, to vindicate the authority of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-12\"><em>Gompers v. Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., supra, </em>221 U.S. at 441, 31 S.Ct. at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">The proceedings leading to adjudications of civil contempt and criminal contempt are not identical. Criminal con-tempts are governed by Fed.R.Crim.P. 42, which provides that if the contumacious conduct was not committed in the actual presence of the court, the alleged contemnor will be entitled to notice, a hearing, and, in certain instances, a jury trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>have held that proceedings in civil contempt too must be accorded some of the safeguards provided by Fed.R.Crim.P. 42, <em>see In re Sadin, </em>509 F.2d 1252, 1255 (2d Cir.1975), such as notice and an opportunity to prepare a defense, <em>In re Fula, </em>672 F.2d 279, 283 (2d Cir.1982); but the trial need not be by jury. In a criminal contempt proceeding, because criminal contempt \u201cis a crime in the ordinary sense; ... a violation of the law, a public wrong,\u201d <em>Bloom v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 201, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 1481, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968), and the sanction is designed to punish to a fixed degree, over which the contemnor is given no control, the government must establish its ease beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Michaelson v. United States ex rel. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Co., </em>266 U.S. 42, 66, 45 S.Ct. 18, 20, 69 L.Ed. 162 (1924); <em>In re Williams, </em>509 F.2d 949, 960 (2d Cir.1975). In a civil contempt proceeding the government need not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but because the sanction may deprive the contemnor of his liberty for some period, the government must prove its case by \u201c \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 proof of violation of a court decree; a bare preponderance of the evidence will not suffice.\u201d <em>Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx </em>v. <em>Alexander\u2019s Department Stores, </em>341 F.2d 101, 102 (2d Cir.1965); <em>In re Bongiorno, </em>694 F.2d 917, 922 (2d Cir.1982); <em>In re Battaglia, </em>653 F.2d 419, 423 (9th Cir.1981); <em>In re Irving, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">B. <em>Traditional Treatment of Testimonial Obduracy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Testimonial obduracy by a witness who has been ordered by the court to answer questions may take any of a number of forms. The witness may refuse categorically to answer. Or he may respond in a way that avoids providing information, as, for example, by denying memory of the events under inquiry, denying acquaintance with targets of the inquiry, or denying knowledge of facts sought to be elicited. Or he may purport to state informative facts in response to the questions while in fact testifying falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Any of these three forms of obduracy may be met with the imposition of one or more judicial or governmental sanctions. For example, when the witness has refused to answer questions, he may be adjudged in civil contempt and ordered to answer, <em>e.g., Shillitani v. United States, supra, </em>384 U.S. at 370, 86 S.Ct. at 1535;, <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation of Giancana, </em>352 F.2d 921 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 959, 86 S.Ct. 437, 15 L.Ed.2d 362 (1965); or he may be adjudged in criminal contempt and punished for his past failure to answer, <em>e.g., Brown v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 78 S.Ct. 622, 2 L.Ed.2d 589 (1958). In some cases both coercive and punitive sanctions have been imposed. <em>See, e.g., Yates v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 66, 74, 78 S.Ct. 128, 133, 2 L.Ed.2d 95 (1957); <em>United States v. Petito, </em>671 F.2d 68 (2d Cir.1982); <em>In re Irving, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">If the witness has responded falsely to the questions propounded, he may be subject to prosecution for a criminal offense in violation of, <em>e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (perjury), or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 (false declarations before grand jury or eourt). If the witness\u2019s false testimony has obstructed the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the performance of its duty, the witness may be met with sanctions for civil contempt, see <em>Ex parte Hudgings, </em>249 U.S. 378, 383, 39 S.Ct. 337, 339, 63 L.Ed. 656 (1919), or criminal contempt, <em>see In re Michael, </em>326 U.S. 224, 227-29, 66 S.Ct. 78, 79-80, 90 L.Ed. 30 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The middle category of testimonial obduracy, <em>i.e., </em>the witness\u2019s equivocal responses or disclaimers of knowledge or memory, has also been dealt with as contemptuous conduct, warranting sanctions that were coercive, punitive, or both. It has long been the practice of courts viewing such testimony as false and intentionally evasive, and as a sham or subterfuge that purposely avoids giving responsive answers, to ignore the form of the response and treat the witness as having refused to answer. <em>See, e.g., In re Schulman, </em>167 F. 237 (S.D.N.Y.1909), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>177 F. 191 (2d Cir.1910); <em>United States v. Appel, </em>211 F. 495 (S.D.N.Y.1913); <em>United States v. McGovern, </em>60 F.2d 880, 889 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>287 U.S. 650, 53 S.Ct. 96, 77 L.Ed. 561 (1932); <em>Schleier v. United States, </em>72 F.2d 414 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>293 U.S. 607, 55 S.Ct. 123, 79 L.Ed. 697 (1934); <em>In re Eskay, </em>122 F.2d 819 (3d Cir. 1941); <em>Howard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>182 F.2d 908 (8th Cir.), <em>vacated and remanded as moot, </em>340 U.S. 898, 71 S.Ct. 278, 95 L.Ed. 651 (1950); <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>273 F.2d 144 (8th Cir.1959); <em>Martin-Trigona v. Gouletas, </em>634 F.2d 354, 357-59 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1025, 101 S.Ct. 593, 66 L.Ed.2d 486 (1980); <em>In re Battaglia, supra, </em>653 F.2d at 422; <em>In re Bongiorno, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In <em>In re Schulman, </em>for example, the district court found that a bankrupt\u2019s repeated responses of \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d and \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d to questions concerning the disposition of his assets in the six months preceding his declaration of bankruptcy were disingenuous and evasive. The court thus construed the responses as refusals to answer and imposed a combination of civil and criminal contempt sanctions by ordering the witness imprisoned for six months, with the proviso that if the witness chose, after five days, to provide nonevasive answers, he would be released from prison. This Court affirmed, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">The testimony as it appears in the record evinces a deliberate purpose to conceal the truth and prevent the trustee from becoming possessed of facts which would lead to a recovery of the missing property. The witness was being asked regarding transactions directly within his knowledge and facts which he must have known. When, therefore, he answered repeatedly \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d it is obvious that he was deliberately withholding information to which the trustee was entitled. In effect his attitude was one of defiance. He did not affirmatively tell the referee that he refused to disclose the facts which would enable the trustee to follow the property, although these facts were well known to him, but his conduct produced the same result as if he had stated his purpose openly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">177 F. at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">In the often cited case of <em>United States v. Appel, </em>the court treated the witness\u2019s professed inability to recall how he had disposed of $940 withdrawn from a bank one week earlier as a refusal to answer. In imposing criminal contempt sanctions, Judge Learned Hand stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATex\">It is indeed impossible logically to distinguish between the case of a downright refusal to testify and that of evasion by obvious subterfuge and mere formal compliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">... If the witness\u2019 conduct shows beyond any doubt whatever that he is refusing to tell what he knows, he is in contempt of court. That conduct is, of course, beyond question when he flatly refuses to answer, but it may appear in other ways. A court, like any one else who is in earnest, ought not to be put off by transparent sham, and the mere fact that the witness gives some answer cannot be an absolute test. For instance, it could not be enough for a witness to say that he did not remember where he had slept the night before, if he was sane and sober, or that he could not tell whether he had been married more than a week. If a court is to have any power at all to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>compel an answer, it must surely have power to compel an answer which is not given to fob off inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">211 F. at 495-96. Similarly, in <em>United States v. McGovern, supra, </em>this Court upheld a criminal contempt adjudication against a witness who would not unequivocally state how he disposed of the proceeds of five checks payable to him in the total sum of $380,000:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">... [Pjlainly having resorted persistently to subterfuge and evasion, if not to deliberate falsifying, to prevent a disclosure of what knowledge he had and was asked to give, he was guilty of obstructing the grand jury in performing its duties, and was properly held in contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">60 F.2d at 890.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">In <em>Howard v. United States, supra, </em>the district court ruled that a witness who had given false and evasive testimony before a grand jury as to the source of $18,000 deposited in her bank accounts during a six-year period, had been \u201c \u2018obstructive, evasive, perjurious and contumacious, and that she [had been and was] deliberately, willfully, and contumaciously obstructing the investigation of\u2019 \u201d the grand jury. 182 F.2d at 912 (quoting district court\u2019s findings). The court held the witness in civil contempt, ordering that she be imprisoned until she testified truthfully and nonevasively. The court of appeals affirmed, stating that \u201c[i]f the appellant\u2019s conduct constituted contempt, we think it is not important whether it was treated as a civil or a criminal contempt or as both,\u201d 182 F.2d at 914; \u201ca District Court has power to deal summarily with a witness before a Grand Jury who is guilty of a patent evasion equivalent to a refusal to give any material information,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">A majority of the above cases involved rulings that the evasive witness was guilty of criminal contempt and the impositions of punitive sanctions, and Weiss seeks to deny their relevance on that basis. This is an astigmatic view which misperceives the focus of our inquiry. In considering whether a witness\u2019s obduracy may be considered a refusal to answer, and hence \u201crecalcitrance\u201d under \u00a7 1826(a), or must instead be dealt with in a proceeding in criminal contempt or a prosecution for perjury or obstruction of justice, we must take care not to confuse the nature of the conduct with the nature of the judicial or governmental response to it. If conduct is tantamount to a willful refusal to obey an order of the court, and the contemnor has the power to end his contumacy, a court may impose criminal contempt sanctions, or civil contempt sanctions, or both. The nature of the court\u2019s response does not alter the character of the conduct, and the determination of the appropriate response is committed largely to the court\u2019s discretion. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Brown v. United States, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">Whatever differences the potentially drastic power of courts to punish for contempt may have evoked, a doubt has never been uttered that stubborn disobedience of the duty to answer relevant inquiries in a judicial proceeding brings into force the power of the federal courts to punish for contempt. Trial courts no doubt must be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>struction to the administration of justice. It is no less important for this Court to use self-restraint in the exercise of its ultimate power to find that a trial court has gone beyond the area in which it can properly punish for contempt. We are not justified in sliding from mere disagreement with the way in which a trial court has dealt with a particular matter, such as petitioner\u2019s conduct in the present case, into a condemnation of the court\u2019s action as an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">356 U.S. at 153-54, 78 S.Ct. at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">C. <em>Section 1826(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Section 1826 was enacted by Congress in 1970 as part of the Organized Crime Control Act, Pub.L. No. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, 932 (1970), to deal with \u201crecalcitrant witnesses.\u201d Section 1826(a), which is set forth in full in the introduction preceding Part A above, was intended to give courts the power \u201csummarily to confine\u201d a witness for limited periods of time when the witness \u201cunjustifiably refuses to testify or produce other information.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 46, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4007, 4022. Weiss argues that the language and history of \u00a7 1826(a) reveal that Congress intended the section to reach only outright refusals to testify and not evasive answers. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Weiss contends that the language of \u00a7 1826(a), permitting the civil contempt sanction for a witness who \u201crefuses ... to comply with an order of the court to testify,\u201d does not extend that power with respect to a witness who makes some response to the questions. She contends that this interpretation is required by remarks during the floor debates on \u00a7 1826 in which members of Congress distinguished between answers that would constitute the crime of perjury and nonanswers that would constitute civil contempt. <em>See, e.g., </em>116 Cong.Ree. 35197 (1970) (Statement of Congressman McCulloch) (\u201cIf [witnesses] refuse to talk, they may be held in civil contempt .... If they talk but do not speak the truth, they may be tried for perjury.\u201d); <em>see also </em>116 Cong.Ree. 35311, 35321, 35327, 35328 (1970) (Statements of Congressmen Flowers, Price, Randall, and Mes-kill, respectively). These statements certainly recognized the fact that different sanctions could be imposed for different types of conduct, and they suggest that it was not Congress\u2019s intent to permit summary confinement in response to a simple perjury. But the statements relied on cannot reasonably be viewed as an attempt to lock together a particular type of conduct and a particular sanction in an unvarying two-step. For example, Congress can hardly be thought, by having stated that a refusal to talk may result in an adjudication of civil contempt, to have eliminated the court\u2019s power to deal with such a refusal as a <em>criminal </em>contempt. Nor is there any indication that Congress sought to draw bright lines between various types of testimonial obduracy on the basis of form rather than substance. Thus, we do not construe the legislative history of \u00a7 1826(a) as disclosing any congressional intention to limit the court\u2019s powers to deal with conduct that may in essence constitute both a contumacious refusal to testify and a perjurious effort at evasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">Indeed, there are explicit indications that Congress did not intend to curtail the courts\u2019 existing practice with respect to the imposition of civil contempt sanctions on obdurate witnesses. It was recognized that civil contempt sanctions have their roots in the \u201cancient\u201d notion \u201cthat courts have the power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders.\u201d 116 Cong.Ree. 588 (1970) (remarks of Sen. McClellan), and \u00a7 1826(a) was viewed as merely a \u201ccodification of] existing Federal civil contempt proceedings designed to deal with recalcitrant witnesses in Federal grand jury and court proceedings.\u201d S.Rep. No. 617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 33; <em>see also Gelbard v. United States, </em>408 U.S. 41, 42 n. 1, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 2358 n. 1, 33 L.Ed.2d 179 (1972); H.R.Rep. No. 1549, supra, at 33, 46, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4008, 4022. As discussed in Part II.B. above, the courts had, long prior to 1970, considered it sound practice not to be gulled by the form of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>witness\u2019s uninformative response to a question, but instead to determine whether in fact the witness was being equivocal and evasive and, in substance, was refusing to answer. As stated in the venerable <em>United States v. Appel, </em>\u201c[t]he mere fact that the witness gives some answer cannot be an absolute test.\u201d 211 F. at 495. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 1826(a)\u2019s conception of recalcitrance incorporates the principle of the <em>Appel </em>line of cases, that deliberately evasive answers constitute refusals to answer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><em>In re Michael, supra, </em>and <em>Ex parte Hudgings, supra, </em>relied on by Weiss, do not support her contention that false evasive answers cannot, as a matter of law, be viewed as recalcitrance within the meaning of \u00a7 1826(a). In <em>Michael, </em>the Supreme Court reversed the criminal contempt citation of a witness whose answers to a number of questions as to the purposes of certain checks had been found \u201cfalse and evasive\u201d by the district court. The court of appeals had concluded that the witness \u201chad not refused to answer questions, and that his testimony could not \u2018fairly be characterized as unresponsive in failing to give direct answers to the questions asked him,\u2019 \u201d 326 U.S. at 225, 66 S.Ct. at 78 (quoting court of appeals decision), and the Supreme Court agreed that the witness \u201chad directly responded with unequivocal answers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 226, 66 S.Ct. at 79. Such unequivocal, \u201cclearcut\u201d answers, <em>id. </em>n. 2, the Court found, might constitute perjury, <em>id. </em>at 226, 66 S.Ct. at 79 (\u201cThese unequivocal answers were clear enough so that if they are shown to be false petitioner would clearly be guilty of perjury.\u201d), but they could not be viewed as evasive attempts to refuse to testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">Here there was, at best, no element except perjury \u201cclearly shown.\u201d Nor need we consider cases like <em>United States v. Appel, </em>211 F. 495, 496, pressed upon us by the government. For there the Court thought that the testimony of Appel was \u201con its mere face, and without inquiry collaterally, ... not a bona fide effort to answer the questions at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-8\"><em>Id. </em>326 U.S. at 228-29, 66 S.Ct. at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">In <em>Hudgings, </em>the Court was confronted with responses by a witness who had been asked to identify handwriting as that of certain persons. The witness testified that \u201che believed, from having often seen the writing of the persons named, that the writings shown him were theirs, but that he could not so state from having seen [them] write because he could not recollect ever having seen them do so.\u201d 249 U.S. at 380, 39 S.Ct. at 338. After extensive cross-examination, the witness adhered to the limitation he had placed on the foundation for his identification of the writing, stating that \u201c \u2018I cannot say that I can recall that I have ever seen him in the act of writing. I would not say I have not, but I would not say that I have.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 39 S.Ct. at 339. The district court ruled the witness in contempt because it was satisfied that this answer was false, and it ordered that the witness be imprisoned until he was willing to answer the question truthfully. The Supreme Court reversed on the ground that the court does not have the power \u201cin every case where [it] is of the opinion that a witness is committing perjury\u201d to punish for contempt. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 39 S.Ct. at 339. The contempt sanctions are to be reserved for those testimonial obduracies, whether perjured or not, which obstruct the tribunal in the performance of its duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">An obstruction to the performance of judicial duty resulting from an act done in the presence of the court is, then, the characteristic upon which the power to punish for contempt must rest. This being true, it follows that the presence of that element must clearly be shown in every case where the power to punish for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>contempt is exerted \u2014 a principle which, applied to the subject in hand, exacts that in order to punish perjury in the presence of the court as a contempt there must be added to the essential elements of perjury under the general law the further element of obstruction to the court in the performance of its duty. As illustrative of this, see <em>United States v. Appel, </em>211 Fed.Rep. 495.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><em>Id. </em>249 U.S. at 383, 39 S.Ct. at 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">We find <em>Michael </em>and <em>Hudgings </em>instructive for the present case in several respects. In <em>Michael, </em>the Supreme Court took care to note that the witness\u2019s answers were not in fact equivocal and thus were not susceptible to being characterized as refusals to answer. It expressly distinguished, with no semblance of criticism, the principle embodied by eases such as <em>Appel, </em>that transparently false evasions and sham claims of memory failure are tantamount to a downright refusal to testify. In <em>Hudgings, </em>the Court ruled merely that a court cannot impose sanctions for contempt \u201cin every case\u201d in which it believes a perjury has been committed. And it cited <em>Appel </em>as illustrative of a case in which a contempt citation with respect to false testimony was proper. The further fact that the Court in <em>Hudgings, </em>a civil contempt case, illustrated the conduct that would justify that sanction by referring to <em>Appel, </em>a criminal contempt case, confirms our view that, in fathoming the nature of recalcitrance, we must focus on the character of the conduct rather than the character of the court\u2019s response to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">We are aware of only two reported decisions discussing the applicability of \u00a7 1826(a) to a witness whose responses are equivocations rather than outright refusals to answer. One is our decision earlier this Term in <em>In re Bongiorno, supra, </em>and the other is <em>In re Battaglia, supra. See also Martin-Trigona v. Gouletas, supra </em>(so applying \u00a7 1826(a) without discussion). In <em>Bongiorno </em>we focused on the character of the conduct at issue, and construed, in the circumstances, the witness\u2019s responses of lack of knowledge or lack of memory as plainly false and evasive assertions designed to impede the grand jury\u2019s investigation. In <em>Battaglia, </em>the court remanded for a determination of whether the government had met the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d test. But both courts interpreted \u00a7 1826(a) to reach this form of recalcitrance, and this interpretation is well within the teaching of <em>Michael </em>and <em>Hudgings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">In sum, we conclude that long prior to the enactment of \u00a7 1826(a), courts had consistently imposed contempt sanctions, both criminal and civil, on witnesses who gave obviously false evasive and equivocal answers in an effort to avoid providing information. Section 1826(a) codified this practice and thus may be applicable to the conduct of Weiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">III. PROPRIETY OF THE CIVIL CONTEMPT SANCTION IN THE PRESENT CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">The question remains whether the district court in the present case abused its discretion by holding Weiss in civil contempt for her responses to questions concerning the details of her employment as a counselor with Project Joint and ordering her to provide detailed information as to such matters as the persons with whom she worked and persons she counseled. The witness\u2019s recalcitrance must be established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>E.g., In re Bongiorno, supra; In re Battaglia, supra, </em>653 F.2d at 423. The district judge recognized this standard of proof, but we conclude that he erred in finding that it had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">In <em>Bongiorno, </em>we pointed out that, in order to carry its burden of establishing recalcitrance in the form of false assertions of absence of memory, the government must show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the witness\u2019s claimed lack of memory was not credible. We noted that \u201c[s]uch evidence may include extrinsic proof, such as tape recordings, documents, or photographs; or it may be found in the witness\u2019s demeanor and his answers, if the pattern and substance of those answers convinces the court that the answers are inherently incredible.\u201d 694 F.2d at 922. In that case we found that adequate proof had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>presented principally in the form of photographs of various persons including the witness in which the witness professed to recognize no one, and the selectivity with which the witness\u2019s memory failed. In <em>Bongiorno </em>it seemed quite evident that the witness had the knowledge and memory that he denied.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The present ease shares certain obvious characteristics with <em>Bongiorno </em>and the cases discussed in Part II.B. above. Like Bongiorno\u2019s, Weiss\u2019s memory failures, as the district court found, followed a certain pattern in that she claimed an inability to provide unequivocally any details as to a particular subject, <em>i.e., </em>her job at Project Joint. Like the witness in <em>In re Schulman, supra, </em>for example, Weiss professed not to remember \u2014 53 times in her first two grand jury appearances, according to the district court\u2019s count \u2014 and she professed not to understand questions concerning the nature of Project Joint and quibbled with various questions\u2019 terminology though she had previously phrased her answers in just such terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Unlike <em>Bongiorno, </em>however, there was here no extrinsic evidence to contradict Weiss\u2019s claimed inability to remember. Thus, the court was compelled to rely simply on the intrinsic credibility \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 of Weiss\u2019s answers. We are inclined to agree with the district court\u2019s assessment that it is inherently incredible that a 34-year-old person, with no traumatic or medicinal reason for a memory loss, who worked for one-and-a-half years at a job that ended less than five years earlier would retain virtually no memory of any detail as to her salary, her hours, her coworkers, people she counseled, where she worked, where she lived at the time, or the nature of what she did. Nonetheless, we are constrained to reverse the court\u2019s holding Weiss in civil contempt for having refused to give this information, for we find lacking any clear and convincing evidence of the truth of the district court\u2019s basic premise, <em>i.e., </em>that Weiss actually worked at the job she is said to have held at Project Joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">The supposition that Weiss worked as a counselor at Project Joint comes from the records of the organization and from answers of Weiss that are relatively clearcut.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But the thrust of the grand jury\u2019s investigation suggests that in fact she may not have worked as a counselor there. The grand jury is inquiring into whether Project Joint claimed funds for nonexistent CETA trainees, supported its claims by means of fraudulent documentation, and thereby obtained one million dollars in CETA funds for having trained no one at all. Thus, the very nature of the inquiry and the absence of any employment documentation that is not treated as suspect by the inquiry itself suggest that Weiss may have no details to give. If there were no counselees, there would have been little need for a counselor. If false documents were filed, the Project\u2019s books showing Weiss as a counselor have little credibility. If false claims were made for training expenses, supposed \u201csalary checks\u201d from Project Joint made payable to Weiss do not mean that she worked there.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">The absence of credited extrinsic evidence of the factual premise for the detailed questioning of Weiss distinguishes the present circumstances from those cases in which evasive answers were held refusals to answer. For example, in <em>Appel, </em>there was concrete evidence of bank account withdrawals and the question was how the witness had spent the money; in <em>McGovern </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the same question was asked with respect to money reflected in checks payable to the witness; in <em>Howard, </em>there was evidence of bank deposits and the question was the origin of the money. The questioning of the witnesses in each case proceeded from the unimpeachable premise that the financial transactions had occurred; the witnesses\u2019 evasions were considered deliberate refusals to answer only because \u201c[their] testimony [was] considered in connection with the known and undisputed circumstances,\u201d <em>Schleier v. United States, supra, </em>72 F.2d at 417, and the questions sought to elicit \u201cfacts which [they] <em>must </em>have known.\u201d <em>In re Schulman, supra, </em>177 F. at 193 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Given the absence here of clear and convincing evidence that Weiss did work as a counselor at Project Joint, and given the thrust of the grand jury\u2019s investigation, we conclude that there are no \u201cundisputed circumstances\u201d such as existed in the above eases. As a result, there is no clear evidence that Weiss \u201cmust ... know[ ]\u201d the details surrounding her supposed job. If Weiss did not work at Project Joint, she in fact can have no memory of hours, or coworkers, or counselees, and her professed inability to supply details as to that employment should not have been construed as refusals to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The questions that Weiss has been ordered to answer are those seeking the details of her employment as a counselor at Project Joint. If Weiss did not in fact have that job she will never have the ability to answer many of those questions and, as a practical matter, will not have the keys to her prison in her pocket. Since the \u201cjustification for coercive imprisonment as applied to civil contempt depends upon the ability of the contemnor to comply with the court\u2019s order,\u201d <em>Shillitani v. United States, supra, </em>384 U.S. at 371, 86 S.Ct. at 1536; <em>see also United States v. Wendy, </em>575 F.2d 1025, 1030-31 (2d Cir.1978), and since Weiss\u2019s wherewithal to give details is suspect, the imposition of the coercive sanction of civil contempt was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">It might be argued that the civil contempt order is sustainable on the ground that if in fact Weiss cannot answer the questions as to the details of her counseling job with Project Joint because she had no such job, she nevertheless has the keys to her prison in her pocket because she could simply recant her predicate testimony that she did work as a counselor at Project Joint. We disagree. Bypassing the technical obstacle that Weiss has not in fact been ordered to recant this predicate testimony, the fundamental difficulty with the argument is that such an order would not have been a proper application of \u00a7 1826(a). Section 1826(a) deals with recalcitrance, which, as we have discussed above, includes evasive answers that seek to avoid giving information as well as outright refusals to testify. Weiss\u2019s testimony that she worked as a counselor at Project Joint, <em>see </em>note 11 <em>supra, </em>cannot be characterized as a refusal to answer. It may well be false, but it does not appear to be either evasive, or equivocal, or uninformative.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">This does not; of course, mean that Weiss has testified falsely with impunity. If she did not work as a counselor at Project Joint, her clearcut testimony that she did so not only exposes her to a possible prosecution for perjury, but also, assuming that an appropriate factfinder finds that her false testimony and misleading claims of lack of memory obstructed the grand jury\u2019s inquiry, exposes her to the possibility of punishment for criminal contempt. <em>In re Michael, supra. </em>Such a criminal contempt proceeding has not to our knowledge been commenced. If one is commenced, it must, of course, be conducted in accordance with the appropriate procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">Had there been clear and convincing evidence that Weiss worked as a counselor at Project Joint, we would have upheld the civil contempt adjudication under \u00a7 1826(a) for her refusal to supply information as to any details. Given the absence of such evidence as to that predicate fact, which is the linchpin both of the finding that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>claimed lack of memory for detail was inherently incredible and of justification for a coercive sanction, we reverse the court\u2019s adjudication of civil contempt, and remand for such other proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-27\">.

The delay in Weiss\u2019s return was caused by conflicting obligations of counsel for the government and of counsel for Weiss, and by Weiss\u2019s refusal to testify further without a new grant of immunity.

A renewed motion was granted on February 3, 1983, by the panel which heard the appeal, and Weiss was released on that date pending determination of this appeal. Since Weiss is not currently incarcerated, the provision of \u00a7 1826(b), requiring that an appeal from an order of confinement under \u00a7 1826(a) be disposed of within thirty days of the filing of the appeal, is not applicable. <em>In re Rosahn, </em>671 F.2d 690, 693-94 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">.

We view this principle as inapposite here because, in light of Congress\u2019s stated intention to codify existing civil contempt practice, we do not believe that \u00a7 1826(a) is ambiguous.' <em>See Albernaz v.

We are aware of no authority imposing such an obligation on a witness or requiring him to refresh his own recollection and we do not believe there is one.

Thus, we all agree that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a) (1976) does not \u201climit the court\u2019s powers to deal with conduct that may in essence constitute both a contumacious refusal to testify and a perjurious effort at evasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Here the government, in order to expedite an investigation of misuse of government funds, seeks the remedy of \u00a7 1826(a) with summary sanctions imposed by the court. The purpose of the sanctions imposed by Judge Platt is to secure, if possible, the testimony of the witness who has been given immunity. I agree that in this case the burden is on the government to establish by clear and convincing proof that the witness\u2019s conduct is contemptuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Judge Kearse\u2019s detailed recitation of the facts amply demonstrates that the witness\u2019s testimony was a deliberate and calculated evasion which amounted to a refusal to testify. My colleagues agree that the testimony appears evasive but nevertheless conclude that the record is lacking in extrinsic evidence that shows that the witness\u2019s claimed lack of memory is not credible. In our recent decision in <em>In re Bongiorno, </em>694 F.2d 917, 922 (2d Cir.1982), we said that evidence that the witness\u2019s claimed lack of memory is not credible \u201cmay [also] be found in the witness\u2019s demeanor and his answers, if the pattern and substance of those answers convinces the court that the answers are inherently incredible.\u201d Judge Platt was so convinced. Reading this record and Judge Kearse\u2019s detailed recital of it, I do not see how we can disagree with the assessment of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">If, on as clear a record as this, any extrinsic evidence is necessary, it is certainly present here. There are at least two items of extrinsic evidence in the record which to me are relevant. The first is a series of five salary checks, made out to Weiss by \u201cProject Joint, adult work experience,\u201d which were dated from March 18, 1977 to June 30, 1978. She did admit, after attempting to evade answering, that the checks, all of which were indorsed by her, were for salary and that she cashed the checks and received the money. Although these salary checks, as Judge Kearse suggests, may be suspect in terms of showing that Weiss actually worked at Project Joint, they obviously establish a tangible relationship between Weiss and Project Joint during the period when she was allegedly employed by that organization. Similar, therefore, to the circumstances in the three cases illustratively cited by Judge Kearse, <em>United States v. Appel, </em>211 F. 495 (S.D.N.Y. 1913); <em>United States v. McGovern, </em>60 F.2d 880 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>287 U.S. 650, 53 S.Ct. 96, 77 L.Ed. 561 (1932); <em>Howard v. United States, </em>182 F.2d 908 (8th Cir.), <em>vacated and remanded as moot, </em>340 U.S. 898, 71 S.Ct. 278, 95 L.Ed. 651 (1950), the questioning of Weiss with respect to the operations of and Weiss\u2019s connections with Project Joint did in fact proceed from the \u201cunimpeachable premise\u201d that Weiss knew something about the organization and her own involvement with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">I would also classify as extrinsic evidence the manner in which Weiss, as Judge Kearse\u2019s opinion states, \u201cprofusely punctuated\u201d her testimony by leaving the grand jury room to consult counsel. On her first appearance, Weiss left to consult counsel on 23 separate occasions which consumed more than 28 minutes. On November 10, she left four times for an absence of at least 20 minutes. And on her last appearance, eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>legal consultations took at least 21 minutes. Considering the negligible results of any advice in terms of responsive testimony and the resulting delay and waste of the grand jury\u2019s time, I think that the nature of such conduct evidences a calculated and deliberate pattern of evasion and refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Rather than deal with the logic of the testimony and the existing extrinsic evidence, Judge Kearse instead suggests the probability that Weiss, contrary to her sworn testimony, never worked at Project Joint and thus reasons that there is no clear evidence that Weiss must know the details surrounding her purported employment. Accordingly, Judge Kearse stresses that what we really have is a case of perjury, and she concludes that since such testimony, if it be perjury, does not appear to be evasive, equivocal, or uninformative, it \u201ccannot be characterized as a refusal to answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">I do not quarrel with the suppositions that Weiss may never have worked at Project Joint and that she may have committed perjury. Nevertheless, even a strong likelihood that Weiss did not do any work at Project Joint only emphasizes the inherent absurdity of any claim that she cannot remember. Whether she worked there or not is precisely what the grand jury is entitled to know from the one person who must know, and that person is Chanie Weiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Under Judge Kearse\u2019s analysis, however, Weiss, by perjuring herself on the predicate question of whether she actually worked at Project Joint and then responding to follow-up questions with answers stating a failure to remember, has been able deliberately to obstruct the grand jury process while, simultaneously, circumventing the very sanctions that were enacted to secure the compliance and cooperation of a witness with that process. Such a result is not warranted either by logic or by case law; in short, it makes no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">As previously noted, we all agree that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 1826(a), \u201cdid not intend to curtail the courts\u2019 existing practice with respect to the imposition of civil contempt sanctions on obdurate witnesses.\u201d Judge Kearse acknowledges that a court traditionally had the power to hold a witness in civil contempt \u201c[i]f the witness\u2019s false testimony has obstructed the court in the performance of its duty... . \u201d <em>See also Ex parte Hudgings, </em>249 U.S. 378, 383, 39 S.Ct. 337, 339, 63 L.Ed. 656 (1919); <em>Howard, supra, </em>182 F.2d at 913. In <em>McGovern, supra, </em>Judge Chase, speaking generally of the contempt power, said: \u201c[A] witness who obstructs the course of justice by so acting that the court\u2019s performance of its duty is frustrated is not beyond the reach of the contempt power because he chooses false swearing as the means to his end in so doing.\u201d 60 F.2d at 889, <em>quoted in Howard, supra, </em>182 F.2d at 913. The key factor necessary to justify a holding of civil contempt in such a situation is that obstruction <em>beyond </em>the mere elements of perjury be shown. <em>Ex parte Hudgings, supra, </em>249 U.S. at 383, 39 S.Ct. at 339; <em>Howard, supra, </em>182 F.2d at 913. Such obstruction may be found where a witness\u2019s answers are \u201cevasive, fantastic, and untrue\u201d and their effect and purpose are to \u201c \u2018thwart the process of inquiry, and to turn a trial [here, a Grand Jury investigation] into a futile form.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard, supra, </em>182 F.2d at 914 (bracketed material in original) (quoting <em>Clark v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 1, 10, 53 S.Ct. 465, 467, 77 L.Ed. 993 (1933)).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">It seems to me that Weiss\u2019s testimony, when viewed as a whole and in conjunction with the extrinsic evidence, amounted to a transparent refusal to testify. If Weiss did not commit perjury and actually worked at Project Joint, she <em>must </em>have known the details surrounding her employment. Thus, a claim of lack of memory as to such details would be evasive. If, on the other hand, she did perjure herself with respect to her predicate testimony concerning the question of employment, she <em>must </em>have known that she never did any work for Project Joint, and thus her answers claiming an inability to remember the details of her work would again be evasive. My colleagues seem to acknowledge that by responding to these questions with answers stating a failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>memory, Weiss has been able deliberately and perjuriously to cover her earlier perjury and still evade any meaningful testimony on the subject of Project Joint. I do not see how such conduct, which acts to \u201cthwart the process of inquiry\u201d and turn the investigation into a \u201cfutile form,\u201d can amount to anything less than an intentional obstruction of the grand jury process.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Judge Kearse asserts that a holding of civil contempt is inappropriate in this situation on the ground that if Weiss did not actually work at Project Joint she will never be able to terminate her confinement by answering the many questions concerning the details of her employment. I do not find this argument persuasive, however. Weiss had, and still has, the ability to answer these questions by stating simply that she never performed any work for Project Joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Accordingly, I do not see how anyone can read this record and reach any conclusion other than the one reached by Judge Platt: that Weiss has refused to answer questions which she obviously is capable of answering.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">There has been mounting concern over the increase in white collar crime and the obstructions encountered in investigating and prosecuting those who commit it. Gathering evidence of such crime is time-consuming and difficult for law enforcement agencies and it strains their limited facilities. To enable law enforcement agencies to get the necessary evidence, Congress has provided two essential weapons: the power to secure grants of immunity to witnesses so that they cannot evade testifying by a claim of self-incrimination, and the power to seek sanctions against those witnesses who, despite grants of immunity, refuse to give eyidence about matters within their knowledge. Under our system of law, the courts must play their part to see that these powers are effectively and properly used according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">But the courts must leave it to the prosecuting authorities to determine how those powers to get evidence are to be used. It is not within the province of judges, and seldom within, their knowledge, to determine how evidence may best be secured. Anyone with any experience of law enforcement knows that prosecutions for the crime of perjury are especially difficult. More to the point, such prosecutions invariably fail to produce evidence, and they always result in excessive delay of any investigation. We have no business to tell the prosecutor that he can proceed with a perjury case or even to suggest that he can, alternatively, seek the punitive sanction of criminal contempt. Our business is to determine whether there is a basis for the district court\u2019s finding of contempt under \u00a7 1826(a). In <em>Brown v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 153-54, 78 S.Ct. 622, 625-26, 2 L.Ed.2d 589 (1958), the Supreme Court cautioned: \u201cWe are not justified in sliding from mere disagreement with the way in which a trial court has dealt with a particular matter [of obstruction of justice] . . . into a condemnation of the court\u2019s action as an abuse of discretion.\u201d I must conclude that my colleagues\u2019 judgment, and the procedure their opinion obviously suggests to witnesses who do not wish to answer questions, will make it even more difficult for federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute white collar crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">I would affirm the order of the district court and direct that our mandate issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
