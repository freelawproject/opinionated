Roque was found to have participated in the shooting of Phillip Maronge, who became a government informant after his arrest for marijuana dealing. On appeal, Roque contends that the trial court erred by (1) admitting a fellow conspirator\u2019s testimony of hearsay statements of coconspirators when the government had not presented independent evidence of the existence of a conspiracy and the defendant\u2019s participation in it; (2) rejecting the defendant\u2019s attempts to impeach the government\u2019s witness through introducing into evidence the testimony of one of the coconspirators in an earlier trial of the same case, as averred to by another witness at that prior trial; (3) refusing to introduce into evidence the acquittals in the prior trial of those coconspirators; (4) finding that the government-arranged identifications of Roque were not impermissibly suggestive or prejudicial; and (5) finding that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. Finding no reversible merit to these contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-21\">1. <em>Introduction of Hearsay Statements of Coconspirators</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-22\">Roque contends that the district court erred in permitting Bruce, a conspirator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>who had pleaded guilty to the conspiracy to kill Maronge (the government informant), to testify as to hearsay statements made by Roque\u2019s alleged coconspirators. The statements were admitted under a hearsay exception, Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), which provides that statements \u201cmade by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">In <em>United States v. James, </em>590 F.2d 575 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 917, 99 S.Ct. 2836, 61 L.Ed.2d 283 (1979), we set out the guidelines for the admissibility of a coconspirator\u2019s statements against a defendant on trial. We noted the requisite predicate facts to be that \u201cthere must be a conspiracy, the statement must be made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, and the declarant and the defendant must be members of the conspiracy.\u201d 590 F.2d at 578. Further, \u201cthe judge alone [must] make the determination of the admissibility of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579-80. \u201c[A]s a preliminary matter, there must be <em>substantial, independent </em>evidence of a conspiracy ... established by evidence independent of the coconspirator statement itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581 (emphasis in original). \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s threshold determination of admissibility is normally to be made during the presentation of the government\u2019s case and before the [coconspirator\u2019s statement] evidence is heard by the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">At this stage, a declaration by a coconspirator against a defendant is admissible only when there is a \u201c \u2018sufficient showing, by independent evidence, of a conspiracy among one or more . .. defendants and the declarant and if the declarations at issue were in furtherance of that conspiracy\u2019 \u201d, <em>id., </em>at least by independent evidence sufficient \u201cto take the question -to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, at the end of the trial</p>\n<p id=\"Agt\">[r]egardless of whether the proof has been made in the preferred order, or the coconspirator\u2019s statement has been admitted subject to later connection, on appropriate motion at the conclusion of all the evidence the court must determine as a factual matter whether the prosecution has shown by a preponderance of the evidence independent of the statement itself (1) that a conspiracy existed, (2) that the coconspirator and the defendant against whom the coconspirator\u2019s statement is offered were members of the conspiracy, and (3) that the statement was made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">590 F.2d at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Here, the district court required the government to establish the <em>James </em>predicate before admitting in evidence any declarations made by a coeonspirator. Through the testimony of Bruce (the coconspirator who had pleaded guilty and testified for the government), the prosecution established: the background surrounding Maronge (the victim\u2019s) arrest along with some of the co-conspirators; Bruce\u2019s subsequent travel with another coconspirator to Miami at the request of yet another conspirator to meet with coconspirators and their return to Louisiana (where Maronge\u2019s subsequent shooting took place); Bruce\u2019s subsequent receipt of a telephone call from the defendant Roque to have him picked up and brought to meet with Bruce and another conspirator, following which Roque and the man who subsequently shot Maronge were brought to a meeting between the four; at a meeting of the four, Roque himself talked about how they were going to \u201cget to\u201d Maronge\u2014 following which, Maronge was indeed shot by the gunman the defendant Roque had brought to meet with Bruce.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Despite Roque\u2019s contention to the contrary, the predicate facts so established by evidence independent of coconspirators\u2019 out-of-court declarations were clearly sufficient to show a conspiracy, of which the defendant Roque was a member, to shoot Maronge, the government witness. <em>See, e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>664 F.2d 94, 98 (5th Cir.1981). The out-of-court declarations were therefore admissible. Further, we find no error in the district court\u2019s holding at the conclusion of the trial that, without reference to the out-of-court declarations, the predicate facts of the conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>had been established by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Roque protests that the only evidence linking him to the conspiracy was Bruce\u2019s identifier+ion, and that the identification made at the time of Roque\u2019s arrest was flawed because it was based on prejudicial procedures. As we discuss in section 4 below, however, Bruce became personally acquainted with Roque on the several occasions they met to plan the shooting; moreover, other evidence adduced at trial (such as Roque\u2019s registration at the hotel where the coconspirators met and records of his telephone calls to and from the other coconspirators) connected him with the conspiracy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">2. <em>Introduction of a Coconspirator\u2019s Testimony from a Prior Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0V\">Roque sought to impeach Bruce\u2019s testimony regarding the conspiracy to kill Maronge by introducing testimony of a coconspirator, Resende, from a trial in this same case in which Resende, Goodrich, and Bonvillain were acquitted. Resende was the only defendant who had testified in that trial. Urging that Resende, as well as Goodrich and Bonvillain, would take the Fifth Amendment if called to testify in Roque\u2019s subsequent trial, Roque attempted to examine a government agent to ask if he had been present at the prior trial where Resende had taken the stand and denied similar allegations made by Bruce. The trial court ruled that this was an improper attempt to introduce the trial testimony of a witness who was not called to testify in the present case and that the agent\u2019s testimony regarding Resende\u2019s statements did not constitute an exception to the hearsay rule contained in Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Roque\u2019s defense counsel did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 804(b)(1), which provides that if the declarant is \u201cunavailable\u201d as a witness, there is an exception to the hearsay rule for \u201c[tjestimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding\u201d of the party against whom the testimony is now offered \u2014 in this case, the government.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For purposes of the rule, \u201cunavailability\u201d encompasses, inter alia, a situation, which the defendant urges is implicated here, where the witness is \u201cexempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege\u201d or \u201cpersists in refusing to testify .. . despite an order of the court to do so.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 804(a). Roque, the proponent of the hearsay evidence, has the burden of proving the unavailability of the witness from the prior trial. <em>See United States v. Amaya, </em>533 F.2d 188, 191 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1101, 97 S.Ct. 1125, 51 L.Ed.2d 551 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Roque did not make a record of his efforts to produce Resende as a witness \u2014 he did not subpoena him or ask the judge for a ruling as to the unavailability on account of privilege or for an order to testify. There was thus no opportunity for the trial court to evaluate Resende\u2019s alleged refusal to testify and propensity to invoke the fifth amendment, or to ascertain whether some type of immunity was available to Resende from the effects of his possible incrimination by his testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cf. United States v. Pelton, </em>578 F.2d 701, 709-10 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 964, 99 S.Ct. 451, 58 L.Ed.2d 422 (1978) (Rule 804(a) \u201cunavailability\u201d does not exist where counsel made no effort to produce witness or to prove his refusal to testify or intent to exercise fifth amendment privilege). Since Roque\u2019s counsel did not bring the issue of Resende\u2019s unavailability into the ambit of the \u201cdiscretion of the trial court to accept or reject counsel\u2019s representations\u201d concerning Resende\u2019s privilege or refusal to testify, <em>see Bailey v. Southern Pacific Railroad, </em>613 F.2d 1385, 1390 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 836,101 S.Ct. 109, 66 L.Ed.2d 42 (1980), we cannot on appeal speculate as to the factual merits of those representations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">3. <em>Evidence of Acquittal of Coconspirators</em></p>\n<p id=\"A74\">Roque attempted to introduce evidence of the acquittals in a prior trial of coconspirators Resende, Goodrich, and Bonvillain in order to impeach Bruce\u2019s testimony implicating those alleged coconspirators and the defendant in the shooting. He also argues in opposition to the trial court\u2019s ruling that this evidence was irrelevant, that Fed.R. Evid. 806 allows introduction of evidence attacking or supporting the credibility of the declarant whose hearsay statements have been previously admitted into evidence under an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">Rule 806 is not pertinent to Roque\u2019s objection because the character or credibility of the coeonspirators/declarants Resende, Goodrich and Bonvillain is not at issue in this case. In actuality, Roque challenges coconspirator <em>Bruce\u2019s </em>credibility and his account of the activities of the conspiracy by seeking to introduce the jury\u2019s finding in a prior case that the government had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of certain of the coconspirators. The circumstance of the acquittal of three of the coconspirators does not detract from Bruce\u2019s credibility or foreclose the conviction of another coconspirator\u2019s in a subsequent case. The district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that this evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible. Fed.R. Evid. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">4. <em>Witness Identification of the Defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">Roque contends that two witnesses\u2019 pretrial and in-court identifications are inadmissible because the presentation of him alone to the witnesses used by the government to obtain them were impermissibly suggestive and created a substantial risk of misidentification. <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 302, 87 S.Ct. 1967,1972,18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bazan, </em>637 F.2d 363, 367 (5th Cir.1981). In particular, Roque objects that Bruce\u2019s initial identification of him to government agents occurred in a single suspect show-up;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>other witness, Van Benchoten, had seen the defendant only on one occasion, sixteen months prior to his testimony, at the hotel for which Van Benchoten worked, and was not asked to identify Roque until Van Benchoten testified in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">In <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968), the Supreme Court takes a two-step approach to the exclusion of identifications. First, the court determines if the procedure was unnecessarily suggestive \u2014 in this case, Bruce\u2019s single-suspect viewing of the defendant after his arrest and Van Benchoten\u2019s in-court confrontation. If it is found suggestive, a separate inquiry is conducted as to whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the suggestiveness leads to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification and thus a denial of due process. <em>See also Passman v. Blackburn, </em>652 F.2d 559, 569-70 (5th Cir. 1981). In making this inquiry, \u201creliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony.\u201d <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">A reliable identification may thus be admitted even if the confrontation procedure was suggestive. The factors considered in determining reliability include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7-\">the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of [the witness\u2019] prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated [by the witness] at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation. Against these factors is to be weighed the corrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6o\"><em>Manson, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. at 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Bruce\u2019s identification stemmed from his many face-to-face contacts and personal acquaintance with the defendant during the course of the conspiracy, and not merely from the circumstances of the arrest. There is no question of reliability of Bruce\u2019s <em>identification </em>of Roque; any doubts hinge on Bruce\u2019s <em>credibility </em>in implicating the defendant in the conspiracy, doubts which were left to jury resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Under the totality of the circumstances, Van Benchoten\u2019s in-court identification also does not result in irreparable misidentification. Although he saw the defendant on only one occasion many months before the trial in the course of his employment at a hotel, he testified to having a disagreement with Roque concerning hotel policy that could have affected greatly the degree of attention with which he regarded Roque during that short period. Another witness present at that time (who could not positively identify Roque), gave a general description of the defendant. If this testamentary identification was weak, \u201cit was a matter to be emphasized to the jury and not to the court.\u201d <em>Bazan, supra, </em>637 F.2d at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">5. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Roque contends that the evidence to convict him as coconspirator and principal in the obstruction of a criminal investigation and for use of interstate transportation in aid of racketeering activities is insufficient. He argues that the government proved no connection between him and the drug dealings which led to the plan to kill the dealer-turned-informant Maronge, or that he knew of Maronge\u2019s cooperation with federal authorities. Additionally, he urges that he did not participate in the initial meeting of Bruce, Resende, Goodrich and Bonvillain and that the sole role he supposedly played (as testified to by Bruce) was appearing with the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d assailant at another meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">We find, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, that the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of the crimes for which Roque was tried. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">In a conspiracy prosecution, the government does not have to prove that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>defendant was intimately familiar with each and every detail of the conspiracy but that the defendant had knowledge of the agreement and was associated with the plan. Evidence that the defendant had knowledge of the conspiratorial agreement and associated with the plan in order to promote its success is sufficient to sustain a conspiracy conviction where the conspiracy has been adequately established by other independent evidence. <em>United States v. Cuesta, </em>597 F.2d 903, 918 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied sub nom. Bowles v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 964, 100 S.Ct. 452, 62 L.Ed.2d 377 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The defendant was charged not only with the conspiracy but with the actual substantive offenses of obstruction of justice and interstate travel in aid of racketeering. The government was able to show that the defendant brought \u201cJohn Doe\u201d from Florida to Louisiana in order to bring about the attempted murder of Maronge, met with and made and received telephone calls to and from the other coconspirators, and travelled interstate with them after the shooting. Since the government proved that the appellant was involved in the plan to murder Maronge, whether or not Roque knew of all the details regarding the motive for the shooting is irrelevant. <em>United States v. Elam, </em>678 F.2d 1234, 1247 (5th Cir.1982). When viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty on all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Because we find no reversible merit to the defendant\u2019s objections to the sufficiency of the evidence and to the trial court\u2019s rulings as to the admittance of hearsay statements, evidence of acquittals in a prior trial and identifications, we AFFIRM his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AVh\">. Without reference to hearsay statements, the testimony adduced at trial established that Bruce met with three of the coconspirators, Resende, Goodrich and Bonvillain, to plan the shooting; that Roque met with Bruce, Bonvillain, and the unknown male (\u201cJohn Doe\u201d) who did the actual shooting; that Bruce accompanied \u201cJohn Doe\u201d and saw him shoot Maronge; and that Bruce, \u201cJohn Doe\u201d, Bonvillain and Roque travelled together after the shooting. This evidence was substantially unrebutted by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-6\">. Roque also contends that several statements presented at trial were inadmissible because they were not made by a coconspirator during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy, as required by Rule 801(d)(2)(E). The defendant objects to introduction of telephone toll records, including a call to a \u201cSidney\u201d rather than to the conspirator \u201cErnest\u201d Bonvillain; however, the fact that these calls <em>occurred </em>is not a hearsay statement. Similarly, the evidence of pre- and post-conspiracy \u201cacts of misconduct and bad character\u201d of the coconspirators with respect to the drug arrests of the coconspirators, are merely observations of the witnesses of events precipitating or in furtherance of the conspiracy and do not involve hearsay statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b882-11\">. Rule 804(b) provides in full:</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">(b) <em>Hearsay exceptions. </em>The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">(1) <em>Former testimony. </em>Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\">. Of course, Resende would be constitutionally protected from future prosecution, with respect to this case in which he was acquitted, by the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">. Moreover, Roque did not proffer the \u201cbest evidence\u201d of Resende\u2019s testimony \u2014 the official court transcript. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 1005. He instead sought to elicit the observations of another witness at the earlier trial, Agent Hilton, concerning the content of Resende\u2019s testimony. The district court may have (correctly) rested its ruling on that ground \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s the reason I did not allow you to call that agent to testify as to what some other witness had said.\u201d (Tr. 589.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b883-15\">. According to trial testimony, Bruce identified Roque (thus bringing about Roque\u2019s arrest) after Bruce was in the custody of and cooperating with the federal authorities. Bruce testified that in trying to locate Roque he could supply the government agent only with the name \u201cCarlito\u201d and a telephone number of a barber shop. The agent took Bruce to that barber shop and asked if \u201cCarlito\u201d were there; Roque responded and Bruce identified him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
