The District Court sentenced Smith to a cumulative term of imprisonment of not less than 15 years and not more than 30 years. On direct appeal this court affirmed his conviction. <em>United States v. Gantt, </em>617 F.2d 831 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Subsequently, appellant filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1976) to vacate his conviction and sentence. He contended, among other things, that his conviction and sentence on separate counts for violating both 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848 violated his constitutional rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The District Court denied his motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">The government concedes that the sentence imposed upon appellant is defective. It acknowledges that the District Court erroneously imposed sentences on both the greater offense (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848) and the lesser included offense (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846). The government also acknowledges that the District Court\u2019s imposition of a 15-to 30-year sentence violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(1) (1976), which requires that a minimum sentence not exceed one-third of the maximum imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">Under these circumstances, we remand this case to the District Court for correction of its sentencing, <em>i.e., </em>by vacating the conviction and sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and reducing the 15-year minimum to a minimum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
