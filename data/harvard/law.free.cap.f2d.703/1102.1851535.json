He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-15\">On March 31, 1982, Hopkins entered a Crocker National Bank and presented a demand note to teller Oliaz. The note stated: \u201cGive me all your hundreds, fifties and twenties. This is a robbery.\u201d When Oliaz replied that she had no hundreds or fifties, Hopkins stated: \u201cOkay, then give me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d Oliaz left the teller window, ostensibly to obtain money, and informed several bank employees that she was being robbed. After Oliaz entered the bank vault, Hopkins left the bank in a nonchalant manner. Oliaz testified that during the course of Hopkins\u2019 attempt she felt intimidated, frightened, and concerned for her unborn child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-17\">Hopkins first argues that his conduct and demeanor were not sufficiently intimidating to support a conviction for robbery. Although the evidence showed that Hopkins spoke calmly, made no threats, and was clearly unarmed, we have previously held that \u201cexpress threats of bodily harm, threatening body motions, or the physical possibility of concealed weapon[s]\u201d are not required for a conviction for bank robbery by intimidation. <em>United States v. Bingham, </em>628 F.2d 548, 549 (9th Cir.1980). We believe that the threats implicit in Hopkins\u2019 written and verbal demands for money provide sufficient evidence of intimidation to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-18\">Hopkins next argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to modify the <em>Devitt &amp; Blackmar </em>\u00a7 44.05 jury instruction on intimidation to conform to this court\u2019s suggestion in <em>United States v. Alsop, </em>479 F.2d 65, 67 n. 4 (9th Cir.1973). The modified jury instruction set forth in <em>Alsop </em>states, in relevant part, \u201cTo take, or attempt to take, \u2018by intimidation\u2019 means wilfully to take, or attempt to take, in such a way that would put an <em>ordinary, reasonable person </em>in fear of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The <em>Devitt &amp; Blackmar </em>instruction adds that \u201cA taking \u2018by intimidation\u2019 must be established by proof of one or more acts or statements, ... under such circumstances, as would produce in the ordinary person fear of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Devitt &amp; Blackmar </em>\u00a7 44.05 (emphasis added). We believe that the instruction as modified in <em>Alsop </em>more accurately states the law. As in <em>Alsop, </em>however, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in giving instruction \u00a7 44.05 from <em>Devitt &amp; Blackmar. </em>To avoid needless appeals, district courts should, in place of <em>Devitt &amp; Blackmar </em>\u00a7 44.05, give the modified version found in <em>Alsop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-19\">Finally, Hopkins argues that he was materially prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jpry on the lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>offense of attempted bank larceny. There is no general federal \u201cattempt\u201d statute. A defendant therefore can only be found guilty of an attempt to commit a federal offense if the statute defining the offense also expressly proscribes an attempt. <em>United States v. Joe, </em>452 F.2d 653, 654 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 931, 92 S.Ct. 1797, 32 L.Ed.2d 134 (1972). The bank larceny statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), does not mention attempts. The district court therefore properly refused to give appellant\u2019s proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">The judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
