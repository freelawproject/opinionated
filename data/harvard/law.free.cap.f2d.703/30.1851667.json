Emmet Clarie, Judge), affirming the dismissal of their consolidated petitions for writs of habeas corpus. The petitions claim that Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 18-7a, which increases the good time credit per year for inmates sentenced on or after October 1, 1976, discriminates against prisoners sentenced prior to that date, including petitioners, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">Frazier was originally sentenced on July 3, 1975 by the Connecticut Superior Court in Fairfield County to a term of not less than 54 nor more than 108 years, following his conviction of several criminal counts. On December 8,1976, he was resentenced to a term of not less than 30 years nor more than 60 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">On July 3, 1973, Schaffer was sentenced to a term of 17 years to life by the Superior Court after his conviction for murder. Both appellants are currently serving their sentences and the Connecticut Commissioner of Corrections is computing good , time credit on their sentences based on the provisions of Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 18-7 which applies to persons sentenced before October 1, 1976.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">While appellants were serving these sentences, the Connecticut legislature enacted Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 18-7a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which applies only to prisoners sentenced on or after October 1, 1976, its effective date, and provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>more good time credit per year than its predecessor, \u00a7 18-7. A prisoner sentenced before October 1, 1976 who maintains a good conduct and work record receives under \u00a7 18-7 110 days of good time for each year of the first five years of a sentence and about 140 days for each subsequent year. On the other hand, a prisoner sentenced on or after October 1, 1976, with a similar conduct and work record, receives 120 days of good time for each year of the first five years of a sentence and 180 days for each subsequent year. Thus, the effect of Connecticut\u2019s non-retroactive enlargement of good time benefits is to subject two persons convicted of the same offense and sentenced to the same maximum term to different periods of incarceration, depending on whether they were sentenced before or after October 1, 1976. Frazier and Schaffer argue that this statutory classification arbitrarily discriminates against persons sentenced before October 1, 1976, and thus violates their right to equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Each appellant exhausted his available state remedies by prosecuting unsuccessful appeals in the Connecticut courts. The Connecticut Supreme Court applied a \u201crational basis\u201d test to the statutory classification and rejected the equal protection claim. <em>Frazier v. Manson, </em>176 Conn. 638, 410 A.2d 475 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court found that the purpose of \u00a7 18-7a was a rational one, i.e., \u201cto consolidate good time statutes and to eliminate multiple systems of computing and crediting good time,\u201d thereby eliminating disparity in good time eligibility based on the type of sentence imposed or the institution in which an inmate might be incarcerated. However, the court did not expressly explain how this or any other rational purpose was served by discriminating in the amount of good time credits between persons sentenced before and after October 1, 1976. It merely cited two decisions of the Rhode Island Supreme Court holding that retroactive extension of enlarged good time benefits would amount to encroachment by the legislature on the sentencing authority of the judiciary. See <em>Opinion to the Governor, </em>91 R.I. 187, 162 A.2d 814 (1960), and <em>Mastracchio v. Superior Court, </em>98 R.I. 111, 200 A.2d 10, <em>cert. denied, </em>379 .U.S. 852, 85 S.Ct. 96, 13 L.Ed.2d 55 (1964). In addition, the Connecticut Supreme Court found that \u201c \u2018[t]he seeming inequity in fixing a cut-off date is outbalanced by the factors of reliance and burden on the administration of justice which argue for prospective application only. <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 300-01 [87 S.Ct. 1967, 1971-72, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199] (1967).\u2019 \u201d 410 A.2d at 481 (quoting <em>Mirenda v. Ulibarri, </em>351 F.Supp. 676, 677 (C.D.Cal.1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">After rejection of their equal protection claim by the Connecticut Supreme Court, Frazier and Schaffer filed their present federal petitions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, which were consolidated and referred to Magistrate F. Owen Eagan. He recommended that they be dismissed on the ground that the nonretroactivity of \u00a7 18-7a could be rationally justified as furthering the legitimate state purpose of avoiding a legislative modification of a judicial sentence in contravention of Connecticut\u2019s constitutional separation of powers. Judge Clarie approved the magistrate\u2019s recommended ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Legislation that does not employ suspect classifications or impinge on fundamental rights must be upheld under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when the legislative means are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. <em>Clements v. Fashing, </em>- U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 2836, 2843, 73 L.Ed.2d 508 (1982); <em>Schweiker v. Wilson, </em>450 U.S. 221, 230, 101 S.Ct. 1074, 1080, 67 L.Ed.2d 186 (1981); <em>Buffalo Teachers Federation, Inc. v. Helsby, </em>676 F.2d 28, 29 (2d Cir.1982) (per curiam). Appellants argue that since good time credits affect the length of incar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ceration they impinge on a protected liberty interest and as such should be analyzed under the strict scrutiny standard that requires a compelling state necessity to sustain a discriminatory classification. We disagree. In <em>McGinnis v. Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 93 S.Ct. 1055, 35 L.Ed.2d 282 (1973), the Court inquired into the constitutionality of bestowing good time credits on some prisoners but not on others and concluded that \u201c[t]he determination of an optimal time for parole eligibility elicited multiple legislative classifications and groupings, which ... require only some rational basis to sustain them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 93 S.Ct. at 1059. In accord, <em>Doyle v. Elsea, </em>658 F.2d 512, 518 (7th Cir.1981); <em>United States ex rel. Sero </em>v. <em>Preiser, </em>372 F.Supp. 660, 671 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d in part and remanded in part, </em>506 F.2d 1115 (2d Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 921, 95 S.Ct. 1587, 43 L.Ed.2d 789 (1975); <em>cf. Marshall v. United States, </em>414 U.S. 417, 422, 94 S.Ct. 700, 704, 38 L.Ed.2d 618 (1974); see also <em>Haag v. Ward, </em>632 F.2d 206, 208 (2d Cir.1980) (per curiam); <em>Dillard v. LaVallee, </em>559 F.2d 873, 874 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 999, 98 S.Ct. 641, 54 L.Ed.2d 495 (1977). While good time credits do affect the length of incarceration, implicating a protected liberty interest, <em>cf. Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 556-57, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2974-75, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), the state\u2019s equally important interests, including promotion of discipline and rehabilitation, militate against a compelling necessity test, <em>McGinnis v. Royster, </em>410 U.S. at 274-76, 93 S.Ct. at 1061-62; <em>Abrahams v. Rodgers, </em>691 F.2d 87, 88 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Appellants attempt to distinguish <em>McGinnis </em>on the ground that it dealt with good time credits relevant to computing minimum terms and parole eligibility, whereas here the good time computation affects maximum terms and discharge. However, the <em>McGinnis </em>court knew that the good time differences at issue there affected the time of release of prisoners to the community, resulting in longer incarceration for those in county jail custody without good time credits than for those in state prison. <em>Id. </em>410 U.S. at 267, 93 S.Ct. at 1058; <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Elsea, supra, </em>658 F.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In applying the rational basis test to determine whether the discriminatory classification under attack serves some legitimate purpose, we look first to expressions by the legislature on the subject. However, we need not necessarily stop there since \u201cthe search for the \u2018actual\u2019 or \u2018primary\u2019 purpose of a statute is likely to be elusive.\u201d <em>Michael M. v. Sonoma County Superior Court, </em>450 U.S. 464, 469-70, 101 S.Ct. 1200, 1204-05, 67 L.Ed.2d 437 (1981); <em>McGinnis v. Royster, supra, </em>410 U.S. at 276-77, 93 S.Ct. at 1062-63. If there are no articulated purposes or if those expressed do not appear to be pertinent or exclusive, it is our function, through examination of the surrounding circumstances, including the legislative history of the statute, and application of logic, to decide whether the legislative classification was a \u201cdeliberate, considered choice\u201d rather than \u201cthe result of inadvertence or ignorance,\u201d <em>Schweiker v. Wilson, </em>450 U.S. 221, 235-36, 101 S.Ct. 1074, 1083-84, 67 L.Ed.2d 186 (1981), and, if so, whether the legislature \u201ccould have concluded rationally\u201d that the discrimination was justifiable and \u201ccould rationally have distinguished\u201d between the classifications under attack. <em>McGinnis v. Royster, supra, </em>410 U.S. at 274, 93 S.Ct. at 1061. In short, we then search for \u201ca legitimate purpose that we may reasonably presume to have motivated an impartial legislature.\u201d <em>United States Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 180-81, 101 S.Ct. 453, 461-62, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring). It may logically be inferred from a considered choice that the legislature acted to further some particular purpose. <em>Schweiker v. Wilson, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 236, 101 S.Ct. at 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Applying these principles here, the articulated purpose of \u00a7 18-7a, to eliminate multiple systems of computing and crediting good time that existed prior to 1976 because of different good time standards for different institutions in the state, while certainly a legitimate state purpose, does not justify the creation of a dual system for calculating good time based on date of sentence. The denial of the new good time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>standards to pre-October 1976 prisoners is irrelevant to the legislature\u2019s expressed purpose, which would have been achieved with equal effectiveness if the new standards had been made retroactive. Yet the legislature deliberately chose to exclude from the enlargement of good time benefits all persons sentenced prior to October 1, 1976. The enacted statute expressly states that it applies only to \u201cperson[s] sentenced to a term of imprisonment, on and after October 1, 1976.\u201d Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 18-7a(a). Furthermore, the legislative history, though sparse, confirms the deliberateness of the nonretroaetivity provision. See, e.g., Conn.Gen. Assembly, Raised Committee Bill No. 5125, \u00a7 3 (\u201cThis act shall not apply to those persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to the effective date of this act. Said persons shall continue their eligibility for such credit as was provided for prior to the effective date of this act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Absent any evidence that the legislature lacked a legitimate reason for the distinction or acted for an unlawful purpose, we may explore other rational justifiable bases. The state offers the justification advanced by it to the Connecticut Supreme Court and accepted by that court, i.e., that retroactivity would impose an excessive administrative burden on it. See <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 300, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1971, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); <em>Jackson v. Alabama, </em>530 F.2d 1231, 1238 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Mirenda v. Ulibarri, </em>351 F.Supp. 676, 677 (C.D.Cal.1972). We find this contention unpersuasive. Since this case was heard in the state and federal courts upon stipulated facts without an evidentiary hearing, we are presented with no actual findings as to the extent of the administrative burden. The sole support offered by the state is an affidavit by one Donald Parker, a research analyst for the Department of Corrections, indicating that there were approximately 4,000 persons under sentence in Connecticut when \u00a7 18-7a became effective. However, this untested document makes no attempt to attest to the actual burden of recalculating the good time that would be earned under the new liberal terms of \u00a7 18-7a if it applied to the 4,000-odd pre-October 1976 inmates in Connecticut jails. Given today\u2019s computer facilities, which Connecticut should be able to put at its disposal, we may reasonably infer that \u201c \u2018[a]ny supposed administrative inconvenience would be minimal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>399 U.S. 235, 245, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 2024, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970) (quoting <em>Rinaldi v. Yeager, </em>384 U.S. 305, 310, 86 S.Ct. 1497, 1500, 16 L.Ed.2d 577 (1966)). The constitutional imperatives of the Equal Protection Clause cannot be satisfied by mere conjecture as to administrative inconvenience. See <em>Williams v. Illinois, supra, </em>399 U.S. at 245, 90 S.Ct. at 2024.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Notwithstanding the inadequacy of the administrative convenience rationale offered by the state, the legislature\u2019s classification may be justified by a legitimate discernible purpose which was suggested by the Connecticut Supreme Court and relied upon by the district court \u2014 the avoidance of encroachment by the legislature on the judiciary\u2019s sentencing authority. The legislature could reasonably have relied upon the fact that in imposing sentence a judge frequently takes into account existing systems of computing good time. It could then have determined that the more liberal method of awarding good time credits under \u00a7 18-7a should not be made retroactive for the reason that if it had been in effect prior to October 1, 1976, longer sentences would have been imposed initially upon appellants and other similarly situated prisoners. We therefore conclude that it was rational for the Connecticut legislature to avoid a retroactive legislative modification of judicial sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">We need not decide whether the Connecticut legislature\u2019s reluctance to intrude on judicial sentencing powers is constitutionally mandated under Connecticut\u2019s separation of powers provision, Conn.Const. art. II, nor under art. IV, \u00a7 13, which vests the pardoning and clemency powers in the executive and not the legislature. See Comment, <em>Today\u2019s Law and Yesterday\u2019s Crime: Retroactive Application of Ameliorative Criminal Legislation, </em>121 U.Pa.L.Rev. 120, 145-47, 150 (1972). Nor is our decision affected by the Connecticut legislature\u2019s grant on two occasions of other benefits to prisoners retroactively. See Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 18-98a and 18-98b. To our knowledge, these stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>utes have not been challenged as violative of Connecticut\u2019s constitutional separation of powers. Moreover, even if the legislature might have granted some benefits retroactively it was not required to do so when it appeared to have a legitimate reason for denying them, as in this case. For the same reason we are unpersuaded by the decision of the Massachusetts legislature to confer enlarged good time benefits on prisoners sentenced prior to an act\u2019s effective date, for time served after that date, apparently also without challenge under Massachusetts\u2019 constitutional separation of powers provision. See <em>Comerford v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, </em>233 F.2d 294, 295 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 899, 77 S.Ct. 141, 1 L.Ed.2d 90 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We are not persuaded to deny rationality to the statute here under attack merely because the Assistant Attorney General of Connecticut has disavowed the legislative encroachment rationale for the challenged classification, apparently because he fears that such a ruling would jeopardize the legislature\u2019s power to grant retroactive relief when appropriate. The fact that retroactivity may be permissible under other circumstances does not preclude the legislature from denying it where a rational basis exists for such action. While it is reasonable to accord some deference to the executive\u2019s view of legislative intent in order to support a statute against constitutional challenge, we need not reject a plausible, legitimate purpose that rationally supports a statutory classification simply because, for tactical reasons, the state agent charged with enforcement of the statute disdains that purpose. We are particularly reluctant to do so when it appears that the highest court of the state impliedly subscribes to the rationale. <em>Frazier v. Manson, supra, </em>410 A.2d at 480 (citing decisions of Rhode Island Supreme Court in <em>Mastracchio v. Superior Court, supra, </em>and <em>Opinion to the Governor, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u201c[Tjhere is no requirement that two persons convicted of the same offense receive identical sentences.\u201d <em>Williams v. Illinois, supra, </em>399 U.S. at 243, 90 S.Ct. at 2023. A legislature may prospectively reduce the maximum penalty for a crime even though prisoners sentenced to the maximum penalty before the effective date of the act would serve a longer term of imprisonment than one sentenced to the maximum term thereafter. Similarly, the legislature may award enlarged good time benefits prospectively only when such prospective application rationally furthers a legitimate state purpose. See <em>Jackson v. Alabama, </em>530 F.2d 1231, 1238 (5th Cir.1976); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Cupp, </em>452 F.2d 1091, 1093 (9th Cir.1971); <em>Comerford </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 F.2d 294, 295 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 899, 77 S.Ct. 141, 1 L.Ed.2d 90 (1956); <em>United States ex rel.
