(Cochise).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment relieves the trustee from liability for his actions in collecting and using payments under installment land contracts between Cochise and a nationwide class of land purchasers. We have jurisdiction under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47(a) (1976) (repealed 1978). We conclude that the bankruptcy court\u2019s analysis of the complex transactions involved in this case may have led to improper conclusions about the ownership of the payments received on the land sale contracts and that it applied incorrect legal standards in evaluating the trustee\u2019s alleged misconduct. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>PACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">In the late sixties, Cochise, an Arizona corporation, acquired an equity interest in several thousand acres of \u201cbarren desert land\u201d in southwestern Arizona. <em>DeMarco v. Security Planning Service, Inc., </em>462 F.Supp. 1066, 1069 (D.Ariz.1978). Naming the area Cochise College Park, Cochise platted subdivisions of the property but made only minimal improvements, failing to provide such necessaries as roads, streets, water, and electricity. Cochise then conducted a nationwide sales campaign to induce individuals to purchase lots in the various subdivisions. The sales were almost all on the installment basis with small downpayments and five-to-eight year terms to pay the balance in monthly payments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">Before its bankruptcy in mid-1972, Cochise entered into thousands of land sale contracts, in each of which Cochise promised to transfer a warranty deed to a particular real estate lot and to construct certain improvements. In return, the purchaser promised to pay sums of money at times certain. Until final payment, Cochise held on to the deed or, where the deed had been delivered prior to final payment, took a mortgage on the lot. The operative documents for each sale included a land sale contract, a promissory note, a warranty deed, and in some cases a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">In some instances, Cochise sold and assigned the promissory notes and mortgages executed in connection with the land sale contracts to other persons. The assigneepurchasers of these promissory notes comprise the Hall class, which is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-8\">In other cases, Cochise retained the notes and mortgages and collected payments on the notes, either directly or through an independent collection service, Computer Graphics, Inc. The land sale vendees whose promissory notes and mortgages were retained comprise the Baldrian class, the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-9\">Despite Cochise\u2019s promises to the land sale vendees to improve the Cochise College Park to support the construction of livable residential dwellings, Cochise never provided any of the services or amenities common to residential property. 462 F.Supp. at 1069. By mid-1972, after five years of development and the sale of over 4,000 lots, no streets and none of the improvements necessary to support livable houses had been installed in Cochise College Park. Only 20 homes were built on the entire tract of land. <em>Id. </em>at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-11\">On June 5, 1972, a petition for involuntary bankruptcy was filed against Cochise. The next day, June 6, 1972, Cochise filed a voluntary petition for corporate reorganization under Chapter X of the Act. Soon after, Perry was appointed trustee and attempted to continue the operations of Cochise under Chapter X. On June 7, 1973, the reorganization proceedings were dismissed, and Cochise was adjudicated a bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-12\">As trustee, Perry came into possession of the contractual documents respecting the land sale transactions between members of the Baldrian class and Cochise. Perry soon recognized the uncertainty and instability of the Cochise operations and reported to the court on September 1, 1972 that \u201chis investigation ... revealed that there is unknown an extremely sizable obligation due to a large number of prospective purchasers of lots of the debtor who were sold with rights of rescission.\u201d Nonetheless, from the date of his appointment until well after the adjudication of Cochise as a bankrupt on June 7, 1973, Perry repeatedly told members of the Baldrian class that they had to continue making payments on the promissory notes to protect their rights and threatened to foreclose on the mortgaged lots if payments were not made. Perry stated to at least some of the Baldrian class members that payments were being held in a separate \u201ctrust\u201d account, were not -being disbursed to any third parties, and were being applied against the outstanding obligations of the vendees. He stated that he was \u201cmaking every effort to have the company operate on a normal basis.\u201d Members of the Baldrian class paid a total of at least $134,000 on the notes before and after the bankruptcy filing on June 5, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>Initially, Perry apparently had some doubts about the ownership of funds received on the unassigned notes. On June 16, 1972, he obtained a restraining order enjoining Computer Graphics and others from disbursing any funds \u201cuntil appropriate litigation can be instituted to determine the rights of the trustee in and to any promissory notes, and any funds collected in connection with said notes.\u201d Nevertheless, on Octoher 24, 1972, without notice to the Baldrian class members, Perry requested and obtained an order requiring Computer Graphics to turn over to the estate all payments it had collected on the notes, less annual collection fees. Subsequently, in the liquidation proceeding, Perry obtained an ex parte order permitting him to pay administrative expenses with funds in his possession and proceeded to use the monies received on the notes to pay costs of administering the estate, including his own trustee\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">On October 6, 1975, the Hall class filed a complaint against Perry, seeking a determination of \u201cthe propriety, right and authority\u201d of Perry to \u201cuse, appropriate, or disburse funds in his custody or under his control that comprised ... payments by lot purchasers\u201d on notes that had not been assigned to members of the Hall class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">The Baldrian class moved to intervene in the Hall class action. The bankruptcy court, agreeing with Baldrian that common issues of law and fact were presented, permitted intervention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Baldrian class alleged that Perry did not have title to payments made on the unassigned notes and also that he was personally liable for fraud, negligence, and conversion with respect to the collection of the note payments. The class sought return to it of all payments made on the promissory notes, together with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">Perry moved for summary judgment against the Baldrian class. The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for Perry, holding that title to all of the funds was vested in the trustee and that the trustee was not liable to the Baldrian class on grounds of fraud,\u2019 negligence, or conversion. The district court affirmed, and the Baldrian class now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A7K\">A grant of summary judgment is proper only if no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Bankr. Rule 756 (effective October 1,1973) (making Fed. R.Civ.P. 56 applicable in all bankruptcy adversary proceedings); <em>In re Southland Supply Inc., </em>657 F.2d 1076, 1080 (9th Cir.1981). The evidence and inferences that may be drawn from it must be construed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Beckham v. Safeco Insurance Co. of America, </em>691 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">The Baldrian class, in their first set of claims, allege that Perry is wrongfully withholding from members of the class payments made on promissory notes signed by them as part of their land sale contracts with Cochise. The bankruptcy court held that the appellants had raised no issue of material fact as to the ownership of the payments, since as a matter of law the trustee \u201chad title to all funds received as paid-in on unassigned notes from whatever time, for all purposes.\u201d The bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the trustee on this ground was plainly incorrect, since the court failed to recognize that dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>ferent legal consequences might pertain if the contracts of the class members were executory, depending upon when the payments had been received. Since the answers to interrogatories and affidavits before the bankruptcy court appear to establish that at least some, if not all, of the contracts between Baldrian class members and Cochise were executory on June 5,1972, and that some if not all of the payments were received after June 5, 1972, the case must be remanded for further proceedings. The trial court must determine, as to each land sale contract, whether the contract was executory on June 5, 1972, <em>see infra </em>Part I, and, if so, when payments, if any, on that contract were received, <em>see infra </em>Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">The second set of claims allege affirmative misconduct by the trustee. Here, again, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for the trustee. The court held that the answers to interrogatories and affidavits before it raised no genuine issue of material fact concerning the personal liability of the trustee to the appellants for misconduct, because his acts either were not willful or were authorized by statute or by the court. This conclusion was unwarranted, since the answers to interrogatories and affidavits before the bankruptcy court raise genuine questions of material fact regarding the trustee\u2019s compliance with his fiduciary duty to the Baldrian class and concerning the existence of actionable misrepresentations by the trustee. The case must be remanded for further proceedings. The bankruptcy court must determine (1) whether, as to each land sale contract, the contract was executory on June 5,1972, <em>see infra </em>Part I, and, if so, whether the trustee had in fact decided before August 6, 1973, to reject that contract, <em>see infra </em>Part III(A); and (2) whether, as to each land sale contract, the land purchaser made any payments on the contract in reliance on fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations by the trustee, <em>see infra </em>Part III(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">I. <em>Nature of the Land Sale Contracts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">The legal nature of the contractual relations between the members of the Baldrian class and Cochise on the date of the bankruptcy filing is of crucial importance in this case. If the contract between Cochise and a lot purchaser upon which payments were made was a fully executed contract on that date, then all payments on that note vested in the trustee. <em>See infra </em>Part 11(A). If the contract was executory, however, other consequences follow. <em>See infra </em>Part 11(B). Whether the land sale contracts were executed or executory also affects the liability of the trustee for misconduct. <em>See infra </em>Part III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">Without considering whether any of the land sale contracts were executory on June 5, 1972, the bankruptcy court entered summary judgment for defendant, even though the answers to interrogatories and facts sworn to in affidavits before the court tend to establish that some if not all of the contracts were executory. This being error, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">Seeking to sustain the grant of summary judgment, Perry argues that all of the contracts upon which payments were made were, as a matter of law, fully executed, not executory on June 5, 1972. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">Perry first contends that in each case the contract upon which payments were made comprised only the promissory note signed by the Baldrian class member, pursuant to which the class member promised to pay specified sums at times certain. Perry argues that any obligations of Cochise to convey a deed to the lot or to construct roads for and to provide utility connections to the purchased lot were commitments by Cochise that were not part of that promissory note \u201ccontract.\u201d We reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">A \u201cpromissory note\u201d is itself merely a \u201cpromise or engagement, in writing, to pay a specified sum at a time therein limited ... to a person therein named, or to his order, or bearer.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1093 (rev. 5th ed. 1979). A \u201ccontract,\u201d by contrast, is an agreement between two persons \u201cwhich creates an obligation to do or not to do a particular thing\u201d and comprises promises by both parties to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>certain obligations. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92; <em>see Shattuck v. Precision-Toyota, Inc., </em>115 Ariz. 586, 588-89, 566 P.2d 1332, 1334-35 (1977) (valid contract requires mutual irrevocable promises by both parties). A promissory note, standing alone, is not a contract at all, because, simply put, it embodies only one of the mutual promises necessary to create a contract. It evidences only one side of the bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">The existence of a promissory note on any given date, therefore, is not in and of itself proof that the payments on the note are in performance of an executed contract. Since payments on a promissory note are merely the performance of one side of the bargain, the note must be examined in conjunction with the <em>other </em>undertakings that, together with the promissory note, constitute the relevant contract of which the promissory note is but a part to determine what commitments remain to be performed by the parties. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Latourrette-Fical Co., </em>37 Ariz. 265, 270, 293 P. 973, 976 (1930) (contract to sell farm unit in subdivision determined to include not only note and mortgage but also covenant to furnish water to subdivision). Each land sale contract did not, and by definition could not, consist solely of the promissory note.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">Perry also argues that even if the contracts here between the members of the Baldrian class and Cochise encompassed both the promissory notes and various obligations of Cochise, in any event, the contracts with the purchasers were not \u201cexecutory\u201d contracts under the terms of the Act. We reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">An \u201cexecutory\u201d contract under the Act is one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-10\">under which the obligations of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed [at the moment of filing] that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing the performance of the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\"><em>In re Select-A-Seat Corp., </em>625 F.2d 290, 292 (9th Cir.1980) (per curiam) (quoting from <em>Jenson v. Continental Financial Corp., </em>591 F.2d 477, 481 (8th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-12\">Under this standard, the answers to interrogatories and affidavits raise a material issue of fact as to whether some if not all of the contracts between Cochise and the purchasers constituted executory contracts upon June 5, 1972, the date of the filing. The record shows that some if not all of the land sale contracts encompassed both obligations of the purchaser to make various payments at times certain <em>and </em>obligations of Cochise to deliver the deed to the lot to the purchaser, to release the mortgage, if any, on that lot upon completion of payments on the promissory note, and to construct various improvements. Under these circumstances, the failure of Cochise to develop the land as promised or to convey a warranty deed to the purchaser could each constitute a material breach excusing performance by the land purchaser of his re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>maining obligations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Likewise, the failure of any given land purchaser to make payments on his promissory note could constitute a material breach \u00a1excusing Cochise from completing its performances under the land sale contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, in all likelihood, some if not all of the land sale contracts here were executory on June 5, 1972.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1393-4\">The mere fact that the promissory notes presented to Cochise under the land sale contracts could be assigned to third parties does not change this conclusion. Although a real estate lessee typically is free to assign his leasehold interest to a third party, the ability of a lessee to assign the leasehold interest <em>(i.e., </em>the right to receive the use of certain real estate for a time certain) has never been thought to transform an unexpired real estate lease, a typical example of an executory contract, from an executory into an executed contract. <em>See, e.g., Palmer v. Palmer, </em>104 F.2d 161, 162-63 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 U.S. 590, 60 S.Ct. 120, 84 L.Ed. 494 (1939); 4A J. Moore &amp; L. King, <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 70.44[1], at 539 (14th ed. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-10\">Since some if not all of the land sale contracts were probably executory on June 5, 1972, it is probable that the ownership of the payments received by the trustee as well as the trustee\u2019s conduct must be evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>ated under the principles governing executory \u2014 -as opposed to executed \u2014 contracts. Since under bankruptcy law, transactions involving executory contracts give rise to different legal consequences from those involving executed contracts, granting summary judgment on those issues without deciding whether the contracts were or were not executory was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">II. <em>Ownership of Payments.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">Appellants challenge the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that title to all payments on the promissory notes signed as part of land sale contracts vested in the trustee. They contend that since title to executory contracts does not vest in the trustee until the trustee affirms those contracts and since the trustee here never affirmed any of the contracts, the trustee does not have title to the payments received pursuant to those contracts. Perry contends that since Cochise had title to the promissory notes, Perry was vested with title to the notes on June 5,1972, the date of filing of the original petition in bankruptcy, and, <em>ipso facto, </em>has title to any funds generated on those notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-6\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that ownership of the funds received on the contracts flowed from the trustee\u2019s purported taking of title to the promissory notes was incorrect. Rather, the ownership of payments depends on (a) whether the land sale contract on which the payments were made was executory on June 5, 1972; and (b), if so, when the payments were in fact received. Since the bankruptcy court made no distinction between executory and executed contracts, the case must be remanded for further proceedings. To guide the determinations on remand, we outline how payments made by the Baldrian class members must be treated, depending on the facts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1394-8\">A. <em>Payments on Contracts That Were Non-Executory on June 5, 1972.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1394-9\">The trustee properly took title on behalf of the estate to all payments received on any land sale contract that was fully executed on June 5, 1972, regardless of whether payments were made before or after June 5, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-10\">Sections 70a(5), 186 of the Act provide that a reorganization or bankruptcy trustee is vested by operation of law as of the date of filing with title to all \u201cproperty . .. which prior to the filing of the petition [the bankrupt] could by any means have transferred, or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him, or otherwise seized, impounded, or sequestered.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 110(a)(5), 586 (1976). Such property includes cash and the like possessed by the bankrupt on the date of filing, whether held by the bankrupt himself, <em>e.g., In re Tudor, </em>100 F. 796, 797 (D.Colo.1900) (money), or by an agent on the bankrupt\u2019s behalf, <em>e.g., In re Tele-Tone Radio Corp., </em>133 F.Supp. 739, 744 (D.N.J.1955) (bank account). On June 5, 1972, the trustee was vested with title to all cash held by Cochise or by Computer Graphics on Cochise\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-11\">Property passing to the trustee under section 70a(5) also includes executed contracts between the bankrupt and third parties and any proceeds or right to proceeds still due. <em>E.g, Hudson v. Wylie, </em>242 F.2d 435, 447 (9th Cir.1957) (contract right to collect money based on performance of services by bankrupt that were completed before filing); <em>In re Hannan, </em>127 F.2d 894, 897 (7th Cir.1942) (contract right to receive commissions for services of bankrupt rendered prior to filing); <em>In re Duncan, </em>148 F. 464, 469 (D.S.C.1906) (promissory note of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>bankrupt\u2019s employer based on services of bankrupt rendered prior to filing). On June 5, 1972, the trustee was vested with both executed land sale contracts, if any, and the right to further payments, if any.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">B. <em>Payments on Contracts That Were Executory on June 5, 1972.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">Payments received by Cochise, Perry, or Computer Graphics on land sale contracts that were executory at the time of filing did not necessarily vest in the trustee as property of the estate. The ownership and treatment of each of those payments, and claims arising therefrom, vary according to the date upon which the particular payment was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-7\">1. <em>Payments Received Before June 5, 1972.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">Payments received by Cochise or by Computer Graphics before June 5, 1972 on land sale contracts that were executory on June 5, 1972 were property of the bankrupt. Title to those payments vested in the trustee as of the date of filing of the original petition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Act \u00a7\u00a7 70a(5), 186 (1976). <em>Compare In re Superior Motor Truck Co., </em>275 F. 623, 624 (N.D.Ga.1921) (payments to seller received by seller prior to filing held by bankrupt seller as his property not \u201con any sort of trust, or as the property of the buyer,\u201d even though trucks not delivered prior to filing) <em>with Gulf Petroleum, S.A. v. Collazo, </em>316 F.2d 257, 261 (1st Cir.1963) (pre-filing payments to seller of land to be held <em>in escrow </em>by bankrupt seller until closing of sale must be returned to buyer, where trustee rejects executory land sale contract before closing).</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-12\">While Perry has title to all prefiling payments, appellants, of course, have claims against the estate arising from payments made prior to filing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>payments are property of the estate, Perry had no duty to notify the payors before using those funds to pay administrative expenses or other claims against the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">2. <em>Payments Received On or After June 5, 1972 and Before August 6, 1973.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">Payments received on executory contracts on or after the date of filing but prior to August 6, 1973 became property of the estate yet give rise to administrative expense claims against the estate in the amount of those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">An executory contract of the bankrupt vests in the trustee, if at all, only if the trustee affirms the contract. <em>Palmer v. Palmer, </em>104 F.2d 161, 163 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 U.S. 590, 60 S.Ct. 120, 84 L.Ed. 494 (1939); 4A J. Moore &amp; L. King, <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>170.43[2], at 524-25 (14th ed. 1978). Until rejection, however, the ex-ecutory contract continues in effect and the non-bankrupt party to the executory contract is not a creditor with a provable claim against the bankrupt estate. <em>See Mohonk Realty Corp. v. Wise Shoe Stores, Inc., </em>Ill F.2d 287, 290 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>311 U.S. 654, 61 S.Ct. 47, 85 L.Ed. 418 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">Where a bankrupt is in reorganization under Chapter X, the trustee need not affirm or reject an executory contract until a reorganization plan is submitted. 6 J. Moore &amp; L. King, <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 3.23[6], at 580 (14th ed. 1978); <em>see In re American National Trust, </em>426 F.2d 1059, 1064 (7th Cir.1970); <em>Mohonk Realty, </em>111 F.2d at 290. If the trustee fails to adopt the executory contract in the reorganization plan, the contract is deemed rejected, as of the date a petition was originally filed under the Act. <em>See In re Gravure Paper &amp; Board Corp., </em>234 F.2d 928, 930-31 (3d Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-11\">Where the bankrupt estate is in liquidation, the trustee to affirm an executory contract must do so by the later of the date 30 days after the trustee\u2019s appointment and the date 60 days after the adjudication of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 70b, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(b) (1976). If the trustee fails to affirm the contract during that period, it is deemed rejected as of the date of the original filing of a petition under the Act.

Thus, in this case, all of the land sale contracts that were executory on June 5,1972 were rejected by operation of law on August 6, 1973, effective June 5, 1972, and hence were breached by Cochise as of June 5, 1972.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The lot purchasers whose contracts were executory on June 5, 1972 were therefore not obligated to make payments on the notes after June 5, 1972, the date of the breach of those contracts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, some of the purchasers here did continue to make payments on the executory contracts after the date of the breach of the underlying contract but before the date upon which the rejection took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">Payments on a rejected executory contract made after the rejection takes place are not property of the estate. <em>See infra </em>Part 11(B)(3). Since title to such contracts does not vest in the trustee, the trustee has no right to enforce them. The Bankruptcy Act does not address, however, the status of payments that are made to the trustee after the effective date of rejection but before rejection has occurred by action of the trustee or by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-9\">Appellants contend that payments made on an executory contract in the period between the June 5, 1972 filing and the August 6, 1973 rejection should be treated <em>not </em>as property of the estate but as property held by the trustee in a constructive trust for the purchasers pending rejection. Under this approach, where the executory contract is affirmed, the payments at the moment of affirmance become property of the estate. On the other hand, where the executory contract is ultimately rejected, the interim payments are returned dollar-for-dollar to the purchasers. Under this theory, the use of such payments to pay the administrative expenses of the estate would be improper since the payments never become property of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>Perry argues in response that payments made in the interim between the original filing and rejection or affirmance should be treated the same as payments on executed contracts. Under Perry\u2019s theory, the lot purchasers are as to these payments mere general creditors of the bankrupt estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">We reject both positions. In light of the policies underlying the treatment of executory contracts under the Act, we conclude that payments received by the trustee on an executory contract during the period between the date of filing and the date of rejection do become property of the estate. However, these payments give rise to claims against the estate of an administrative expense priority in the amount of the reasonable value of the consideration tendered to the trustee. In reaching this conclusion, we find support both in previous case law and in the policies underlying the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">This treatment of executory contracts is supported by the well-settled principles governing treatment of creditors of a bankrupt who confer benefit on the bankrupt estate after the date of filing of a bankruptcy petition. Where the consideration supporting the claimant\u2019s right to payment is both supplied to and beneficial to the trustee in the operation of the bankrupt\u2019s post-filing business, the consideration becomes property of the estate but the right to payment is accorded first priority under section 64a(l) of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See </em>4A J. Moore &amp; L. King, <em>Collier on Bankruptey </em>170.43, at 524 (14th ed. 1978); <em>cf. In re Health Maintenance Foundation, </em>680 F.2d 619, 621 (9th Cir.1982) (denying priority to severance pay claims based on consideration that was neither supplied to nor beneficial to trustee, since services of claimant had been provided to bankrupt prior to bankruptcy); <em>120 Wall Associates v. Schilling, </em>266 F.2d 548, 550 (2d Cir.1959) (denying claim for rent where trustee made no use of leasehold).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-11\">This rule is commonly applied in the situation arising when the trustee of a bankrupt lessee continues in possession of the leasehold during the period between the effective date of rejection and the date of the actual act of rejection of the lease. <em>See generally Palmer, </em>104 F.2d at 162-63 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 U.S. 590, 60 S.Ct. 120, 84 L.Ed. 494 (1939); 6 J. Moore &amp; L. King, <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>U 3.23[6.1], at 590-93 (14th ed. 1978). During the period between initial filing under the Act and the rejection of the lease, the trustee is not required to pay or to set aside in trust the rent due under the lease nor to refrain from using the leasehold for the benefit of the estate. <em>See Palmer, </em>104 F.2d at 163; 4A J. Moore &amp; L. King, <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>f 70.44[4], at 550-52 (14th ed. 1978). The lessor obtains, however, a claim with administrative expense priority in the amount of the reasonable value of the leasehold used during the interim period by the trustee for the benefit of the estate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>S. &amp; W. Holding Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number><em>Kuriansky, </em>317 F.2d 666, 667-68 (2d Cir. 1963); <em>see In re First Research Corp., </em>457 F.2d 331, 332 (5th Cir.1972). This special administrative expense priority maintains parity among all of the creditors of an estate who confer benefits on the estate after the date of filing. If a lessor, or for that matter any individual, who confers economic benefit on a bankrupt estate, were not given such a priority, it is likely he would refuse to confer such benefits and would thereby jeopardize the orderly reorganization or administration of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">Moreover, the Act gives the trustee the power to affirm or reject executory contracts on the theory that the value of the consideration still owed to the estate under some executory contracts exceeds the cost of the remaining obligations owed under the contract to the other party. The theory is that advantageous contracts should be affirmed by the trustee as a means of enhancing the likelihood of successful reorganization, or, if the estate is in liquidation, as a means of increasing creditor dividends.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Act provides that any claim arising from the trustee\u2019s post-filing obligations under the contract has an administrative expense priority where the trustee ultimately affirms,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> yet does not specify how payments made to the estate during the period while the trustee is deciding whether to affirm or to reject are to be treated if the trustee subsequently decides to reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-11\">We think the claim for return of such payments must receive a like priority. If payments made after the initial filing but before rejection were not given an administrative priority, a party who owes the bankrupt payments under an executory contract would face the risk that his claim for post-petition payments would be treated as a mere unsecured claim if the executory contract were rejected. A party placed in that situation would often be well-advised to cease making payments, even though he could be sued for breach of contract,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> because he might well recover little or nothing as an unsecured claimant if the trustee rejects. Providing an administrative expense priority for post-filing payments in the event of rejection encourages parties to continue performance of their executory contracts with the debtor during the interim period and thus furthers the statutory policy of encouraging the continued performance of executory contracts which may be beneficial to the estate until the trustee makes his decision.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>In this case, the trustee was entitled to use post-filing payments in the administration of the estate.

The trustee was therefore obligated either to return these monies immediately to the payors, or, at a minimum, to set the monies aside in trust for them. Charged with knowledge of the principles of bankruptcy law, the trustee could not reasonably have believed that he was entitled to use the payments in the administration of the estate.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>extent they have not been returned to the purchasers, these are monies (together with appropriate interest) for which the trustee is personally responsible.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-4\">III. <em>Misconduct of the Trustee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">Appellants contend that to the extent that their recovery against the estate does not satisfy all of their claims against the estate, Perry should be held personally liable for such payments because he failed affirmatively to reject those contracts that were executory and induced all purchasers to continue making payments on the notes by misrepresentations. They argue that the trustee owed a fiduciary duty to the purchasers whose contracts were executory on June 5,1972, requiring him to reject the contracts immediately upon his appointment as Chapter X trustee, since he should have realized that a successful reorganization of Cochise was impossible. They assert that the trustee\u2019s breach of this duty gives rise to his personal liability for any payments made after the date of filing. In addition, they argue that the trustee is personally liable for any payments made in reliance on the trustee\u2019s intentional or negligent misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-6\">The bankruptcy judge and the district court summarily rejected these contentions. We conclude that the bankruptcy judge and district court erred in granting summary judgment on appellants\u2019 claims because they evaluated Perry\u2019s conduct under incorrect legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-9\">A. <em>Liability for Failure to Reject Executory Contracts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-10\">A bankruptcy or reorganization trustee is a fiduciary of each creditor of the estate, including anyone who is a party to an executory contract with the bankrupt. <em>See Wolf v. Weinstein, </em>372 U.S. 633, 650, 83 S.Ct. 969, 979, 10 L.Ed.2d 33 (1963); <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Weaver, </em>680 F.2d 451, 461 (6th Cir.1982); <em>Sherr v.

As such, he has a duty to treat all creditors fairly and to exercise that measure of care and diligence that an ordinarily prudent person under similar circumstances would exercise. Weaver, 680 F.2d at 461; <em>Sherr, </em>552 F.2d 1374; <em>In re Johnson, </em>518 F.2d 246, 251 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 893, 96 S.Ct. 191, 46 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975). Although a trustee is not liable in any manner for mistakes in judgment where discretion is allowed, <em>Mosser v. Darrow, </em>341 U.S. 267, 273-74, 71 S.Ct. 680, 683, 95 L.Ed. 927 (1951); Weaver, 680 F.2d at 461; <em>Sherr, </em>552 F.2d at 1375, he is subject to personal liability for not only intentional but also negligent violations of duties imposed upon him by law, see <em>Mosser, </em>341 U.S. at 272, 274, 71 S.Ct. at 682, 683; <em>Johnson, </em>518 F.2d 246, 251; <em>cf. Leonard v. Vrooman, </em>383 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir.1967) (trustee is personally liable for acts which either are not taken in good faith or are unreasonable).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>While a debtor is in reorganization and for the first 60 days of a bankruptcy proceeding, the decision whether to affirm or reject an executory contract is within the discretion of the trustee.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>See Mohonk Realty Corp. v.

Thus, as long as the trustee remains undecided on whether to affirm or to reject an executory contract and the decision remains in his discretion, the trustee has no duty to creditors to tell them that he is entitled by law to reject that contract. Once the trustee has finally decided to reject an executory contract and therefore not to perform his obligations under that contract, the trustee then comes under a duty to take formal steps to reject it. To fail to do so and thereby permit the creditor to continue to perform after the date of decision to reject directly and unnecessarily injures the creditor<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and is not consonant with conduct of an ordinarily prudent person serving in the capacity of trustee. Such failure therefore gives rise to a claim for damages for which the trustee is personally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-9\">The papers before the bankruptcy court do not disclose whether the trustee had or had not decided before August 6, 1973 to reject some if not all of the land sale contracts that were executory on June 5, 1972. Nevertheless, the bankruptcy court entered summary judgment for the trustee on appellant\u2019s claim of misconduct by the trustee on the ground that the trustee\u2019s conduct was authorized by federal statute. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-10\">If the trustee is found to have decided before August 6, 1973 to reject the executory land sale contracts, the trustee is personally liable to the Baldrian class for damages arising out of this violation of his fiduciary duty. Damages would consist of all payments made post-filing, after the trustee\u2019s decision to reject, less any amount received from the estate.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-11\">B. <em>Liability for Misrepresentations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-12\">Appellants claim that the trustee is personally liable for damages arising from fraudulent and negligent misrepresenta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>tions communicated to Baldrian class members regarding the use and status of payments made on the land sale contracts. The bankruptcy court concluded that the trustee bore no personal liability to the Baldrian class members since the statements were \u201cauthorized and ordered by the court,\u201d were \u201cdemanded of the trustee by congressionally authored statute and controlling case precedent,\u201d or were not made \u201cwilfully and deliberately.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">The Act shields the trustee from liability for a \u201ccommunication\u201d to a creditor of the bankrupt concerning \u201cthe property of the bankrupt\u201d where the communication is uttered \u201cin good faith <em>and </em>with reasonable grounds for belief in its truth.\u201d Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 21i, 11 U.S.G. \u00a7 44(i) (1976) (emphasis added). Where these conditions do not obtain, however, the trustee is liable to the same extent as any other person for damages arising from misrepresentations actionable under the law of the state in which he acts. <em>See Leonard v. Vrooman, </em>383 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir.1967). Thus, where a statement made by the trustee to a land purchaser is otherwise actionable under state law, the trustee is personally liable, despite section 21i of the Act, if the statement was uttered either in bad faith <em>or </em>without reasonable grounds for belief in its truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-6\">Under Arizona law a person is liable in an action in fraud for damages arising from an intentional misrepresentation where all of the following elements exist: \u201c(1) a representation;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> (2) its falsity; (3) the materiality of representation; (4) the speaker\u2019s knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (5) his intent that it be acted upon and in a manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of its falsity; (7) his reliance on its truth; (8) his right to rely thereon, and (9) his consequent and proximate injury.\u201d <em>Carrel v.

App. 565, 568-69, 534 P.2d 1064, 1068 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-9\">Under Arizona law, liability may also arise if a person, in privity with another, makes a false communication without reasonable grounds for belief in its truth where the representation induces a justifiable reliance by the latter, even if the intent and knowledge required for an action in fraud do not obtain. <em>See Van Buren v. Pima Community College District Board, </em>113 Ariz. 85, 87, 546 P.2d 821, 823 (1976); <em>Arizona Title Insurance &amp; Trust Co. v.

In light of the trustee\u2019s fiduciary status vis-avis the purchasers, we have no difficulty concluding that under Arizona law the trustee was in sufficient privity with the purchasers to justify their reliance on statements or intentionally false promises he made in the course of his administration of the estate. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 491-92, 484 P.2d at 644 \u2014 45 (title insurer\u2019s function as disbursing agent for building contractors held to create requisite privity).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-10\">In granting summary judgment for the defendant, the bankruptcy court made no findings that the alleged misrepresentations had been made <em>both </em>in good faith <em>and </em>with reasonable grounds for belief in their truth.

Perry\u2019s contention on appeal that the bankruptcy court improperly allowed the Baldrian class to intervene because the class raised issues outside the scope of the original complaint is meritless.

Perry contends that even if the contracts here between the members of the Baldrian class and Cochise encompassed more than the promissory notes, the only promise by Cochise included in the contract was a promise to convey a deed to the purchasers. He argues, in effect, that as to any purchaser who in fact had received a deed prior to June 5, 1972, the land sale contract was executed on that date, since Cochise\u2019s only remaining obligation was to complete the purely \u201cministerial\u201d act of releasing the mortgage on the purchased land upon completion of payments. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">While the extent of contractual promises is a factual issue to be determined at trial, the papers before us, including Cochise\u2019s land sale registration form, as well as Perry\u2019s own concession that on June 5, 1972, Cochise had substantial remaining contractual commitments to the purchasers, see <em>supra </em>note 3, make this contention seem disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-7\">Moreover, even if each land sale contract did not include any promises by Cochise other than one to convey a deed and to release the mortgage (which seems unlikely), Cochise\u2019s failure to deliver a warranty deed as promised (where such a deed had not been conveyed), to convey clear title (if required by the agreement), or to release the mortgage upon completion of payments could constitute material breaches of Cochise\u2019s obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1393-8\">. We find it inconceivable that, under the terms of these land sale contracts and Arizona law, the mere execution of a promissory note, without more, constituted sufficient performance of the purchaser\u2019s obligations under the land sale contract so that default on note payments would <em>not </em>constitute a material breach excusing Cochise from further performance of its obligations (including delivery of deed, release of mortgage, or construction of improvements). <em>See Earven v.

The amended complaint in intervention of the Baldrian class does not allege facts giving rise to a claim of fraud on the part of Cochise in entering the land sale contracts nor assert a right to rescind the land sale contracts on grounds of fraud of the bankrupt. Thus, we do not address here the question whether, under the authority of <em>In re Paragon Securities Co., </em>589 F.2d 1240, 1242 (3d Cir.1978) and <em>Nicklaus v. Bank of Russellville, </em>336 F.2d 144, 146 (8th Cir.1964), the purchasers could have sought rescission of the land sale contracts and reclamation of all payments made under those contracts on the ground that a trustee can have no interest in property acquired by the fraud of the bankrupt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1395-9\">. These fully executed contracts, by definition, include only those contracts, if any, under which Cochise had so completely performed its obligations thereunder by June 5, 1972 that any failure by Cochise (or by the trustee) to complete performance would <em>not </em>constitute a material breach of the contract by Cochise excusing further performance by the purchaser. Despite their obligation to continue payments on the notes, these purchasers might have claims against the estate for minor breaches by Cochise of the land sale contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1395-10\">. Unlike cash and bank accounts, promissory notes that were in Cochise\u2019s possession as of June 5, 1972 (if part of executory contracts) did not pass to the trustee as property of the estate. The broad language of subsections a(5) and a(6) of \u00a7 70 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110, would seemingly indicate that the trustee is vested on the date of filing with all contract rights of the bankrupt (including the right to payment on such promissory notes). However, those provisions must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 70b, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(b), and the case law that has developed thereunder that hold that title to executory contracts and rights to future performance thereunder passes to the trustee only upon the affirmative act of adoption of the executory contract. <em>See infra </em>Part 11(B)(2). Since the trustee never affirmed any of the executory contracts, title to the promissory notes <em>(i.e., </em>the right to collect payments in the future) never passed to the trustee. <em>See, e.g., In re Gravure Paper &amp; Board Corp., </em>234 F.2d 928, 930-31 &amp; n. 4 (3d Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"A4x\">Even assuming that Perry did take \u201ctitle\u201d to such notes on June 5, 1972, and that such \u201cnotes\u201d were in fact negotiable instruments, however, any \u201ctitle\u201d he took was taken by operation of law under the Act and <em>not </em>for value. Thus, he is merely a holder and not a holder in due course. Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 44-2532(C)(2), -44-2208(20) (1967) (U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3-302(3)(b), 1-201(20)). As a holder, Perry took the notes subject to all defenses of the lot purchasers, including such defenses as breach of the underlying land sale contracts, fraud in the making of the contracts, and failure of consideration. Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 44-2536(2) (1967) (U.C.C. \u00a7 3-306(b)). Unlike his right under a promissory note that is part of an executed contract, his right to enforce a note that is part of an executory contract was not unlimited but rather was subject to the defenses of the maiker (the lot purchaser). <em>Cf. Smith v. Latourrette-Fical Co., </em>37 Ariz. 265, 269-70, 293 P. 973, 976 (1930) (holder takes promissory note furnished to seller of land subject to defenses of promissor-buyer, including counterclaim for recoupment for breach of seller\u2019s covenant to supply land with water). Even if the trustee did take \u201ctitle\u201d to the notes on June 5, 1972, the breach of the underlying land sale contracts on the same date, <em>see infra </em>discussion in Part 11(B)(2), excused the purchasers from further performance <em>(i.e., </em>making payments) on the notes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1395-14\">.

Bankruptcy Act \u00a7\u00a7 70b, 63c, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 110(b), 103(c) (1976); <em>In re Gravure Paper &amp; Board Corp., </em>234 F.2d 928, 930-31 (3d Cir. 1956); <em>see infra </em>discussion in Part 11(B)(2). The non-bankrupt party to an executory contract that has been breached, as a general creditor of the estate, has a provable claim against the estate for damages arising from the breach. <em>Id. </em>The appropriate damages are those ordinarily available for breach of contract and would account for any consideration paid to the bankrupt (including pre-filing payments).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">Appellants apparently did not request the bankruptcy court to grant equitable liens on the purchased lots to secure the refund of prefiling payments from the estate for those purchasers who had not received a warranty deed by the date of filing. Thus, we do not consider whether an equitable lien could be extended to such a purchaser in the bankruptcy situation, giving him priority over unsecured creditors. <em>Compare </em>Countryman, <em>Executory Contracts in Bankruptcy, </em>57 Minn.L.Rev. 439, 471-72 &amp; n. 124 (1973) (questioning validity of lien) <em>with </em>Lacy, <em>Land Sale Contracts in Bankruptcy, </em>21 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 477, 485-91 (1973) (advocating lien); Levy, <em>Bankruptcy and the Land Sale Contract, </em>23 Case W.Res.L.Rev. 393, 403-05, 409 (1972) (same); <em>and </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(j) (Supp. V 1981) (Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978) (providing for lien).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1396-14\">. <em>See Central Trust Co. v.

As unlikely as the trustee\u2019s assumption of the executory land sale contract may have been, each purchaser was entitled to believe that the trustee might cure the default and assume the contract, to continue making payments on the contract, and to expect to have a claim against the estate for those payments of administrative expense priority, regardless of whether the trustee did or did not eventually affirm the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">.

In this case, previous disbursements to other administrative expense creditors of the Cochise estate could possibly prevent the appellants from recovering that pro rata share of the assets of the estate that they would have received if all disbursements had been delayed until the trustee\u2019s final accounting. The trustee, not having given notice to the land purchasers, is therefore personally liable for the difference. <em>Thomas, </em>221 F.2d at 289-90 (where assets are \u201cinsufficient even to pay [administrative] costs,\u201d trustee is personally liable to lessor for portion of lessor\u2019s administrative expense claim which lessor would have received if trustee had postponed other administrative expense disbursements until final accounting); <em>In re B.A. Montgomery &amp; Son, 17 </em>F.2d 404 (N.D.Ohio 1927) (where assets remaining in estate are insufficient to pay priority wage claim, trustee is personally liable, where trustee exhausted estate by paying general creditors).

Oro Valley Townhouses, Inc., </em>131 Ariz. 121, 123, 638 P.2d 1367, 1369 (Ariz.App. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">. Even if the trustee had requested and the court had authorized such negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations, the trustee would nonetheless remain personally liable, since the record nowhere indicates that the purchasers were given notice of such a request, even though giving notice to \u201ccreditors and interested parties\u201d is required before the trustee\u2019s personal liability is waived. See <em>Mosser, </em>341 U.S. <em>at </em>874, 71 S.Ct. at 683.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">. The papers before the bankruptcy court indicate that a genuine issue of fact remained on both the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims. The affidavits and interrogatories fail to negate conclusively any of these factual issues: whether Perry or his agents made false representations (including both statements of fact and promises to perform certain acts); whether these statements or promises were material to the purchasers\u2019 decision to make further payments; whether Perry ever knew or reasonably should have known that the statements were false; whether Perry ever knew that he had no intention or reasonably should have known that he had no ability to perform the promises; whether Perry acted to correct misrepresentations he believed to be true when made but later discovered to be false; whether he intended or reasonably should have realized that the purchasers would continue to make payments based on his statements and promises; whether the purchasers ignorantly and justifiably relied on the statements and promises; and whether the purchasers were injured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">. Apparently conceding that the summary judgment cannot be sustained on the grounds set forth below, Perry argues that, since the appellants here had entered contracts with Cochise, the trustee cannot be held liable for payments which purchasers were obliged to make under those contracts, even if the payments were induced by misrepresentations. <em>See Berry v. Robotka, </em>9 Ariz.App. 461, 468, 453 P.2d 972, 979 (1969). We disagree, since the <em>Berry </em>defense is properly applicable only where the person relying on the alleged misrepresentations was in fact obligated under the terms of the contract or by law to continue performance. Arizona Title, 14 Ariz.App. at 494, 484 P.2d at 647. The answers to interrogatories and affidavits show that the continuation of payments on the land sale contracts was not the only course of action open to some, if not all, of the members of the Baldrian class on June 5, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-11\">As to those land sale contracts which were executory on June 5, 1972, by operation of law and as conceded by the trustee himself, each land sale contract was rejected by the trustee and thereby breached by the bankrupt as of that date. <em>See supra </em>discussion in Section 11(B). Hence, from June 5, 1972 onward, these Baldrian class members were <em>not </em>obligated by law to continue making payments, and against them the <em>Berry </em>defense is unavailable to Perry. Indeed, by failing to affirm those contracts, Perry in effect abandoned the <em>Berry </em>defense which would have otherwise shielded him from liability for his post-filing misrepresentations, assuming, that is, that such parties to executory contracts were in fact otherwise obligated to continue performance, which we doubt. The bankruptcy court was not justified in granting summary judgment for defendant based on that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-12\">As to those lot purchasers, if any, whose land sale contracts had been wholly executed by Cochise on June 5, 1972, the bankruptcy court should have applied a similar analysis. The <em>Berry </em>defense is simply not available to a misrepresenting party where the party who is misled had valid defenses to further performance available at law or by contract, even where the misrepresenting party has performed all of his contractual obligations. <em>See Arizona Title, </em>14 Ariz.App. at 494, 484 P.2d at 647. If a party to an executed contract was not obligated by law to continue making payments on his contract at the time Perry made the alleged misrepresentation, <em>e.g., </em>because he had an available claim for rescission or because fraud inhered in the making of the contract, that misrepresentation is actionable if that purchaser relied on the intentional or negligent false statement or promise in making payments to Perry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
