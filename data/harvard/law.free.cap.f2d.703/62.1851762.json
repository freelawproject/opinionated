Frezzo Bros., Inc., </em>461 F.Supp. 266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>(E.D.Pa.1978). This court affirmed the convictions. <em>United States v. Frezzo Bros., Inc., </em>602 F.2d 1123 (3d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1074, 100 S.Ct. 1020, 62 L.Ed.2d 756 (1980). The district court dismissed petitions for post-conviction relief, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <em>United States v. Frezzo Bros., Inc., </em>491 F.Supp. 1339 (E.D. Pa.1980), but this court reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether appellants\u2019 conduct was exempted from the criminal sanctions of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a) and 1319(c) as agricultural activity under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.4(i) (1978). <em>United States v. Frezzo Bros., Inc., </em>642 F.2d 59 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The district court found that petitioners\u2019 conduct was not agricultural activity; rather, the court found that petitioners\u2019 conduct was manufacturing in . nature. <em>United States v. Frezzo Bros., Inc., </em>546 F.Supp. 713 (E.D.Pa.1982). Consequently, it held that the pollution that resulted from petitioners\u2019 conduct was not exempted by 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.4(i) from the criminal sanctions under which they were convicted, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a) and 1319(c). It therefore denied petitioners\u2019 request for collateral relief. Petitioners now oppose the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">After considering the contentions raised by appellants, to-wit, that (1) the district court erred in interpreting the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s agricultural exclusion regulations, (2) the district court entirely ignored the evidence of record in determining that petitioners\u2019 mushroom composting operation was manufacturing rather than agriculture, (3) the government is estopped from arguing and the district court is estopped from finding that petitioners\u2019 mushroom composting operation is manufacturing, (4) that the definition of point source in the Water Pollution Control Act and EPA regulations constitute an unconstitutionally vague standard of criminal conduct, (5) petitioners were denied effective assistance of counsel, we will affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
