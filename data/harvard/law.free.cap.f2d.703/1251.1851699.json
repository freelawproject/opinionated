On appeal, Booker advances four contentions: 1) the prosecutor\u2019s use of information derived from a psychiatric examination in cross examination of Booker during the penalty phase violated his fifth amendment rights; 2) the prosecutor\u2019s introduction of evidence concerning Booker\u2019s prior acts of violence permitted the jury to consider a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance; 3) the state trial court improperly limited the jury\u2019s consideration of nonstatutory mitigating factors; and 4) the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s solicitation of ex parte psychological material concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>Booker was unconstitutional. After a careful consideration of Booker\u2019s claims on appeal, we affirm the denial of the petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AIPf\">Booker was convicted on June 19,1978 in the state court of first degree murder, sexual battery and burglary based upon evidence which showed that Booker entered the Gainesville, Florida apartment of Lorine DeMoss Harman, a ninety-four year old woman, raped Harman and stabbed her repeatedly in the chest and neck causing her death. Booker was connected to the crime by body hair samples, fingerprints, and testimony concerning the print pattern of his shoes. Further, Booker \u201cconfessed\u201d to a Gainesville police detective. This \u201cconfession\u201d occurred while Booker was describing himself in the third person as Steve and calling himself \u201cAniel,\u201d which he spelled out for the detective and described as a demon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While Booker was \u201cAniel,\u201d the detective asked him if \u201cStephen had done it,\u201d and Booker replied, \u201cHe did it, God damn it, he did it.\u201d There is no contention that the confession was involuntary and in fact, its substance was adduced during cross examination of the detective by Booker\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">After Booker was duly indicted by the grand jury and a public defender appointed to represent him, defense counsel filed a motion for mental examination and notice of defense of insanity. (State Record at 4). A county judge granted the motion, committing Booker to an intake facility of the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to determine whether he was competent to participate in his own defense and appointing Jose Lineas, M.D. and George Barnard, M.D. to examine Booker as to his sanity or insanity at the time of the offense. (State Record at 9). Thereafter, both the state and defendant filed separate motions to appoint an additional psychiatrist to examine Booker on the grounds that the previously appointed doctors were unable to reach a conclusion regarding Booker\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense. (State Record at 32, 36). The state court appointed Dr. Frank Carrera to examine Booker. (State Record at 45). Dr. Carrera testified during the defendant\u2019s case and Dr. Barnard testified during the state\u2019s rebuttal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">The case was submitted to the jury after three days of trial proceedings. The jury deliberated for slightly in excess of three hours and returned verdicts of guilty on all three counts. The next day, the advisory sentencing proceedings occurred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only evidence introduced by the state at this time was a document relating to Booker\u2019s prior conviction for robbery. The only evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> introduced by the defense was the testimony of Booker. Booker also made a statement prior to counsel\u2019s arguments on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>sentencing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After hearing counsel\u2019s arguments and receiving the trial judge\u2019s instructions, a majority<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the jurors recommended the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">In October 1978, the trial judge had before him a presentence investigation report, the psychological report of Dr. Elizabeth MacMahon, certain medical records, a letter from Booker and the sentencing memoranda of counsel, as well as the recommendation of the jury and the oral arguments of counsel. The trial judge considered the statutory aggravating and possible mitigating factors and sentenced Booker to death for the murder of Lorine DeMoss Harman,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> entering his written order in accordance with Fla.Stat. Section 921.141(3) (1977). (State Record at 142). <em>See also, Booker v. State, </em>397 So.2d 910, 915-918 (Fla.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">Booker appealed to the Florida Supreme Court which affirmed the conviction and sentence. <em>Booker v. State, </em>397 So.2d 910 (Fla.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 957, 102 S.Ct. 493, 70 L.Ed.2d 261 (1981). Booker also joined 122 other death row inmates in petitioning the Florida Supreme Court for extraordinary relief based on that court\u2019s possible consideration of extra-record psychological material in affirming the sentences. The Florida Supreme Court denied relief, <em>Brown v. Wainwright, </em>392 So.2d 1327 (Fla. 1981), and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, <em>Brown v. Wainwright, </em>454 U.S. 1000, 102 S.Ct. 542, 70 L.Ed.2d 407 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">On March 22,1982, the Governor of Florida signed a death warrant authorizing Booker\u2019s execution by electrocution on April 21. On April 13, Booker filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the Northern District of Florida, alleging various grounds for relief and including a prayer for stay of execution. The district court denied the stay orally on April 15 and by a summary order on April 19. (Record at 260). The district court filed its order denying petition for writ of habeas corpus on April 20. (Record at 261). Booker filed a notice of appeal and an application for certificate of probable cause and to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (Record at 270-71). The district court issued a certificate of probable cause and a certificate to permit appeal in forma pauperis (Record at 260), as well as an order denying Booker\u2019s application for certificate of probable cause and to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (Record at 273). In any event, appeal was taken to the Eleventh Circuit, which issued an order granting stay. <em>Booker </em>v. Wainwright, 675 F.2d 1150 (11th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We now consider the merits of Booker\u2019s claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-12\">II. USE IN CROSS EXAMINATION OF PSYCHIATRIC EXAM INFORMATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-13\">A. The Procedural Bar</p>\n<p id=\"AY-z\">On this appeal, Booker claims that his privilege against self incrimination was violated when the prosecutor utilized information during cross examination of Booker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>penalty phase testimony which was derived from a psychiatric examination. Booker contends that since the constitutional protections mandated by <em>Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981), were not afforded Booker, his death sentence must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">The state, however, argues that we are barred from considering the merits of Booker\u2019s <em>Estelle v. Smith </em>claim in a habeas proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 2254 by the doctrine of <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). In <em>Sykes, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a habeas corpus petitioner must show \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d in order to advance in federal court those claims barred from consideration in the state courts by a valid procedural rule. The United States Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the <em>Sykes </em>doctrine in <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982), recognizing that the costs of the federal writ of habeas corpus \u201care particularly high when a trial default has barred a prisoner from obtaining adjudication of his constitutional claim in the state courts.\u201d 456 U.S. at 128, 102 S.Ct. at 1572.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">The state argues that Booker\u2019s counsel did not adequately object at trial. During oral argument on this appeal, Booker\u2019s counsel, who has represented Booker throughout the state and federal proceedings, argued that the objection at trial was sufficient. Both parties also devoted considerable attention in their respective briefs to the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d exception to <em>Sykes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">One rationale for the <em>Sykes </em>doctrine is the integrity of the state court trial. \u201cThe failure of the federal habeas courts generally to require compliance with a contemporaneous-objection rule tends to detract from the perception of the trial of a criminal case in state court as a decisive and portentous event.\u201d <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. at 90, 97 S.Ct. at 2508. However, equally important underpinnings of the <em>Sykes </em>doctrine are considerations of comity and federalism. As recently stated in <em>Isaac, </em>without <em>Sykes\u2019 </em>requirement that defense counsel present constitutional claims during trial, the state appellate courts would not have a \u201cchance to mend their own fences and avoid federal intrusion.\u201d <em>Isaac, </em>456 U.S. at 129, 102 S.Ct. at 1572.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">Considerations of comity and federalism have resulted in the development of a well settled exception to the procedural default rule of <em>Sykes: </em>where a state appellate court does not rely on a procedural default, but reaches the merits of the federal law claim, the <em>Sykes </em>bar is inapplicable. As explained by the United States Supreme Court, when the state courts do not indicate that a \u201cfederal constitutional claim is barred by some state procedural rule, a federal court implies no disrespect for the State by entertaining the claim.\u201d <em>County Court of Ulster County </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 154, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2223, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979). The former Fifth Circuit recognized this exception and applied it in numerous cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See e.g., Sassoon v. Stynchombe, </em>654 F.2d 371, 374 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Moran v. Estelle, </em>607 F.2d 1140, 1142 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Cannon v. State of Alabama, </em>558 F.2d 1211, 1216 n. 12 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1087, 98 S.Ct. 1281, 55 L.Ed.2d 792 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">The state contends that Booker did not adequately object at trial or present his federal constitutional claim on appeal to the Florida Supreme Court. The state further contends that no exception is applicable because \u201cit is clear from the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s opinion that this issue was treated as a question of state evidentiary law rather than a federal constitutional question.\u201d (Brief of Appellee at 20, n. 3). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">The Florida Supreme Court described Booker\u2019s position on appeal thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-13\">The defendant contends that during the sentencing proceedings the court committed error in permitting the prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>cutor to ask questions based on information gathered from court ordered psychiatric reports. The defendant argues that this violated his right against self-incrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">397 So.2d at 913. The Florida Supreme Court also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-5\">The defendant recognizes that a court ordered psychiatric examination generally is not considered violative of defendant\u2019s right to freedom from compelled self-incrimination<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that psychiatrists may render opinions concerning sanity based on factual statements made by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\"><em>Id. </em>In both the above references to the right against self incrimination, the right is referred to generally, without denominating whether it is specifically the right embodied in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Florida Constitution, Article 1, Section 9. Booker\u2019s Initial Brief to the Florida Supreme Court mentions both sources <em>initially </em>and then refers to the right generally. In deciding the dispositive issue, the Florida Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-7\">A defendant who chooses to testify waives his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination with respect to the testimony he gives, and that waiver is no less effective or complete because the defendant may have been motivated to take the witness stand in the first place only by reason of the strength of the lawful evidence adduced against him. <em>Harrison v. United States, </em>392 U.S. 219, 88 S.Ct. 2008, 20 L.Ed.2d 1047 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">397 So.2d at 914. By relying on <em>Harrison, </em>which did not concern Florida\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Florida Supreme Court was apparently considering both the state and federal constitutional privileges against self-incrimination. We therefore conclude that where a state court does not make explicit whether it is considering the federal constitutional provision or its state constitutional counterpart, and cites cases construing both, we will view the state court as having treated the issue as arising under both federal and state law for <em>Sykes </em>purposes. To hold otherwise would be to sanction an imprecision in jurisprudence intolerable in the realm of constitutional issues and to foreclose federal habeas review of federal claims because the language used by the state courts was vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">Having decided that we are not barred by the procedural default doctrine of <em>Sykes, </em>we proceed to consider Booker\u2019s claim concerning the use of the psychiatric exam on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">B. The Substantive Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">Booker asserts that under <em>Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981), his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s use of information allegedly gained from a psychiatric examination of Booker. In <em>Smith, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-14\">when faced while in custody with a court-ordered psychiatric inquiry, respondent\u2019s statements to [the doctor] were not \u2018given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences\u2019 and, as such, could be used as the state did at the penalty phase only if respondent had been apprised of his rights and had knowingly decided to waive them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 469, 101 S.Ct. at 1876. There is no contention that Booker was given <em>Miranda </em>or other suitable warnings before making statements to the psychiatrists who examined him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-16\">Neither Booker\u2019s mere submission to a psychiatric or psychological examination, nor the fact that the defense may have requested an examination forecloses his claim under <em>Smith. Battie v. Estelle, </em>655 F.2d 692, 702 (5th Cir.1981). In <em>Battie, </em>however, the former Fifth Circuit distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>guished a situation where the government used the results of a court-appointed psychiatric examination only after the defense had introduced psychiatric testimony in order to raise a mental defect defense, <em>citing, United States v. Cohen, </em>530 F.2d 43 (5th Cir.) <em>cert denied, </em>429 U.S. 855, 97 S.Ct. 149, 50 L.Ed.2d 130 (1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Battie </em>approved <em>Cohen\u2019s </em>holding that \u201cthe introduction by the defense of psychiatric testimony constituted a waiver of the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment privilege in the same manner as would the defendant\u2019s election to testify at trial.\u201d <em>Battie, </em>655 F.2d at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">In Booker\u2019s case, the issue of insanity was raised as a defense and a psychiatrist testified on behalf of the defendant. Thus, under <em>Battie, </em>there was a waiver of defendant\u2019s fifth amendment privilege as to psychiatric testimony. However, the jury had already rejected Booker\u2019s defense of insanity by finding him guilty on all three counts of the indictment and the use of the psychiatric testimony occurred during the subsequent penalty phase of the trial. We need not decide whether such a waiver under <em>Battie </em>during trial survives in the separate penalty proceeding in a capital case, since there is another determinative factor in Booker\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Booker took the stand to testify during the advisory sentencing proceedings of the state trial. In answer to his attorney\u2019s specific inquiry as to whether he had a recollection of the day of the crime, Booker said he did not remember. Booker also testified that he had been in various hospitals, including Camp Codie Medical Center on Okinawa and Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C. while he was in the armed services. The following colloquy then occurred between Booker and his attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-8\">Q: Have you had any difficulties during this time you were hospitalized from the time you were 13 until now with periods of time which you can\u2019t remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-9\">A: Yes, sir. Three of these occasions of hospitalization, that was the reason for being in the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-10\">Q: That you couldn\u2019t remember what had happened to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-11\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-12\">(State Transcript at 838). On cross examination, the prosecutor questioned Booker about his military service:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-13\">Q: Do [sic] you have problems with acts of violence while you were in the service? A: Yes. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-14\">Q: Other than these for fighting, have you ever attempted to kill people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-15\">Q: While you were in Okinawa in the houses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-16\">A: Could be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-17\">Q: Do you know what I am talking about, Mr. Booker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-18\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-19\">Q: I\u2019m talking about houses of prostitution. Did you ever try to kill anybody over there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-20\">A: Not necessarily. I used to \u2014 we used to rob cat houses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-21\">Q: What weapons did you use to hit people with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-22\">A: Claw hammer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-23\">Q: How many people do you think you hit with the claw hammer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-24\">A: I can\u2019t recollect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-25\">Q: More than five?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-26\">A: I would say about five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-27\">Q: More than ten?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-28\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-29\">(State Transcript at 841-42). Later, Booker\u2019s attorney objected to the prosecutor\u2019s questions relating to the day of the crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>The trial court overruled the objection on the grounds that the question of lapse of memory on the day of the incident was opened by the defendant on direct. The cross examination continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-4\">Q: Mr. Booker, my question to you was do you remember when you got up at 7:00 or 7:30 feeling that morning like you wanted to kill somebody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-5\">A: Part of the way, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-6\">Q: Did you know Mrs. Harman prior to this date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-7\">A: No. I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-8\">Q: Had she ever done anything to you in her life to deny you anything or prevent you from anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-9\">A: No. In regards to me knowing her, I still don\u2019t know her. I have just been confronted with her in this courtroom in this charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-10\">Q: Did you attempt to kill anybody else that day; do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-11\">A: Sure, I remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-12\">Q: Do you remember you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-13\">A: No. I didn\u2019t try to kill anybody that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-14\">Q: In the morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-15\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-16\">Q: You did not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-17\">A: No. I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-18\">Q: Did you think about doing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-19\">A: Sometime I did, but I gave up the idea because it was crazy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-20\">(State Transcript at 844-45)</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-21\">Booker contends, and we assume without deciding, that the prosecutor obtained the information about the Okinawa houses of prostitution and Booker\u2019s state of mind upon waking on the day of the crime through information given to a psychiatrist <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> without the constitutional safeguards of <em>Estelle v. Smith.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet even assuming Booker\u2019s statements would not have been admissible in the state\u2019s case, there is no constitutional prohibition against using the information for impeachment purposes. <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Harris, </em>the United States Supreme Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atu\">Every criminal defendant is privileged to testify in his own defense, or to refuse to do so. But that privilege cannot be construed to include the right to commit perjury, [citations omitted]. Having voluntarily taken the stand, petitioner was under an obligation to speak truthfully and accurately, and the prosecution here did no more than utilize the traditional truth-testing devices of the adversary process. Had inconsistent statements been made by the accused to some third person, it could hardly be contended that the conflict could be laid before the jury by way of cross examination and impeachment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-26\">The shield provided by <em>Miranda </em>cannot be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-27\">401 U.S. at 225-6, 91 S.Ct. at 645-646. Since \u201cthe holding in <em>Smith </em>followed logically from the <em>Miranda </em>decision itself,\u201d <em>Battie </em>655 F.2d at 699, it is likewise logical to conclude that the shield provided by <em>Smith </em>is also not susceptible to being perverted into a license to use perjury free from permissible impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-28\">While the prosecutor\u2019s questions concerning events on Okinawa may have been susceptible to an objection as being outside the scope of direct examination,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the cross ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>animation questions do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and relief in a federal habeas action is therefore not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">III. PRIOR ACTS OF VIOLENCE</p>\n<p id=\"Au5\">Booker contends that the Okinawa activities elicited on cross examination of Booker during the advisory sentencing proceeding requires granting of the writ on another basis. In <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>661 F.2d 56 (5th Cir.1981),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we held that it is constitutional error to allow a jury in a capital case to consider nonst\u00e1tutory aggravating factors in deciding whether the death penalty should be imposed. Booker seeks to extend <em>Henry </em>to situations where the jury is properly instructed to consider only statutory aggravating factors but evidence of a nonst\u00e1tutory aggravating factor has been presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">To adopt Booker\u2019s theory would be to presume that the jury did not follow the court\u2019s instructions listing the aggravating circumstances and specifically limiting the jury\u2019s consideration to those circumstances. There is no hint in the record that the jury would have construed the Okinawa impeachment testimony as a nonst\u00e1tutory aggravating factor. We decline to posit a per se rule to the effect that the introduction of any evidence that might <em>possibly </em>be interpreted as a nonst\u00e1tutory aggravating circumstance renders the imposition of the death penalty unconstitutional notwithstanding specific instructions limiting the <em>jury\u2019s </em>consideration to the enumerated statutory aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">IV. JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON NON-STATUTORY MITIGATING FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">Booker argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury during the advisory sentencing proceedings improperly limited the jury\u2019s consideration of nonst\u00e1tutory mitigating factors. The state argues that our consideration of this issue is barred by the procedural default doctrine of <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). Booker concedes procedural default as to the jury instructions, but contends that he comes within the cause and prejudice exception to <em>Sykes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">This issue is controlled by <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>696 F.2d 804 (11th Cir.1983) (en banc). In <em>Ford, </em>the trial judge similarly instructed the jury to consider <em>only </em>the enumerated aggravating factors and, omitting the \u201conly,\u201d to consider the following mitigating factors. <em>Ford </em>also conceded procedural default in <em>Sykes. </em>In <em>Ford, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-13\">The <em>Sykes </em>issue becomes blurred in this case, however, because of two principles which mesh to deny Ford relief on this point. First, the Supreme Court has held that an erroneous jury instruction satisfies <em>Sykes\u2019 </em>prejudice prong only if actual, not possible, prejudice is shown so that there is <em>\u2018actual </em>and substantial disadvan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>tage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u2019 <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 168, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1595, 71 L.Ed.2d 816, 832 (1982).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-4\">Second, in evaluating a trial court\u2019s instructions, we must determine the interpretation a reasonable juror might give the words of the instruction in question. <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 514, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 2454, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979). The entire charge must be examined as a whole to discern whether the issues and law presented to the jury were adequate. <em>Davis v. McAllister, </em>631 F.2d 1256, 1260 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 907, 101 S.Ct. 3035, 69 L.Ed.2d 409 (1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-5\">The fundamental issue then is whether Ford has carried his burden in establishing that his jury perceived that in deciding whether to recommend life or death, it was denied the use of any nonstatutory mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">696 F.2d at 812. As in <em>Ford, </em>we conclude that Booker has not carried his burden in establishing the jury perceived that in deciding to recommend life or death, it was denied the use of any nonstatutory mitigating factors. <em>Ford </em>set forth four reasons for this conclusion. Three of those reasons are applicable to Booker\u2019s case and bear repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-7\"><em>[FJirst, </em>the trial court read the statute as written, setting forth the entire list of statutory mitigating circumstances, which statute omits the word \u2018only.\u2019 The Supreme Court has recognized the Florida statute does not limit a jury\u2019s consideration of mitigating circumstances to those listed in the statute. <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. [242] at 250 n. 8,96 S.Ct. [2960] at 2965 n. 8 [49 L.Ed.2d 913].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-8\"><em>Second, </em>the instruction here was different from <em>Washington v. Watkins, </em>655 F.2d 1346 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied,456 </em>U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 2021, 72 L.Ed.2d 474 (1982), where the state trial judge concluded the charge with these words:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1304-9\">If you unanimously find from the testimony that <em>one or more of the preceding elements of mitigation </em>exist[s], then you must consider whether <em>it </em>outweighs the aggravating circumstances you previously found and you must return one of the following verdicts....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4u\"><em>Id. </em>at 1368 (emphasis added). Here the jury was not confined to two \u2018preceding elements of mitigation,\u2019 as in <em>Washington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-11\"><em>Third, </em>that petitioner was not limited in the introduction of evidence which might be considered mitigating and that the jury arguments encompassed all evidence introduced in the case explains counsel\u2019s perception that the jury was not denied the use of any evidence in weighing sentences. Thus had petitioner known of <em>Lockett [v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973], he would still have no reason to object because the jury was not in fact being limited to what it could consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 812-13. As in <em>Ford, </em>the rational conclusion is that the jury did not perceive a restriction on the consideration of any mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-13\">Y. NONRECORD MATERIAL BEFORE THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT</p>\n<p id=\"AGg\">The final issue raised by Booker concerning the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of nonrecord material is also controlled by <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>696 F.2d 804 (11th Cir.1983) (en banc), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMj\">But even if members of the [Florida Supreme] court solicited the material with the thought it should, would or might be used in the review of capital sentences, the decision of the Florida court that it should not be so used, the statement that it should not be so used, and the rejection of the notion that it affected the judgment of the reviewing judges of the court ends the matter when addressed at the constitutional level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1304-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 811. We note only that Booker\u2019s attorney was furnished with the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s request of Booker\u2019s presentence investigation report, thus rendering this factual situation even weaker than <em>Ford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\">Based on the foregoing, the district court\u2019s denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">. The detective explained Booker during this time as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-8\">Prior to the time that he became Aniel he would chant. And the chanting would go on for perhaps ten seconds, 15 seconds, not long. It was during this time that the glassy eyes appeared. He had the glassy eye appearance. He would then settle, be serene, smile, and in my terminology clench his teeth. The grinding would stop, but his teeth would clench, and in that form he would begin to whisper things that I had to lean forward to hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-9\">As my questioning related toward Aniel and who Aniel was, how he became acquainted with Aniel, and so on, as my questions grew more direct, he would burst into tears and cry. And he would laugh and wipe his tears from his eyes in a split second. He would then settle back in the chair, face me again, and be in a word, calm. He was rational in all aspects. Nothing was not understandable with the exception of the chant. (Transcript of Trial Proceedings, Vol. IV., p. 627).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">. Pursuant to Fla.Stat. Section 921.141 (1977), the court was required, upon the defendant\u2019s conviction of a capital felony, to conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine whether the defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. After hearing all the evidence, the jury deliberates and renders an advisory sentence to the court of either death or life imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">. The jury, however, is not restricted to evidence presented during the penalty phase in arriving at its advisory sentence and may consider evidence presented throughout the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">. Booker, against the advice of his attorney, made the following statement to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">You people in the jury box have convicted me of first degree murder, sexual battery, and burglary. And you are going in the room and deliberate over what punishment should be given for a crime of this nature. A defendant found guilty of such a crime should receive the death penalty. That\u2019s it. (Transcript of Trial Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 850).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1298-8\">. Unlike the verdict, the advisory sentence of the jury need not be unanimous. Fla.Stat. Section 921.141(3) (1977). The jury considering Booker\u2019s sentence voted nine to three to impose the death sentence. (Transcript of Trial Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 886).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1298-14\">.
