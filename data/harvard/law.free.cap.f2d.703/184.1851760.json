RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">A party whose civil cause had been rejected by the jury sought permission to interview the jurors. The district judge refused because there had been no showing that the jury\u2019s deliberations had been tainted by wrongdoing. Finding that the judge acted well within her discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">Kelli Jo Wilkerson seriously injured her hand on a shelf manufactured by Amco Corporation. She sued Amco, alleging that the shelf was defective in design and manufacture. After two days of trial followed by a day of deliberations, the jury informed the judge that they were unlikely to agree on answers to the special interrogatories on which the case was submitted. The judge then gave an additional instruction urging the jurors to attempt to reach an agreement. Shortly thereafter, the jury returned a verdict for Amco.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">Although Wilkerson did not object to the supplemental instruction at the time it was given, she filed a post-judgment motion for permission to interview the jurors,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which stated, \u201cThe jury was instructed by the court to reach a verdict. They then broke the deadlock. Plaintiff is obligated to ascertain whether or not the jury employed any improper method of breaking the deadlock.\u201d The district judge denied the motion, and Wilkerson brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-19\">\u201cHistorically, interrogations of jurors have not been favored by federal courts except when there is some <em>showing </em>of ille1 gal or prejudicial intrusion into the jury process.\u201d <em>O\u2019Rear v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>554 F.2d 1304, 1309 (5th Cir.1977) (emphasis in original); <em>United States v. Riley, </em>544 F.2d 237, 242 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 932, 97 S.Ct. 1554, 51 L.Ed.2d 777 (1977); <em>accord Martinez v. Food City, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 369, 373 n. 2 (5th Cir.1981) (dictum). We have required a showing of \u201cspecific instances of misconduct\u201d before allowing the parties to conduct such an inquiry. <em>O\u2019Rear, </em>554 F.2d at 1309-10; <em>Riley, </em>544 F.2d at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-20\">In <em>O\u2019Rear, </em>we reviewed the \u201cvery cogent reasons\u201d for requiring parties to make a showing of likely misconduct before allowing such an inquiry: protecting the jury from post-verdict misconduct and the courts from time-consuming and futile proceedings; reducing the \u201cchances and temptations\u201d for tampering with the jury; and increasing the certainty of civil verdicts. 554 F.2d at 1310 n. 4. We continue to decline to \u201cdenigrate jury trials by after-wards ransacking the jurors in search of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>some ground ... for a new trial\u201d unless a preliminary showing is made. 554 F.2d at 1310.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Wilkerson failed to make any preliminary showing of misconduct. The motion sought simply to discover what happened in the jury\u2019s deliberations in the hope of uncovering a taint. This the district judge properly refused to sanction. If the district judge\u2019s supplemental instruction was erroneous, Wilkerson should have objected and challenged the instruction itself as error. Even if the instruction was erroneous, an issue we need not address, the error was in its being given. The jury cannot be faulted for having followed an instruction given it by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Indeed, under Fed.R.Evid. 606(b), the jurors would not be allowed to testify as to whether they followed the instruction or not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of the fact that Wilkerson failed to make a preliminary showing of wrongdoing in the jury deliberations, and because any information the proposed inquiry might turn up would be inadmissible in a proceeding to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict, we think the district judge acted properly in denying Wilkerson\u2019s motion for permission to interview the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">For these reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-15\">. The motion was entitled \u201cMotion to Poll the Jury.\u201d In a letter written to the judge on October 5, 1982, however, Wilkerson\u2019s counsel explained that despite its title, \u201cthe Motion requests permission to contact jurors subsequent to the trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\">. <em>Cf. In re Express-News Corp., </em>695 F.2d 807, 810 (5th Cir.1982) (policy considerations different where press, not parties, seeks to interview jurors after trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\">.
