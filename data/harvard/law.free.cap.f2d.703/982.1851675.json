Vinson, </em>606 F.2d 149, 153 (6th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1074, 100 S.Ct. 1020, 62 L.Ed.2d 756 (1980), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>445 U.S. 972, 100 S.Ct. 1668, 64 L.Ed.2d 251 (1980), holding that hearsay statements of a co-conspirator are admissible to decide the preliminary requirement of <em>United States v. Enright, </em>579 F.2d 980 (6th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Appellant urges that <em>Vinson </em>be overruled. This court has followed <em>Vinson </em>and rejected efforts to overrule it. In <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>657 F.2d 92, 93 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1086, 102 S.Ct. 646, 70 L.Ed.2d 622 (1981), we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-6\">All defendants contend that the district court erred in admitting hearsay testimony of Durham under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule. This argument boils down to a request that this court reverse its decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vinson, </em>606 F.2d 149 (6th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1074, 100 S.Ct. 1020, 62 L.Ed.2d 756 (1980). This court adheres to its decision in <em>United States v. Vinson </em>and holds that the district court did not err in the admission of Durham\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\"><em>See also Steele v.
