The appellants first contend that the dues in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>crease is invalid because the union\u2019s convention delegate selection system violates section 101(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(1), by giving small locals disproportionately greater representation than large locals. Second, they contend that the dues increase violates section 101(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(3), which specifically governs the procedures for increasing dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Appellants Denov and Lane are members of the Chicago Federation of Musicians, Local 10-208 (CFM or the local) and of AFM, an international union, by virtue of the local\u2019s affiliation with it. In June 1980, when AFM held its convention, CFM had 11,156 members and was one of 526 local affiliates of AFM, which had nearly 300,000 members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Article 5 of the constitution of AFM sets out the system for the selection of delegates by the locals for AFM conventions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-7\">All locals of 200 members or less shall be entitled to one delegate. All locals of not less than 201 members and not more than 400 members shall be entitled to two delegates. All locals of more than 400 members shall be entitled to three delegates. A merged Local ... shall be entitled to one additional Delegate....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">As a merged local, CFM was entitled to four of the 994 delegates at the convention. CFM\u2019s delegate strength thus was about one-tenth of what it would have been on a proportional basis. Although voice votes are the most common method of voting, article 5 also provides that proposals to change the bylaws may be subjected to a roll call vote if fifteen locals or thirty delegates demand it. In a roll call vote, each local may cast as many votes as it has members; thus CFM could cast 11,156 votes in a roll call vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">On June 17, 1980, the delegates, by voice vote, approved a recommendation to amend their bylaws to establish minimum work dues of one percent of each member\u2019s scale wages. The proposal directed that one-half of this was payable to the international and one-half to the local. The amendment also provided that the work dues of any local that were in effect as of July 1,1980, would be increased one percent of scale wages. Prior to the convention, Local 10-208 levied work dues of two percent on its members; the effect of the implementation of this proposal was to increase work dues to three percent, of which one-half percent was due the international. No one at the convention requested a roll call vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">The proposal also provided that a local could apply to the International Executive Board for waiver of the increases. The appellants say that since June 1980, about forty of the 526 locals have successfully petitioned for a waiver of the increases. CFM, however, has not petitioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-12\">On December 3,1980, the appellants filed a three-count action against CFM and AFM. Count I asserted that the delegate selection system constituted a violation of section 101(a)(1) of the Act, which provides for equal voting rights for union members. Count II charged that the vote and dues increase violated section 101(a)(3)(A), which provides that a local cannot increase dues except by a secret ballot. Count III asserted a violation of section 101(a)(3)(B), which requires that a dues increase considered at a special convention be preceded by thirty days\u2019 notice. The appellants asked the court to enjoin the local from collecting its one-half percent and to require AFM to apportion delegates more closely to the size of the local.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-13\">On June 11,1981, Judge Shadur dismissed Counts II and III, but denied the motion to dismiss Count I. <em>Denov </em>v. <em>Chicago Federation of Musicians, Local 10-208, </em>517 F.Supp. 980 (N.D.I11.1981). The court said that whether the convention representation scheme was \u201creasonable\u201d under section 101(a)(1) was a question of fact that precluded dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 985. The court held that success on Count II was precluded by our decision in Ranes <em>v. Office Employees International Union, Local No. 28, </em>317 F.2d 915 (7th Cir.1963), which held that section 101(a)(3)(A) was inapplicable where the increase in dues payable to the local was attributable to action by the international <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>with which it was affiliated, as here. 517 F.Supp. at 986. Judge Shadur held that Count III was foreclosed because the convention was regularly scheduled, not special, and hence the section 101(a)(3)(B) notice requirement was inapplicable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">On August 14, 1981, the case was reassigned to Judge Parsons. On August 19, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On December 31, 1981, the district court granted the appellees\u2019 motion. The court held that section 101(a)(1) \u201cdid not set forth the structure of one-man one-vote for delegate voting of dues in an annual convention,\u201d and said that the delegate selection process was reasonable for purposes of the Act. The court entered final judgment in favor of the appellees on April 21, 1982. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Before reaching the merits, we must consider the appellees\u2019 claim, rejected by Judge Shadur, that the district court had no jurisdiction to consider the appellants\u2019 challenge to the convention representation system. The appellees contend that the appellants cannot bring an action under Title I of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 411-415, because the claim is essentially one under Title IV, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 481-483. Because an action under Title IV is the exclusive remedy for a violation that comes within it, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 483, and because only the Secretary of Labor may bring a Title IV action, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 482, the appellants cannot maintain their action in this case if we hold that the case is predominantly governed by Title IV, see <em>O\u2019Doherty v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline &amp; Steamship Clerks, </em>618 F.2d 484, 486 (8th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">The test of whether a case is properly brought under Titles I or IV is whether the issues raised \u201cbasically relat[e] ... to eligibility of candidates for office\u201d; if they do, the case \u201cfall[s] squarely within Title IV of the Act and [is] to be resolved by the administrative and judicial procedures set out in that Title.\u201d <em>Calhoon </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>379 U.S. 134, 141, 85 S.Ct. 292, 296, 13 L.Ed.2d 190 (1964); <em>accord, Driscoll v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 139, </em>484 F.2d 682, 686 (7th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 960, 94 S.Ct. 1490, 39 L.Ed.2d 575 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"A-E\">We hold that the district court properly ruled that it did have jurisdiction. The subject matter of Title IV is the election of union officers. By contrast, the appellants here challenge a dues increase and the selection of delegates who voted on the increase. Title I specifically governs the increase of dues, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(3), and also ensures the right of every member of a union \u201cto participate in the deliberations and voting upon the business of [membership] meetings,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 411(a)(1). Title IV has no language referring to increases of dues, participation in voting on matters other than election of officers, or the election of delegates. Thus Title I applies to the facts of this case much more directly than Title IV. <em>See Gordon v. Laborers\u2019 International Union, </em>490 F.2d 133, 137 (10th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 836, 95 S.Ct. 63, 42 L.Ed.2d 62 (1974) (upholding Title I jurisdiction in a case with facts similar to those present in the instant case).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">None of the cases cited by the appellees are inconsistent with this view. In <em>O\u2019Doherty </em>v. <em>Brotherhood of Railway, Airline &amp; Steamship Clerks, </em>618 F.2d 484, 486 (8th Cir.1980), the court, in a case challenging the union\u2019s system of representation on an intermediate board, held that Title IV governed because 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(d) specifically governs the election of officials to union intermediate bodies. Similarly, the court in <em>Kempthorne v. United Transportation Union, </em>457 F.2d 551 (7th Cir.1972) (per curiam), held that Title IV governed a challenge to the nonproportional voting system for electing the chairman of a union committee, saying that the committee was an intermediate body governed by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(d). Finally, in <em>Pruitt v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters, </em>518 F.Supp. 61, 63 (N.D.Ga. 1981), the court held that Title IV governed where the claim was that a union official was improperly elected and ineligible to hold office, because the case involved a matter of qualification fo^ office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>III. PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"AQJ\">Section 101(a)(1) of the Act provides that \u201c[ejvery member of a labor organization ... shall have equal rights and privileges ... to attend membership meetings, and to participate in the deliberations and voting upon the business of such meetings, subject to reasonable rules and regulations in such organization\u2019s constitution and bylaws.\u201d The appellants contend that this section requires that delegate representation for AFM conventions be nearly proportional to the size of the membership of each constituent local. Both district court decisions stated that the issue in the case was whether the representation system was \u201creasonable\u201d under section 101(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">The appellees argue that section 101(a)(1) has no application because by its terms it applies to membership meetings, not to delegate conventions. They contend that section 101(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is the only section that applies to dues increases and they note that that section makes no mention of any requirements for the selection of those who vote on dues increases. Neither Judge Shadur nor Judge Parsons addressed this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">The few cases that have considered delegate selection systems have suggested that the standards of section 101(a)(1) apply even though the section itself does not. In <em>Gordon v. Laborers\u2019 International Union, </em>490 F.2d 133 (10th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 836, 95 S.Ct. 63, 42 L.Ed.2d 62 (1974), the court said that section 101(a)(1) did not apply to the selection of delegates to a district council because the section governs membership meetings only. It held that therefore Congress did not intend to impose a proportional representation system on international unions. Nevertheless, in upholding the delegate system, the court referred to the \u201creasonable rules and regulations\u201d language of section 101(a)(1), implying that the delegate system was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 137-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">In <em>Rota v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline &amp; Steamship Clerks, </em>489 F.2d 998 (7th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1144, 94 S.Ct. 896, 39 L.Ed.2d 99 (1974), we noted that section 101(a)(3) is silent concerning the procedures that must be followed in voting on a dues increase. We commented, however, that \u201c[njecessarily, . .. the word \u2018vote\u2019 connotes a fairly determined expression of the will of the union membership and a reliable and accurate count thereof,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1004, and we remanded the case for further proceedings. In considering our remark, the district court on remand concluded that section 101(a)(3)(B) incorporated the protections guaranteed by section 101(a)(1). <em>Rota v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline &amp; Steamship Clerks, </em>64 F.R.D. 699, 702 (N.D. Ill.1974). In addition, the Supreme Court has suggested that section 101(a)(3)(B) contains an implicit fairness-of-representation requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>Section 101(a)(3)(B) is a part of Title I, entitled the \u201cBill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations.\u201d This Title guarantees to every member of a labor organization equal rights and privileges to vote, to attend meetings, and to participate in the deliberations and business of such meetings. Section 101(a)(3)(B) forms a part of this framework by requiring participation by all members, either directly or through their elected representatives, on certain union matters thought to be of special importance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAod\"><em>American Federation of Musicians v. Wittstein, </em>379 U.S. 171, 181, 85 S.Ct. 300, 306, 13 L.Ed.2d 214 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">We agree with the appellees that section 101(a)(1) by its language does not apply to delegate representation, and that section 101(a)(3) is the only section that does. Nevertheless, we agree with the district court in <em>Rota </em>that section 101(a)(3) incorporates the safeguards of section 101(a)(1). Thus the inquiry is identical whether section 101(a)(1) or 101(a)(3) is applied: was the convention representation system reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">We believe that this is the proper interpretation of our statement in <em>Rota </em>that \u201cthe word \u2018vote\u2019 connotes a fairly determined expression of the will of the union membership and a reliable and accurate count thereof.\u201d 489 F.2d at 1004. Imbuing section 101(a)(3) with the reasonableness requirement of section 101(a)(1) is the only way to ensure that the purpose of section 101 \u2014 \u201cto shield the union membership from arbitrary, autocratic, and despotic control by union officers and leaders,\u201d <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3, </em>686 F.2d 723, 727 (9th Cir.1982), and to \u201cprevent[] the leadership of a union from imposing arbitrary financial exactions unilaterally on its membership,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 728 \u2014 is fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">Accordingly, we must consider whether Title I was designed to require proportional delegate representation at union conventions. The only Supreme Court case to have considered the application of section 101 to weighted voting systems is <em>American Federation of Musicians </em>v. <em>Wittstein, </em>379 U.S. 171, 85 S.Ct. 300, 13 L.Ed.2d 214 (1964). There, union members challenged AFM\u2019s roll call procedure in which each local casts as many votes as it has members, asserting that each delegate could cast only one vote regardless of the size of the local. They contended that AFM\u2019s system was prohibited by the requirement of section 101(a)(3)(B) that a dues increase be approved by \u201cmajority vote of the delegates voting at a regular convention.\u201d The Court held that a weighted voting system was permissible under the statute: \u201cWe think . . . that the vote of an elected delegate may reflect the size of his constituency . .. . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 85 S.Ct. at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\"><em>Wittstein </em>concerned the reverse of the situation here, however, and thus its relevance to this case is limited. The Court considered a claim that a nonproportional system was required; the claim here is that a proportional system is required. The only significance of the case is its tacit acceptance of nonweighted voting and the Court\u2019s remark that \u201cSection 101(a)(3)(B) ... authorizes a representative system of government and does not require a town meeting for action by an international or national union.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182, 85 S.Ct. at 306 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">The one case directly on point is <em>Gordon v. Laborers\u2019 International Union, </em>490 F.2d 133 (10th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 836, 95 S.Ct. 63, 42 L.Ed.2d 62 (1974). In that case, locals with fewer than 500 members were allowed two delegates, and locals with 501 to 1000 members were allowed three delegates. The court rejected the claim by members of a local with over 600 workers that the system violated section 101(a)(1) because it gave small locals greater proportional representation than large locals. The court, citing <em>Wittstein\u2019s </em>\u201ctown meeting\u201d language, held that section 101(a)(1) \u201cwas not intended to impose a proportional representation system on international unions or their intermediate bodies,\u201d 490 F.2d at 137, and further stated that no other statutory provision did either, <em>id. </em>at 137-38. The court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>disputes between an international and its locals were best left to internal settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 138. <em>See O\u2019Doherty v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline &amp; Steamship Clerks, </em>618 F.2d 484, 487 (8th Cir.1980) (suggesting in dictum that section 101(a)(1) did not make invalid a union rule providing for one vote for each local regardless of size).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">With the dearth of case law on the application of Title I to delegate selection rules, we must examine the legislative history of the provision. Because Title I as enacted was written largely from the floor of the Senate, Congressional expression of the intent behind some of the sections, such as section 101(a)(3), is, in the words of one commentator, \u201calmost nil.\u201d Rothman, <em>Legislative History of the \u201cBill of Rights\u201d for Union Members, </em>45 Minn.L.Rev. 199, 212 (1960). Nevertheless, the evolution of the section that became section 101(a)(1) demonstrates that Congress did not intend to require proportional voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">The version of Title I proposed by Senator McClellan provided that the vote of delegates at a convention \u201cshall be numerically equivalent, or proportionate, to the number of members of [each] constituent unit.\u201d S.1137, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 104(2); <em>see </em>105 Cong.Rec. 2407-17 (1959) (remarks of Sen. McClellan). The Senate Labor Committee, however, reported out the Kennedy-Ervin bill, which contained no such provision. S.1555, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 105 Cong.Rec. 5253 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">While the Senate was considering S.1555, Senator McClellan offered an amendment on the floor providing for \u201cidentical voting rights and equal protection of [a union\u2019s] rules and regulations.\u201d 105 Cong.Rec. 5810 (1959) (remarks of Sen. McClellan). The Senate passed this bill. <em>Id. </em>at 5827. This version was short lived, however; Senator Kuchel and others proposed a substitute amendment, which the Senate passed overwhelmingly. <em>Id. </em>at 6030. The new version eliminated the \u201cidentical voting rights\u201d language and substituted the \u201creasonable rules and regulations\u201d language of the section as enacted. Congress then enacted the bill into law with the wording it now has. <em>Id. </em>at 16435 (Senate passage), 16653-54 (House passage). Thus Congress rejected the version of Title I requiring a one-member, one-vote delegate system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">Further support for the view that, in passing the Act, Congress did not intend to require proportional representation at conventions of national or international unions may be found in the regulations for Title IV. These regulations, promulgated by the Office of Labor-Management Standards Enforcement of the Department of Labor, state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-9\">[T]he structure of representation of the membership is a matter for the Union to determine in accordance with its constitution and bylaws. <em>There is no indication that Congress intended, in enacting Title IV of the Act, to require representation in delegate bodies of labor organizations to reflect the proportionate number of members in each subordinate labor organization represented in such bodies.... </em>Congress did not attempt to specify the organizational structure or the system of representation which unions must adopt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab7c\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 452.127 (1982) (emphasis added). There is no reason to believe that Congress intended to adopt a different standard for voting under Titles I and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">Although few Congressional expressions of intent about specific provisions of Title I are available, the general purpose of Title I is apparent. It was designed \u201cto further the Act\u2019s primary objective of ensuring that unions would be democratically governed and responsive to the will of their memberships.\u201d <em>Finnegan v. Leu, </em>456 U.S. 431, 102 S.Ct. 1867, 1870, 72 L.Ed.2d 239 (1982). On the other hand, the \u201cgeneral congressional policy [is] to allow unions great latitude in resolving their own internal controversies.\u201d <em>Calhoon </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>379 U.S. 134, 140, 85 S.Ct. 292, 296, 13 L.Ed.2d 190 (1964). With respect to specific provisions of Title I, section 101(a)(3) is designed to prevent union officers \u201cfrom imposing arbitrary financial exactions unilaterally on its membership.\u201d <em>Burroughs v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3, </em>686 F.2d 723, 728 (9th Cir.1982). As for section 101(a)(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>\u201c[t]he principle ... is that those who are bound, as members, by the union\u2019s decisions should have the opportunity to take part in the deliberations.\u201d Cox, <em>Internal Affairs of Labor Unions Under the Labor Reform Act of 1959, </em>58 Mich.L.Rev. 819-34 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">With the purpose and legislative history of Title I in mind, we hold that the delegate selection system is reasonable. First, given that Congress did not require a one-member, one-vote system of representation, the system is permissible as long as some meaningful representation is achieved. Here, CFM did have four delegates at the convention. Second, the AFM constitution allows for the expression of true majority will through roll call votes for changes in the bylaws (such as dues increases). Although it is true that no one delegate or local can demand a roll call vote, the requirement of needing fifteen locals or thirty delegates does not seem unduly burdensome. The union is entitled to devise a roll call procedure that is not so easy to comply with that <em>every </em>matter is subject to a roll call vote and its attendant delay upon the demand of a small number of locals or delegates. Furthermore, the appellants do not even contend that the delegates from Local 10-208 asked for a roll call vote, much less that they were precluded from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">IV. OTHER ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"ABN\">A. <em>Nonuniformity of Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">The appellants contend that the dues increase violated section 101(a)(3) because the AFM International Executive Board was empowered to waive the dues increase in the case of a particular local upon the application of that local. The appellants cite <em>Burroughs v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 8, </em>686 F.2d 723 (9th Cir. 1982), as invalidating a dues increase where the union board had unlimited discretion to impose or not to impose a dues increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">In <em>Burroughs, </em>the membership approved a procedure whereby dues would automatically increase as wages increased, subject to the union board\u2019s power to suspend all or part of the increase at its sole discretion. The court held this invalid because it gave the union officers \u201cnearly unfettered discretion to determine the size of any increase in dues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729. The fault with the procedure was that the union members in effect had delegated to union officers their power to approve or disapprove of a dues increase. \u201cThe union membership is never provided an opportunity to vote \u2014 yes or no \u2014 whether dues shall increase, either absolutely or as a percentage of earnings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">By contrast, in the instant case there was no such delegation of power. The dues increase was uniform and specific and was required to go into effect. Union officers had only limited discretion to waive the increase: a local had to take the initiative, and thus the discretion was only on a case-by-case basis. Union officers had no power to waive the increase for locals that did not apply for waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">The inapplicability of <em>Burroughs </em>is further shown by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision upholding a dues increase subject to the union president\u2019s discretion to approve individual exceptions to the imposition of a minimum rate. In <em>Mori v. International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, </em>653 F.2d 1279 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1147, 102 S.Ct. 1011, 71 L.Ed.2d 301 (1982), the court, stating that the question was whether \u201ca dues increase ... subject to suspension at the discretion of the president is within the range of substantive choices a convention may make without violating \u00a7 101(a)(3),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1284, held that such an increase was proper. The court said that the case was not one where the international was enriching itself at the expense of unpopular locals, because the locals received most of the dues. Because the increase was voted on and adopted at a convention at which the concerned local was represented, and because the increase was primarily for the financial benefit of the locals, the court held that the increase did not run afoul of section 101(a)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 1284-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-11\">The instant case is almost identical to <em>Mori. </em>Here, only one-half percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>dues was payable to the international; the rest was payable to the locals. Thus, there is no sense that the international or small locals were seeking to enrich themselves at the expense of large locals like CFM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">The appellants further argue that the one percent increase for locals that had work dues as of July 1,1980, is invalid because it discriminates against locals with work dues structures. We reject this contention. In <em>Mori, </em>the court approved a work dues levy imposed only on one small division of workers (field construction members). The court noted that the dues went only to the locals, not the international, and concluded that the international proposed this levy because it believed that field construction locals needed the money. 653 F.2d at 1284-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">In the instant case, this particular claim apparently was not raised until this appeal, and thus there was no opportunity to develop the facts about why the proposal was written in this manner. Nevertheless, we find no fault in the passage of the dues increase because the dues went to the locals. We will not interfere with the union\u2019s decision to give extra money to locals with existing dues structures where \u201c[t]he record does not reflect an attempt on the part of a majority of the international to exploit or discriminate against [a] minority.\u201d <em>Mori, </em>653 F.2d at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">B. <em>The Locals\u2019 Autonomy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">Although their briefs are unclear on this point, it appears that the appellants argue that the one percent levy interferes with the locals\u2019 rights to set their own rates. Specifically, they note that the effect of the provision raising the dues rates of locals with existing dues structures is to \u201cfreeze\u201d the rate of dues at the rate in effect as of July 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">We find no impropriety. In <em>Ranes v. Office Employees International Union, Local No. </em>28, 317 F.2d 915 (7th Cir.1963), we held that an international union could raise the minimum rates payable to the local without a secret ballot of the members of the local. <em>Id. </em>at 918. The action of the international in setting the dues of the local union is within the power of internationals as recognized in <em>Ranes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(3) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">(3) Dues, initiation fees, and assessments.
