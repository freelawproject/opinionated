(Nekton) from violating the overtime compensation provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>(FLSA). The Secretary also seeks unpaid overtime compensation for \u201cmarine technicians\u201d and \u201celectronics technicians\u201d employed aboard Nekton\u2019s oceanographic research vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-22\">The district court found Nekton in violation of the FLSA, and Nekton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-23\">The sole issue is whether marine technicians and electronic technicians aboard oceanographic research vessels are \u201cseamen\u201d within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(6) and therefore exempt from the overtime cpmpensation provisions of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-24\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-25\">Nekton is a California corporation which performs oceanographic, seismologieal, and geological research principally for govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>ment agencies and oil companies. Nekton owns three oceanographic research vessels (ORV\u2019s), all of which are under United States registry. The vessels collect data but have no laboratories on board. Most of Nekton\u2019s surveys are conducted off the coasts of the United States and Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">Nekton\u2019s ORV\u2019s normally carry no passengers other than Nekton\u2019s employees and the client\u2019s technical representative, and no cargo or equipment other than that necessary for the surveys to be conducted. On a typical coastal survey, the ORV is manned by a crew of twelve to fifteen members. The crews generally include a captain, mate, engineer, navigator, cook and deckhands. They also include marine and electronic technicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">When an ORV is moored, Nekton pays all the crew members overtime compensation as required by the FLSA, but when the crew is working at sea, Nekton does not pay them extra compensation for overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">Marine and electronic technicians are paid monthly salaries and receive a salary differential for sea duty. They do not need merchant mariners\u2019 documents, and do not sign shipping articles before they serve on an ORV. The district court described their duties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-7\">MARINE TECHNICIAN: assists in launching and recovering seismic sound-generating devices and sound-listening devices; monitors seismic instruments; occasionally stands bridge and in-port anchor watches; assists in mooring and anchoring; assists the cook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-9\">ELECTRONIC TECHNICIAN: maintains and repairs seismic instruments and shipboard electrical and electronic equipment; assists in launching and recovering seismic sound-gathering devices and sound-listening devices; monitors seismic instruments; occasionally stands bridge and in-port anchor watches; assists in mooring and anchoring; assists the cook.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-14\">The district court also found that all crew members occasionally perform other tasks required for the general operation of the vessel as an ORV. But when a survey is conducted far from the ORV\u2019s home port, a smaller crew takes the ORV to its destination, and the marine and electronic technicians are flown to the ORV before the survey begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-15\">The district court found that the primary duties of the marine technicians are to launch and retrieve the seismic gear, and to operate the seismic recorders. The district court also found that the primary duties of electronic technicians are to maintain the electronic and seismic gear, the ship\u2019s radio, and to assist the ship\u2019s engineer to repair the ship\u2019s gear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-16\">Based on these findings, the district court concluded that Nekton\u2019s marine and electronic technicians are \u201cpart of the ship\u2019s scientific team\u201d and are not exempt as seamen from the overtime provisions of the FLSA. The court noted that it is Nekton\u2019s burden to prove that its employees are exempt, and that the term \u201cseaman\u201d has been interpreted to refer to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azb\">one who performs as a master or subject to the authority, direction, and control of a master aboard a vessel, service which is rendered primarily as an aid in the operation of a vessel as a means of transportation and who performs no substantial amount of work of a different character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">Conclusions of Law 2. The district court found that the principal activities of Nekton\u2019s marine and electronic technicians are not of a \u201cnautical nature,\u201d but their purpose was to \u201caid in the performance of seismic surveys.\u201d They are not \u201cseamen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AdUm\">The district court also stated that the ORV Act, codified at 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 444 required it to hold that scientific personnel were not seamen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the ORV Act does not mention the FLSA, the district court held that the exclusion of scientists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>from the \u201cseamen\u201d category applies to the FLSA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">The court ordered Nekton to pay overtime compensation to its marine and electronic technicians, and enjoined Nekton from future violations of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">The premium overtime compensation provisions of-29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 do not apply to \u201cany employee employed as a seaman.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(6). Therefore, the applicability of the overtime provisions to marine and electronic technicians depends on whether these employees are \u201cseamen\u201d within the meaning of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">An employer who claims an exemption from the FLSA has the burden of showing that the exemption applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-9\">Any exemption from [the FLSA] must therefore be narrowly construed, giving due regard to the plain meaning of statutory language and the intent of Congress. To extend an exemption to other than those plainly and unmistakably within its terms and spirit is to abuse the interpretative process and to frustrate the announced will of the people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\"><em>A.H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, </em>324 U.S. 490, 493, 65 S.Ct. 807, 808, 89 L.Ed. 1095 (1945); <em>accord, Mitchell </em>v. <em>Kentucky Finance Co., </em>359 U.S. 290, 295, 79 S.Ct. 756, 759, 3 L.Ed.2d 815 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-11\">The FLSA does not expressly define \u201cseaman\u201d; but that term has been interpreted both in the regulations and by the courts. Under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 783.31, the term applies only to an employee who aids \u201cin the operation of [the] vessel as a means of transportation, provided he performs no substantial amount of work of a different character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-12\">Here, the primary duties of the marine and electronic technicians did not aid the operation of the ORV as a means of transportation. The technicians did occasionally stand watch, assist in ship maintenance, serve as messmen or operate the ship\u2019s shore boat, but as the district court found \u201c[t]he evidence adduced by the defendant at trial did not show that such additional duties were performed by defendant\u2019s marine technicians on a regular basis or other than incidental to the employees\u2019 primary duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-15\">One does not become a \u201cseaman\u201d under the FLSA merely because he performs services aboard a vessel on navigable water. Bargees who spent most of their time loading and discharging cargo were held by the FLSA not to be exempt from the overtime compensation provisions merely because they spent a small part of their time engaged in maritime duties. <em>Knudsen </em>v. <em>Lee &amp; Simmons, Inc., </em>163 F.2d 95 (2d Cir.1947). Persons employed aboard movable dredges who occasionally performed maritime duties were held not to be seamen under the FLSA if they spent most of their time doing industrial work. <em>Sternberg Dredging Co. v. Walling, </em>158 F.2d 678 (8th Cir.1947); <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 783.33; <em>see also Marshall v. Woods Hole Oceanographic Inst., </em>458 F.Supp. 709 (D.Mass.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-16\">Nekton may be correct that exempting some employees and not others who sometimes perform identical work at the same time on the same ORV vessel may create significant problems. But those are problems which should be addressed to Congress and the agencies charged with the administration of the applicable laws and not to the Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-17\">Under FLSA, seamen are exempt from provisions of the Act although the Act does not define \u201cseamen.\u201d The regulations require that to be a seaman, one must render service primarily as an aid to the operation of the vessel as a means of transportation and not perform substantial work of a different character* 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 783.31 and \u00a7 783.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-18\">The exemption must be narrowly construed, and the burden is on the employer to prove it. The district court found that the marine and electronic technicians were \u201cpart of the ship\u2019s scientific team\u201d and that their primary duties were to operate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>care for the electronic and seismic gear and seismic recorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">The district court found that these employees were not exempt and that they were subject to the overtime provisions of the FLSA. We agree with the court\u2019s analysis of the law and the regulations, and we also agree with the court\u2019s findings of fact, all of which were amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1194-11\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 444 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-12\">\u00a7 444.
