On appeal defendants urge that plaintiff has not shown it will probably succeed on the merits. We stated in <em>Dataphase:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-20\">It follows that the court ordinarily is not required at an early stage to draw the fine line between a mathematical probability and a substantial possibility of success. This endeavor may, of course, be necessary in some circumstances when the balance of equities may come to require a more careful evaluation of the merits. But where the balance of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>factors tips decidedly toward movant a preliminary injunction may issue if movant has raised questions so serious and difficult as to call for more deliberate investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying the above standard in granting the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">We do, however, request the district court to expedite an early determination on the merits of the legal issue involved as to the applicability of the Minnesota Franchise Act, Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 80C.01 to -.22 (West Supp.1983), asserted by the plaintiff as governing the relationship of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The order granting the preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
