On appeal, he asserts that the trial court\u2019s reference to his codefendants\u2019 guilty pleas was plain error. \u25a0 We agree and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-26\">During voir dire, the trial judge summarized the indictment to the prospective jurors, then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-27\">\u201cI am going to tell you that the two people who it\u2019s claimed were involved with him in this conspiracy, Ralph Baez, Jr. has pled guilty to one conspiracy count and Carl Andrew Lancaster has entered a plea of guilty to a lesser charge of having knowledge of some violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>which he did not report. But I think that if they testify \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they will or not, but at least Ralph Baez, Jr., who\u2019s the son of this Defendant, will say: Yes, I\u2019m guilty but my father was not. He was not involved at all. It was me and Lancaster, but that you\u2019ll hear [in] the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u201cI say that to tell you that the law is clear that you must accept what the law mandates, and that is: you presume the Defendant innocent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Rec., supp. vol. I, at 3-4. Although Carl Lancaster testified, Ralph Baez, Jr. did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">A codefendant\u2019s guilty plea may not be used as substantive evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>E.g., United States v. Halbert, </em>640 F.2d 1000, 1004 (9th Cir.1981). If the codefendant testifies, however, either the government or the defense may elicit evidence of a guilty plea for the jury to consider in assessing the codefendant\u2019s credibility as a witness. <em>See id. </em>at 1004-05; <em>United States v. Wiesle, </em>542 F.2d 61, 62 (8th Cir.1976). Because of the potential for prejudice, cautionary instructions limiting the jury\u2019s use of the guilty plea to permissible purposes are critical. <em>See Halbert, </em>640 F.2d at 1006-07. No instruction was given to inform the jury that it could consider Lancaster\u2019s guilty plea only as evidence relating to his credibility. Even more serious than the failure to give a limiting instruction, however, is the fact that the guilty plea reference was also made with respect to Ralph Baez, Jr., who did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The Government asserts that the trial judge\u2019s remarks were justified because his purpose was to explain the absence of Lancaster and Baez, Jr. as codefendants. When codefendants plead guilty mid-trial, the judge may so inform the jury to prevent speculation on their absence, although it is preferable to explain simply that the codefendants are absent for a legally sufficient reason and to instruct the jury not to speculate. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>640 F.2d 87, 90-92 (7th Cir.) (codefendant interrupted questioning of witness, had jury excused, changed plea to guilty), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 991, 101 S.Ct. 2331, 68 L.Ed.2d 851 (1981); <em>see also United States v. Earley, </em>482 F.2d 53, 58-59 (10th Cir.) (codefendant guilty plea on fifth day of trial), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1111, 94 S.Ct. 841, 38 L.Ed.2d 738 (1973); <em>United States v. Washabaugh, </em>442 F.2d 1127, 1129 (9th Cir.1971) (codefendant guilty plea \u201c[a]fter most of the evidence was in\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">However, here the codefendants pled guilty prior to the beginning of trial. Two Fifth Circuit cases are directly on point. In both <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>546 F.2d 47 (5th Cir.1977), and <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>544 F.2d 778 (5th Cir. 1977), the trial court had committed reversible error by telling prospective jurors that the defendants\u2019 co-indictees had pled guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">\u201c[T]here is no need to advise the jury or its prospective members that someone not in court, not on trial, and not to be tried, has pleaded guilty. The prejudice to the remaining parties who are charged with complicity in the acts of the self-confessed guilty participant is obvious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-12\"><em>Hansen, </em>544 F.2d at 780. If anything, the prejudice was greater here than in <em>Hansen </em>and <em>Vaughn, </em>for the trial judge not only told the jurors of the codefendants\u2019 pleas but also told them to expect Ralph Baez, Jr. to testify to exculpate his father. When Baez, Jr. did not appear as a witness, the jury might have been tempted to conclude, after the judge\u2019s remarks, that it was because he could not honestly testify in his father\u2019s favor. The trial judge\u2019s remarks constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">No objection was made to the court\u2019s comments. Nevertheless, we may notice plain error affecting the substantial rights of the accused even though the error was not objected to below. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). \u201cIn determining whether the \u2018clear error\u2019 rule should be invoked, the entire record should be considered.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>445 F.2d 421, 424 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 966, 92 S.Ct. 342, 30 L.Ed.2d 286 (1971). \u201c \u2018[I]f one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). <em>See also United States v. Nolan, </em>416 F.2d 588, 594 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 912, 90 S.Ct. 227, 24 L.Ed.2d 187 (1969); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>United States, </em>301 F.2d 412, 414 (10th Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">After reviewing the record, we are convinced that the trial judge\u2019s reference to the guilty plea of Baez, Jr. constituted clear error. The only significant Government witness against Baez, Sr. was an informer, Bill Shahan, a twenty-seven-year-old man who had regularly used drugs for thirteen years. He consented to testify in exchange for the Government\u2019s agreement to drop drug charges against him and his wife, which could have resulted in ten years in prison for them both.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When he was arrested, Shahan told the police that he was expecting a delivery of PCP from Ralph Baez, Jr. the next day. Baez, Jr. and Carl Lancaster were arrested when they made the delivery to Shahan. Lancaster\u2019s testimony at trial was not damaging to Baez, Sr. He admitted he went with Baez, Jr. to deliver the drugs but he testified he had no idea where they came from. Thus, Shahan\u2019s testimony and credibility were critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The great majority of Shahan\u2019s testimony related to his drug dealings with Baez, Jr. By telling the jury that Baez, Jr. had pled guilty, the trial court greatly enhanced Shahan\u2019s credibility. Shahan connected Baez, Sr. with the drug transaction because he allegedly answered the telephone when Shahan called to inquire about Baez, Jr. delivering the PCP. While some other circumstantial evidence tended to tie Baez, Sr. to the conspiracy, the evidence was so far from overwhelming that the judge\u2019s prejudicial remarks could well have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>Compare Williams, </em>445 F.2d at 424 (\u201cThe evidence is so one-sided that it is inconceivable that [correction of the error] would have had any influence on the judgment of the jury or affected the result.\u201d). Under these circumstances, we hold that plain error was committed warranting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-15\">. Because of our disposition, we do not reach the other issues Baez, Sr. raises: sufficiency of the evidence, admission of coconspirator hearsay, and the denial of his request to make an opening statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">. The night after he testified, Shahan was arrested for possession of PCP. He was found under the influence of the drug, staggering barefoot around his front yard in the snow. The Government informed the jury of this incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
