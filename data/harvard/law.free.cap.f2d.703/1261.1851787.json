We reject the Bank\u2019s argument that these charges constitute an impermissible penalty under Georgia contract law and affirm the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-4\">This is a diversity case under Georgia contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">In August 1979, ADP, a New Jersey based firm in the business of providing computer data processing services to financial institutions, acquired Data Computation of Georgia, Inc. (\u201cData Comp\u201d). Data Comp was owned by five shareholder banks in Atlanta, including the First National Bank of Cobb County, which held forty percent of the Data Comp stock. Data Comp served the five shareholder banks by processing deposit, loan and other financial data for those banks and approximately ten others from their data processing center in Atlanta. When ADP acquired Data Comp it agreed to continue to provide computer data processing to .these, fifteen customer banks and to replace the outdated hardware and software with ADP\u2019s modern national computer service product. More specifically, ADP and First National agreed to a three-year data processing services contract running from April 1, 1979 to March 31, 1982. This contract obligated ADP to perform certain data processing services as requested by First National. These services fell into five categories. The Bank was obligated to pay for these services as they were ordered; i.e., the charges were \u201ctransaction related.\u201d The services were to be provided to First National for the charges listed in a schedule which was part of the contract. Also included in the contract was the provision that regardless of First National\u2019s actual use of the data processing services, they would pay ADP a minimum monthly charge equal to eighty percent of the average monthly charge for the services during the immediately preceding six-month period. If First National used the services, they paid for them by the transaction. But if use in any month fell below the average use for the preceding six months, they still were to pay eighty percent of this average as a minimum monthly charge. This formula for minimum monthly charges was to be applied and figured separately for each of the five services categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">ADP was progressing toward conversion to their national system when, in October 1979, Mr. Jack Gray and Mr. Bud Shaw bought controlling interest in First National. Mr. Gray became president and chief operating officer of First National and, shortly, directed his data processing committee to re-evaluate the bank\u2019s relationship with ADP. This committee asked at least six other vendors of computer equipment and services to bid for First National\u2019s business in spite of the existing and on-going contract with ADP. During this search, Mr. Gray found out that one of the computer firms, Trusco Data Services, had ordered a computer from IBM appropriate for bank in-house data processing, and that Trusco would assign their right to purchase the computer to Mr. Gray if Trusco were awarded ADP\u2019s data processing work. At the same time, Mr. Gray received advice from his accounting firm that substantial financial benefits would accrue to him personally if he were to purchase the computer and related equipment and then lease the equipment to First National.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">On February 12, 1980, at Mr. Gray\u2019s request, Mr. Gray and other bank officers met with ADP\u2019s president, Mr. Mclnerney, and two other ADP officers. At this meeting, Mr. Gray voiced his interest in taking First National\u2019s computer operations \u201cin-house.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Three days later, First National concluded its negotiations with Trusco and agreed to change from ADP\u2019s computer service to Trusco\u2019s. For the next three months, First National continued to use and pay for services in all five categories. In May they stopped using services in three categories but continued using the other two. First National paid for services in the two categories which they used but did not pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>minimum service charge as formulated for the other three categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">The jury awarded ADP compensatory damages in the amount of $411,360.32 \u2014 the total of the minimum monthly charges for the remaining months of the contract. The jury also concluded that First National had acted in bad faith or had been stubbornly litigious, so that ADP was entitled to further awards of interest and litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">First National raises four issues on appeal. First, they contend that the trial court erred in denying First National\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, in denying First National\u2019s motion for a new trial on the issue of damages. Second, First National argues that ADP\u2019s cashing of checks paid for services actually rendered, which were less than ADP\u2019s invoices for minimum monthly charges, constituted an accord and satisfaction barring further recovery. Third, First National contends that ADP\u2019s customer surveys should have been admitted either for impeachment or as a business record. Fourth, First National argues that the trial court erred in denying their motion for directed verdict and J.N.O.V. on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees and litigation costs. Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">Both ADP and First National spent most of their efforts in briefing this appeal arguing whether the questioned clause was permissible as a liquidated damage provision or constituted an impermissible penalty. At oral argument and in a supplemental brief, ADP abandons this position and supports a different interpretation. We think this change of course is a wise one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Georgia law does not interpret contracts as providing for liquidated damages unless it is clear that the parties intended it. <em>Jones v. Clark, </em>147 Ga.App. 657, 249 S.E.2d 619 (1978); Ga.Code Ann. Section 13-6-7. While the words \u201cliquidated damages\u201d are not specifically required, some manifestation of the parties intent to agree to liquidated damages is. In meeting what they presumed would be ADP\u2019s position on appeal \u2014 i.e., that the provision was 'an enforceable liquidated damages clause \u2014 First National said in their brief, \u201cThe \u2018minimum monthly charge\u2019 clause on which ADP relied in this case does not meet this threshold condition, [intent], of enforceability of a liquidated damage clause under Georgia law.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at p. 24. Unfortunately for the writer, we wholeheartedly agree. If there was some evidence to suggest that the parties intended this clause to be a liquidated damage provision, we feel that it would certainly fail the strict tests of Georgia law concerning that kind of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-9\">The \u201cminimum monthly charge\u201d provision was found in the contract under a heading called \u201cCost of Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">No mention is made of \u201cliquidated damages,\u201d \u201cbreach,\u201d or other condition to suggest that this provision sought to establish liquidated damages, and we think it clear that this was not the parties\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">If not liquidated damages, then what? As a reading of the contract suggests and ADP now contends, the disputed provision simply describes the price to be paid for ADP\u2019s services. Taking again from First National\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-12\">\u201cAs long as the Bank\u2019s usage of ADP\u2019s service charges exceeded eighty percent of the average of the charges paid by the Bank for the immediately preceding six months, the \u2018minimum monthly charge\u2019 provision in the ADP contract did not apply. The \u2018minimum monthly payment\u2019 clause applied only if, as the Bank performed the contract, the volume of transactions processed by ADP for the Bank in a particular month fell below the average cost during the immediately preceding six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>months. Only then was the Bank required to pay ADP the \u2018minimum monthly charge\u2019 for that particular month.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at p. 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">The purpose of the eighty percent provision was to provide ADP an even flow of payments during performance, without abrupt decreases in a month in which the volume of a customer\u2019s transactions fell below the average for the immediately preceding six months. Appellant\u2019s brief p. 25 n. 17. This was important because ADP\u2019s primary investment had been made when they bought the equipment, and a steady flow of cash was part of their bargain to enable them to switch to their new national computer service system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">When First National stopped using ADP\u2019s services in three categories, the eighty percent minimum monthly charge provision was triggered. The charges for the other two categories continued to be billed on a per-transaction basis. Mr. Gray\u2019s outside deal to buy a computer and take his bank\u2019s processing \u201cin-house\u201d did not breach or terminate First National\u2019s contract with ADP. In fact, his actions did not affect the contract at all other than to trigger the eighty percent provision. No clear repudiation existed to constitute anticipatory breach because First National continued to use ADP for service in two of the five categories.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Phosphate Mining Co. v. Atlanta Oil &amp; Fertilizer, </em>20 Ga.App. 660, 93 S.E. 532 (1917). Where no repudiation occurs, the contract is not breached simply by First National\u2019s not requesting service in the three categories. Nothing in the contract obligated them to request services and ADP was obligated to provide service only as requested. The record shows that First National could have asked for and received ADP\u2019s service in all five categories after they converted to Trusco as ADP continued to provide these services to other customer banks. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">Therefore, First National\u2019s argument that ADP must prove actual damages is incorrect. This suit was to collect the contract price and that is what the jury awarded. In the absence of some termination, ADP is allowed to recover the price agreed for their services. 5 Corbin, Contracts Section 1110 (1964). First National\u2019s reliance on <em>Bennett v. Associated Foods, Inc., </em>118 Ga.App. 711, 165 S.E.2d 581 (1968), and <em>Bennett v. Smith, </em>245 Ga. 725, 267 S.E.2d 19 (1980) for the idea that ADP must mitigate their loss after repudiation is misdirected. As the jury found, the contract had not been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">We think the situation is somewhat like a telephone customer service contract. If the customer does not use his phone and communicates to his friends by other means, he still must pay his minimum monthly bill, even if the telephone company knows he is not making calls. Something must terminate the telephone service contract to relieve the customer\u2019s obligation to pay his bill. If he does not pay his bill, the company can sue and recover it in court. The company is not required to prove actual damages \u2014 only that there was a contract for service at \u00e1 certain rate and that the bill was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">The jury\u2019s verdict was supported by the record and the trial court properly denied First National\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">Accord and Satisfaction</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">First National argues that when ADP cashed the checks from the bank for services actually rendered, that an accord and satisfaction occurred which bars further recovery. Under Georgia law, an accord and satisfaction is a\u2019 contract which, like other contracts, requires a \u201cmeeting of the minds.\u201d <em>Myers v. American Finance System of Decatur, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 368 (5th Cir.1980); Code Ga. Section 20-1201. If a check is tendered for less than the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>in dispute, both parties must intend that acceptance will be an accord and satisfaction. <em>Dixie Belle Mills v. Specialty Machine Co., </em>217 Ga. \u00cd04, 120 S.E.2d 771 (1961); <em>American Food Purveyors, Inc. v. Lindsay Meats, Inc., </em>153 Ga.App. 383, 265 S.E.2d 325 (1980). The amounts for which the checks were made were not in dispute. There was evidence that the paying officer from First National had conversations with local officers of ADP agreeing to pay the undisputed amounts pending resolution by the two firms\u2019 top management of disputes over the remaining amounts. This evidence presented a jury question on accord and satisfaction. <em>Clark Equipment Credit Co. v. Refrigerated Transport Co., </em>148 Ga.App. 405, 251 S.E.2d 321 (1978); <em>Prater v. American Protection Insurance Co., </em>145 Ga.App. 853, 244 S.E.2d 925 (1978). In light of the evidence, it was permissible for the jury to find that no meeting of the minds \u2014 and therefore no accord and satisfaction \u2014 occurred by payment of these checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">Customer Surveys</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">First National argues that the trial court erred in not allowing them to introduce ADP\u2019s customer surveys as, impeachment evidence or as an exception to the hearsay rule. The trial judge has broad discretion in the matter of admission or exclusion of evidence and will not be overturned absent an abuse of this discretion. <em>Salem v. U.S. Lines Co., </em>370 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 8 L.Ed.2d 313 (1962); <em>Perkins v. Edwards, </em>228 Ga. 470, 186 S.E.2d 109 (1971); <em>Camelot Condominium Ass\u2019n., Inc. </em>v. <em>Metro Lawns, Inc., </em>161 Ga.App. 574, 288 S.E.2d 325 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">First National sought to use the surveys to impeach testimony that ADP\u2019s services had improved since the firm had been bought from Data Comp. While the surveys did contain some criticism of ADP\u2019s service, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in disallowing the evidence for impeachment purposes. There was nothing in these surveys comparing service under ADP and service under Data Comp.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">Likewise, the surveys do not qualify as a business records exception to the hearsay rule. Rule 803(6), Fed.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">The surveys also do not qualify as an admission against interest under Rule 801(d)(2) Fed.R.Evid. because they are not statements made by a party-opponent. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in disallowing ADP\u2019s customer survey as an admission or a business record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">First National also contends that the trial court erred in denying the bank\u2019s motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-11\">Ga.Code Section 13-6-11 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-12\">The expenses of litigation are not generally allowed as a part of the damages; but if the defendant has acted in bad faith, or has been stubbornly litigious, or has caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense, the jury may allow them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1310-13\">The trial court submitted the issue of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of litigation to the jury by a special interrogatory that asked, \u201cHas the defendant been stubbornly litigious or acted in bad faith?\u201d The jury responded, \u201cYes\u201d, and the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees, expenses and prejudgment interest to ADP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-14\">First National argues that the \u201cor\u201d creates a disjunctive form of special interrogatory \u2014 bad faith <em>or </em>stubbornly litigious \u2014 which may only be affirmed if the award can be justified on <em>both </em>grounds. To support this idea they cite two cases. <em>Dougherty v. Continental Oil Co., </em>579 F.2d 954 (5th Cir.1978); <em>Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Morrow, </em>339 F.2d 411 (5th Cir.1964). It is true that these cases reverse general verdicts rendered under a disjunctive special interrogatory. But the problem in those cases is that one of the jury\u2019s choices was in some way flawed and not a proper basis for the jury\u2019s verdict. In this case the statute is clear that either bad faith or stubborn litigiousness can support the award of fees and costs. Georgia cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>are unanimous in holding that it is only necessary for the plaintiff to show that one of the conditions existed to recover fees and costs. <em>National Service Industries, Inc. v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., </em>661 F.2d 458 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Blank v. Preventive Health Programs, Inc., </em>504 F.Supp. 416 (S.D.Ga.1980); <em>Gordon v. Ogden, </em>154 Ga.App. 641, 269 S.E.2d 499 (1980); <em>Marler v. River Creek Assocs., </em>138 Ga.App. 471, 226 S.E.2d 311 (1976). The instructions were not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">The first possible ground for award of fees and costs is \u201cbad faith.\u201d This has been defined as \u201cactual or constructive fraud or a design to mislead or deceive another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake, but prompted by some sinister motive.\u201d <em>Schafter v. Wolbe, </em>113 Ga.App. 448, 148 S.E.2d 437 (1966). If some evidence of bad faith is produced, the recovery of fees and costs under Section 13-6-11 may be submitted to the jury. <em>A.W. Easter Construction Co. v. White, </em>137 Ga.App. 465, 224 S.E.2d 112 (1976). In this case there was evidence that First National stopped cooperating with ADP\u2019s conversion to the new system after Mr. Gray took charge, sought and accepted bids from other computer firms while under contract with ADP, and wrote letters which the jury found not to be sincere representations of prior events. Further, Mr. Gray entered into a highly lucrative equipment purchase and leasing arrangement between Trusco, himself and First National.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">From this evidence the jury was authorized to conclude that First National had acted in bad faith. Because this finding is supported, it is unnecessary to demonstrate whether a finding of \u201cstubborn litigiousness\u201d is also authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">The decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">. First National contends that Mr. Gray and Mr. Mclnemey agreed to terminate their contract at this February 12th meeting and that a later series of letters confirms this contention. However, it is clear from the record in general and the jury instructions in particular, that the jury specifically found this not to be the case. There is ample evidence to support this finding and we do not disturb it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">. We do not endorse or encourage this sort of mid-stream horse switching. But our efforts to dispose of issues on appeal will not be deterred simply because the correct answer was not suggested until oral argument. Both sides were allowed to discuss the issues fully before, during and after oral argument. First National, as appellant, controls their choice of issues on appeal. That their appeal was met with more than one response does not prejudice them in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">. There is some argument over whether ADP was able to provide service in the three discontinued areas after some months of First National\u2019s conversion to Trusco. The evidence supports ADP\u2019s contention that they were, and it was First National who stopped requesting service,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
