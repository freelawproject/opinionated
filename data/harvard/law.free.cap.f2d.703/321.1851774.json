Griffin brought suit pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et seq. </em>The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed on the grounds that Griffin\u2019s sole remedy is the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101 <em>et seq. Griffin v. United States, </em>No. 82-3145-CV-S-2 (W.D.Mo. Sept. 8, 1982) (order). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-25\">The FECA explicitly provides that it is the exclusive remedy for a federal employee injured on the job. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Griffin admits that his injury occurred when he was at work. However, he argues that because the FECA does not compon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>sate employees for back injuries, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101(19), he should be able to recover under the FTCA. Griffin cites <em>Reep v. United States, </em>557 F.2d 204 (9th Cir.1977), in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">In <em>Reep, </em>the plaintiff, a federal employee working on a military base, was struck by a truck driven by an enlisted serviceman. The accident occurred on the b\u00e1se, some thirty-five minutes before the plaintiff was to report to work. The plaintiff sued under the FTCA, but the district court dismissed on the grounds that the FECA was his sole remedy. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, noting that \u201c[a]n injured federal employee may not bring an action under the FTCA if there is a substantial question as to whether his injuries are covered under FECA... . [I]f there is no substantial question as to FECA coverage, the injured employee may commence an action under the FTCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Griffin claims that because there is no question that his back injury is not covered by the FECA, he may sue under the FTCA pursuant to <em>Reep.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Griffin misconstrues the problem <em>Reep </em>addressed. In <em>Reep, </em>and in a number of other cases applying or discussing a similar \u201cexception,\u201d the issue was whether the injury had occurred while the employee was on the job. <em>Reep v. United States, </em>557 F.2d at 207; <em>see Wallace v. United States, </em>669 F.2d 947 (4th Cir.1982); <em>Hudiburgh </em>v. <em>United States, </em>626 F.2d 813 (10th Cir.1980); <em>Avasthi v. United States, </em>608 F.2d 1059 (5th Cir.1979). The FECA only applies to a federal employee injured on the job. If the injury occurs when the employee is <em>not </em>on the job, then the FECA is not the exclusive remedy \u2014 or even the appropriate remedy. <em>Cf. Wallace v. United States, </em>669 F.2d at 954 (when the injury had nothing to do with employment, compensation is unavailable under the FECA). But if the personal injury did occur on the job \u2014 as concededly Griffin\u2019s did \u2014 then FECA is the exclusive remedy. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8102(a), 8116(c). That the FECA does not compensate an employee with Griffin\u2019s particular injury is a question of scope of coverage, not coverage in and of itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Avasthi v. United States, </em>608 F.2d at 1061; <em>Tredway </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>403 A.2d 732, 734 (D.C.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 867,100 S.Ct. 141, 62 L.Ed.2d 92 (1979). Thus, <em>Reep </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Because Griffin\u2019s injury occurred in the performance of his duties as a federal employee, the FECA is his exclusive remedy. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-15\">. The Honorable William R. Collinson, United States Senior District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-16\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(c) reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A7S\">(c) The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen\u2019s compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute. However, this subsection does not apply to a master or a member of a crew of a vessel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\">. <em>In Mason v. District of Columbia, </em>395 A.2d 399 (D.C.1978), the court found the FECA not to apply because the injury did not cause disability. The plaintiff was allowed to proceed with her common law tort suit. Here, Griffin\u2019s injury is clearly of the type intended to be covered by the FECA \u2014 a disabling personal injury. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101, 8102(a). <em>See Tredway v. District of Columbia, </em>403 A.2d 732, 734 (D.C.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 867, 100 S.Ct. 141, 62 L.Ed.2d 92 (1979); 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 65.14, at 12-9 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"AjW\">We note that Griffin qualified for and received periodic disability payments for his back injury intermittently until February 1980. Griffin now seeks a lump sum payment in compensation for his back injury under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8107(b), (c). Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8107(c)(22) provides for lump sum compensation for the loss of the use of an organ of the body; however, the back is not within the statutory definition of organ in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101(19). Thus, Griffin is statutorily ineligible to recover a lump sum payment in compensation for his back injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
