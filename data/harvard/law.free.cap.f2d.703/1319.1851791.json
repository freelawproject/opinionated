Plaintiff-appellants <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contend that OPM\u2019s approval of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>the reductions was arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), because the cutbacks seriously and unnecessarily undermined the policy expressed in FEHBA section 8904, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8904,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that federal employees have the opportunity to purchase \u201ccatastrophic\u201d coverage for severe or extended illness. For the reasons set forth below we conclude that OPM\u2019s negotiations and final contract with Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (\u201cBlue Cross-Blue Shield\u201d), the insurer that offers the government-wide service benefit plan, rationally accommodated FEHBA\u2019s several competing goals. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court, which held that OPM did not abuse its wide discretion in arranging for federal health insurance benefits. <em>Doe v. Devine, </em>545 F.Supp. 576 (D.D.C.1982) [hereafter, \u201cDistrict Court Opinion\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"Ara-\">A. <em>Overview of FEHBA</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aj9\">FEHBA creates a subsidized health insurance system for federal employees. The system is competitive \u2014 in 1981, 121<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> insurers participated. During a four-week \u201copen season\u201d held each year<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> federal employees may select the plan that best fits their insurance needs and budget. The government\u2019s subsidy is set at sixty percent of the average subscription costs of the six largest plans.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Employees pay the balance of the premiums due on the particular plan they select.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">Insurers may offer four types of coverage: 1) a government-wide \u201cservice benefit plan\u201d; 2) a government-wide \u201cindemnity benefit plan\u201d; 3) \u201cemployee organization plans\u201d; and 4) \u201ccomprehensive medical plans.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> OPM is responsible, under FEH-BA section 8902(a), for negotiating and approving the terms of all plans offered to FEHBA subscribers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-15\">OPM may negotiate one government-wide service benefit plan, and one government-wide indemnity benefit plan. Every federal employee is eligible to join these plans. The service benefit plan has, historically, offered broad \u201cfirst dollar\u201d coverage (full payment for the charges incurred by patients in the early stages of illness) while the indemnity benefit plan has required coinsurance (cost sharing by the patient and the insurer) from the earliest stages of treatment. FEHBA section 8904 directs that both government-wide plans \u201cshall include\u201d coverage for \u201chealth services of a catastrophic nature.\u201d This ease turns on the scope of the undefined statutory term \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-16\">OPM may also contract with employee organization plans (open only to federal employees who join the organizations that sponsor the plans), and comprehensive medical plans (group-practice plans). FEH-BA does not require these plans to include catastrophic coverage. It provides, however, that benefits under all FEHBA contracts shall be subject to \u201csuch m\u00e1ximums, limitations [and] exclusions ... as the Office considers necessary or desirable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-17\">B. <em>History of Blue Cross-Blue Shield Contracts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-18\">From FEHBA\u2019s inception in 1960 Blue Cross-Blue Shield has, under contract with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>OPM, offered the one government-wide service benefit plan; Aetna Life Insurance Company (\u201cAetna\u201d) has offer\u00e9d the government-wide indemnity benefit plan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">The 1960 Blue Cross-Blue Shield contract provided full coverage for 30 days per year of hospitalization for mental illness and 80% coverage for additional inpatient days;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for outpatient treatment of mental illness the plan provided 50% coverage of an unlimited number of visits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1964 inpatient coverage of treatment for mental illness was increased from 30 days per year to 120 days per confinement;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in 1965, to 365 days per confinement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Benefits for outpatient mental care were increased from 50% to 80% of all medically necessary visits in 1967.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> From 1967 until 1975 Blue Cross-Blue Shield offered essentially the same levels of coverage for treatment of mental and physical illnesses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-14\">For the 1975 contract year OPM rejected most of Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s requests for significant reductions in both inpatient and outpatient mental health benefits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These requests were renewed. For 1981 OPM agreed to a reduction in the rate of coverage for outpatient mental care from 80% to 70% for all medically necessary visits; <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> OPM rejected Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s proposal to limit inpatient mental care to 60 days of coverage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> After extensive negotiations addressing diverse interests, described in relevant detail below, OPM agreed to a 1982 Blue Cross-Blue Shield contract that reduced inpatient mental coverage from 365 to 60 days, and outpatient mental coverage from 70% of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>medically necessary office visits to 70% of a maximum of 50 visits.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">C. <em>History of Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">Plaintiff-appellants promptly challenged OPM\u2019s decision to accept Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s 1982 reductions in mental health coverage. On December 23, 1981, the district court denied plaintiff-appellants\u2019 request, for a preliminary injunction directing OPM to renegotiate its contract with Blue Cross-Blue Shield so as to reinstate the level of mental health benefits offered in the 1981 plan.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This court heard an expedited appeal and affirmed on February 23, 1982. The panel agreed with the district court that, <em>\u201cin light of the drastic changes in the status quo\u201d </em>sought in this action, plaintiff-appellants had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to justify preliminary relief; the panel further stated its impression that plaintiff-appellants\u2019 strongest claim lay in their charge that OPM acted arbitrarily and capriciously in approving, without adequate explanation, the coverage reductions in the Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The panel therefore remanded the case to the district court with instructions to OPM to provide a more complete account of its reasons for approving the 1982 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">OPM\u2019s main initiative on remand was to file the affidavit of Kevin J. Burns, OPM\u2019s Assistant Director for Insurance Programs, Compensation Group. The Burns affidavit, J.A. 1081-90, recites the following history of the 1982 contract negotiations between OPM and Blue Cross-Blue Shield.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-12\"><em>March 30,1981: </em>Burns initiated the negotiations in a letter to Blue Cross-Blue Shield and other carriers. The letter stated, in part: OPM\u2019s \u201cobjective for 1982 is to hold premiums and costs as low as possible.\u201d Burns affidavit, H 2. Blue Cross-Blue Shield responded with proposed new coverage provisions and premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-13\"><em>August 21, 1981: </em>OPM analyzed Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s proposed rates; the Agency concluded that federal budget limits on the government\u2019s FEHBA subsidy required lower rates than those proposed by Blue Cross-Blue Shield. Accordingly, on August 21, OPM suggested three major coverage changes expected to achieve about a 6% reduction in costs. These would have decreased \u201cfirst dollar\u201d coverage (by increasing deductibles and coinsurance requirements) but would have left largely intact the plan\u2019s \u201clast dollar\u201d coverage. Burns affidavit, 1H 3 &amp; 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-14\"><em>September 21, 1981: </em>OPM invited carriers to submit, by September 25, proposals embodying benefit reductions \u201cequivalent,\u201d in terms of costs saved, to OPM\u2019s August proposals.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Burns affidavit, If 5. Further negotiations between OPM and Blue Cross-Blue Shield ensued.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Blue Cross-Blue Shield proposed reducing its mental health coverage by imposing a 50-visit limit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>outpatients and a 60-day limit on inpatient benefits. This fiscally \u201cequivalent\u201d proposal was tentatively accepted by OPM. Burns affidavit, 18.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">Blue Cross-Blue Shield and OPM subsequently considered the possibility of retaining 365-day mental coverage but requiring 30% coinsurance by subscribers. This alternative would have provided the needed cost savings; it was rejected, however, because the coinsurance feature was likely to be less attractive than the Blue Cross-Blue Shield proposal to a substantial majority of federal employees. Burns affidavit, 114; Brief of Blue Cross-Blue Shield at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\"><em>October 21, 1981: </em>In early September, OPM studied the \u201cserious budgetary problems in the health benefits program.\u201d Burns affidavit, 16. In a document dated September 11, 1981, OPM acknowledged .that savings beyond those in OPM\u2019s August proposals would be required to meet the cost limit set by the federal budget. On October 21, OPM advised carriers that it would be necessary to achieve a further 6.5% reduction in premiums. Burns affidavit, HH 7 &amp; S.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> OPM announced to carriers that benefits should nevertheless be maintained at \u201cacceptable\u201d levels, and that coverage reductions should be made so that no plan or group of individuals would suffer disproportionately. Burns affidavit, 16. OPM \u201cmade it clear that [it would consider] only limited further reductions, if any, in mental health benefits.\u201d Burns affidavit, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-12\">OPM and Blue Cross-Blue Shield ultimately agreed to reduce dental benefits, and to impose a $20 per day copayment requirement on the first 10 days of hospital benefits<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and a 50-visit limit on coverage of outpatient visits for physical treatment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> After some tumultuous intervening litigation<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the agreed-upon benefit reductions went into effect on January 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">In addition to supplying this history, the Burns affidavit explains OPM\u2019s main objectives and concerns in its 1982 negotiations with Blue Cross-Blue Shield.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-14\">(1) The \u201cvast majority\u201d of mental inpatients are hospitalized for less than 60 days, and the average outpatient requires fewer than 50 visits per year. These facts were \u201c[significant to OPM\u2019s decision to accept [Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s] 1982 levels of nervous and mental health coverage.\u201d Burns affidavit, fl 10 &amp; 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-15\">(2) Throughout the negotiations OPM \u201cwas aware of the high cost of insurance for nervous and mental benefits, especially when compared with the limited return for most federal employees.\u201d Burns affidavit, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-16\">(3) A \u201cfurther consideration\u201d for OPM was that the 1982 Blue Cross-Blue Shield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>mental package was \u201cat least comparable and generally superior to such benefits provided by major private sector employers . Burns affidavit, 112.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">(4) The package accepted by OPM insured that \u201cclaims paid by Blue Cross[-Blue Shield] for nervous and mental benefits would be roughly equal to the premiums paid for those benefits. The same is true with respect to the ratio of claims paid and premiums received for physical coverage. ... [The result is] a fairer and more accurate allocation of premium payments to coverage offered.\u201d Burns affidavit, '[ 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">(5) As between the two alternative proposals for cutbacks in inpatient mental coverage \u2014 imposing 30% coinsurance with 365-day coverage, or providing full insurance for 60 days but nothing thereafter \u2014 OPM rejected the former because it would \u201cnegatively affect far more employees.\u201d Burns affidavit, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">(6) OPM was mindful of Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s concern with the problem of \u201cadverse selection.\u201d If an insurer operating in competition with other insurers offers a costly type of coverage that few subscribers want, only high risk subscribers likely to benefit from that coverage will rationally choose that insurer. At best this will cut into the insurer\u2019s revenue; at worst, that insurance plan will collapse.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cThe 1982 contract with Blue Cross[-Blue Shield], with its benefits reductions, was structured to avoid, to the extent possible, the loss of subscribers who are good risks.\u201d Burns affidavit, H15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">On April 30, 1982, the district court, ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, dismissed the case. It held that the Burns affidavit explained, \u201cin sufficient detail, the various considerations underlying OPM\u2019s decision to accept [Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s] proposal. Those considerations included all the policy goals which are discernible in the FEHBA, including those embodied in section 8904.\u201d District Court Opinion, <em>supra, </em>545 F.Supp. at 584. Plaintiffs then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">The cornerstone of plaintiff-appellants\u2019 appeal is their claim that FEHBA requires OPM to negotiate contracts that provide broad coverage of catastrophic mental and physical illnesses. Accordingly, plaintiff-appellants argue, OPM\u2019s agreement to reductions in catastrophic coverage for mental illness was arbitrary and capricious if feasible alternative methods could have been devised to achieve OPM\u2019s legitimate contract objectives. Plaintiff-appellants attack the justifications for OPM\u2019s decisions set forth in the Burns affidavit as either irrational or inconsistent with the goals of FEHBA, with one notable exception; adverse selection, plaintiff-appellants concede, was a legitimate concern of OPM\u2019s. Plaintiff-appellants insist, however, that OPM could have protected Blue Cross-Blue Shield from undue adverse selection through alternative measures that would have entailed no significant reductions in catastrophic mental coverage in the carrier\u2019s contract: At least Aetna (the other government-wide carrier) and perhaps all carriers could have been required to provide catastrophic mental health protection at approximately the level set in the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-14\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-15\">Our review<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> of OPM\u2019s proffered justifications for the proposals made, alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>natives considered, and trade-offs accepted in negotiations with Blue Cross-Blue Shield is guided by the nature of the function Congress assigned to the Agency.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Plaintiff-appellants challenge the most informal of informal agency action \u2014 the negotiation of a contract. Negotiation involves give and take that does not easily lend itself to the accumulation of a detailed record, to studied, advance justifications of each step taken, or to open, clearly-ordered procedures. These incidents of reasoned decisionmaking are mandatory in formal agency proceedings, and their adoption in informal agency action certainly facilitates judicial review. But an agency\u2019s negotiation of a contract cannot be characterized as \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d merely because it is fluid, uncertain, and, to a large extent, ad hoc. Courts reviewing a contract negotiation must be mindful of the considerable leeway an agency has in that setting to balance and accommodate competing interests. The agency\u2019s judgment must be respected if consistent with the governing law and not unreasonable.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">A court reviewing an agency\u2019s negotiation of a contract, however, properly may demand (1) a coherent, even if post-hoc, statement of the agency\u2019s bargaining objectives and concerns, that the court may compare against the objectives prescribed by law, and (2) an adequate account of the bargaining history, that allows the court to determine whether the agency reasonably pressed its own objectives and did not unreasonably accommodate those of the other party to the negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">B. <em>FEHBA\u2019s Objectives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">The first step in our review of OPM\u2019s 1982 contract negotiations with Blue Cross-Blue Shield is to identify the objectives that the Act requires or permits OPM to advance in contract negotiations with insurers. The relevant sections of FEHBA, we find, articulate at least four competing goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number><em>1. Catastrophic coverage. </em>\u2014 FEHBA unambiguously states that government-wide contracts \u201cshall include\u201d \u201ccatastrophic\u201d coverage. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8904.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> One major goal of the Act is thus to \u201cprotect federal employees against the high and unpredictable costs of medical care.\u201d <em>NFFE I, supra, 679 </em>F.2d at 913 n. 9, quoting <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. Devine, </em>525 F.Supp. 250, 252 (D.D.C.1981). FEH-BA, however, supplies no definition of \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d And while the legislative history emphasizes, in general terms, the importance of catastrophic coverage in FEHBA contracts,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> it gives little guidance as to the level of catastrophic benefits section 8904 contemplates in the government-wide plans. It does, however, suggest first, that Congress was prepared to accept significant limits on catastrophic coverage, and second, that Congress did not intend to require equal levels of catastrophic coverage for mental and physical illnesses. These indications substantially weaken plaintiff-appellants\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-28\">The version of FEHBA that first passed the Senate would have suggested to the Agency minimum levels of catastrophic coverage, with higher minimums for physical than for mental illnesses.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Senate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>guidelines relating to minimum levels of coverage were rejected by the House, which preferred to confide even broader discretion in OPM.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Agency has, over the two decades of FEHBA\u2019s existence, negotiated and accepted contracts that place definite limits on the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d protection afforded subscribers, and that provide more limited coverage for mental than for physical illness. <em>See supra, </em>pp. 1321-1323 &amp; notes 9-18. Congress has reviewed OPM\u2019s administration of the Act frequently, devoting, on several occasions, special attention to the insurance of mental illnesses, and has taken no action to correct OPM\u2019s view of what the Act permits.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\"><em>2. Other coverage and low cost. </em>\u2014 While FEHBA makes explicit the goal of providing catastrophic coverage to subscribers, the Act and its legislative history attach importance to other subscriber interests as well.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Catastrophic coverage is required only as part of a broader FEHBA objective \u2014 to afford federal employees the best possible health coverage at the lowest possible cost to themselves. Congress expected, for example, that FEHBA contracts would offer subscribers broad \u201cfirst dollar\u201d coverage as well as catastrophic coverage,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and the legislative history contains numerous references to the importance of modest premiums affordable to all federal employees.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Catastrophic coverage, first dollar coverage, and low premiums are FEHBA goals that vie for attention. OPM cannot negotiate coverage that is complete, from \u201cfirst\u201d dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>lar to \u201clast,\u201d without abandoning low cost as an objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\"><em>3. Low cost to the government </em>\u2014 The federal government pays about sixty percent of the cost of FEHBA insurance. FEHBA\u2019s \u201centire legislative scheme is based upon OPM considering cost to the government in contracting for health benefit plans.... Congress . .. indicated that OPM should be restricted in the health benefit plans it may contract for by the available sums appropriated therefor.\u201d <em>NFFE I, supra, </em>679 F.2d at 912.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In short, OPM must attend to limits imposed by the federal budget when it negotiates FEHBA contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\"><em>4. Interests of insurers. </em>\u2014 While FEHBA is not a program to promote the welfare of the insurance industry, for practical reasons the Act and its history require OPM to consider insurers\u2019 interests in the overall calculus. First, FEHBA section 8903 strongly invites OPM to negotiate two government-wide contracts. Implicit in this is the suggestion that OPM should not demand, in the government-wide contracts, terms so generous to subscribers that no insurer will accept them.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Second, OPM has an implied responsibility to preserve competition among FEHBA contractors.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Congress expected the two, more-closely regulated, government-wide plans to set typical standards of coverage<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and levels of premiums,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> but relied on competition among all insurers to keep FEHBA program costs down.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Accordingly, as this court has recognized before, OPM appropriately considers in the course of negotiations the \u201cfinancial stability of the federal employee health benefit program\u201d in general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>and, when circumstances so warrant, of one insurer in particular. <em>NFFE II, supra, </em>671 F.2d at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">This goal, as much as any other, may compete significantly with section 8904\u2019s directive that the government-wide insurers include \u201ccatastrophic\u201d coverage. Section 8904 is certainly undercut if OPM demands too little of the government-wide insurers. But if the Agency demands too much, the affected carriers may withdraw from the system or succumb to the less regulated competition, nullifying OPM\u2019s leverage on catastrophic coverage when it might merely have been curtailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">Thus, while OPM is obliged to negotiate for broad catastrophic coverage in the government-wide FEHBA contracts, the Agency may, indeed <em>must, </em>simultaneously concern itself with at least three<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> other competing interests: (1) offering federal employees other types of coverage (particularly \u201cfirst dollar\u201d coverage) and low cost insurance; (2) limiting the federal government\u2019s outlays in connection with the FEH-BA program; and (3) preserving participation by one insurer in each of the government-wide programs, and by other insurers offering other types of plans, to maintain a competitive system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">C. <em>OPM\u2019s Objectives in the 1982 Contract Negotiations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">We next inquire whether OPM\u2019s objectives and concerns in negotiating the 1982 Blue Cross-Blue Shield contract were consistent with FEHBA\u2019s. The Burns affidavit sufficiently indicates that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-9\">First, OPM did have as one objective preserving more than minimal levels of catastrophic coverage in the 1982 Blue Cross-Blue Shield contract.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> That contract curtails, but does not eliminate coverage for expensive, extended illness. Indeed, the coverage of <em>both </em>catastrophic physical and catastrophic mental illness in the 1982 contract substantially exceeds the minimum level guidelines the Senate was prepared to codify when FEHBA was enacted.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> We reject plaintiff-appellants\u2019 contentions that FEHBA section 8904 requires \u201cfull\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> coverage of all catastrophic illnesses, or that it mandates \u201cfull \u2018last dollar\u2019 protection,\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> or that it calls for equal coverage of all types of catastrophic illness. The first two suggestions find no support in the Act or its legislative history, and take no account of FEHBA\u2019s competing interest in providing first dollar coverage while minimizing cost to subscribers and the government.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The third is equally unsupported by the Act, and is undercut by the Senate\u2019s original, explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>proposal, and the House\u2019s implied understanding, see <em>supra </em>notes 35-36, that OPM could contract for different levels of coverage for different types of catastrophic illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">Second, OPM sought to negotiate a contract that would continue to provide other types of coverage, including \u201cfirst dollar\u201d coverage, and would do so at a reasonable cost to subscribers. OPM announced, at the beginning, its objective \u201cto hold premiums and costs as low as possible.\u201d Burns affidavit, 12. When it considered a choice between two proposals for cutting back mental health coverage that would probably yield the savings budgetary constraints required,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> OPM opted for the alternative that would preserve better first dollar coverage and negatively affect fewer employees. Burns affidavit, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">Third, OPM\u2019s paramount objective was to arrive at a contract that would cost the government no more than had been appropriated for FEHBA subsidy. Burns affidavit, 116 &amp; 7. As to this goal, OPM was inflexible; plaintiff-appellants do not question the budgetary constraint on OPM\u2019s bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">Fourth, OPM sought to keep Blue Cross-Blue Shield in the program and thereby preserve the government-wide service benefit plan. Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s central concern \u2014 a concern that almost precipitated its withdrawal from FEHBA \u2014 was with adverse selection. OPM concedes that it shared that concern. Burns affidavit, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-8\">Plaintiff-appellants raise multiple objections to the justifications of OPM\u2019s actions supplied in the Burns affidavit. We summarize here the principal points they urge. Plaintiff-appellants object first to OPM\u2019s recognizing that a \u201cmajority\u201d of mentally ill subscribers will remain well protected under the reduced coverage (Burns affidavit, 1110 &amp; 11), and insist that catastrophic coverage must be geared to protecting the minority who will be exposed to large, uninsured costs. Opening Brief of Appellants at 33-34. The premise of this argument\u2014 that OPM must focus on the provision of catastrophic coverage to the exclusion or substantial subordination of other subscriber interests \u2014 is incorrect.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> FEHBA intended subscribers to receive, at modest cost, broad first dollar as well as last dollar coverage. In attempting to further this objective for as many subscribers as possible, it was proper for OPM to consider what fraction of subscribers would continue to receive full reimbursement under a proposed contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-14\">In a similar vein, plaintiff-appellants maintain that FEHBA contemplates and requires some degree of adverse selection when it authorizes an arrangement under which two, regulated, government-wide insurers are to compete with other, less regulated carriers. <em>Id. </em>at 40. While plaintiff-appellants concede that the problem of adverse selection is of legitimate concern to OPM, they insist that cuts in catastrophic coverage are permitted only as \u201ca last resort, after the exhaustion of alternative remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. Again, plaintiff-appellants\u2019 position would require one of FEHBA\u2019s goals \u2014 insuring federal employees against catastrophic losses \u2014 to take clear precedence over others. The Act does not place the goal of providing catastrophic coverage on such an elevated plane that its curtailment is allowed only as a \u201clast resort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-15\">We agree, however, with a third point made by plaintiff-appellants. Under pre1982 Blue Cross-Blue Shield contracts, subscribers who received mental treatment were reimbursed at rates higher than those at which subscribers who received physical treatment were reimbursed. According to the Burns affidavit, 113, OPM was sympathetic, during the negotiations, to Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s desire to equalize the rates of reimbursement to the two groups of claimants. Plaintiff-appellants question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>the rationality of classifying and comparing the mentally and physically ill in this way. We share their concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">Blue Cross-Blue Shield contracts are carefully drafted to cover only physician-prescribed or \u201cmedically necessary\u201d treatment,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> whether for physical or for mental illness. That mentally ill claimants receive high rates of reimbursement establishes only that those subscribers suffer from illnesses that require exceptionally costly treatment because of the nature or duration of the affliction. No contract that OPM can negotiate will ever change the fact that those whose medical condition requires more costly treatment will benefit more from their insurance than those whose condition requires less expensive care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">However, the goal of parity between mentally and physically ill claimants was, by all appearances, a minor one for OPM, eclipsed by several others that are both rational and anchored in FEHBA. To survive judicial scrutiny under the deferential standard of review it engages, an agency\u2019s negotiation of a contract need not be irreproachable in every detail. It suffices that the agency\u2019s objectives be substantially in accord with the statute\u2019s, and that the provisions of the final contract advance permitted agency goals. We do not believe that the aim to equalize reimbursement rates to mentally and physically ill claimants so skewed OPM\u2019s position that the 1982 contract negotiations with Blue Cross-Blue Shield should be reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">D. <em>OPM\u2019s Negotiations with Blue Cross-Blue Shield</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">We proceed next to determine whether OPM conducted the 1982 negotiations with Blue Cross-Blue Shield in a manner reasonably calculated to further the objectives announced, after the fact, in the Burns affidavit. OPM\u2019s description of the negotiations suffices to establish that the Agency engaged in a genuine effort to balance its own conflicting concerns, and to accommodate, within reason, Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s competing goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">OPM first proposed no cutback in catastrophic mental health coverage; after acceding to significant reductions in that area in the September negotiations, the Agency announced, in October, \u201cthat only limited further reductions, if any, in mental health benefits would be considered by OPM.\u201d Burns affidavit, 18.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> OPM\u2019s early goal was to increase first dollar coverage of dental care and midwifery;<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> an increase in dental coverage, at least, was apparently abandoned in the October round of cutbacks and, in the end, that benefit was reduced. Brief of Blue Cross-Blue Shield at 27. Confined by the non-negotiable congressional appropriation for 1982\u2019s FEHBA subsidy, OPM insisted on the necessary cost reductions, but did so in two cautious stages.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Although sensitive to Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s concerns about adverse selection, the Agency negotiated a contract which, it appears, came very close to being unacceptable to the insurer.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Taking into account the conflicting interests with which OPM contended, we are unavoidably led to the conclusion earlier reached by the district court that \u201c[i]t was not irrational for OPM to accept a[n] ... imposition on one of the FEHBA\u2019s purposes, in order to substantially further other, equally valid statutory goals.\u201d District Court Opinion, <em>supra, </em>545 F.Supp. at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-12\">We turn, finally, to the specific proposals that plaintiff-appellants suggest OPM should have considered and implemented as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>alternatives to cutting back on coverage of catastrophic mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">First, plaintiff-appellants point out that OPM could eliminate adverse selection as between Blue Cross-Blue Shield and Aetna by compelling Aetna to offer the same level of mental coverage as Blue Cross-Blue Shield. Opening Brief of Appellants at 46. But this \u201cremedy\u201d risked accelerating flight to the other 120-odd carriers that are not subject to the catastrophic coverage requirement. And since the government\u2019s contribution to FEHBA is fixed, plaintiff-appellants\u2019 proposal would require a cutback in some other aspect of coverage\u2014 most likely first dollar coverage. Read together, the Act and its legislative history do not establish a clear priority binding OPM to trade off first dollar for last dollar coverage. Relevant too, Aetna, although required as Blue Cross-Blue Shield is, to cover \u201chealth services of a catastrophic nature,\u201d has maintained reduced benefits for mental health since 1975; Congress, aware of Aetna\u2019s cutback, has not endeavored to alter Aetna\u2019s obligation. <em>See supra </em>notes 15 &amp; 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">Second, plaintiff-appellants suggest that OPM could require all FEHBA carriers to provide the same level of mental coverage as in the 1981 Blue Cross-Blue Shield contract. Opening Brief of Appellants at 46. This alternative would undoubtedly eliminate adverse selection on the basis of the mental coverage offered, but would also move away from FEHBA\u2019s two-tiered structure in which only the government-wide carriers are bound by congressional direction to provide \u201csome form of catastrophic sickness insurance.\u201d <footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Again, the high cost of coverage for mental benefits would necessitate cuts in other protection desired by subscribers and recognized as important by Congress.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-10\">Third, plaintiff-appellants suggest OPM could exercise its general regulatory authority under FEHBA section 8902(d) to set up a \u201crisk pool\u201d to spread the cost of mental coverage among all FEHBA carriers. \u201cIndividual carriers would make pro rata contributions to the pool based on their share of total FEHBA subscribers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47. This proposal is barely distinguishable from the second. A risk pool arrangement would effectively require all carriers to <em>pay </em>for mental coverage, and therefore remove incentive not to <em>offer </em>it to subscribers.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-11\">Plaintiff-appellants\u2019 preferred alternatives, in sum, rest upon a view of the statute we have already rejected.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> They read the FEHBA section 8904 provision for catastrophic protection in government-wide plans<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> to mean protection against all severe or extended illnesses, at very high levels of reimbursement, and as a matter so paramount that reductions in \u201clast dollar\u201d coverage may be made only as a \u201clast resort.\u201d We agree that Congress did intend OPM to negotiate firmly with the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>ment-wide carriers for catastrophic coverage. But it would take far clearer directions than Congress has supplied in section 8904 for a court to hold that OPM does not have considerable latitude to accept reductions in some forms of catastrophic coverage in the interest of arriving at \u201cthe best benefit bargain it can arrange.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> OPM sought to assemble a total package of benefits that reasonably accommodated the diverse concerns and interests of subscribers, the government, and the carrier. It proceeded in a manner we cannot characterize as irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">In negotiating the 1982 contract with Blue Cross-Blue Shield OPM set goals that were, by and large, consistent with FEH-BA\u2019s, and conducted its negotiations with the insurer in a manner reasonably calculated to advance those goals. OPM\u2019s decision to accept the 1982 contract \u201creflected a rational balancing of conflicting statutory purposes,\u201d District Court Opinion, supra, 545 F.Supp. at 584, and therefore withstands judicial review.

FEHBA specifies in section 8904 that the government-wide plans \u201cshall include\u201d catastrophic coverage, but provides in section 8903 only that OPM \u201cmay\u201d contract for such plans. Conceivably, these two conditions could be read to require OPM to prefer no government-wide plan at all to one that includes less than complete catastrophic coverage. But the legislative history unambiguously indicates otherwise. Congress firmly intended that two government-wide contracts be negotiated; with that as given, OPM was to negotiate for the best overall bargain it could accomplish \u2014 good catastrophic coverage, first dollar coverage, and favorable premiums. Almost every member of Congress who commented on FEHBA assumed that two government-wide plans would be offered. <em>See generally </em>105 Cong.Rec. 13,558-70, 17,549-63 (1959). At least one Congressman read FEHBA to \u201crequire\u201d OPM to negotiate such contracts, <em>id. </em>at 17,558; several assumed that the government-wide service benefit plan would be negotiated with Blue Cross-Blue Shield, see, <em>e.g., id. </em>at 17,552, 17,556. <em>Cf. </em>District Court Opinion, <em>supra, </em>545 F.Supp. at 583. (\u201c[I]t was not irrational for OPM to secure [Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s] continued participation in the FEHB program by alleviating [Blue Cross-Blue Shield\u2019s] uncertainties [with respect to problems of adverse selection].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">Above all, FEHBA contemplates hard-headed but realistic negotiation between OPM and private insurers. Intelligent negotiation demands sensitivity and, on occasion, concession to the objectives of one\u2019s partner in negotiation. <em>See </em>R. Fischer &amp; W. Ury, Getting to Yes 58-83 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">.

FEHBA section 8902(i) provides: \u201cRates under [the government-wide plans] shall be determined on a basis which, in the judgment of [OPM], is consistent with the lowest schedule of basic rates generally charged for new group health benefit plans issued to large employers.\u201d That section also requires that rates for all \u25a0 plans \u201creasonably and equitably reflect the cost of the benefits provided.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b1373-16\">. \u201c[C]ompetition among carriers and plans [is] healthy and should tend to produce lower costs than if only one approach using one carrier or syndicate of carriers were used to cover all employees.\u201d S.Rep. No. 468, <em>supra </em>note 34, at 8.

Comparability with private sector plans was a further, specifically stated concern. <em>Compare NFFE I, supra, </em>679 F.2d at 913 n. 9, quoting <em>American Federation of Government Employees v.

We note in this context that reductions in mental coverage finally approved by OPM for 1982 had been sought repeatedly by Blue Cross-Blue Shield in prior years, <em>see supra </em>p. 1322 &amp; notes 15, 16; thus the Agency did not act in haste in ultimately accepting cutbacks Blue Cross-Blue Shield had long and insistently urged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b1376-13\">.
