WPX Freight System, Inc. was granted three separate licenses for authority to operate as a motor carrier. The three petitions were consolidated for hearing in this Court, and WPX was permitted to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">WPX, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Western Pacific Railroad Company, a class I rail carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, was granted <em>unrestricted </em>authority to operate as a common motor carrier in each of the three ICC decisions. The fact that the grant of authority was in each case \u201cunrestricted,\u201d and did not in some manner and to some degree limit or restrict WPX to the handling of freight in conjunction with its rail parent, is the root of the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">A preliminary reference at this point to the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d doctrine might put the present controversy in focus at the outset. In deciding applications of rail affiliates, such as WPX, for motor carrier operating authority, the Commission has issued two types of certificates. One authorizes the rail affiliate to provide motor service which is \u201cauxiliary to or supplemental of\u201d the rail service of the parent company and the other type authorizes the provision of service which is unrestricted to that provided by the rail parent. In both types of cases, the Commission has been concerned with the adverse effects of intrusion by the railroads into the motor carrier industry. This interest in protecting the motor carrier industry from unjustified rail intrusion has been greatest in those cases where the rail affiliates seek unrestricted authority. In those cases, the rail affiliate has historically borne the burden of proving \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d in order to justify a grant of unrestricted authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">Although the term \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d is itself not used in the statute, the doctrine of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d is derived from 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11344(c) and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101. Section 10101 is a general statement of national transportation policy. Section 11344(c), in pertinent part, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>[W]hen a rail carrier, or person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, is an applicant and the transportation involves a motor carrier, the commission may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the transaction is consistent with the public interest, will enable the rail carrier to use motor carrier transportation to public advantage in its operations, and will not unreasonably restrain competition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 141, 149-50, 78 S.Ct. 165, 170, 2 L.Ed.2d 158 (1957), the Supreme Court held that the Commission had the power to grant a motor carrier subsidiary of a railroad unrestricted authority where \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d prevail, namely, where unrestricted operation by the rail-owned carrier are found on specific facts and circumstances to be in the public interest. The basic position of the petitioners in each of these consolidated proceedings is that in two proceedings the Commission paid only \u201clip-service\u201d to the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d requirement, and that in one proceeding the Commission did not even mention the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">As indicated, WPX filed three applications for additional authority to carry general commodities, excepting Class A and B explosives and used household goods, over described routes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These three proceedings are referred to by the parties as Nos. 4, 5, 6, and we shall adopt such reference in our discussion of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In No. 4, WPX\u2019s application was opposed, <em>inter alia, </em>by Garrett Freight Lines, Inc. and Milne Truck Lines, Inc., each of which is a petitioner in the present proceeding. The request of Garrett and Milne for an oral hearing was denied on the ground that there were no material facts in dispute, and the application was considered on the basis of written material submitted by both the applicant and the protestants under the Commission\u2019s modified procedure. A Review Board granted the application, and in so doing made no specific reference to the \u201cspecial circumstance,\u201d doctrine. Garrett and Milne appealed the Review Board\u2019s action, and the Commission denied the appeals. American Trucking Associations, Inc. was thereafter permitted to intervene, but the Commission declined to re-open the matter. American Trucking, Garrett, and Milne then filed a petition in this Court to review, and set aside the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">In No. 5, WPX\u2019s application was again opposed by Garrett and Milne. The application, with the objections thereto, was considered under the Commission\u2019s modified procedure and in this instance the Review Board denied WPX\u2019s application, finding that WPX had not met the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d requirement. On appeal, the Commission set aside the decision of the Review Board and granted WPX\u2019s application. In so doing, the Commission found that WPX had met the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d requirement and was entitled to a grant of unrestricted authority. Garrett and Milne then filed a petition in this Court to review and set aside the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">In No. 6, WPX\u2019s application was opposed by Garrett and Milne, and the application was handled under the Commission\u2019s modi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>fied procedure, <em>Le., </em>no oral hearing. In this instance, the Review Board granted WPX\u2019s application and specifically found that the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d requirement had been met. Garrett and Milne appealed, and the Commission denied the appeal. In this proceeding, as in No. 4, American Trucking was permitted to intervene, and its discretionary appeal was denied. American Trucking, Garrett, and Milne then filed in this Court a petition to review and set aside the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">As stated, the petitioner\u2019s position here is that the Commission in granting WPX\u2019s applications did not follow the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d rule. As concerns Nos. 5 and 6, petitioners contend that though the Commission concededly did mention the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d rule, the underlying facts, as found by the Commission, did not justify the Commission\u2019s ultimate finding that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d were present. As concerns No. 4, petitioners point out that neither the Review Board nor the Commission even mentioned the term \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">WPX\u2019s counter argument is that in Nos. 5 and 6, the Commission found that \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d did exist, and that the findings of facts justified such an ultimate finding. As concerns No. 4, WPX admits, as it has to, that neither the Review Board nor the Commission ever used the term \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d However, WPX contends that there is no particular magic in words, and that the important thing is whether the facts as found by the Review Board, and later adopted by the Commission, showed that there were such \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d as that term is defined by statute and the courts, as would justify the grant of unrestricted authority. In this latter regard, WPX argues that the facts, as found, establish \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d even though the term itself was not used by the Review Board or the Commission. We are inclined to agree with WPX\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">As indicated, the doctrine of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d has its roots in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11344(c), which provides that the Commission may grant authority to an affiliate of a railroad which seeks permission to transport by motor carrier only if such is consistent with public interest, will enable the railroad to use motor carrier transportation to public advantage, .and will not unreasonably restrain competition. The key phrases in the statute, so far as we are concerned, are \u201cpublic interest,\u201d \u201cpublic advantage,\u201d and \u201cnot unreasonably restrain competition.\u201d Judicial decisions uniformly utilize, with slight variations, the terms used in the statute, and uphold a grant of unrestricted motor carrier authority to a railroad affiliate where such is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">It is axiomatic that the scope of review by an appellate court of a Commission decision is a narrow one. We may not set aside Commission action unless it be arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, or unless it be otherwise not in accord with the law or unsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>Curtis, Inc. v. I.C.C., </em>669 F.2d 648, 651 (10th Cir.1982); <em>Koppel, Inc. v. United States, </em>612 F.2d 1264, 1269-70 (10th Cir.1979). Our study of the record leads us to conclude that the Commission\u2019s decisions are neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">We agree with WPX that the mere fact that in granting application No. 4, neither the Commission nor the Review Board used the term \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d is not decisive of the matter. The fact is that in the No. 4 proceeding the Commission did grant' unrestricted authority. Hence, the critical issue becomes whether the specific findings, as made by the Review Board and as approved and adopted by the Commission, justified the action taken. In other words, are the findings as made the equivalent of a specific finding of \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Further, the fact that in connection with application No. 5 the Review Board found that there were no special circumstances is, of course, worthy of note, but does not end the matter. The Commission, on administrative review, reversed the Review Board on that particular matter and found that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d did exist. Our problem then is whether the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>findings on the matter are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Permeating, in one form or another, the Commission\u2019s decisions in each of these proceedings is the finding that \u201cpublic interest\u201d suggests the granting of unrestricted authority, as opposed to restricted authority. WPX\u2019s application in the No. 4 proceeding was supported by 125 entities which intended to use WPX\u2019s services if its application were affirmed. In proceeding No. 5, 39 entities proposed to use WPX\u2019s services if that particular application were granted. And in proceeding No. 6, 42 entities indicated a desire to use WPX\u2019s services if allowed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In its decisions the Commission made such illustrative findings as follows: (1) There was a prevailing public need for expedited direct-line motor carrier and intermodel service in the involved traffic corridors; (2) performance by WPX of the service for which application is sought will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need; (3) \u201cpublic interest\u201d is entitled to paramount consideration in determining \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d and flexibility, and discretion should be employed in making any determination of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d; (4) \u201cpublic need\u201d for the proposed service has been shown by the evidence in the record; (5) granting of the application is not only in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d but enables the parent railroad to use WPX\u2019s services to \u201cpublic advantage,\u201d and the like. Additionally, the Commission expressly found that the grant of unrestricted authority would not constitute an undue restraint of competition. In short, our study of the Commission\u2019s decisions indicates to us that, in accord with the provisions of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11344(c), the Commission did give careful consideration to just what was in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d and to the \u201cpublic advantage,\u201d and, at the same time, would not \u201cunreasonably restrain competition.\u201d Based on its findings, the Commission\u2019s grant of unrestricted authority was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">As indicated, each of these three applications was handled under the Commission\u2019s modified procedure for licensing motor carriers, and petitioners\u2019 requests to the Commission for oral hearings were in each instance denied. Petitioners claim that such was a denial -of constitutional due process. We do not agree. The Commission\u2019s use of a so-called \u201cmodified\u201d procedure has been upheld where material facts are not in dispute, and the'statements offered in support of, and in opposition to, the application provide an adequate basis for resolution of the matter. See, for example, <em>Crete Carrier Corp. v. United States, </em>577 F.2d 49 (8th Cir.1978). In placing the three applications of WPX on its modified docket, the Commission, under the described circumstances, did not deny petitioners due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">With one exception, other points raised by the petitioners as grounds for reversal have been considered and are deemed to be without merit and require no comment. However, one matter, perhaps minor in nature, should be further considered by the Commission. In each of its applications, WPX sought authority to carry general commodities, excepting Class A and B explosives and household goods. In proceedings Nos. 4 and 5 the Commission excepted from its grant of authority \u201chousehold goods.\u201d As concerns proceeding No. 6, however, the Commission did not except \u201chousehold goods\u201d from its grant of authority, even though WPX in its application did not seek authority to carry household goods. There is nothing in any of the material before us to indicate why the Commission excepted \u201chousehold goods\u201d in its grant of authority in proceedings Nos. 4 and 5, and did not similarly except in proceeding No. 6. This particular matter should be reconsidered by the Commission. Otherwise, the decisions of the Commission in each appeal are hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">. On January 6, 1983, the Interstate Commerce Commission issued a final policy statement in Ex Parte No. MC-156, Application for Motor Carrier Operating Authority by Railroads and Rail Affiliates. In it, the Commission concluded that in light of recent amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act embodied in the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, Public Law 96-296, and the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Public Law 96-448, the \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d doctrine should be eliminated from motor carrier licensing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">In Case No. 83-4039, the American Trucking Associations, Inc. and others have filed a Petition for Review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit asking the Court to set aside, enjoin or vacate the order of the I.C.C. That petition is now pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-15\">. At the time WPX filed the three applications with which we are here concerned, it held certain authority to transport general commodities, excepting Class A and B explosives and used household goods, but its lead certificate was restricted to operations which were auxiliary or supplemental to its railroad parent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
