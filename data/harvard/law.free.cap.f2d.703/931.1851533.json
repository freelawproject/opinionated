The issue is one of statutory interpretation. We affirm the Board\u2019s reading of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Section 3(f)(3) of the Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231b(f)(3), contains the \u201csocial security minimum guaranty provision.\u201d It says, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-9\">If ... the annuity to which an individual is entitled under this subchapter ... together with the annuity, if any, of the spouse of such individual, is less than the total amount, or the additional amount, which would have been payable to all persons ... under the Social Security Act ..., such annuity or annuities shall be increased proportionately to such total amount, or such additional amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231b(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">Under the Railroad Retirement Act, Margiotta\u2019s annuity is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-12\">Mr. Margiotta $683.95</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-13\">Mrs. Margiotta 0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-14\">Darla Margiotta 0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-15\">$683.95</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">Under the Social Security Act, Margiotta\u2019s annuity would be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-17\">Mr. Margiotta $471.90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-18\">Mrs. Margiotta 193.75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-19\">Darla Margiotta 193.75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-20\">$859.40</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-21\">This is the amount the Board has awarded Margiotta. Margiotta contends that the Act should be interpreted to provide him with an annuity equal to the maximum allowed for each annuitant under either Act. His computation is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-22\">Mr. Margiotta $683.95</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-23\">Mrs. Margiotta 193.75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-24\">Darla Margiotta 193.75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-25\">$1071.45</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-26\">The meaning of this statute may not be plain to every reader. However, its legislative history clarifies the congressional intent. While the statute could appear to direct the award of an amount computed as Margiotta contends, such a reading would be inconsistent with the purpose Congress said it had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-27\">Under the statute, the annuity payable under the Railroad Act is to be increased to the total amount \u201cwhich would have been payable to all persons\u201d under the Social Security Act. Legislative history confirms that Congress passed the statute to protect railroad retirees from receiving benefits less than those provided for under Social Security. Conf.Rep. No. 1215, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1951 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2529, 2556. Thus, it would be curious if the Act directed the award of an annuity greater than the amount receivable under the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-28\">The Senate Report gives the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-29\">To illustrate, if the total annuities to the employee and his spouse is $100 and if the employee\u2019s service were \u2018employment\u2019 the total of monthly benefits to the employee and his spouse under the Social Security Act would be $90, and if such employee and his spouse have a child under the age of 18 so that the monthly benefits to all three under the Social Security Act would be $110, the annuities of the employee and spouse would be increased proportionately to a total of $110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-30\">S.Rep. No. 890, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-31\">The Act intends a computation based on the total amount either Act would award. It does not contemplate a combination of the greatest amounts from each Act. This was the Board\u2019s view. Its decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-32\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
