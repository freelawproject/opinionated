HENDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b591-24\">The National Labor Relations Board (Board) petitions this court to enforce an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>order directed against the respondent, Local Union 323 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (Union), for an alleged unfair labor practice in violation of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(1)(B). We enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The facts are essentially undisputed. In 1970, John Willey, a longtime member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), moved to Palm Beach County, Florida. He obtained a work permit from the local IBEW chapter, Local 323, and secured an electrician\u2019s job through the Union\u2019s hiring hall. He retained his official membership with his former local chapter of the IBEW in Terre Haute, Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In 1974, Willey passed the county\u2019s master electrician examination and received a certificate of competency. This authorization enabled him either to operate as a contractor or to apply for the required electrical permits on behalf of other contractors. Soon after acquiring master electrician status, Willey and a partner formed their own electrical contracting business. At that time, he allowed his working permit with the local Union to expire, although he continued to pay membership dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The following year, Willey sold his business and accepted a position as the electrical superintendent for Drexel Properties, Inc. (Drexel). Drexel is engaged in land development and residential and warehouse construction. The company is a nonunion employer and has no contract with Local 323. In his capacity as superintendent, Willey supervises all of the electrical contracts performed in the company\u2019s construction projects. His responsibilities include the hiring and firing of electricians, handling employee complaints concerning working conditions and equipment safety, imposing disciplinary sanctions, making work assignments, and approving vacation requests. Additionally, he utilizes his master\u2019s certificate to obtain county permits on behalf of Drexel. By law, he is required to accept supervisory responsibility for all electrical work performed pursuant to those permits. As compensation, Willey receives a salary; he does not share in Drexel\u2019s profits nor does he hold any ownership interest in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">In 1977, the business manager of Local 323 preferred written charges against Willey, accusing him of \u201crunning a nonunion electrical contracting business.\u201d He charged that Willey had violated the IBEW Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the ensuing trial, Willey and the Union officials discussed the fact that he secured electrical work permits for Drexel through the use of his master\u2019s certificate. The trial board informed him that this practice violated the working agreement between Local 323 and area union employers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One member advised Willey to quit his job and leave the area.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Soon afterward, Willey was found guilty of violating the two constitutional provisions and was fined $1,000.00 for each infraction. In a letter to Willey, the tribunal agreed to suspend part of the fine if he would \u201cget right with the Local Union within 30 days and commit no further violations for a period of one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Willey then appealed to an International Vice President of the Union. That official affirmed the trial board\u2019s decision and noted that Willey had not contested the fact that he was \u201cemployed by a firm who does not have an agreement with Local 323.\u201d He also pledged to reduce the fines, contingent upon Willey\u2019s \u201cimmediate cessation of \u2022the violation.\u201d Subsequently, Willey continued to pursue his appeal in correspondence to various IBEW officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Before the Union ever informed Willey that he had exhausted his appeals, another member of Local 323 filed new accusations against him citing the same two constitutional provisions as the earlier charge, and also claiming a violation of the area working agreement. Willey was adjudged guilty of all three violations and fined an additional $5,150.00. The union offered to suspend the second set of fines if Willey would pay the fine outstanding on the first charge. Insisting that he was still appealing the original decision and that he intended to appeal the second set of charges, he refused. Consequently, the trial board expelled Willey from membership in the IBEW.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">As a result of these actions, the Union was charged with an unfair labor practice, i.e., a violation of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B), which proscribes the restraint or coercion of an employer in the selection of his representative for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances. After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that the 1977 fines were imposed for \u201cworking for a nonunion contractor.\u201d The AU also concluded that the second set of violations concerned his association with a nonunion employer and his use of his master\u2019s certificate for the benefit of Drexel. In his view, these sanctions constituted unlawful coercion under \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B). The ALJ rejected the Union\u2019s contention that the statute did not apply to its conduct because Willey was an employer. Based on these findings, the ALJ recommended a cease and desist order enjoining further violations, as well as various types of affirmative relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">The Union filed exceptions to the AU\u2019s findings. On review, the National Labor Relations Board adopted all of the AU\u2019s pertinent findings and conclusions of law. The Board members unanimously agreed that the union acted in violation of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) by disciplining Willey for his employment with a nonunion firm. A majority of the Board also characterized the fine imposed for using the master\u2019s certificate as \u201cpart and parcel of the same violation.\u201d One member, however, expressed a contrary view. The Board now seeks to enforce its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Section 8(b) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]t shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents \u2014 (1) to restrain or coerce ... (B) an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.\u201d Since the 1968 decision in <em>San Francisco-Oakland Mailers\u2019 Union No. 18, </em>172 NLRB 2173, the Board\u2014 with judicial acquiescence \u2014 has construed the statute to prohibit not only direct pressure on an employer, but also coercion aimed at the supervisor, which indirectly affects the employer\u2019s selection. <em>See American Broadcasting Cos. v. Writer\u2019s Guild of America, West, Inc., </em>437 U.S. 411, 429, 98 S.Ct. 2423, 2433-34, 57 L.Ed.2d 313, 328 (1978); <em>see generally Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>417 U.S. 790, 800-01, 94 S.Ct. 2737, 2742-43, 41 L.Ed.2d 477, 485-86 (1974). In spite of this expansive interpretation, the reach of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) is not with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>out restriction. In two cases decided during this past decade, the Supreme Court examined the \u201couter limits\u201d of the statute\u2019s application. <em>See, e.g., Florida Power &amp; Light, </em>417 U.S. at 805, 94 S.Ct. at 2745, 41 L.Ed.2d at 488. A closer look at the provision\u2019s \u201couter limits\u201d will demonstrate that the Union\u2019s actions in this case fall within those parameters, thereby constituting prohibited conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The Court in <em>Florida Power &amp; Light </em>faced the issue whether punitive measures taken by a union against supervisory personnel for crossing picket lines to perform duties customarily undertaken by rank-and-file employees contravened \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B). Without repudiating the <em>San Francisco-Oakland Mailers\u2019 </em>doctrine, the Court refused to extend the statute to immunize a supervisor\u2019s performance of rank-and-file work. <em>Id. </em>at 805, 94 S.Ct. at 2745, 41 L.Ed.2d at 488. According to the Court, it was the purpose of Congress to protect an employer\u2019s <em>\u201cselection </em>of its representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804, 94 S.Ct. at 2744, 41 L.Ed.2d at 488 (emphasis in original). For that reason, the Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7q\">[t]he conclusion is thus inescapable that a union\u2019s discipline of one of its members who is a supervisory employee can constitute a violation of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) only when that discipline may adversely affect the supervisor\u2019s conduct in performing the duties of, and acting in his capacity as, grievance adjuster or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 804-05, 94 S.Ct. at 2744-45, 41 L.Ed.2d at 488. Finding that the union discipline did not affect the supervisors\u2019 performance of the pertinent duties, the Court held that the Union\u2019s conduct did not violate the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 805, 94 S.Ct. at 2745, 41 L.Ed.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>the Court had occasion to consider the implications of its holding in <em>Florida Power &amp; Light. </em>The union involved in that case ordered its supervisory members not to cross picket lines, even to perform their supervisory duties. Some of the members obeyed the directive, and the ones who did not were subsequently penalized by the union. In its evaluation of the legality of the union\u2019s actions, the Court reiterated the inquiry originally formulated in <em>Florida Power &amp; Light. </em>Union discipline of a supervisor contravenes \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) if that coercion \u201cmay adversely affect\u201d his performance of grievance adjustment or collective bargaining responsibilities. <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>437 U.S. at 429, 98 S.Ct. at 2434, 57 L.Ed.2d at 328; see <em>Florida Power &amp; Light, </em>417 U.S. at 804-05, 94 S.Ct. at 2744-45, 41 L.Ed.2d at 488. Applying that test to the facts before it, the Court concluded that the requisite \u201cadverse\u201d effect was present. As for the supervisors kept from work by union pressure, the opinion stated that the \u201cemployer was restrained and coerced within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) by being totally deprived of the opportunity to choose these particular supervisors as his collective-bargaining or grievance-adjustment representatives during the strike.\u201d <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>437 U.S. at 432, 98 S.Ct. at 2435, 57 L.Ed.2d at 329. Similarly, the Court agreed with the Board that the discipline imposed on those members who actually crossed the picket lines could influence the performance of their grievance-adjustment duties and therefore deprive the employer of \u201cthe full range of services from his supervisors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434, 98 S.Ct. at 2436, 57 L.Ed.2d at 331. The Court reasoned that \u201c[ujnion pressure on supervisors can affect either their willingness to serve as grievance adjustors or collective bargainers, or the manner in which they fulfill these functions; and either effect impermissibly coerces the employer in his choice of representative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 98 S.Ct. at 2437, 57 L.Ed.2d at 332; <em>see also NLRB </em>v. <em>System Council T-6, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>599 F.2d 5, 9 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">To illustrate, the Court cited with approval <em>New Mexico District Council of Carpenters and Joiners of America (A.S. Homer, Inc.), </em>177 NLRB 500 (1969), <em>enforced, </em>454 F.2d 1116 (10th Cir.1972), a decision particularly applicable to the case at hand. <em>See American Broadcasting Cos., </em>437 U.S. at 436 n. 36, 98 S.Ct. at 2437 n. 36, 57 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>at 332 n. 36. In <em>A.S. Homer, </em>the Board found, as it did in this ease, that union discipline of a member because he worked as a supervisor for a nonunion employer violated the statute. 177 NLRB at 503; <em>c.f. Wisconsin River Valley District Council v. NLRB (Skippy Enterprises, Inc.), </em>532 F.2d 47 (1976) (statute prohibits union fining member-supervisor for disobeying a \u201cno contract-no work\u201d policy and working for employer who refuses to sign bargaining agreement). In discussing <em>A.S. Horner, </em>the Court relied upon the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s analysis of that case in <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. NLRB, </em>487 F.2d 1143, 1154-55 n. 19 (D.C. Cir.1973) (en <em>banc), aff\u2019d sub nom., Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>417 U.S. 790, 94 S.Ct. 2737, 41 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974). In that opinion, the court observed that <em>A.S. Horner </em>\u201cfalls close to the original rationale of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) which was to permit the employer to keep the bargaining representative of his own choosing.\u201d 487 F.2d at 1155 n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Against this background, the Union\u2019s disciplinary sanctions and eventual expulsion of Willey constitute unlawful coercion. The ALJ found, based on uncontroverted testimony, that Willey had extensive grievance adjustment responsibilities in his capacity as Drexel\u2019s electrical superintendent, As previously noted, Willey had numerous duties \u2014 such as handling complaints of conditions and safety at the work site\u2014 requiring settlement of the individual problems of the employees under his supervision. Because he was fined for his affiliation with a nonunion company, \u201ccompliance .. . with the union\u2019s demands would have \u2018the effect of depriving the Company of the services of its selected representative for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.\u2019 \u201d <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>437 U.S. at 436 n. 36, 98 S.Ct. at 2437 n. 36, 57 L.Ed.2d at 332 n. 36, <em>quoting, A.S. Homer, </em>177 NLRB at 502. Such a potential adverse effect on the employer\u2019s choice is determinative under the Supreme Court\u2019s test. <em>See, e.g., American Broadcasting Cos., </em>437 U.S. at 429, 98 S.Ct. at 2434, 57 L.Ed.2d at 328. Thus, the union\u2019s sanctions against Willey amounted to an unfair labor practice in violation of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Nevertheless, the Union advances several reasons why the prohibition should not apply to its actions in this case. First, it argues that, because it did not represent Drexel\u2019s employees, the sanctions against Willey were an internal union matter, and not an attempt to coerce his employer. As support for this position, it relies on <em>NLRB v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 73 (Chewelah Contractor\u2019s, Inc.), </em>621 F.2d 1035 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">In <em>Chewelah, </em>the court held that a union does not act contrary to \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) if it neither represents nor displays a representational interest in the company\u2019s employees. 621 F.2d at 1037. The union in <em>Chewelah </em>had fined a member-supervisor for his employment with a nonunion company. The Board declared the discipline unlawful under \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B). On appeal, the Ninth Circuit refused to enforce the order. The court initially identified the two concerns it considered paramount in Congress\u2019 enactment of the statute: (1) preventing union pressure on employers regarding their participation in multiemployer bargaining units, and (2) guaranteeing a bargaining representative\u2019s complete loyalty to his employer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1036. While the court admitted that such considerations may be relevant when the union represents the company\u2019s employees, absent that nexus, the policies underlying the statute were not implicated. <em>Id. </em>at 1036-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The court further observed that in all the \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) decisions it had reviewed, the union had been the bargaining representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tive of the company\u2019s employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1037. Because it did not have such a representational interest, the union lacked any <em>\u201cincentive </em>to either influence Chewelah\u2019s choice of bargaining representatives or affect [the supervisor\u2019s] loyalty to Chewelah.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Finally, characterizing the discipline as an internal union affair, the court emphasized that the penalized member always retained the option of resigning from the union.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>For these reasons, the court announced that \u201c[a] union does not violate Section 8(b)(1)(B) by disciplining a member, even though that member is also the bargaining representative of an employer, if the union neither represents nor shows an intent to represent the employer\u2019s employees.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In this case, the Union invites us to engraft the same limitation on our interpretation of the statute. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We decline to do so. Our reading of the statute, and the two Supreme Court decisions construing it, does not support such a restrictive application. Most significantly, contrary to the <em>Chewelah </em>court\u2019s suggestion, a \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) violation does not hinge on the union\u2019s incentive or intent in disciplining a supervisory member. Rather, the statute proscribes any union pressure which \u201cmay adversely affect\u201d the supervisor\u2019s performance of the protected duties. <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>437 U.S. at 429, 98 S.Ct. at 2434, 57 L.Ed.2d at 328; <em>Florida Light &amp; Power, </em>417 U.S. at 804-05, 94 S.Ct. at 2744-45, 41 L.Ed.2d at 488. Hence, the provision prohibits any union conduct which has the effect of restraining the employer\u2019s choice, even if the union\u2019s motivation does not contemplate that result.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Placing the emphasis on the effect caused by the union\u2019s actions, rather than its intent, is more consistent with the fundamental purpose of the statute. Congress\u2019 overriding concern in enacting \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) was to insulate an employer\u2019s <em>selection </em>of his collective bargaining or grievance adjustment representative from union influence or interference. <em>See, e.g., Florida Power &amp; Light, </em>417 U.S. at 803, 94 S.Ct. at 2744, 41 L.Ed.2d at 487. An attempt to force a member-supervisor to cease working for a nonunion company demonstrably infringes on the employer\u2019s right to choose that person as its representative. <em>See A.S. Horner, </em>177 NLRB at 502. In view of that inevitable result, even a union endeavoring only to enforce an internal regulation, and not primarily motivated to influence an employer\u2019s selection, can deprive the employer of the protection afforded by the statute. Consequently, we find the <em>Chewelah </em>limitation inconsistent with the central aim of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Next, the Union attempts to escape the dictates of the statute by characterizing Willey as an \u201cemployer.\u201d The Union reasons that the use of the master\u2019s certificate to obtain electrical permits is a responsibility more akin to an employer, rather than a supervisory, function. Then, claiming that it disciplined Willey primarily for his use of the certificate, the Union urges that the statute does not condemn sanctions imposed on a member for engaging in strictly employer activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">It is true that the Board has consistently held \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) inapplicable in cases where the member is the owner of the business. <em>See, e.g., Glaziers and Glassworkers, Local 1621, </em>221 NLRB 509 (1975). In analyzing whether the member-supervisor is indeed the employer, and thus unprotected by the statute, the Board focuses on the extent, if any, of the individual\u2019s financial ownership in the company. <em>See </em>221 NLRB at 513. The reason for this rule is apparent. When a person has a financial self-interest in the enterprise, \u201cit is difficult to envision circumstances where the employer would be greatly influenced in the performance of his grievance-adjustment or collective-bargaining functions where any decision he makes in those respects directly works to his benefit or detriment depending on how he decides it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>NLRB at 512. Moreover, the application of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) in that situation would, through the subterfuge of protecting the employer\u2019s selection of his representative, effectively deprive a union of all economic weapons, merely because the employer assumes the additional role of a supervisor. As the Board has noted, Congress certainly did not intend that result. <em>See id. </em>at 512-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The Union\u2019s assertion that Willey\u2019s mere use of the master\u2019s certificate places him within the ambit of this rule misconstrues its rationale. Essentially, the Union confuses ownership with management duties. Supervisory personnel, by their very nature, often undertake numerous tasks closely associated with an employer\u2019s role, such as Willey\u2019s acquisition of electrical permits in this ease. In effect, a supervisor acts as a managerial agent for the employer. However, this responsibility does not necessarily create the personal stake inevitably present when the individual possesses a financial interest in the company. Without that participation, there is no assurance that union pressure will not adversely affect the supervisor\u2019s performance of his collective-bargaining and grievance-adjustment duties. Thus, managerial responsibility, standing alone, does not negate the applicability of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">On that basis, the Union\u2019s argument must fail. The uncontroverted testimony before the AU established that Willey owned no stock or other financial interest in Drexel. Without such a personal stake, his responsibility in obtaining electrical permits does not justify an exemption from the statute\u2019s coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The order of the Board is ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">.

NLRB, </em>539 F.2d 554-556 (5th Cir.1976) <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 828, 98 S.Ct. 106, 54 L.Ed.2d 87 (1977) (union prohibited from picketing employer who had entered collective bargaining agreement with rival union instead of hiring its members as supervisors).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\">. On the contrary, the Supreme Court has suggested that the option of terminating one\u2019s union membership does not alleviate the unlawful coerciveness of a union\u2019s sanctions. <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>437 U.S. at 437, 98 S.Ct. at 2437-38, 57 L.Ed.2d at 332. Moreover, we are unconvinced that discipline imposed in those circumstances is aimed solely at a conflict between the union and its member. As the Board observed in <em>A.S. Homer, </em>\u201cthe basic dispute underlying the disciplinary action against [the supervisor] was not entirely an intra-union matter but stemmed from the fact that the Company did not have a collective-bargaining agreement with the [union].\u201d 177 NLRB at 503. In effect, the union is \u201cusing its internal working rules to boycott an employer who [does] not have a contract with the [union] by making it a violation, subject to fine, for its members to work for such an employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">. Testimony at the hearing suggested that Local 323 may indeed have had an interest in representing Drexel\u2019s employees. Hearing Transcript at 44, 194, 403-05, 422. If so, the union\u2019s assessment of a penalty against Willey violated the statute even under the test posited by the Ninth Circuit. The ALJ and the Board, however, made no finding on the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b596-12\">. The Board claims that the Union has foreclosed our consideration of this argument because it did not raise the defense during the administrative proceedings. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). To the contrary, the Union preserved the contention in its exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision, which were submitted three months prior to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s issuance of the <em>Chewelah </em>opinion. There, the Union emphasized that it did not represent Drexel\u2019s employees, thereby rendering the sanction an internal union matter outside the scope of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b596-13\">. In <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>Justice Stewart in dissent underscored this implication of the majority\u2019s holding. As he observed,</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">[i]n the present cases it is entirely clear that the union had no interest in restraining or coercing the employers in the <em>selection </em>of their bargaining or grievance adjustment representatives, or in affecting the <em>manner </em>in which supervisory employees performed those functions. As the Court notes, ... the union expressed no interest at the disciplinary trials in the kind of work that was done behind its picket lines. Its sole purpose was to enforce the traditional \u00a1kinds of rules that every union relies on to maintain its organization and solidarity in the face of the potential hardship of a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">437 U.S. at 440, 98 S.Ct. at 2439, 57 L.Ed.2d at 334 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\">. Implicit in this approach is a related contention based on the Union\u2019s characterization of the master\u2019s certificate as an \u201cemployer function.\u201d It essentially claims that since <em>Florida Power &amp; Light </em>construes the statute only to prohibit sanctions imposed for the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>supervisory duties, and use of the master\u2019s license is an employer rather than a supervisory undertaking, discipline for that purpose does not offend \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B). As previously noted, we are unconvinced by the Union\u2019s attempt to distinguish between employer and supervisory functions, in that the distinction ignores the inherently managerial nature of a supervisor\u2019s role. Moreover, mere labels do not control the existence or absence of a violation. <em>See American Broadcasting Cos., </em>437 U.S. at 430, 98 S.Ct. at 2484, 57 L.Ed.2d at 328 (not all discipline imposed for performance of \u201csupervisory work\u201d is necessarily unlawful). Rather, the inquiry focuses on the <em>effect </em>of the discipline on the employer\u2019s selection of a representative to perform the pertinent duties. The Board found an equal adverse effect in the sanctions imposed for using the certificate as it did with the discipline resulting from Willey\u2019s association with a nonunion employer. As the Board noted, \u201c[i]t is part and parcel of the same violation.\u201d Recognizing that this finding of the requisite effect is \u201cpeculiarly the kind of determination that Congress has assigned to the Board,\u201d <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>437 U.S. at 432, 98 S.Ct. at 2435, 57 L.Ed.2d at 330, we see no reason to disturb the Board\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
