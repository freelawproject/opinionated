The first motion was filed\n   by Defendants Commonwealth Recovery Group, Inc. (\"Commonwealth Recovery\") and Capital One Auto Finance (\"Capital One\"), who move to dismiss Counts III and IV of the Amended Complaint and to strike Plaintiff's punitive damages claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41.) The second motion was filed by the Pennsylvania State Police, Col. Tyree C. Blocker, Trooper Michael Morris, Trooper Bryan Devlin, and John Doe Troopers 1-10 (collectively the \"Commonwealth Defendants\"), who move to dismiss Counts V and VI of the Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The motions have been fully briefed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 40, 43, 52, 53) and are ripe for disposition. For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery's motion to dismiss in its entirety (ECF No. 41). The Court will grant in part, and deny in part, the Commonwealth Defendants' motion to dismiss (ECF No. 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case involves the repossession of a car. In 2014, Plaintiff purchased a new Toyota Corolla. (ECF No. 27 at \u00b6 19.) Capital One financed Plaintiff's purchase and obtained a security interest in the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) In 2016, Plaintiff was hospitalized because of an unspecified illness and requested that Capital One defer her auto payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) Capital One considered Plaintiff's request but did not inform Plaintiff whether it would approve it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.) Ultimately, and without notice to Plaintiff, Capital One \"ordered\" Commonwealth Recovery to repossess Plaintiff's automobile. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The repossession occurred the evening of October 5, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff and her partner, Shyree, heard a truck pulling up to Plaintiff's house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When they peered out the window, they saw \"a repo man\" in the driveway attempting to repossess Plaintiff's car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.) The driveway is part of Plaintiff's property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff went outside and \"told the repo man to get off her property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.) Shyree believed that the \"repo man\" was about to illegally repossess Plaintiff's vehicle and, in an attempt to prevent him from succeeding, got into Plaintiff's car and closed the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) Plaintiff \"demanded repeatedly\" that the \"repo man\" vacate her property and told him he was \"trespassing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) Despite Plaintiff's demands, the \"repo man\" remained on Plaintiff's property and attempted to repossess her vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At some point, the \"repo man\" called the Pennsylvania State Police. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.) Shortly thereafter, multiple Pennsylvania State Troopers arrived at Plaintiff's residence, including Defendants Bryan Devlin and Michael Morris. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Pennsylvania State Troopers \"assisted\" the \"repo man\" in repossessing Plaintiff's vehicle (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43), even though they \"knew\" that that neither Capital One\n   nor the \"repo man\" had received a court order or writ authorizing them to seize Plaintiff's car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.) In fact, at the time these events unfolded, \"[n]o legal determination had been sought or made regarding entitlement to seize [Plaintiff's] car.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.) But this did not prevent \"[o]ne of the troopers, believed to be Defendant Bryan Devlin[,]\" from informing Plaintiff that \"the repo man had the right to repossess the vehicle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At this juncture, Shyree was still inside the car, while Plaintiff, Trooper Devlin, and the \"repo man\" stood outside the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47.) Plaintiff called her daughter Makiba for advice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Makiba, a law student, \"politely told Trooper Devlin that his actions were in violation of the law, and that this was a purely civil matter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   One of the Troopers\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   stated that \"if she [Shyree] does not willingly come out [of the car] we are going to have to remove her.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.) After Makiba, speaking over the cellphone, told the Troopers that the \"police cannot enforce a civil contract\" and that they were inappropriately taking sides between private parties in a civil dispute, one of the Troopers stated that \"what's going to happen here today is we already spoke with the tower [and] they have to get the vehicle tonight, okay?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of the Troopers then said to Makiba, \"[m]aam, maam, okay-if you're talking with the young lady in the car, okay, if you would please tell her to get out so these men can do their job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Makiba told the Troopers that he was acting \"unlawfully.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of the Troopers responded, \"[o]kay, you can file a complaint on me later. That's okay.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Makiba told one of the Troopers \"[s]ir[,] you cannot ask her to get out of the car.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of the Troopers responded by threatening to \"break the window\" and remove Shyree from the car if she did not\n   exit on her own. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Makiba informed one of the Troopers that she was recording him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Trooper responded \"[i]t's okay[,] you can record it, I'm telling you what's going to happen. She is going to be removed, she is going to be arrested for disorderly conduct and the car is still going to get taken.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Makiba again told one of the Troopers that he was \"breaking the law,\" to which the Trooper responded \"[t]hat's okay.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of the Troopers asked if Makiba was going to ask Shyree to exit the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Makiba stated that Shyree would comply with the Trooper's command but reiterated that the Trooper was unlawfully enforcing a civil contract in the absence of a court order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of the Troopers told Makiba that she could \"contact the state police, talk to my sergeant, [and that] I am the shift supervisor tonight, [so] you can file a complaint against me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After more back and forth between Makiba and one of the Troopers, the Trooper instructed Makiba \"to call her [Shyree] and tell her to [comply with my order] and once I know that she is going to get out [of the car] we'll be okay.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Makiba hung up her call with the Trooper and called Shyree, who was still sitting inside Plaintiff's vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of the Troopers, standing outside the car, stated \"I'm not going to wait all day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Trooper then told Shyree \"[y]ou got about 30 more seconds [sic].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shortly thereafter, one of the Troopers informed Shyree \"[y]ou've got 30 seconds to come out or we breaking the window and coming in [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ], how long have we been dealing with this? I asked nicely, I explained to you what is going to happen, okay?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One of the Troopers then informed Shyree that \"[i]f you refuse to come out we are going to have to remove you and I do not want to do that for a repossessed vehicle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shyree complied with the Trooper's command and exited the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.) Once Shyree had exited the vehicle, the Trooper \"directed\" Plaintiff to \"surrender her vehicle to the repo man.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff filed her Complaint before this Court on May 30, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1), followed by an Amended Complaint on August 4, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27). Plaintiff asserts six counts in her Amended Complaint: (1) a Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Claim against Commonwealth Recovery (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 83-87); (2) a claim under the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code against Capital One (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 88-91); (3) a conversion/trespass to chattels claim against Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 92-96); (4) a trespass claim against Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 97-100); (5) a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim against the Pennsylvania State Police, Defendants Blocker, Morris, Devlin, and John Doe Troopers 1-10 in their official capacities (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 101-111); and (6) a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim against the Pennsylvania State Police, Defendants Blocker, Morris, Devlin, and John Doe Troopers 1-10 in their individual capacities (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 111-119). Additionally, Plaintiff seeks punitive damages against Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery for her conversion/trespass to chattels (Count III) and trespass (Count IV) claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery move to dismiss Plaintiff's conversion/trespass to chattels claim (Count III), her trespass claim (Count IV), and her prayer for punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41.)

Moreover, to the extent there is a factual dispute about who owned the automobile, these questions are more properly determined at a later stage in litigation. Furthermore, Plaintiff plausibly had a right to immediate possession at the time of the conversion; Plaintiff's well-pleaded facts give rise to a reasonable inference that the \"repo man\" committed a\n   breach of the peace by failing to vacate Plaintiff's private property and by summoning law enforcement officers to assist his repossession, which would nullify his right to repossess the automobile without a court order under \u00a7 9609(a) - (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court is similarly unmoved by Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery's argument that Plaintiff cannot prevail on her conversion and trespass to chattels claims because \"repo man\" acted at the behest of the State Trooper Defendants. Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery have not cited any authority to support their contention that the State Trooper Defendants' involvement shields Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery from liability. Moreover, their argument is particularly farfetched given that the State Trooper Defendants' arrived at the scene only after the \"repo man\" summoned them to help him repossess Plaintiff's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In conclusion, the Court will deny Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's conversion and trespass to chattels claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery further argue that Plaintiff's trespass claim is tenuous because the \"repo man\" repossessed Plaintiff's car in the driveway of Plaintiff's house, an area with less Constitutional protection than the home or the curtilage.

Moreover, as the Court noted in Section V.B.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to give rise to a reasonable inference that Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery \"breached the peace\" by enlisting the State Trooper Defendants to help the \"repo man\" repossess Plaintiff's vehicle over her protests. Thus, Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery \"exceed the scope of the privilege\" they were afforded under 13 Pa.

Accordingly, Plaintiff alleged a plausible trespass claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Capital One and Commonwealth Recovery's argument that Plaintiff cannot bring a trespass claim due to the fact that \"repo man\" had a limited right to repossess Plaintiff's vehicle.

However, Plaintiff's reply brief alleges that Defendant Morris made at least some of these statements; Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Morris \"ordered Shyree out of the car to complete the repossession [and] threatened to break the window, pull her out of the car, and arrest her for disorderly conduct.\" (ECF No. 53 at 7.)
