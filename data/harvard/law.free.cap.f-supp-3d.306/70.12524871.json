INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With the inclusion of a few check marks on a form submitted in 1999, this litigation might have been avoided. In December of 1999, Defendant Henry Solomon, an attorney for Plaintiff Atlanta Channel, Inc. (\"ACI\"), submitted a form on ACI's behalf to the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") without realizing that several key questions on the form remained unanswered. Because the form was incomplete, the FCC dismissed it, thereby blocking ACI's ability to obtain a special license that would have given it preference on the airwaves. Mr. Solomon filed a motion with the FCC asking it to reverse its dismissal of the form, but for twelve years the FCC sat on that motion. In the intervening years, Mr. Solomon retired from the practice of law. After several failed appeals of the FCC's dismissal, ACI filed suit in this Court alleging that Mr. Solomon was negligent when he filed the incomplete form, and now moves for summary judgment as to Mr. Solomon's liability. In his cross-motion for summary judgment, Mr. Solomon argues that ACI cannot recover because its malpractice claim is barred by the statute of limitations, because ACI was contributorily negligent by failing to complete the form itself, and because the far-reaching damage ACI now alleges it suffered was not proximately caused by the submission of the incomplete form. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that neither party has met its burden for a finding of summary judgment in its favor, and therefore denies both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ACI is a broadcast television business that owns and operates a low power television (\"LPTV\") station with the call sign WTHC-LD in Atlanta, Georgia.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ACI and Mr. Solomon have each moved for a ruling in their favor regarding Mr. Solomon's liability for the submission of the incomplete Statement of Eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot.; Def.'s Mot. ACI argues that the Court should grant it summary judgment because it has demonstrated that Mr. Solomon committed malpractice when he submitted the incomplete form and because it filed suit within the statute of limitations period. Mr. Solomon argues that the Court should rule in his favor because he has demonstrated that ACI's suit is barred by the statute of limitations. In the alternative, Mr. Solomon argues that ACI was contributorily negligent when it forwarded the incomplete Statement of Eligibility to him for his review, and that ACI cannot show, as a matter of law, that it was Mr. Solomon's actions that led to the full extent of the loss ACI alleges it suffered in its Second Amended Complaint. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that questions of fact remain as to whether Mr. Solomon committed legal malpractice when he submitted the incomplete form, whether ACI's claim against Mr. Solomon is time-barred, and whether Mr. Solomon's actions proximately caused the full extent of ACI's injuries, and therefore denies both parties' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

First, ACI argues that its claim did not accrue at the time of Mr. Solomon's error, or upon its discovery of that error, because ACI did not suffer an actual injury as a result of Mr. Solomon's alleged malpractice until November 10, 2014, when it began to pay its new lawyers for its appeal of the FCC's decision to the D.C.

Second, it claims that even if it did suffer an injury earlier, its suit is not time-barred because its claim was tolled during the lengthy time period during which Mr. Solomon continued to represent the company in its attempt to obtain a Class A license for its LPTV station and because it brought suit within three years of the end of the tolling period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n    at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition, he argues that the lulling doctrine is inapplicable, and his actions did not amount to fraudulent concealment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n    at 18, 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that ACI's injury as a result of Mr. Solomon's alleged negligence occurred when its Statement of Eligibility was dismissed in June 2000, that Mr. Solomon did not lull ACI into inaction, and that Mr. Solomon did not fraudulently conceal from ACI its cause of action against him. However, the Court also finds that questions of fact remain as to whether ACI's claim against Mr. Solomon was tolled past October 26, 2012 due to the continuing representation doctrine.

Therefore, the dismissal of the Statement of Eligibility, which precluded ACI from obtaining a Class A license for its LPTV station, was the first actual harm ACI suffered as a result of Mr. Solomon's alleged negligence. At that point, its station lost its chance to obtain the same protection from displacement as a full power television station has, and also possibly its opportunity to increase in value as a result of obtaining that license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Colley Decl. \u00b6 23, ECF No. 79-3. Even though the full extent of the damages caused by the dismissal of the Statement of Eligibility may not have been apparent in 2000, the dismissal of the Statement was a real, concrete injury, and would have provided a basis for a malpractice suit in 2000 if ACI had chosen to sue Mr. Solomon then.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 22 (\"ACI's damages are measured by the difference between ACI having a Class A license and not having a Class A license.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because ACI suffered an actual injury as the result of Mr. Solomon's alleged malpractice in 2000 but did not bring this suit until 2015-well beyond the three years required by the applicable statute of limitations-the Court must evaluate whether there are any applicable common law doctrines that excuse ACI's otherwise\n   late filing. ACI claims that there are three: the continuous representation doctrine, lulling, and fraudulent concealment. The Court addresses each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Continuous Representation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   ACI has invoked the continuous representation doctrine to argue that the statute of limitations has not run on its malpractice claim against Mr. Solomon. ACI claims that, because Mr. Solomon continued to represent the company in its attempt to secure a Class A license through at least October 26, 2012, the continuous representation doctrine tolled the statute of limitations during that time period, thereby making the suit that it brought only three years later timely. Pl.'s Mem. at 16. Mr. Solomon counters that the continuous representation doctrine does not make ACI's claim timely, because his representation of ACI ended upon his retirement in 2010 and ACI did not bring suit within three years of that date. The parties dispute whether Mr. Solomon ever clearly told ACI that he was retiring from the practice of law in 2010. The Court finds that because a material question of fact remains as to whether Mr. Colley and Ms. Davis reasonably believed that Mr. Solomon was still representing them in their pursuit of a Class A license, it is precluded from granting summary judgment on this issue to either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The continuous representation doctrine \"tolls the statute of limitations for a legal malpractice claim during the time the attorney continues to represent the client in the relevant matter.

Therefore, the Court must determine whether ACI's assumption that Mr. Solomon continued to represent it past October 26, 2012 was reasonable. Mr. Solomon highlights the following events as demonstrating that Mr. Colley and Ms. Davis understood, or at the very least should have understood, that Mr. Solomon was retiring from the practice of law, and therefore could no longer represent them. First, in late 2009, Mr. Solomon informed Mr. Colley that there would be a \"transition\" due to Mr. Solomon's age which would include Mr. Solomon turning over to his partner Ms. Virtue responsibility for all ACI and Beach TV matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Colley Decl. \u00b6 16, ECF No. 72-1. Second, Mr. Solomon believes that Mr. Colley demonstrated that he understood Mr. Solomon to be retiring from the practice of law when he responded to Mr. Solomon's \"Biker Bar\" email by joking that the motorized scooters may have had Mr. Solomon and Mr. Colley's names on them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 15-16. And third, following Mr. Solomon's retirement in July 2010, Ms. Virtue began acting as ACI's replacement counsel by traveling to Florida to meet with Mr. Colley and Ms. Davis, and began serving as ACI's email point of contact, as demonstrated when Mr. Colley inquired in March 2012 as to the status of\n   the Application for Review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Indeed, following the biker bar email, Mr. Colley never emailed or spoke with Mr. Solomon again, Solomon Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, ECF No. 76-29, though perhaps that was because he did not believe he had any means of reaching him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8, Colley Dep., ECF No. 72-3 (email from Mr. Colley to Ms. Virtue on August 13, 2010 asking for Mr. Solomon's \"email address and other contact info\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   ACI argues that although Mr. Colley had been informed of the transition at some point in 2009, he was under the impression that Mr. Solomon had not terminated his representation of ACI and Beach TV, but rather was taking a step back from the work because of his age.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 19. It explains that Mr. Colley and Ms. Davis were within reason in believing that Mr. Solomon was not disassociating himself from ACI's case entirely because Mr. Solomon had, when describing the transition, referred to Ms. Virtue as the future \"front person\" for ACI's dealings with the FCC and to himself as a consultant acting \"in the background\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   had stated that he would be remaining in Washington, D.C.; and had mentioned that he would maintain an office at the Garvey Firm, from which he would be doing pro bono work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Colley Dep. at 17:4-14; 45:14-46:17; 54:17-55:21, ECF No. 72-2. ACI also argues that Mr. Solomon never informed Mr. Colley that he was relinquishing his bar licenses, and indeed, there is no evidence in the record that Mr. Colley was aware that Mr. Solomon had relinquished both of his bar licenses by 2011. Pl.'s Mem. at 5. Last, ACI points to the assistance Mr. Solomon gave Ms. Virtue, which included strategy pointers and case citations, as she attempted to encourage the FCC to rule on the long-pending\n   Application for Review and as she drafted a Petition for Consideration on ACI's behalf following the denial of its Application for Review, contributions which were conveyed, to some extent, to Mr. Colley, and that appear consistent with the \"background\" role ACI claims Mr. Solomon told the company he would perform. Pl.'s Mem. at 8-9; Pl.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 131-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   These accounts of who knew what and when raise sufficient questions of fact to preclude the Court from granting ACI or Mr. Solomon summary judgment on the statute of limitations question. First, there is a dispute among the parties as to what Mr. Solomon said to Mr. Colley when he retired. Second, there is a dispute as to whether Mr. Colley understood Mr. Solomon to be scaling back his practice, as opposed to retiring. Third, there is a dispute as to whether Mr. Colley truly believed that Mr. Solomon was his lawyer on the Class A license matter. And fourth, there is a dispute as to whether, if Mr. Colley did believe that Mr. Solomon continued to represent ACI, that belief was reasonable under the circumstances. As such, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on the continuous representation doctrine question, and must leave the determination of when Mr. Colley should have reasonably understood that Mr. Solomon was no longer his lawyer to the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   ACI has invoked two other common law doctrines to argue that the statute of limitations was tolled past October 26, 2012: lulling and fraudulent concealment. The Court will next determine whether it can determine on a motion for summary judgment that either of these doctrines render ACI's suit timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Lulling and Fraudulent Concealment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   ACI argues that even if Mr. Solomon had ceased to represent it in its attempt to obtain a Class A license for its LPTV station before October 26, 2012, its claim is not time barred because Mr. Solomon lulled ACI into thinking that he still represented it, and fraudulently concealed that he was no longer representing it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 19-23. Mr. Solomon responds that neither doctrine applies to this case because he did not take any affirmative steps to trick ACI into believing that he still represented it after his retirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 18-26.

In\n   <em>\n    Hobson\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit listed two factors for courts to consider: first, \"the plaintiff must know facts giving notice of the particular cause of action at issue, not just any cause of action\"; and second, the \"plaintiff's knowledge of the grounds for a suit must generally extend to an awareness of the persons responsible for plaintiff's injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As a preliminary matter, ACI has pointed to no cases in which a court has found that fraudulent concealment applied when a defendant concealed not a cause of action or underlying injury, of which the plaintiff was well aware, but rather an ancillary fact such as when the statute of limitations began to run. Rather, courts in this district have found that so long as plaintiff was on notice of the alleged malpractice, fraudulent concealment cannot apply.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallucci v. Schaffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659994\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/507/85/#p90\">\n    507 F.Supp.2d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90-91 (D.D.C. 2007) (holding that fraudulent concealment did not apply to a case in which the defendant law firm had told plaintiff that there was nothing more it could do for him in his workers' compensation case because he was already aware of his allegedly insufficient payments for over a year). Here, ACI had been aware that Mr. Solomon had submitted the incomplete Statement of Eligibility to the FCC since June 2000. Therefore, the fact that it believes that Mr. Solomon misrepresented the nature of his retirement to it cannot toll the statute of limitations on fraudulent concealment grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Even assuming that fraudulent concealment could apply to ancillary matters such as when the statute of limitations on a claim began to run (or, in this context, stopped being tolled), as opposed to the existence of the actual cause of action, ACI has not alleged sufficient affirmative actions on Mr. Solomon's part to demonstrate that he fraudulently concealed that the statute of limitations on their claim had begun to run, or lulled them into inaction. There is indeed a definitive dispute as to whether Mr. Solomon clearly indicated to ACI that he was retiring from the practice of law in 2009 and 2010, and whether ACI understood that he was retiring, rather than simply taking a step back from his practice.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Section IV.A.1. However, Mr. Solomon's alleged lack\n   of clarity does not amount to an \"affirmative inducement to plaintiff[ ] to delay bringing action.\"\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7929154\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/516/934/#p937\">\n    516 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   937 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hornblower v.

Even if Mr. Solomon was purposefully unclear when he told ACI about his \"transition\" and the transfer of his work for ACI and Beach TV to Ms. Virtue, following his biker bar email to Mr. Colley in December 2009, Mr. Solomon took no further steps to lead Mr. Colley or Ms. Davis to believe that he was still ACI's lawyer. The record reflects that Mr. Colley began to email Ms. Virtue, whom he believed to be the \"front person\" for all Beach TV and ACI business before the FCC, after Mr. Solomon retired, and never emailed Mr. Solomon again after December 11, 2009. Although Ms. Virtue began communicating with Mr. Solomon about how to encourage the FCC to finally review ACI's Application for Review, and informed Mr. Colley of that fact, there is no indication in the record that Mr. Solomon asked Ms. Virtue to inform Mr. Colley that he was giving her advice. Similarly, when Mr. Solomon assisted Ms. Virtue as she drafted the Petition for Reconsideration, there is no evidence that Mr. Solomon asked Ms. Virtue to inform ACI that he was involved. Because the record is devoid of evidence that Mr. Solomon took affirmative steps after late 2009 to maintain the appearance that he was still representing ACI, his actions do not amount to lulling or fraudulent concealment, and the statute of limitations cannot be tolled on these bases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Next the Court must determine whether there is a question of material fact, apart from timing, as to Mr. Solomon's liability to ACI for legal malpractice. ACI argues that it has presented sufficient undisputed evidence for the Court to determine that Mr. Solomon is liable to ACI for malpractice due to the submission of the incomplete Statement of Eligibility, and therefore should be granted summary judgment on liability. Mr. Solomon has in turn moved for a finding that he is not liable for any damages to ACI caused by the passage of the Spectrum Act of 2012. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that neither party has met its burden for a grant of summary judgment on these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Choice of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"Because jurisdiction over [ACI's] legal malpractice claims is founded on diversity of citizenship, the Court must first determine which state law to apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury Law Group, PLLC v.

July 21, 2013). Neither party briefed which state's laws the Court should use when evaluating this legal malpractice claim. ACI uses D.C. law to demonstrate that the Court has enough evidence before it to rule on Mr. Solomon's liability, but also explains that \"District of Columbia law is the same as Virginia law on the elements of legal malpractice.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 12 n.7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Desetti v.

In his opposition to ACI's motion for summary judgment, Mr. Solomon applies D.C. law in responding to all of ACI's arguments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 10, but in his own motion for summary judgment, uses Virginia law in support of his proximate causation arguments, assuming that the Court's October 14, 2016 analysis deciding that Virginia law applied to ACI's attempt to assign its legal malpractice claim to Beach TV applies to determining which state's laws should be used to decide the merits of ACI's malpractice claim as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Brief at 28 n.25. ACI has chosen to respond to these arguments with Virginia law. Neither party suggests that the laws of Florida or Georgia, where ACI is incorporated and has its principle place\n   of business, respectively, applies to any portion of this case. Because the parties disagree as to whether District of Columbia or Virginia law applies to the substantive legal issues governing ACI's malpractice claim against Mr. Solomon, the Court must determine which law applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"A federal court sitting in diversity must apply the choice-of-law rules of the forum state-here, the District of Columbia.\"\n   <em>\n    In re APA Assessment Fee Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4110184,4201284\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/39/\">\n    766 F.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51 (D.C.

Additionally, while the Court has a general idea of the damages ACI will seek should liability be established,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 70-72, the Court has very little indication at this point of the monetary effects of Mr. Solomon's alleged negligence for one very simple reason: damages discovery has not occurred yet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 3 n.6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, ECF No. 58 (setting schedule for discovery on liability, but not damages). As such, ACI has not been given an opportunity to procure and present expert evidence regarding\n   the extent of damages it has suffered, as well as the ascertainability of those damages, in order to rebut Mr. Solomon's assertion that any damage it suffered as a result of the passage of the Spectrum Act was unforeseen in 1999 and also incalculable. But as is required under\n   <em>\n    Comier\n   </em>\n   , ACI has established that it has suffered\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   damage: the loss of the opportunity to receive a Class A license. Therefore, the Court will allow the question of the extent of the damage Mr. Solomon's alleged negligence proximately caused to proceed to the trier of fact, and denies his motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Mr. Solomon now claims that he remembers that he \"never told Colley in 2009 or any time thereafter, that after [he] retired Melodie Virtue would be the front person and that [he] would be the back person regarding legal representation of ACI or any of the other businesses owned by Colley[, n]or did [he] ever suggest that after [he] retired [he] would maintain an attorney-client relationship with ACI or any of the Colley interests.\" 2d Solomon Decl. \u00b6 8. Technically, these statements do not contradict each other, and are therefore, not subject to the sham affidavit rule, as ACI argues. Mr. Solomon did not say that he does not recall\n    <em>\n     whether\n    </em>\n    he had any conversations with Mr. Colley about his retirement; he said that he did not recall any such conversation taking place. Assuming he never told Mr. Colley that he would continue to work as ACI and Beach TV's attorney, it makes sense that Mr. Solomon does not recall ever telling Mr. Colley that he would. Therefore, there remains a question of fact as to whether Mr. Solomon and Mr. Colley ever discussed Mr. Solomon's retirement, and if such a conversation occurred, what was said during it. However, there is no dispute that Mr. Solomon wrote to Mr. Colley in 2009 that he would \"be around to consult, etc.\" following his transition. Ex. C, Pl.'s Mot., ECF No. 71-5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The parties dispute whether Mr. Solomon told Mr. Colley that he would be maintaining an office at the Garvey firm and would work on pro bono projects there. Mr. Solomon explains that he \"did not tell Colley ... at any time, that [he] was going to remain at the Garvey law firm doing pro bono work, representing Garvey's clients, or starting a law practice of [his] own. In mid-June 2010, as [he] was preparing to vacate [his] office by the July 1, 2010 termination date set by the firm, [he] received an offer to affiliate, pro bono, with a nonprofit organization. The offer was unsolicited and welcomed. As noted, the pro bono opportunity arose after 2009-[his] final communication with Colley-and after [he] had any contact with Colley or anyone else in his organization. Nor did [he] ever tell Colley about the Garvey firm's offer to allow [him] to share office space after [he] retired.\" 2d Solomon Decl. \u00b6 9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The Court also observes that contributory negligence is available as an affirmative defense in both D.C. and Virginia, creating another \"false conflict.\"\n    <em>\n     See e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lyle, Siegel, Croshaw &amp; Beale, P.C. v.
