He now objects to his Presentence Investigation Report's sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"). (Doc. 43.) The ACCA calls for a fifteen-year minimum sentence if Cash \"has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     committed on occasions different from one another\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) (emphasis added). Cash has three previous convictions for violent felonies-two for aggravated robbery\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one for aggravated assault. But the ACCA enhancement applies only if the Government has met its burden of proving, by a preponderance of\n   the evidence, that Cash's two aggravated-robbery convictions were for offenses \"committed on occasions different from one another.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barbour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067893\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/535/#p545\">\n    750 F.3d 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545-46 (6th Cir. 2014). The Court must decide whether state-court judgment forms listing divergent dates found nowhere else in the record satisfy this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Government argues that a sentencing court must always trust offense dates in judgments to answer the ACCA's different-occasions inquiry because judgments are\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   -approved documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Tr. at 23-24.) Cash argues that a sentencing court may never do so, because a court is prohibited from considering any facts about\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the prior offense was committed and may only rely on a judgment to establish the fact of the prior conviction and the offense elements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) The parties agree that the offense dates are not elements of aggravated robbery under Tennessee law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 44-45.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   It is important to understand relevant precedent guiding the Court's decision.

However,\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   carved out an important exception-a sentencing judge may use the fact of a prior conviction, which need only be found by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, while the Government must prove by only a preponderance the existence of a prior conviction, that conviction serves as an ACCA predicate offense only if facts supporting application of the ACCA were previously established in a manner that satisfied the Sixth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , three separate indictments charged the defendant with committing similar violent felonies \"on or about February 18, 2002.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276997\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/267/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276997\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/267/\">\n    at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But none of the indictments alleged the times or locations\n   of the offenses, and the district court needed more to answer the different-occasions question.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276997\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/267/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, it examined a bill of particulars relating to each indictment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276997\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/267/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because these bills of particulars included different times and locations for the charged offenses, the district court applied the ACCA enhancement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276997\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/267/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276997\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/267/\">\n    at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the state court's finding on the defendant's guilty plea, it differed from the original indictment only because firearm specifications had been removed from the first two counts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263910\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/215/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263910\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/215/\">\n    at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 55-1.) One indictment charged Cash with aggravated robbery of Gregory Morgan on \"the ___ day of November, 2003.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Another indictment charged Cash with aggravated robbery of Jessie Parr on \"the ___ day of November, 2003.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) These indictments alleged that Cash took a CD player, a lighter, and batteries from Mr. Morgan and two pizzas and money from Mr. Parr. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4.) Based on the facts established by Cash's guilty plea to these indictments, it is just as possible as not that Mr. Parr, the pizza-delivery man, arrived at Mr. Morgan's residence during Cash's robbery of Mr. Morgan and became a second victim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Tr. at 38-39.) Nothing in the indictments sheds any light on whether Cash committed the two offenses on occasions different from one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Even assuming, then, that the Court may rely on the judgments-which, of course, a sentencing court typically enters well after it last hears from a defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the Government does not meet its burden. The judgments for Cash's aggravated-robbery convictions are both state-court judgments from the criminal court of Coffee County, Tennessee. (Doc. 54-1.) The first judgment is dated August 12, 2004, and includes an offense date of November 2, 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The second judgment is dated August 3, 2004, and includes an offense date of November 30, 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) These are the record's only references to offense dates. The judgments indicate that Cash was sentenced for both aggravated robberies on the same day, July 23, 2004, and that the sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) It appears that the defense attorney's name, on\n   at least one of the judgments, was signed by the prosecutor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865281\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/878/#p888\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, there is no evidence in the record that the judges who signed the judgments are the same judges who conducted Cash's plea colloquies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court cannot, from the judgments alone, \"\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   tell whether the plea ...
