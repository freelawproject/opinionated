For the reasons discussed below, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The Court will enter a separate Order and Judgment consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, K.C., is a minor child with cerebral palsy. [DN 1 at 3 (Complaint).] K.C.'s condition renders him unable to communicate verbally and requires that he receive his nutrition through a gastronomy tube in his stomach. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] At the times relevant to this complaint, K.C. attended Central Elementary, a Marshall County public school. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] During the 2015-2016 school year, K.C. was placed in a \"functional mental disability\" classroom in which he was taught by a special education teacher, Crystal Teckenbrock. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DN 21-1 at 1.] Near the end of April 2016, K.C.'s mother, T.C., \"received a report from a mother of a classmate ... that KC was being abused by\" Teckenbrock. [DN 21-4 at 6 (T.C. Deposition).] The classmate's mother, Heather Lane, informed T.C. that her child \"had c[o]me home upset and kept telling her that ... the teacher, Ms. Crystal, is ... being mean to KC and that she feels really bad for him.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.] In detail, T.C. testified that Lane told her that Lane's child \"said that [Teckenbrock is] mean. She yells at him. She gets in his face. He sits in timeout for long periods of time ... She yanks him and is very rough with him.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Not long after her phone call from Lane, on approximately April 29, 2016, T.C. and K.C.'s father, whose initials are also K.C., spoke with Joanna Cash, a classroom aide in K.C.'s classroom with Teckenbrock in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.] During that conversation, T.C. claims that Cash told her that she \"[wa]s tired of crying herself to sleep because she's witnessed Ms. Crystal abusing K.C.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.] \"She witnessed ... her pull his hair, verbally screaming at him, in his face,\" and \"him being in timeouts for lengthy amount[s] of time,\" sometimes for hours at a time. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.] T.C. testified that, during their meeting, Cash provided her with a \"typed letter of concerns\" with items for T.C. \"to check into that [Cash] had concerns about.\" [DN 22-4 at 7 (T.C. Deposition).] K.C.'s parents recorded their conversation with Cash. [\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DN 22-4 (Transcript of Conversation); DN 22-5 (K.C. Deposition).] Following these events, K.C.'s parents removed him from school for the remainder of the school year. [DN 22-8 (T.C. Declaration).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 1, 2016, K.C.'s parents went to the Marshall County Sherriff's Office to report the alleged abuse of K.C. occurring in Teckenbrock's classroom. [DN 22-4 at 5.] The parties agree that May 1, 2016 \"was the first time [K.C.'s parents] reported any alleged mistreatment of KC within the Marshall County School District to anyone.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] K.C.'s father testified that he played the recording of his and T.C.'s conversation with Cash at the Sherriff's office. [DN 22-5 at 40.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Stephen Flatt, the Director of Special Education at Marshall County Schools, testified that he found out about the allegations against Teckenbrock when he received a call from Pat Gold, the Interim Principal at Central Elementary at the time. [DN 22-7 at 11 (Flatt Deposition).] Flatt testified that Gold indicated that she had received a call from the Sherriff's Department regarding allegations of abuse of K.C., and that the Department would be conducting an investigation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Ray Chumbler, the \"school resource officer\" (\"SRO\") was in charge of that investigation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.] An SRO is \"a joint partnership between [Marshall County Schools] and the Marshall County Sherriff's Department.\" [DN 22-6 at 15 (Lovett Deposition).] At Interim Principal Gold's request, Flatt sat in on each interview Officer Chumbler conducted. [DN 22-7 at 13-15.] Officer Chumbler interviewed Jennifer Parker\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , Joanna Cash, and Crystal Teckenbrock. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.] Officer Chumbler's questions were \"[t]rying to find out if they had witnessed or seen anything in regards to abuse or neglect or the treatment of KC.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.] According to Flatt, Jennifer Parker stated that she \"had not seen anything that she would consider to be abuse or neglect or mistreatment.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Flatt testified that, during Cash's interview, she explained that she once heard a \"swatting\" noise coming from the room in which Teckenbrock was changing K.C.'s clothes, but that she did not know who was doing the swatting. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22.] Flat also explained that Cash referenced a hair-pulling incident, but explained that Teckenbrock was merely trying to pull K.C.'s hands out of his hair to prevent him from pulling his own hair. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.] Flatt could not recall Cash stating that she had witnessed Teckenbrock scream in K.C.'s face or leave K.C. in time out for extended periods. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24.] However, Cash testified that, during her interview with Officer Chumbler, she did tell him that she had seen Teckenbrock pull K.C.'s hair, scream in his face, and that she heard her spank him. [DN 22-1 at 32.] However, Cash testified that she did not prepare the document that she gave to K.C.'s parents at Cracker Barrel which had a list of questions for K.C.'s parents to check into. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.] Cash was unable to say who did prepare it, however. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By declaration, K.C.'s father averred that he called Officer Chumbler on May 2, 2016 to offer him the recording of the conversation with Cash and the list of questions and answers that Cash provided to them at Cracker Barrel. [DN 22-9] (K.C. Declaration). According to K.C.'s father, \"[h]e said it was not needed because he already made his conclusions of no abuse. He said it sounded like an 'unruly' situation to him and he was finished with his investigation.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Flatt testified that, at the conclusion of the interviews, Officer Chumbler informed him that he did not see \"any way to ... prove that this really took place based on ... what I found and what they've said ... they can't make a case on this.\" [DN 22-7 at 29.] \"He basically said, you know, he can't prove it happened.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Flatt, in turn, informed Superintendent Trent Lovett that Officer Chumbler \"found no incidents of wrongdoing.\" [DN 22-6 at 14 (Lovett Deposition).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Officer Chumbler's investigation, Flatt and Lovett had a meeting with T.C., Heather Lane, and another parent named Amber Harris on May 5, 2016. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 26.] At that meeting, the parents provided Lovett with a bulleted list of concerns, including \"abuse and neglect\" the \"[d]aily log not even being looked at by teacher,\" and \"[t]imeout for up to four hours.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20.] Lovett testified that the parents told him Teckenbrock frequently discussed T.C.'s personal life and called her \"monster\" in front of the students. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.] At the conclusion of the meeting, Lovett informed the parents that the school would further investigate the situation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lovett assigned Flatt and Abby Griffy, Marshall County's Elementary Supervisor, to conduct a second investigation. [DN 22-6 at 22.] Lovett advised them to investigate each of the items on the bulleted list that was provided to him during his meeting with T.C., Lane, and asked Harris to write a report summarizing their findings. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24.] Flatt and Griffy interviewed Teckenbrock and the instructional aides, Cash, Lindsay Hall, and Jennifer Parker. [DN 22-7 at 31.] According to Flatt, Teckenbrock denied that she had engaged in any abuse or neglect. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.] Flatt also testified that Cash was again \"kind of wishy-washy\" regarding what she had seen. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] \"She was kind of noncommittal,\" and referred back to what she'd said in her interview with Officer Chumbler. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35.] Flatt \"got the feeling that she just ... wasn't sure if what she was saying was mistreatment of students or not.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.] Flatt also testified that Cash told them she had not contacted any parents. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Cash did, however, mention that \"sometimes she didn't think there was enough going on in the room, and there was maybe sitting-the[ ] [kids] were just sitting there.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.]\" The report reflects that Cash stated \"[n]othing is being done to help these kids.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.] The parties agree that neither Officer Chumbler nor Flatt and Griffy interviewed K.C.'s parents or any special needs students during their investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lovett testified that he received the report from Flatt and Griffy on the 12th or 13th of May, but did not report back to T.C., Lane, and Harris because he received a call shortly after notifying him that the Department of Child Based Services (\"DCBS\") would be conducting its own investigation into a complaint filed with them. [DN 22-6 at 29.] The day he learned that DCBS would be conducting an investigation, Lovett removed Teckenbrock from the classroom setting. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As far as Lovett recalled, DCBS interviewed him, Interim Principal Gold, the instructional assistants (Cash, Parker, and Hall), Teckenbrock, and Flatt. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.] According to Lovett, DCBS did not inform him of its findings until late July, 2016. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.] DCBS reportedly did not substantiate abuse in Teckenbrock's classroom, but it did substantiate neglect. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Lovett asked to see the evidence DCBS uncovered in its investigation, but DCBS informed him that it could not share that information. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Though Teckenbrock's May 13, 2016 removal from the classroom setting was initially\n   intended to be temporary \"until all of this was settled,\" Teckenbrock remains removed from the classroom today. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.] Now, she works in the technology department in the office of the Marshall County Board of Education [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.] Teckenbrock does not currently work with children. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] No one from the school informed T.C., Lane, or Harris \"of the remedial measure of putting her in the tech department,\" however. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In August 2016, K.C., by and through his parents, T.C. and K.C., (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") brought the instant lawsuit. [DN 1.] Herein, Plaintiffs make claims for violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\"\u00a7 504\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.] The parties engaged in discovery, and the Marshall County Board of Education (the \"Board\" or \"Defendant\") filed the instant motion for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims. For the reasons discussed in detail below, that motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, reveals \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In the context of allegations that a school acted discriminatorily when it failed to provide a disabled student with appropriate physical and occupational services, the Sixth Circuit has stated that \"a plaintiff seeking to state a claim under either the ADA or \u00a7 504 against a school ... must show that he or she is (1) disabled under the statute, (2) 'otherwise qualified' for participation in the program, and (3) being excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under the program by reason of his or her disability.\"\n   <em>\n    M.G. by &amp; through C.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20Fed.%20Appx.%20280\">\n    720 Fed.Appx. at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20327447\">\n    2018 WL 327447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the context of teacher-on-student sexual harassment under Title IX, many principles of which have been applied to the ADA and \u00a7 504, the Sixth Circuit has held that \"[i]f a plaintiff proves that (1) a school district had actual notice of the sexual harassment; and (2) exhibited deliberate indifference in light of such notice, a school district may be held liable for damages.\"\n   <em>\n    McCoy v.

[DN 22-1 at 9.] The parties agree that K.C.'s last day of school was on Friday, April 29, 2016, and that he never returned to school in Marshall County after that date. [DN 22-5 at 41; DN 22-8.] K.C.'s parents also concede that when they went to the Marshall County Sherriff's Office on Sunday, May 1, 2016, \"that was the first time [they] reported any alleged mistreatment of KC within the Marshall County School District to anyone.\" [DN 22-4 at 5.] Then, on May 13, 2016, after Lovett learned that DCBS would be conducting its own investigation, Lovett removed Teckenbrock from the classroom and into an office setting where she did not work with children. Teckenbrock remains removed from the classroom today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The only argument Plaintiffs make in opposition to the Board's argument that it could not have been deliberately indifferent before May 1, 2016 is that the Board \"failed to train its aide on reporting child abuse over the head of the teacher. In doing so, Defendant disregarded a known or obvious\n   <em>\n    consequence of its action\n   </em>\n   -that a special needs child, who cannot report abuse himself, could not escape the abuser.\" [DN 22 at 9.] However, the evidence does not support a finding that Defendant failed to adequately train its instructional aides. In her deposition, Jennifer Love (formerly Jennifer Parker) testified that, at the beginning of each school year, teachers and aides attend a meeting in which the principal covers the definitions of abuse and neglect. [DN 22-3 at 10 (Jennifer Love Deposition).] Love testified that, if aides \"were to witness abuse or neglect in a classroom,\" their duty is \"[t]o report it to [the] administration.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Love testified that she would first report to the principal, and then to the assistant principal if the principal was unavailable. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Similarly, Cash testified in her deposition that she receives a copy of the employee handbook every year, which covers reporting child abuse. [DN 22-1 at 72-75.] Cash further testified that, if she suspected a student was being abused, she would first report to the teacher, but if the teacher was the person suspected of abusing the student, then she would report to the principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-76.] Cash explicitly stated that she was aware she could go to the principal to report abuse as of the 2015-2016 school year. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76.] In sum, the evidence belies a finding that the instructional aides were inadequately trained regarding the procedures for reporting child abuse and therefore that the Board acted deliberately indifferent to abuse in that regard. Aside from this argument, which the Court finds unpersuasive, Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute that the Board could not have been deliberately indifferent prior to May 1, 2016, when they first had notice of the alleged mistreatment. And because K.C. never again attended Marshall County schools again\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Board had notice of the alleged mistreatment, the Court agrees that it could not have been deliberately indifferent to K.C.'s abuse before that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2) Deliberate Indifference in Responding to Allegations of Harassment or Abuse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue, however, that the Board's response once it did have notice of the alleged abuse after May 1, 2016 was inadequate and amounted to deliberate indifference. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the first investigation, conducted by Officer Chumbler, failed to give sufficient weight to Cash's testimony that she\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   witnessed mistreatment of K.C. by Teckenbrock. [DN 22 at 4.] In her deposition, Cash testified that her interview with Officer Chumbler covered whether \"there w[ere] any instances of any abuse or any sort of physical situations.\" [DN 22-1 at 13.] She further testified that she told Officer Chumbler that she had seen Teckenbrock pull K.C.'s hair and scream in his face. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.] Flatt, on the other hand, who sat in on each of Officer Chumbler's interviews, stated that Cash referenced a hair-pulling incident, but explained that Teckenbrock was merely trying to pull K.C.'s hands out of his hair to prevent him from pulling his own hair. [DN 22-7 at 22.] Flatt also could not recall Cash stating that she had witnessed Teckenbrock scream in K.C.'s face or leave K.C. in time out for extended periods. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24.] Accordingly, what Cash told Officer Chumbler during her interview with him is somewhat in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   During the second investigation, during which Lovett assigned Flatt and Griffy to interview Teckenbrock and the instructional aides, Cash was interviewed again. However, Cash testified that she did not tell Flatt and Griffy that she had seen any hair-pulling or screaming or heard any spanking during her meeting with them because they did not ask those questions and \"[t]hat's not what the conversation was about.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.] According to Cash, her meeting with Flatt and Griffy was geared only toward matters of internal classroom operations. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.] Flatt testified otherwise; he contends that he did \"reask the question that Mr. Chumbler asked to each of these persons as to whether they witnessed any abuse or neglect or mistreatment by Ms. Teckenbrock.\" [DN 22-7 at 34.] Therefore, whether Flatt and Griffy questioned the interviewees about abuse is disputed. According to Flatt, when asked about any mistreatment, Cash was \"wishy-washy\" and \"noncommittal\" in her answers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Flatt did not recall Cash saying Teckenbrock screamed in K.C.'s face, but did recall her saying that \"[n]othing is being done to help these kids. They are just sat in a chair.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.] After Flatt and Griffy's investigation concluded sometime between May 11 or 12, 2016, Lovett testified that he received a call shortly after from DCBS indicating that they would also be conducting an investigation. It was then, on May 13, that he removed Teckenbrock\n   from the classroom to work in the Board's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Flatt and Griffy's investigation exhibited deliberate indifference because it was \"results-oriented,\" did not ask specific questions about abuse, and failed to interview K.C.'s parents, who could have provided them with the recording of their conversation with Cash or the document she gave them. [DN 22 at 5-6.] According to Plaintiffs, \"failure to investigate abuse-in the face of complaints\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   abuse, and instruction from the Superintendent to investigate\n   <em>\n    abuse\n   </em>\n   -is also 'disregarding a known risk.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.] However, regardless of whether Flatt and Griffy's investigation was adequate, K.C. was never subjected to a risk of further harassment because he was removed from school and, soon after, Teckenbrock was removed from the classroom. Importantly, \"[t]he deliberate indifference must, at a minimum, 'cause [students] to undergo' harassment or 'make them liable or vulnerable' to it.\"\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20387\">\n    515 Fed.Appx. at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p648\">\n    526 U.S. at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p648\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). That was simply not the case here; K.C. was never made vulnerable to experiencing additional harassment after the Board had notice of the alleged mistreatment because he was never in Teckenbrock's classroom again after that time. Plaintiffs have pointed to no case law suggesting that an alleged insufficient investigation into allegations of misconduct, without more, constitutes deliberate indifference. Rather, deliberate indifference must somehow result in harassment or make students vulnerable to continued harassment. Here, the last day K.C. attended school was Friday, April 29. K.C. never returned to school. Thus, even if the ensuing investigation was inadequate, it did not subject K.C. to further harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In contrast, in cases in which courts have found that school officials have exhibited deliberate indifference include situations in which repeated reports went ignored and students continued to be abused or harassed. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    S.S. v. Eastern Kentucky University\n   </em>\n   , the court, citing two other cases, explained the deliberate indifference standard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The cases of\n   <em>\n    K.M.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   are instructive in determining whether Model's actions evinced a deliberate indifference to S.S.'s situation. In\n   <em>\n    K.M.\n   </em>\n   , a disabled child had repeatedly been subjected to verbal abuse and physical attacks over the course of two middle-school years, including disability-related slurs. The student and his mother reported each incident to the school, but school officials initially took no action to protect him from further harassment. After the student was beaten up on a schoolbus, the school advised his mother to keep him out of school for an indeterminate period of time, but provided no educational services for him. Furthermore, no one was disciplined in connection with the incidents, which caused the student to become suicidal. He subsequently sued the school under the ADA and \u00a7 504 for inadequately responding to the peer-on-peer disability-based harassment. The district court denied the school's motion for summary judgment, concluding that triable issues of fact existed with respect to the school district's lack of response to the student's repeated complaints.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   similarly involved a disabled student and her mother who reported incidents of harassment to school administrators. But in\n   <em>\n    Biggs\n   </em>\n   the school took action each time, including counseling the child, meeting with the offending students, sending letters to parents, threatening the offenders with suspension, and alerting teachers to the problem.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Concluding that such responses established that the school was not deliberately indifferent to the harassment, the court granted the school's motion for summary judgment. 229 F.Supp.2d at 445.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    S.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032404\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/532/445/#p452\">\n    532 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   455 (citing\n   <em>\n    K.M. ex rel.

During that meeting, the parents voiced several remaining concerns about Teckenbrock's classroom. After that, Lovett assigned Flatt and Griffy to investigate a second time. After that investigation concluded, on May 11 or 12, and Lovett learned that DCBS would be conducting a third investigation, Lovett removed Teckenbrock from the classroom on May 13. Teckenbrock has remained in the Board office ever since, not working with children. Plaintiffs are correct that the contents of parts of Officer Chumbler and Flatt and Griffy's investigations are factually disputed. They also contend that the Board could have done more, such as remove Teckenbrock from the classroom sooner or interview K.C.'s parents about what Cash told them. However, ultimately, the Court does not find these matters to be probative in light of the fact that K.C. never attended school again after April 29, 2016 and therefore was never forced to undergo further harassment or made more \" 'liable or vulnerable' to it.\"\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20387\">\n    515 Fed.Appx. at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p648\">\n    526 U.S. at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p648\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, at the time the investigations took place, \"the known circumstances were sparse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 392.

[DN 22 at 11.] According to Plaintiffs, this resulted in a loss of K.C.'s valuable education time. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.] The Sixth Circuit has recognized that a school \"acts with deliberate indifference if it disregards a 'known or obvious consequence' of its actions, namely that its actions will violate the plaintiff's federally-protected rights.\n   <em>\n    R.K. ex rel.

As an initial matter, Plaintiffs have not shown that the Board denied K.C. participation in or excluded him from school. Rather, Plaintiffs merely argue that the Board did not adequately communicate with them regarding their investigation and the removal of Teckenbrock from the classroom. And while it would seem reasonable for the Board to have communicated with K.C.'s parents regarding these issues, the fact that they did not does not show that it went so far as to deny K.C. education or exclude him from it. Plaintiffs have introduced no evidence that they attempted to obtain information from the Board and that the Board refused their requests. Moreover, Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that, for example, they desired to return K.C. to school but that the Board failed to cooperate or accommodate K.C. to ensure he was not mistreated. What's more, there is no evidence that any failure by the Board to adequately communicate with Plaintiffs or failure to seek K.C.'s return to school occurred \"because of\" or \"solely by reason of\" K.C.'s disability. This is the crux of ADA and \u00a7 504 claims. Without any evidence as to these findings, Plaintiffs' claims cannot proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court does not take Plaintiffs' allegations lightly. The allegations of mistreatment of K.C. by Teckenbrock are offensive and reprehensible. However, the question before the Court in an ADA and \u00a7 504 case is \"whether the independent misconduct of a teacher is attributable to the school [board] that employs h[er] under a specific federal statute designed primarily to prevent recipients of federal financial assistance from using the funds\" in a manner that discriminates against individuals with disabilities.\n   <em>\n    Gebser v.
