Mueller, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The State of California (\"State\") has sought a federal grant for two state transit projects. The United States Department of Labor (\"DOL\") has refused to certify the State to receive the grant funds. The State argues this refusal of certification was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Although the court previously resolved the parties' cross motions for summary judgment, largely in the State's favor, one question remains: Whether DOL can properly base\n   its refusal to certify the State to receive grant funds based on an intervening state law's changes to pension benefit provisions affecting certain employees that work for Monterey-Salinas Transit (\"MST\"). As explained below, the court grants judgment for the State on this remaining issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties dispute the adequacy of the statutory interpretation in which the DOL engaged to deny the State's request for funding under \u00a7 13(c)(1) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205301\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"UMTA\").

The unions feared local governments would use the newfound federal funding to assume operation of transit entities, and states would either restrict or outright prohibit public employers from bargaining collectively with their employees.

The existing ATU-MST agreement memorialized certain pension rights for MST's classic employees.

Under PEPRA, applications for airtime credit were no longer accepted after January 1, 2013. The preexisting\n   ATU-MST bargaining agreement, however, gave MST classic employees the right to buy airtime through September 2013.

What matters under \u00a7 13(c)(1), as adopted by Congress, is the nature and degree of changes employers make to their employees' existing rights. Hence, a contextually sound statutory reading is that changing an employee's existing bargained-for rights violates \u00a7 13(c)(1) only if the change is negative, meaning it eliminates, reduces, or limits those rights, as well as meaningful, as in a change that is neither trivial nor purely semantic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, the court interprets \u00a7 13(c)(1) to provide that the DOL may deny certification where a state entity seeks funding for a transit project, but has not protected the affected transit entity's employees against meaningful negative changes to rights and benefits conferred by their then-existing collective-bargaining agreements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332234\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/64/#p69\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Applying this standard, the court assesses whether PEPRA's airtime provision has a meaningfully negative effect on MST's classic employees.

Given that only the airtime provision directly impacts MST classic employees' bargained-for rights, and the absence of authority to support DOL's position regarding its aggregation argument, the court examines the airtime provision by itself. More narrowly, then, did the nine-month reduction in time meaningfully and negatively impact MST classic employees' existing bargained-for pension rights or benefits?

Instead of examining the nature and meaningfulness of PEPRA's effect on MST employees' pension rights, the DOL broadly relied on the basic fact that PEPRA \"changed\" government employee pension rights as proof that the State has not \"preserved\" existing rights. AR 69. As discussed above, however, a \u00a7 13(c)(1) analysis properly focuses on the nature and degree of change. The DOL's decision recites various PEPRA provisions, including those reviewed below; the DOL labels these as barriers to \u00a7 13(c)(1) compliance, but does not explain how the changes in state law negatively and meaningfully impact MST classic employees' rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229682\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/134/#p140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mere recitation of provisions is not reasoned decision making.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Airtime, and the ability to purchase it, is a significant pension benefit. The court thus rejects the State's argument that \u00a7 13(c)(1) does not apply because PEPRA's airtime provision effected only a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   change. ECF No. 124 at 2. Section 13(c)(1) protects a classic employee's \"rights, privileges, and benefits.\" Even if airtime is considered a \"benefit enhancement option,\" it is still a benefit: The option to enhance a benefit is a benefit in and of itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Completely eliminating one's ability to purchase airtime would have a meaningful and negative impact on one's pension benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJ Order at 3 n.2 (describing how airtime in general has a \"significant\" effect on retirement benefit calculations);\n   <em>\n    Remand Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248812\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/76/1125/#p1130\">\n    76 F.Supp.3d at 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the relevant provision here is not so drastic. PEPRA reduced the timeframe during which MST classic employees could purchase airtime. It shortened the initial 36-month period by nine months. The employees still had 27 months to purchase the airtime to which they were entitled under the bargaining agreement. The change PEPRA effected did not reduce how much airtime employees could buy; it prompted them to buy it sooner. Also, the employees knew about the deadline well before it happened: PEPRA was enacted in September 2012 but went into effect on January 1, 2013, with four months' notice. SJ Order at 3; ECF No. 124 at 4; ECF No. 128 at 5. And, as plaintiffs argue, MST and its employees could potentially offset any effect on benefits through local negotiations. The air time change was not sufficiently meaningful to trigger \u00a7 13(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, PEPRA did not meaningfully and negatively impact rights the MST classic employees enjoyed under their existing collective bargaining agreements so as to warrant a \u00a7 13(c)(1) denial. The DOL misconstrued its statutory mandate to determine that the State had not \"preserved\" existing bargained-for rights. The court finds the DOL's \u00a7 13(c)(1) denial was improper under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The court GRANTS the State's motion for partial summary judgment on the DOL's \u00a7 13(c)(1) denial as to MST classic employees.
