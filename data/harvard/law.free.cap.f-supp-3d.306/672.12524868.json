PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Invoking diversity jurisdiction, on June 29, 2016, Plaintiff Louise Robinson sued Defendant Allstate Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Co., alleging breach of contract, common law bad faith, and statutory bad faith. (Compl., Doc. No. 1);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Allstate moved to dismiss the Complaint for failure to join an indispensable party, to dismiss the common law bad faith count as non-cognizable, and to strike some of Plaintiff's monetary claims. (Doc. No. 2.) I denied without prejudice Allstate's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, dismissed Plaintiff's common law and statutory bad faith claims, and struck Plaintiff's claim for attorneys' fees. (Doc. No. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the conclusion of discovery, the Parties cross-moved for summary judgment. (Doc. Nos. 46, 47.) Plaintiff also moved to reinstate her statutory bad faith claim. (Doc. No. 47.) The matter was fully briefed and I denied Plaintiff's motions for summary judgment and to reinstate her statutory bad faith claim. (Doc. Nos. 48, 49, 52, 58, 60, 61.) All that remains is Allstate's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's breach of contract claim. (Doc. No. 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I have resolved all disputes in Plaintiff's favor and construed the undisputed facts in the light most favorable to her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hugh v. Butler Cty. Family YMCA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8932771\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/265/#p267\">\n    418 F.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267 (3d Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Insurance Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Allstate issued the Policy insuring the Philadelphia home of Plaintiff and her husband, Willie Robinson, both of whom are \"named insureds.\" (Homeowners Policy 6, Doc. No. 46-4.) The Policy imposes \"joint obligations on persons defined as an insured person,\" meaning that \"the responsibilities, acts and failures to act of a person defined as an insured person will be binding upon another person defined as an insured person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Policy provides,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"Dwelling Protection\" and \"Personal Property Protection\"; both apply only to \"sudden and accidental direct physical loss\" to the\n   property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-39.) Allstate also included a provision common to almost all homeowners policies, excluding from both \"Dwelling Protection\" and \"Personal Property Protection\" loss caused by \"intentional or criminal acts of or at the direction of any insured person, if the loss that occurs: a) may be reasonably expected to result from such acts; or b) is the intended result of such acts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Fire\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the morning of October 26, 2015, Plaintiff called 911 because she \"want[ed] someone to get her husband,\" who was \"armed with a torch.\" (Phila. Police Dep't, Incident History Details, Oct. 26, 2015, Doc. No. 46-5.) Plaintiff told the operator that she smelled kerosene and smoke and that the fire alarm was going off. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When the police arrived, \"[Mr. Robinson] stated to police that he set the fire because 'his house is demonic and needs to be taken down.' \" (Phila. Police Dep't, Complaint or Incident Report, Oct. 26, 2015, Doc. No. 46-7.) The police arrested Mr. Robinson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.'s Dep. 31:19-21, 33:18-21, Doc. No. 46-6.) The fire \"caus[ed] moderate thermal, soot and smoke damage to the closet area[,] smoke and soot damage to the third floor.\" (Phila. Fire Dep't, Investigation Profile Report, Doc. No. 46-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff testified that on the morning of the fire, she saw her husband-then 85 years old-with a lighter (which she more frequently described as a lit torch). (Pl.'s Dep. 16:21-17:4; Pl.'s Am. Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 4, Doc. No. 60.) After Mr. Robinson went upstairs and Plaintiff smelled smoke, she went outside to call 911. (Pl.'s Dep. 25:5-14, 29:7-13.) She left the house to make the call because \"[she] didn't want [her husband] to hear [her] calling 911\" and \"reporting somebody to come in on [him].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:12-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Robinson's admissions aside, the cause of the fire is undisputed. Plaintiff acknowledges that her husband set the fire. (Pl.'s Am. Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 1 (\"The 'intentional act' which Allstate purports the basis of the denial, was the result of medical issue [sic] suffered by co-insured, [Mr. Robinson.]\").) Philadelphia Fire Marshal Eric Geiger determined that the fire \"originate[d] on the third floor in the closet area ... when an open flame [was] applied to available combustibles.\" (Phila. Fire Dep't, Investigation Profile Report, Doc. No. 46-11.) Plaintiff's expert John Lightbody concluded that \"[t]he ignition source for the fire is identified as open flame from a plumber's torch. The cause of the fire is intentional....\" (Lightbody Investigation Report 9, Doc. No. 46-24.) Finally, Defendant's expert Arthur Czajkowski concluded that \"the fire [was] caused by an open flame from a plumbers torch (Ignition Source) being applied to the clothing and other combustibles (First Item Ignited) stored in and around the third floor front bedroom closet.\" (Letter from Arthur Czajkowski to Allstate 5, Doc. No. 46-17) Mr. Czajkowski interviewed Plaintiff on November 3, 2015, when she told him that on the morning of the fire, she saw Mr. Robinson with a lit plumber's torch in his hand; after he went upstairs, she called 911. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Mr. Robinson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Upon arresting him, the police took Mr. Robinson to the Albert Einstein Medical Center, where he underwent involuntary examination and treatment. (Phila. Police Dep't, Complaint or Incident Report, Oct. 26, 2015, Doc. No. 46-8);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207302\">\n    50 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 7302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has provided 1,100 pages of records from Einstein relating to her husband. (Pl.'s Am. Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. A., Doc. No. 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   An examination note made on October 27, 2015 (the day after the fire) provides that Mr. Robinson was suffering from \"psychosis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81, Doc. No. 60-5.) Mr. Robinson told the medical staff: \"I want it to burn ... my house, my wife, everything ... [e]verything is demonic, me, where I live, it's all demonic ... I got a port where they can talk to me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dementia and acute psychosis are repeatedly noted in the Einstein records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89, 96, 108, 114.) Those records also indicate, however, that the doctors had come to no definite diagnosis. For instance, the admitting psychiatrist (whose deposition was not taken) wrote,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , as follows: \"We need more information from family regarding the [patient's] history, baseline functioning, and timeline to better ascertain if the cause of the [patient's] behavior is psychiatric in nature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Robinson was discharged from Einstein on November 11, 2015 and transferred to another inpatient facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35; Pl.'s Am. Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 10.) He passed away on January 16, 2016. (Cert. of Death, Jan. 20, 2016, Doc. No. 47, Ex. G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As I discuss below, Plaintiff has presented no expert report or deposition testimony respecting her husband's mental state. Rather, in contesting summary judgment, she relies entirely on the Einstein records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Insurance Claim and the Instant Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On the day of the fire (which took place during the Policy's coverage period) Allstate received Plaintiff's claim for coverage. (First Notice of Loss Snapshot, Doc. No. 46-12.) Having retained expert Czajkowski to determine the fire's cause, Allstate made no coverage decision until it received his report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Some two weeks later, Mr. Czajkowski informed Allstate that the fire \"was the result of someone applying an open flame to available clothing and other combustibles [in Plaintiff's house].\" (Letter from Arthur Czajkowski to Allstate 4, Doc. No. 46-17.) Allstate promptly issued to Plaintiff a reservation of rights letter, while it awaited advice from counsel. (Reservation of Rights Letter, Doc. No. 46-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Approximately two weeks later, counsel advised Allstate that Plaintiff's claim was not covered. (Coverage Opinion, Doc. No. 46-21.) Acting on counsel's advice, a week later, Allstate issued to Plaintiff a letter denying coverage, concluding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the loss Plaintiff had sustained: (1) was not \"accidental\" within the meaning of Allstate's policy; and (2) was intentionally caused by the acts of an insured. (Letter from Allstate, Doc. No 46-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On June 29, 2016, Plaintiff brought suit against Allstate. (Compl., Doc. No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    V. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In asking me to dismiss, Allstate argues,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the damage to Plaintiff's home is not covered because: (1) the fire loss was not accidental; and (2) the fire was intentionally set by Mr. Robinson. Plaintiff responds that: (1) the fire, when viewed from her perspective, was accidental; and (2) Mr. Robinson did not set the fire intentionally because he was psychotic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because Plaintiff has not made a prima facie showing that coverage exists for the fire loss, I will grant summary judgment in Allstate's favor. In the alternative, I conclude that Allstate has shown that the loss is excluded because it resulted from an insured's intentional act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Absence of Medical Experts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Although both sides retained fire experts, neither has offered any expert medical evidence. Allstate argues vigorously that without expert opinion testimony, as a\n   matter of law Plaintiff cannot show that her husband's mental illness precluded him from committing an intentional act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 26, Doc. No. 46 (\"The Plaintiff has not retained any expert who has opined that Mr. Robinson is [sic] mentally unstable.\"); Def.'s Reply 2, Doc. No. 61 (\"The Plaintiff has not provided support for all her arguments related to Mr. Robinson's alleged mental illness with admissible evidence.\").) I do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Allstate notes (correctly) that in all the decisions Plaintiff offers addressing the question of whether a mentally ill person can commit an intentional or criminal act, the claims of mental illness were supported by expert opinion evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Germantown Ins.
