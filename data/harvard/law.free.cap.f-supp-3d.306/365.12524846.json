Tyson, Sr. is an employee of the United States Postal\n   Service (\"USPS\" or \"Postal Service\") who contends that the Postal Service discriminated against him on the basis of his religion when he was reassigned to another duty location and was prevented from returning because the open position at his original station was rescinded. (Am. Compl., ECF No. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 1-12, 49-53.) Tyson has filed the instant employment discrimination action against Defendant Megan Brennan, the U.S. Postmaster General (in her official capacity), and although the complaint is less than clear about the legal basis for the claim alleged, the Court presumes that Tyson is proceeding under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e - 2000e-17, as he states in a later filing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss or Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"), ECF No. 20, at 20 (\"Plaintiff is suing the defendant for religious discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[.]\") )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before this Court at present is USPS's motion to dismiss Tyson's complaint, or in the alternative, motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Pl.'s Am. Compl., or, in the Alternative, for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 15, at 1-2; Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. (\"Def.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 15, at 5-24). USPS argues that because the appointment that was allegedly rescinded due to religious discrimination was nothing more than a lateral transfer, Tyson's complaint fails to plead specific facts showing that Tyson suffered an adverse action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 16-17.) USPS further maintains that dismissal is warranted because the complaint lacks facts that demonstrate that USPS actually rescinded the position on account of Tyson's religion. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.) In the alternative, USPS contends that the Court should enter summary judgment in its favor, because it has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for having rescinded the position-namely, that the position announcement was posted in error. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons explained below, this Court will decline USPS's invitation to treat its pending motion as one for summary judgment at this early stage of the case, and with respect to the merits of the motion to dismiss, the Court concludes that the allegations contained in Tyson's amended complaint are sufficient to state a plausible claim for discrimination under governing D.C. Circuit precedent. Accordingly, USPS's motion will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to the complaint, Tyson-who self-identifies as a Christian-was working at the government mails facility at 3300 V Street, Northeast in Washington, D.C. in 2010, when Cecil Harriston, the plant manager, \"approached [him] and told [him] to turn [his] gospel music down[.]\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 1;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) The complaint further alleges that Tyson had \"several confrontations\" with Harriston \"over the playing of the gospel music\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3), and yet, according to the complaint, Harriston did not \"say anything to the other employees[ ] who play[ed] secular music ... in [the same] work area\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Tyson maintains that his \"job was abolished on or about[ ] April 11, 2011,\" and that he \"was transferred to the [Curseen-Morris Processing and Distribution Center] to continue employment\" with the\n   Postal Service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) The complaint alleges that, following this transfer, Tyson retained \"retreat rights\"-that is, the right to fill a position that becomes vacant at his original facility. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.) When Tyson learned in 2014 that a mail-handler position at the government mails facility was posted due to another employee's departure (the complaint refers to this as a \"new [ ] position\" or a \"retreated position\" (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 14) ), Tyson conferred with his union representative regarding his rights with respect to the new position, and on May 19, 2014, Tyson was allegedly \"given a letter indicating[ ] the offer of retreat[,] which he accepted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-10.) Two days later, however, Tyson was purportedly told that the new position had been rescinded. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Tyson subsequently made a number of inquiries regarding the rescission of the new position (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-24), and the complaint alleges that the Postmaster ultimately told him to report to the new position at the government mails facility (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31). But when he did so, Tyson again came into contact with Harriston, who allegedly told Tyson \"that he had no position for [Tyson]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36), and instructed Tyson to report back to the Curseen-Morris Processing and Distribution Center (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 17, 2016, Tyson initiated the instant pro se lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) Tyson filed the operative amended complaint on November 28, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl.), which mooted the Postal Service's motion to dismiss his original complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 9; Min. Order of Dec. 22, 2016). In his Amended Complaint, Tyson alleges \"that plant manager Harriston[ ] did not want [Tyson] employed at the government mails facility[ ] because while employed there previously, Tyson was playing his Gospel music and exercising his religious rights as a Christian.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 49.) He further maintains that rescission of the position \"was a direct result of plant manager Harriston['s] intervention\" because Harriston allegedly \"did not want [Tyson] there, exercising his religious beliefs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) As relief, Tyson seeks the \"out of schedu[le] pay\" that he allegedly lost as a result of the rescission of the new position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Postal Service has moved to dismiss Tyson's amended complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem.) USPS argues that Tyson's complaint contains insufficient facts, because Tyson \"does not allege any facts from which to infer that his denial of a lateral transfer to the government mails facility had any effect on the terms, conditions, or privileges of [his] employment.\" (Def.'s Mem. at 17.) The Postal Service further argues that Tyson has failed to plead sufficient facts establishing the requisite causation for a religious discrimination claim; to this end, USPS characterizes Tyson's allegation that \"the manager at the government mails facility did not want Plaintiff to work there because Plaintiff is a Christian\" as nothing more than a \"legal conclusion\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and argues that Tyson \"does not even allege that [it was] the manager [who] made the decision to deny [him] a later[al] transfer\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). USPS's motion is ripe for this Court's consideration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply in Supp. of Def.'s Mot.

Specifically, Tyson alleges that that he had \"several confrontations\" with the plant manager regarding his \"playing of the gospel music\" and that the same manager \"doesn't say anything to the other employees, who play[ ] secular music ... in [the same] work area.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 2-3.) Then, after Tyson's post was abolished and he was moved elsewhere, he was allegedly offered a new position back at the government mails facility, but this offer was rescinded as \"a direct result of plant manager Harriston['s] intervention\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53), because Harriston \"did not want [Tyson] back at the government mails facility\" due to Tyson's Christian faith (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51). And while\n   USPS maintains that any movement from the Curseen-Morris facility to the government mails facility was merely a \"lateral\" transfer that thus fails to qualify as an actionable adverse employment action under Title VII (Def.'s Mem. at 17), the character of the two positions is not immediately evident from the face of Tyson's complaint, and it would be inappropriate for this Court to infer that Tyson is complaining about a missed opportunity with respect to a \"lateral\" move in resolving this instant motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Settles v. U.S. Parole Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1554005,3446535\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/1098/\">\n    429 F.3d 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1106 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (\"At the motion to dismiss stage, counseled complaints, as well as\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaints, are to be construed with sufficient liberality to afford all possible inferences favorable to the pleader on allegations of fact.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The bottom line is this: after construing all facts in Tyson's favor, and proceeding with the understanding that pro se complaints must be given considerable leeway, this Court finds that the complaint's assertion of religious discrimination-and, in particular, its contention that \"[a]fter several confrontations[ ] between plaintiff and plant manager Harriston[ ] over the playing of the gospel music,\" Tyson's position was \"abolished\" (Am Compl. \u00b6 3), and Tyson was subsequently offered a position back in that same facility (which he was entitled to as \"the senior employee who left that facility\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7) ) but the offer was rescinded due to the \"intervention\" of the same manager who had previously confronted him about playing religious music (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53)-is sufficient to state a plausible Title VII claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. USPS's Pre-Discovery Request For Summary Judgment Will Not Be Entertained At This Time\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This Court will deny USPS's invitation to accelerate the litigation process by treating its motion as one for summary judgment and considering its evidence pertaining to the purportedly legitimate reasons for the agency's rescission of the open position in the government mails facility. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 19 (arguing, \"[i]n the alternative,\" that USPS \"has been able to establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason as to why [Tyson] was not permitted to return to his old position\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   When a district court undertakes to evaluate an employer's motion for summary judgment in an employment discrimination case where the validity of an employer's proffered reason for the challenged conduct is at issue, it is clear beyond cavil that \"the district court must resolve one central question: Has the employee produced sufficient\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   for a reasonable jury to find that the employer's asserted non-discriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin?\"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Resolution of this question necessarily turns on the evidence that\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   sides have presented regarding the factual circumstances surrounding the challenged conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.

Thus, it is this Court's long-held view that pre-discovery motions for summary judgment in situations such as this one-i.e., motions that seek summary judgment before the plaintiff has had the chance to gather and submit evidence related to the challenged employment decision-are seldom appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173387\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/180/#p192\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases \"ordinarily must marshal the kinds of evidence that one usually can only gather during the discovery phase in order to carry their burden\" of showing,\n   pursuant to the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework or otherwise, \"that the legitimate reasons the defendant has proffered are, in fact, pretextual, and that the real reason for the adverse employment action is a prohibited one\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   493-94 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (remarking that \"in this Court's view, the cases in which a plaintiff will be fairly held to the task of opposing summary judgment without first being afforded the opportunity to take discovery will be few and far between\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This Court sees no reason to depart from its ordinary practice of declining to consider an employer's evidence regarding its reasons for undertaking the challenged employment action prior to authorizing the discovery process in the instant case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 193-94, and USPS has provided none. Tyson will have the opportunity to gather evidence regarding the circumstances under which the alleged appointment was rescinded during discovery, and USPS will be able to renew (and potentially expand) its request for summary judgment at the conclusion of the discovery process. Consequently, USPS's present request for summary judgment is essentially tabled, and the Court has not considered the extra materials that USPS has attached to the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This Court finds that Tyson has pled sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for religious discrimination under governing Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent, and the Court declines to consider USPS's arguments in support of a motion for summary judgment at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 15) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Page numbers herein refer to those that the Court's electronic case filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    In addition to claiming discrimination, the amended complaint also appears to allege that USPS violated \"the Employee and Labor Relation Manual, Issue 26, September 2013, Section 666.12\" and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution (Am. Compl. \u00b6 48), and USPS specifically addresses the complaint's allegation that USPS had violated provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between the National Postal Mail Handlers Union and USPS in its motion (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mem. at 20-22). Tyson has since clarified that he \"is not suing for a violation of the National Agreement\" (Pl.'s Opp'n at 20), and USPS has therefore \"withdraw[n] its argument for dismissal of that non-existent claim\" (Def.'s Reply at 7 n.2). Furthermore, because Tyson has clarified that he \"is suing the defendant for religious discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" (Pl.'s Opp'n at 20), this Court will deem Tyson to have abandoned any claims brought under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
