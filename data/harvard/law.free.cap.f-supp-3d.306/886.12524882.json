Stewart, Sr., in their official capacities. Plaintiffs filed an opposition to this motion (Doc. 32), to which Defendants replied (Doc. 35). The Court held oral arguments on January 30, 2018. (See Doc. 56). For the following reasons, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, access to abortion has withered in Louisiana since 2001. Eight abortion clinics have closed, and only three remain. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 191, 201-02). Today, there are approximately 312,000 reproductive-aged women for each clinic in the State, one of the lowest ratios in the entire nation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 203). While access to this constitutionally protected right has steadily declined, the number of laws governing abortions and abortion providers have drastically increased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First passed in 2001, the Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing Laws (\"OAFLL\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   govern the personnel, internal policies, facility, reporting, recordkeeping, and licensing of clinics that perform abortion services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 50). The Louisiana Legislature substantially revised OAFLL in 2010, and major regulations have been enacted pursuant to the statute, most notably in 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53, 61, 71, 74-75, 77, &amp; 87). Today, OAFLL and its accompanying regulations place over 1,000 individual requirements on outpatient abortion clinics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). Importantly, one of these laws allows for the warrantless inspection of abortion clinics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103). OAFLL also empowers the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health (\"LDH\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to suspend immediately a clinic's license for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   violation of OAFLL, its regulations, or any other federal or State law or regulation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to OAFLL, which regulates abortion clinics, Louisiana has passed several statutes that purportedly govern the safety of doctors that perform abortions and their patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). Plaintiffs challenge twelve specific statutory provisions in their complaint: La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 14:32.9 (criminalizing abortions by non-licensed physicians); \u00a7 14:32.9.1 (criminalizing dismemberment abortion); \u00a7 40:1061.10(A)(1) (setting qualifications for physicians who perform abortions); \u00a7 40:1061.10(D)(1) (requiring that the physician performing the abortion to also perform the mandatory pre-abortion ultrasound); \u00a7 40:1061.11 (requiring that the physician who prescribes abortion drugs be in the room when they are first administered); \u00a7 40:1061.16(B) (requiring the provision of printed materials to women at least seventy-two hours prior to an abortion); \u00a7 40:1061.16(C) (mandating that the printed materials be provided individually, in a private room, and that the abortion clinic keep records concerning women who receive the materials); \u00a7 40:1061.17(B) (setting forth informed consent requirements that allegedly include false or misleading information); \u00a7 40:1061.17(C)(8) (requiring a \"prominent link\" to LDH's abortion alternatives and informed consent website on abortion clinics' webpages); \u00a7 40:1061.17(G) (requiring physicians to report all women who receive informed consent information to the State); \u00a7 40:1061.19 (mandating the retention of certain records); and, \u00a7 40:1061.21 (reporting requirements for all abortions performed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are June Medical Services, LLC d/b/a Hope Medical Group for Women (\"Clinic Plaintiff\")-on behalf of its patients, physicians, and staff-and six doctors who perform abortions (\"Doctor Plaintiffs\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-17). They challenge the Louisiana abortion laws-as applied-on three grounds. First, Plaintiffs claim that the challenged laws and regulations violate their substantive due process rights by placing an undue burden on women seeking an abortion. Second, Plaintiffs claim that the State's power to suspend immediately a clinic's license for any violation of state or federal law violates their procedural due process rights. Third, Plaintiffs allege that the warrantless search provision violates their Fourth Amendment right to privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Because OAFLL empowers the State to promulgate individual regulations, Defendants claim that many of the regulations are reasonable and that, alternatively, Plaintiff lacks standing to challenge other regulatory provisions (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13-14). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs must identify \"exactly which regulations they challenge\" (Doc. 57 at p. 10, l. 20), which Defendants speculate could take the form of \"a 2,000 page complaint addressing 500 regulatory requirements,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 11, ll. 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs disagree. First, Plaintiffs claim that Supreme Court precedent, primarily\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   , requires that the Court analyze the combined effect that laws have on access to abortion. (Doc. 32 at p. 4). Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that, in attacking the application of OAFLL as applied through its regulation and enforcement provisions, they have asserted a cognizable claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5). In other words, Plaintiffs are challenging the OAFLL regulatory scheme as a whole, not each individual regulation implementing OAFLL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 5-6). Plaintiffs argue that their complaint sets out detailed, factual allegations that the challenged laws \"make[ ] obtaining abortion care more invasive, confusing, difficult, and costly for patients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Turning first to Defendant's argument that Plaintiffs cannot bring a cumulative effects challenge to Louisiana's abortion laws, the Court concludes that such a challenge is allowed in the abortion context.

To examine laws in a vacuum, one at a time, without examining how they fit into \"a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   framework,\"\n   <em>\n    Casey,\n   </em>\n   at\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    505 U.S. at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , would allow the State to transform unconstitutional action into constitutional action by splitting the action into separate statutes or regulations. In other words, a state is not permitted to attack abortion providers in a death-by-a-thousand-cuts strategy, evading review by legislating in a piecemeal fashion. \"The inescapable fact is that adjudication of substantive due process claims may call upon the Court in interpreting the Constitution to exercise\n   that same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    at 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Having determined that a cumulative effects challenge is permissible, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded such a challenge. In the case of the twelve specific statutes that govern Doctor Plaintiffs and patients, the analysis is straightforward. Plaintiffs pleaded with specificity that the cumulative burden of the statutes outweigh their purported health benefits. For example, Plaintiffs claim that limiting the universe of those who can perform abortions is not medically justified. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 153, 195, 197). Plaintiffs further allege that the health information that they are required to provide patients includes misleading, inaccurate information-such as linking an increased risk of breast cancer to abortion-and that the recordkeeping requirements are unduly burdensome and invasive to their patients' privacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 155-57, 196-98). For these twelve enumerated statutes, Plaintiffs have pleaded that when the medical benefits are weighed against the burdens imposed, they create an undue burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the analysis is less straightforward concerning the challenge to OAFLL, the Court nonetheless concludes that, at the motion to dismiss stage, Clinic Plaintiff has adequately pleaded that OAFLL, as applied through regulations, imposes an undue burden on Clinic Plaintiff. OAFLL is the fountainhead from which the State's restrictions on Clinic Plaintiff flows. It is a broad grant of rulemaking authority to LDH, and establishes that Clinic Plaintiff must conform to those rules and regulations promulgated by LDH. Although Defendants argue that Clinic Plaintiff should be forced to specify each and every regulation challenged, even if it results in a \"2,000 page complaint,\" the Court concludes that Clinic Plaintiff has adequately pleaded its claim pursuant to Rule 8's requirement for \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Clinic Plaintiff alleges in detailed, specific ways how Louisiana has used the rulemaking authority conferred by OAFLL in a manner that imposes an undue burden on Clinic Plaintiff. For instance, Clinic Plaintiff claims that LDH's survey procedures \"are disproportionately time-consuming and expensive for [Clinic Plaintiff] compared to healthcare providers offering similar or higher risk procedures.\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 169-75). Clinic Plaintiff further insists that the State issues regulations without providing any time for Clinic Plaintiff to come into compliance with those regulations, rescinds and reissues regulations over short periods of time, and issues emergency regulations in the absence of an emergency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 56, 60-88). Clinic Plaintiff argues that these constantly shifting regulations have forced the closure of the majority of abortion clinics in the State, which has increased the burden on women seeking to avail themselves of a constitutionally protected action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 203-19). According to Plaintiffs, the burden the State places on abortion clinics through its exercise of rulemaking authority under OAFLL outweighs any health benefits conferred by the regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 92-94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In other words, Plaintiffs do not allege that every exercise of rulemaking authority under OAFLL has resulted in an undue burden; rather, Plaintiffs allege that the manner in which LDH implements OAFLL, which includes some onerous regulations that have minimal or no health benefits, has created an undue burden. Plaintiffs' argument is strengthened by the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   , which struck down a Texas law that mandated\n   abortion clinics follow all the regulations of surgical centers.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/#p2309\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the Supreme Court did not require the plaintiffs to parse which surgical center requirements were unduly burdensome and which were not; instead, it struck down the statute that imposed the regulations on abortion clinics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n    </em>\n    Burford\n    <em>\n     Abstention\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Alternatively, Defendants argue that the Court should decline to review the State's regulatory scheme based on the\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention doctrine. (Doc. 22-1 at pp. 10-11).\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention applies where \"the exercise of federal review of the question in a case and in similar cases would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Merkel v.

The Fifth Circuit has enumerated a five-factor test for\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention: \"(1) whether the cause of action arises under state or federal law, (2) whether the case requires inquiry into unsettled issues of state law, or into local facts, (3) the importance of the state interest involved, (4) the state's need for coherent policy in that area, and (5) the presence of a special state forum for judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Valley Elec. Membership Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6528376,10508773\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/311/\">\n    8 F.3d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314 (5th Cir. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention is inappropriate. Regarding the first factor, it is apparent from the face of the complaint that Clinic Plaintiff's substantive due process claim arises exclusively under federal law, and regarding the second factor, Clinic Plaintiffs claim is based on the application of Louisiana's existing abortion law, not an inquiry into unsettled areas of state law. Although under the third factor the State has an important interest in ensuring that abortions are performed safely and in demonstrating its respect for life, Clinic Plaintiff has a countervailing interest in ensuring that a woman's right to have an abortion is not unduly burdened by the State. Similarly, under the fourth factor, the State needs coherent health regulations, but the Court has an independent duty to examine whether those regulations place an undue burden on the right to an abortion. On the fifth factor, the parties disagree over whether a special state forum for judicial review exists. Defendants point to specific avenues for challenging state regulatory provisions. (Doc. 22-1 at p. 18) (citing La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 49:953(B)(1)(b)(3) ; 49:964(B); 40:2175(G) ). Clinic Plaintiff argues that it is not challenging a particular regulatory decision, but the entire regulatory scheme as applied to it. (Doc. 32 at p. 13). Accordingly, the Court finds that the\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   factors, on the whole, militate against abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The parties' disagreement about the final\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   factor illustrates a broader problem with Defendants' argument. Fundamentally, \"\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention is intended to avoid recurring and confusing federal intervention in an ongoing state scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6528376,10508773\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/311/\">\n    8 F.3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that is not what is at issue here. Clinic Plaintiff is challenging the constitutionality of the State's regulatory scheme, not an individual determination that arises from that\n   scheme. As the First Circuit explained when holding that\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   did not apply to a challenge of a state's abortion law, \"[i]f plaintiff succeeds, what will occur is not an ongoing intermeddling with the state [officials] but a prohibition of an unconstitutional process.\"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood League of Mass. v.

An analogy is instructive. Although a state certainly has a strong interest in creating a comprehensive scheme for gun licensing and ownership, that scheme would still be susceptible to a Second Amendment challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Clinic Plaintiff brings a procedural due process claim challenging La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 40:2175.6(G), which provides that the Secretary of LDH may revoke an license for a \"violation of any provision of [OAFLL], in violation of the licensing rules promulgated by [LDH], or in violation of any other state law or regulation.\" Revised Statutes \u00a7 40:2175.6(H) further empowers the Secretary of LDH to \"issue an immediate suspension of a license if an investigation or survey determines that the applicant or licensee is in violation of any provision [of OAFLL], in violation of the rules promulgated by [LDH], or in violation of any other federal or state law or regulation.\" Clinic Plaintiff argues that this broad grant of authority without notice and an opportunity to be heard before a neutral decision-maker before any action is taken violates its procedural due process rights.

Although Clinic Plaintiff's license was suspended for three weeks based on inspections conducted in 2010 and 2011, Clinic Plaintiff settled its claims arising out that suspension with the State in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 22-3). The State has taken no other adverse action against Clinic Plaintiff since that settlement. Clinic Plaintiff has therefore not alleged that any\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    imminent\n   </em>\n   threat to its license exists, such that its claim is ripe for adjudication.

(Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 227-28). Specifically, Plaintiffs claims that, as applied, Revised Statutes \u00a7 40:2175.6 permits unlimited warrantless inspections of abortion clinics without notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 104-05). Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have complete access to patients' confidential medical records without a warrant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 107). Plaintiffs point out that at least one federal circuit has held that abortion clinics are not subject to the closely regulated business exception because patients' \"expectation of privacy is\n   <em>\n    heightened\n   </em>\n   , given the fact that the clinic provides a service grounded in a fundamental constitutional liberty, and that all provision of medical services in private physicians' offices carries with it a high expectation of privacy for both physician and patient.\"\n   <em>\n    Tucson Woman's Clinic v.

La. 1980) (striking down a prior Louisiana law that mandated warrantless inspections of abortion clinics in part because of the \"history of respect towards the recognized need for privacy in the doctor-patient relationship\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants argue that abortion clinics are a closely regulated business that is susceptible to warrantless searches. (Doc. 22-1 at p. 23). Further, they claim that the statutes that authorize warrantless inspections provide adequate procedural safeguards that ensure \"the inspection program provides a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 26). Defendants insist that other statutes effectively protect patient information, which ameliorates Plaintiffs' concerns about patient privacy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants' arguments are unpersuasive because they primarily raise factual issues that have yet to be determined, rather than showing that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. To the contrary, Plaintiffs have pleaded a number of specific, factual allegations, which when assumed to be true, could render the searches unreasonable. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 105-07). The Court notes that it is not bound by the prior opinions in\n   <em>\n    Eden\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , but they are persuasive authority that make dismissal of Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim difficult at this stage, pending further factual findings concerning whether an abortion clinic is a closely regulated business. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
