INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants Diageo-Guinness, USA, Inc. and Diageo North America, Inc. make and market Guinness Extra Stout (\"Extra Stout\"), a form of beer, for distribution in the United States. Plaintiff Kieran O'Hara filed a putative class complaint alleging that he bought Extra Stout in part because defendants deceptively advertised that it was brewed at St. James's Gate brewery, Dublin, Ireland. Plaintiff alleges that Extra Stout was actually brewed in New Brunswick, Canada. Plaintiff alleges that he paid more for the beer than he would have if defendants had disclosed its origin. Plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint with seven claims, including unjust enrichment, misrepresentation, and unfair and deceptive practices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws Chapter 93A. Defendants have moved to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court is denying the motion with respect to Count I, alleging misrepresentation. It is also denying the motion with respect to Counts III and IV to the extent that they allege that statements on defendants' website violated Mass. Gen. Laws Chapter 93A. The Amended Complaint states plausible claims that these statements reasonably deceived plaintiff into buying and paying a price premium for Extra Stout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   However, the court is dismissing the Chapter 93A claims to the extent that they are based on the labels affixed to Extra Stout's bottles and packaging. The labels were approved by the Alcohol Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the \"TTB\") and, therefore, are entitled to safe harbor protection under Chapter 93A, \u00a7 3. It is also dismissing Count II, alleging unjust enrichment, because plaintiff has adequate remedies at law. In addition, plaintiff has not alleged any threatened injury to himself that could be prevented by prospective relief, and his claim for a declaratory judgment duplicates his claims for damages. Accordingly, the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are also being dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II.

Chapter 93A may apply to a broader category of misleading statements than common-law misrepresentation.
