SMITH, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court upon two motions by Defendant James Woods: (1) a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, filed June 7, 2017 (Doc. 7); and (2) a Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Motion for Dismissal, filed August 15, 2017 (Doc. 16). The motions are both fully briefed and ripe for disposition. For the following reasons, Woods's Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Motion for Dismissal is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and Woods's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts occurred against the backdrop of the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign. The parties are Plaintiff Portia Boulger, \"a very active volunteer and pledged convention delegate for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (D-Vt)\" for the Democratic Party's nomination, and Defendant James Woods, \"a well-known movie actor and producer who has appeared in a number of films including\n   <em>\n    The Way We Were, The Onion Field,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Once Upon a Time in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    America\n   </em>\n   .\" (Doc. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On Friday, March 11, 2016, the campaign of Donald J. Trump, then a candidate for the Republican nomination for President, held a rally in Chicago, Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). That evening, the Chicago Tribune newspaper posted on its Twitter account a photograph of a woman at the rally, wearing a Trump T-shirt, and \"giving a Nazi salute-the well-known 'Heil Hitler' salute with her right hand raised straight up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). On Saturday, March 12, the Twitter user @voxday posted the\n   photograph, together with a photograph of Boulger and caption identifying Boulger as \"Organizer (Women for Bernie).\" (Doc. 7, PAGEID # 61, screenshot). The two photographs and caption were accompanied by the (false) statement, \"The 'trump Nazi' is Portia Boulger, who runs the Women for Bernie Sanders Twitter account. It's another media plant.' \" (Doc. 7, PAGEID # 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Within minutes of @voxday's tweet, Defendant James H. Woods tweeted the same two photographs and caption along with the comment, \"So-called #Trump 'Nazi' is a #BernieSanders agitator/operative?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; Doc. 9-1, screenshot). Woods's Twitter account has more than 350,000 followers and the tweet in question was re-tweeted more than 5,000 times, including by Mr. Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr. (Doc. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later that same Saturday, the woman who gave the salute at the rally was correctly identified by various newspapers and twitter users as Birgitt Peterson of Yorkville, Illinois. (Doc. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17-18). Woods then tweeted, still on that same Saturday, that \"Various followers have stated that the Nazi Salute individual and the #Bernie campaign woman are NOT the same person. #Chicago #Trump.\" (Doc. 7, PAGEID #62, screenshot). However, Woods did not delete his earlier tweet containing the photographs of Peterson and Boulger. (Doc. 1, Compl. \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 22, 2016, counsel for Boulger wrote to counsel for Woods, requesting that Woods delete the tweet and issue, through Twitter, a retraction and apology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). Woods's counsel denied that the tweet was defamatory but asked Woods to delete the tweet, which he did on March 22, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22). On March 23, 2016, Boulger's counsel again contacted Woods counsel and demanded a public retraction and apology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). On March 23, 2016, Woods posted three new tweets:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (i) \"I have an opportunity to clarify something I challenged immediately when it hit Twitter. Portia A. Boulger was NOT the 'Nazi salute lady.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (ii) \"Ms. Boulder [sic] has reached out to me and asked me to use my many followers to stop people from harassing her. I am more than happy to do so.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (iii) \"Though she supports @BernieSanders, I am happy to defend her from abuse. I only wish his supporters would do the same for other candidates.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During the period from March 12-March 23, 2016, while Woods' tweet remained posted on his Twitter account, Boulger received hundreds of obscene and threatening messages, including death threats. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26). Boulger has also received telephone calls at her residence, continuing through the time she filed her Complaint, from callers who hung up when the phone was answered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Boulger filed her Complaint against Woods on March 3, 2017, asserting two claims:defamation and invasion of privacy. (Doc. 1). On June 1, 2017, Boulger filed a motion for extension of time to complete service of process on Woods, as the 90 days for completion of service allowed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) was about to expire. (Doc. 4). Boulger described in her motion the efforts her counsel had undertaken in attempting to serve Woods:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 On March 8, 2017, Boulger's counsel contacted Michael Weinstein, the lawyer who had acted for Woods\n   when Boulger's counsel requested a retraction of and apology for the March 12, 2016 tweet. Boulger's counsel asked Weinstein whether he would accept service of the summons and complaint on behalf of Woods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 On March 15, 2017, Weinstein responded by stating he was not authorized to accept service and was not sure what lawyer would be defending the case; but that \"if I am ultimately retained for the case, I'll be able to address it with you then.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 4-3, email exchanges).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Boulger's counsel used the database service PeopleFinder to attempt to find an address for Woods in Los Angeles. The database returned a last known address for Woods on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California. On March 23, 2017, Boulger's counsel mailed a copy of the Summons, Complaint, Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive Service, two copies of the Waiver of Service form and a self-addressed stamped envelope to the Wilshire Boulevard address. That package was returned marked \"Addressee Unknown.\" (Doc. 4 at 4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 On April 12, 2017, Weinstein confirmed that he had not been retained by Woods in this matter and was not authorized to accept service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 4-3, email exchanges).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Also on April 12, 2017, Patrick Kasson contacted Boulger's counsel by telephone, stating that he had been retained to represent Woods in this matter. Kasson asked Boulger's counsel to send him the Complaint, Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive Service, and the Waiver of Service form. Boulger's counsel provided all of these documents to Kasson that same day via email. (Doc. 4 at 4; Doc. 4-5, email exchanges).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 On April 13, 2017, Kasson emailed Boulger's counsel and stated that he had not agreed to accept service on behalf of Woods as \"I am not authorized to do that yet. I asked that you send over a waiver form.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Boulger's counsel followed up with Kasson via email on April 24, 2017, but received no response. (Doc. 4 at 5).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 On May 8, Boulger's counsel spoke with Kasson on the phone, and Kasson stated that Woods had not authorized him to accept service. Boulger asserts, but Woods denies, that Kasson stated during this phone call that he would try to talk Woods out of his refusal to authorize acceptance of service in the next few days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 20, Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 9).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 On May 25, 2017, Boulger's counsel spoke with Kasson on the phone. Kasson stated that Woods would not authorize Kasson to accept service; that Woods planned to file an answer and motion for judgment on the pleadings; and that Woods would raise the defense of insufficient service in the answer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 On May 30, 2017, Boulger's counsel spoke with Kasson on the phone again. Kasson stated that Woods would not oppose Boulger's motion for an extension of time to complete service, and that Kasson did not have a valid address for Woods to which a waiver request could be sent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court granted Boulger's request for an extension of time on June 6 and ordered that she complete service on Woods no later than August 7, 2017. (Doc. 5). The following day, June 7, 2017, Woods filed an Answer to the Complaint (including affirmative defenses of insufficient service of\n   process and lack of personal jurisdiction) and a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (arguing that Boulger's allegations failed to state a viable claim for either defamation or invasion of privacy because Woods's tweet was not a statement of fact). (Docs. 6-7). The parties also jointly filed a Rule 26(f) report on July 11, 2017, which stated that \"Defendant Woods has not been served. In addition, Defendant Woods contests personal jurisdiction. Plaintiff contends that Defendant has waived lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficient service by failing to include it in his Rule 12 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\" (Doc. 12 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 15, 2017, eight days after Boulger's extended time to complete service expired, Woods filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Motion for Dismissal due to Boulger's failure to perfect service within the time permitted by the Court. (Doc. 16). Boulger asserts that Woods has waived his defenses of insufficient service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction by failing to raise those defenses in his previous Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings under Rule 12(c). (Doc. 19). The Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings have now been fully briefed and are ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although Woods's second motion is styled as a \"Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Motion for Dismissal,\" its substance is clearly that of a motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5). The Sixth Circuit has noted that summary judgment is an \"improper\" vehicle to challenge service of process \"because the defense 'involves a matter in abatement and does not go to the merits of the action.' \"\n   <em>\n    King v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523346\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/650/\">\n    694 F.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657 n.2 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Pa. 1971) ). \"Nevertheless, when the defense has been preserved in an answer and is later raised in a pre-trial motion, a court will look past the label chosen by the movant and treat the motion as a request for a ruling on the defense made under ... Rule 12(i).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3580291\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/335/95/#p101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the basis for Woods's summary judgment motion is not that he is entitled to judgment on the merits, but that Plaintiff's failure to perfect service deprives this Court of jurisdiction over Woods's person, the Court will construe the motion as seeking dismissal under Rule 12(b)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Without proper service of process, consent, waiver, or forfeiture, a court may not exercise personal jurisdiction over a named defendant.\n   <em>\n    Murphy Bros., Inc. v.

If the Plaintiff fails to do so, Rule 12(b)(5) allows the defendant to seek dismissal by motion. Because the pleadings themselves will typically shed no light on service issues, motions to dismiss need not be treated as motions for summary judgment even if they are supported by affidavits or other evidence outside the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Fed.%20Appx.%20285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(Doc. 19, Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. at 8). Nor has Boulger documented or described any efforts taken by her or her counsel to serve Woods since the time the extension was granted. The Court would be inclined to nevertheless find that Boulger has shown good cause for failure to complete service due to the actions of Woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It certainly appears that Woods is fully aware of the lawsuit, has retained a lawyer to represent him in this matter, has received a copy of the Complaint (as evidenced by his responding Answer), and is willing to engage with the substance of the allegations (as evidenced by his Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings seeking a decision on the merits). His simultaneous refusal to waive service, to authorize his lawyer to accept service, or to provide his lawyer with an address where he may be served smacks of intentional evasion, a well-settled ground for denying dismissal under Rule 12(b)(5).\n   <em>\n    Friedman v.

Boulger argues that regardless of her efforts, Woods has waived the defenses of insufficient service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction as provided by Rule 12(g)-(h) by failing to raise those defenses in his earlier Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings under Rule 12(c).

Boulger contends that Woods filed a motion under Rule 12-his Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings under Rule 12(c) -and failed to raise in that motion the defense of insufficient service of process or lack of personal jurisdiction; therefore he has forever waived those defenses.

(Doc. 16, Mot. for Summ. J. at 4). Because his Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings followed the filing of his Answer to the Complaint, Woods contends the waiver rules in Rules 12(g)(2) and 12(h)(1) do not apply to him.

Rule 12(g)(2)'s prohibition on successive motions applies \"except as provided in Rule 12(h)(2).\" Rule 12(h)(2) provides that \"[f]ailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted ... may be raised by a motion under Rule 12(c).\" Reading Rule 12(g)(2) and Rule 12(h)(2) together thus results in the unremarkable conclusion that a party may file a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings at a later stage in the litigation, even if the party has filed a previous motion under Rule 12. That is, Rule 12(c) motions are excepted from the bar against successive motions when the Rule 12(c) motion is the\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   motion, not the first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This exception is consistent with the \"[t]he obvious purpose of Rule 12(c) [ ] to save time and expense in cases wherein the ultimate facts are not in dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Ulen Contracting Corp. v.

Importantly, the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings asks the Court to render a decision on the merits of the lawsuit.

First, Woods was under no obligation to file either a motion or a responsive pleading at the time that he did so. His time to respond to the Complaint would have begun to run only once service\n   of process was completed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a). The Court had just granted Boulger an additional 60 days to complete service the day before Woods filed his Answer and Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. As he would have forfeited nothing by waiting for Boulger to complete service, his reason for filing the Answer and Motion could only be that he desired an early resolution of this case on the merits and was willing to submit to this Court's jurisdiction in order to achieve that early resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second, Woods has not substantively challenged this Court's jurisdiction over his person. That is, he has given no indication that he would hold a valid personal jurisdiction defense if Boulger had completed service within the time permitted by the Court. His only basis for objecting to personal jurisdiction is the failure of service. (Doc. 20, Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 5) (noting that Boulger's \"failure to properly serve Mr. Woods triggers Mr. Woods' lack of personal jurisdiction defense\"). His challenge to personal jurisdiction is therefore is \"not of a constitutional dimension\" and may be waived more easily. Waiver of Certain Defenses- Rule 12(h)(1), 5C Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc.

Thus, the Court \"must examine the type of article and its placement in the newspaper and how those factors would influence the reader's viewpoint on the question of fact or opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=496%20N.E.2d%20699\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Traditionally, the \"general context\" of the statement comprises the content of the \"entire work at issue,\" while the \"broader context\" is \"the publication in which the work appears.\"\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273210\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/21/879/#p884\">\n    21 F.Supp.3d at 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, Ohio law indicates that \"courts should assess 'the entire article or column' because 'unchallenged language surrounding the allegedly defamatory statement will influence the average reader's readiness to infer that a particular statement has factual content.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wampler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"248508\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/93/111/#p127\">\n    93 Ohio St.3d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20N.E.2d%20962\">\n    752 N.E.2d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ollman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"628946,3805683\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/750/970/\">\n    750 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   979 ). These concepts are easy to apply to articles appearing in newspapers or magazines, the most common setting for defamation claims. Woods's tweet, however, does not map neatly onto a passage from a newspaper article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Woods suggests that the general context should be defined as \"Mr. Woods' Tweets on March 12, 2016, concerning Plaintiff\" and the broader context should comprise both Woods's Twitter account as a whole as well as the entire Twitter social media platform. (Doc. 7, Mot. for J. on the Pleadings at 8-10). Boulger argues that the general context should be defined as Woods' Twitter account as a whole, and that the broader context is again the entire Twitter social media platform. (Doc. 9, Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for J. on the Pleadings at 13-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court has trouble adopting either of these approaches, however, because the nature of a \"tweet\" is fundamentally different from a statement appearing in the context of a longer written work, which itself appears in the context of a publication containing multiple written works.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each tweet, at the time in question, was limited in length to 140 characters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is generally sufficient space to express a single coherent thought, but almost certainly insufficient to surround that thought with context and nuance. As each tweet is typically a complete, independent publication, there is no \"general context\" in the sense provided by the balance of a newspaper or magazine article in which an allegedly defamatory statement appears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, most Twitter users do not sit down and read an entire Twitter account in chronological order. More likely, each reader has a feed of Twitter accounts that is updated whenever one of the (perhaps large number of) accounts they follow posts a new tweet. The Twitter feed of a typical user therefore comprises a constantly changing, disjointed series of brief messages on multiple topics by multiple authors. Most users would not see all of Woods's tweets, nor even all of his tweets pertaining to Boulger on March 12, 2016, in one place or at one time. While we can logically presume that a reader of a defamatory statement in a newspaper article has read the entire article in which the statement appears, we can make no analogous presumption that a reader of Woods's tweet regarding Boulger has read any other specific tweet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the other tweets\n   in Woods's account are unlikely to provide the same kind of context that the surrounding language in a newspaper article would.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   A further difficulty with Twitter accounts is that each is unique in tone and content. Many established news reporting outlets maintain Twitter accounts for the very purpose of reporting the news. An individual Twitter user may use his or her account to bring attention to particular facts and news stories; another, to share personal opinions about those new stories; another, to engage in political satire; another, to post personal anecdotes; and so on. Others may engage in a combination of these activities. As a result, a reader cannot tell anything about whether a particular Twitter account is likely to contain reporting on facts, versus personal opinion or rhetorical questions, from the mere fact that the author uses of Twitter as his or her preferred communication medium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   But the Court must still analyze whatever surrounding circumstances are available to the reader to evaluate whether a tweet presents an assertion of fact, even if they do not precisely correspond to the framework developed for newspapers and magazines. So what contextual information\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   available to a typical reader of Woods's tweet? For one, the author of the tweet is identified as \"James Woods,\" with twitter username \"@RealJamesWoods,\" and with a headshot of Woods as the account's profile picture. (Doc. 9-1, screenshot). The Ohio Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he author's reputation\" should be considered in evaluating the context of an allegedly defamatory statement.\n   <em>\n    Vail v. The Plain Dealer Publ'g Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1737289\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/72/279/#p282\">\n    72 Ohio St. 3d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20N.E.2d%20182\">\n    649 N.E.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). In\n   <em>\n    Vail\n   </em>\n   , the author's reputation as \"an opinionated columnist\" weighed in favor of classifying the statement in question as opinion rather than a statement of fact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20N.E.2d%20182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As Boulger acknowledged in her complaint, Woods is \"a well-known movie actor and producer.\" (Doc. 1, Compl. \u00b6 2). As a well-known actor and producer, Woods likely has a reputation among his readers. Unfortunately, there is no evidence in the pleadings as to Woods's reputation that would assist the Court. Woods asserts that a personal Twitter account, such as his, is unlikely to be \"normally engaged in the business of factual reporting or news dissemination.\" (Doc. 7, Mot. for J. on the Pleadings at 10) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wampler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"248508\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/93/111/#p127\">\n    93 Ohio St.3d at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20N.E.2d%20962\">\n    752 N.E.2d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But as discussed above, personal Twitter accounts can be used for all sorts of purposes, including news dissemination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Additionally, the tweet concerned and was posted during a highly-contentious political campaign for U.S. president. The Ohio Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Vail\n   </em>\n   that the allegedly defamatory statement in question was published \"in the midst of a political campaign, which provided the subject for the column.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1737289\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/72/279/#p282\">\n    72 Ohio St. 3d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20N.E.2d%20182\">\n    649 N.E.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Woods argues that this statement from\n   <em>\n    Vail\n   </em>\n   weighs against his tweet being an assertion of fact. But this cannot be\n   <em>\n    Vail\n   </em>\n   's logical implication, and the Court does not read\n   <em>\n    Vail\n   </em>\n   to suggest as much. True, political campaigns give rise to much opinion and rhetoric, but they also give rise to much factual reporting and news dissemination. That a statement was made about and published during a political campaign\n   cannot by itself be evidence that the statement is or is not an assertion of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In sum, the Court is unable to clearly define the parameters of the \"general\" or \"broader\" context of an allegedly defamatory statement made on Twitter. The Court is also unable to say that the general or broader context of Woods's tweet weighs either for or against classifying the tweet as a statement of fact. But given that the first two factors were both answered in the negative, the Court finds that the totality of the circumstances dictate that at least some reasonable readers of Woods's tweet would interpret it as a question and not a statement of fact. Therefore, under Ohio's innocent construction rule, Woods's tweet is protected by the Ohio Constitution and is not actionable.\n   <em>\n    Bentkowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197570\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/689/#p693\">\n    637 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Woods challenges both elements by arguing that (a) Woods's tweet would not place Boulger in a highly offensive light, and (b) Woods's tweet was a question incapable of verification and therefore could not place Boulger in a \"false\" light.

Even positing the possibility that Boulger was pictured giving the Nazi salute at the Trump rally in Chicago comes close to directly accusing her of\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   making this hideous gesture in an effort to associate herself with the Nazi movement, falsely, in order to make it seem as if Nazi sympathizers had attempted a Trump rally.

Woods's contention that a reasonable person would not be highly offended by even the mere suggestion that one had engaged in such conduct (even absent a direct accusation) is disingenuous at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   However, as noted by the\n   <em>\n    Welling\n   </em>\n   court, \"[f]alse-light defendants enjoy protections at least as extensive as defamation defendants\" and the elements of the claim \"make a false-light claim difficult to prove.\"\n   <em>\n    Welling,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58, 51. And, just as with Bougler's claim for defamation, her claim for false light invasion of privacy requires Woods to have made a false statement of fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52;\n   <em>\n    Roe ex rel.
