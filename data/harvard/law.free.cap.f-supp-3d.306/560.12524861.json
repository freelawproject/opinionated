(collectively, \"Defendants\"), arises out of an alleged scheme to sell stolen Jasper Johns artwork to unsuspecting buyers. (Compl., ECF No. 1, at 1, 6.) Plaintiff asserts federal claims against all Defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   as well as claims for fraud, breach of warranty, and unilateral mistake, for allegedly selling to Plaintiff one such painting stolen from Johns' art studio by his longtime studio assistant, James Meyer. (Compl. \u00b6 1, 103-265.) Defendants move to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. (Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 21; Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Defs.' Mem.\"), ECF No. 23, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim for breach of warranty and DENIED in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Since its incorporation in 1976, Defendant Fred Dorfman, Inc., which is solely owned and operated by Defendant Fred Dorfman, has been recognized in the fine-art community for its expertise in presenting contemporary artists to a wide audience of collectors, galleries, and dealers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) According to Plaintiff, however, more recently it has been involved in a criminal racketeering scheme\n   to sell nearly forty pieces of art stolen from renowned contemporary artist Jasper Johns' studio by one of Johns' longtime and trusted studio assistants, James Meyer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For many years, Jasper Johns has maintained an art studio in Sharon, Connecticut. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) In 1985, James Meyer became one of Johns' studio assistants. In that position, he helped Johns create artworks and assisted with various administrative and record-keeping tasks. By virtue of his role as studio assistant, Meyer had unfettered access to the studio and its books and records, including a ledger that contained a description and inventory number for each of Johns' completed artworks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) He also had access to Johns' unfinished works and was responsible for maintaining a file drawer holding such works and others that Johns' had not yet authorized to be placed into the art market. In addition, Meyer was responsible for destroying pieces that Johns was not satisfied with or otherwise did not want included among his body of finished works. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) In the 1990s, however, Meyer began stealing artwork from the studio, taking drawings that Johns had wanted discarded-sometimes straight from the trash-as well as some of Johns' unfinished works. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sometime in 2003, Meyer and Fred Dorfman were introduced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the next three years, Dorfman embarked on a campaign to convince Meyer to allow him to represent the latter as an independent artist. What Meyer did not know, however, was that Dorfman never intended to represent him or his interests, but rather sought only to use him to gain access to Jasper Johns' artwork. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) Indeed, from 2003 through 2006, other than two pieces that he bought for himself, Dorfman never sold any of Meyer's art to any other galleries or collectors. Instead, Dorfman repeatedly asked Meyer if he had access to Johns' discarded and/or unfinished works and pressured him to obtain as many of them as he could so that the pair could sell them for profit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) In or about the fall of 2006, Meyer finally acquiesced and began delivering discarded and unfinished artwork from Johns' studio-some of which he had already previously stolen-to Dorfman to sell to his contacts in the art world. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The alleged scheme was well planned and carefully executed to ensure its longevity. For instance, to convince prospective buyers that the stolen works were authentic, that Meyer had good title, and that Johns had authorized their sale, Dorfman had affidavits prepared for Meyer's signature attesting that Johns had given him the various works as gifts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Dorfman also provided counterfeit labels that were sometimes affixed to the back of stolen artwork to create the impression that their sale had been authorized by Johns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 159, 224-25.) Through his business entities, Dorfman also provided written assurances to prospective buyers certifying, falsely, that the purchased artworks would be included in the Jasper Johns catalogue raisonne and recorded in his studio archives when they were prepared.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) In some instances,\n   Dorfman even provided buyers with false records, including fictitiously-assigned inventory numbers so as to give the appearance that the artworks were finished and authorized for sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition, Meyer sometimes fabricated other documents purportedly taken from the studio's ledger of registered artworks, describing the artwork, listing its fictitious inventory number, and stating falsely that the work had been gifted to Meyer. On occasion, Meyer even placed these fake pages into the ledger, photographed them in that setting, and then provided them to Dorfman so that they could be transmitted to prospective buyers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Further, and to ensure that Johns never learned of the scheme, Dorfman imposed confidentiality and re-sale restrictions prohibiting buyers from disclosing the sale, including by reselling, exhibiting, or loaning the works to others for at least eight years following the sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In mid-December 2007, Dorfman, by and through his business entities, contacted an art adviser seeking prospective buyers for a particular piece of stolen Jasper Johns artwork.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As with all the other stolen Johns artwork that Dorfman sold, he represented to the art adviser that Johns had gifted the piece to Meyer. According to the complaint, even though he was speaking with the art advisor, Dorfman knew that the art advisor was working on behalf of Plaintiff, a prospective buyer. Plaintiff is an art gallery located in Vancouver, British Columbia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 59-60.) Dorfman provided the art advisor with images and additional details about the work, who in turn shared them with Plaintiff. The art adviser also helped Plaintiff negotiate and consummate the sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Despite it being an authentic Jasper Johns painting, even containing his signature, Plaintiff asserts that it would have never bought the painting had it known the truth of its provenance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As with all the other stolen Johns paintings he sold, Dorfman had an affidavit prepared attesting to Meyer's ownership of the artwork and its authenticity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Meyer executed the affidavit on January 11, 2008, and had it notarized by Dorfman's wife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.) On or about the same date, a separate confidentiality agreement was drafted for Plaintiff's signature, requiring Plaintiff to \"keep the Artwork private and ... not sell or loan the Drawings to anyone or any institution within the first ten (10) years of his ownership.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) Plaintiff accepted the terms of the sale and on January 15, 2008, was invoiced a bill for $800,000 to purchase the Johns artwork.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67, 69, 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the sale to Plaintiff, Dorfman and his business entities sold at least another fourteen stolen Johns artworks to unsuspecting purchasers. In doing so, Dorfman continued assuring prospective buyers that the artworks were given to Meyer as gifts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-80.) For instance, on January 20, 2010, Dorfman forwarded an email (the \"January 20, 2010 email\") from Meyer to the same art adviser who connected Dorfman with Plaintiff, indicating the stolen works \"were given\" to\n   Meyer. On February 2, 2010, Dorfman forwarded another email to the art advisor from Dorfman's wife (the \"February 2, 2010 email\") providing additional information about the Johns artworks, and indicating that the art advisor has \"no reason to believe that the work is anything but in [Meyer's] rightful possession.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82.) The February 2, 2010 email went on to confirm that the stolen artwork \"was a gift from Jasper\" and that the art adviser can \"justifiably rely on [Meyer's] sworn statement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) Later, in September 2011, Dorfman drafted a false certification \"to be shared with Plaintiff,\" which indicated that the artwork it purchased would be included in Johns' catalogue raisonne and recorded in his studio's archives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Where necessary, Meyer and Dorfman took other steps to conceal their scheme and ensure its survival. For instance, in January 2010, one victim sent an image to Jasper Johns' studio of a piece that it purchased from Dorfman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.) Meyer promptly contacted Dorfman and sought his assistance in having the artwork returned to the studio. To cover their tracks, Meyer asked Dorfman to \"wipe\" it with \"glass cleaner\" to eliminate fingerprints and send it \"with no return information\" so its origin could not be traced. Dorfman acquiesced, responding to Meyer as follows: \"Tell me exactly what you want and how you want it and [y]ou will get it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In total, of the eighty-three individual pieces Meyer stole from Johns' studio, forty-two were provided to Dorfman, of which thirty-seven were sold for a profit exceeding $9 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) As the mastermind behind the scheme, Dorfman and his business entities pocketed almost two-thirds of the profits, or approximately $5.99 million. Eventually, however, the fraud was discovered and in August 2013, Meyer was indicted by a federal grand jury sitting in this District and charged with one count of transporting stolen property across state lines and one count of wire fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. B.) In June 2014, he pled guilty to the interstate transportation of stolen property and was sentenced to an eighteen-month term of imprisonment and two years of supervised release. He was also ordered to pay restitution to the victims, including Jasper Johns. According to Plaintiff, the artwork it purchased from Dorfman in January 2008,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the one at issue in this case, was identified in the order of restitution as one of the stolen Johns artworks. (Compl. \u00b6 90;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. D.) Dorfman was never indicted or otherwise charged with any criminal wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under an October 17, 2016 assignment agreement, the art advisor who purchased the stolen artwork for Plaintiff assigned to the latter all claims it had against Dorfman and his business entities arising out of the sale of the stolen artwork, including its rights under a statute of limitations tolling agreement it entered into with Defendants in July 2015. Under the July 2015 tolling agreement, Defendants agreed that the time period beginning on August 1, 2012, until August 1, 2016, would not be included in computing the relevant statute of limitations for any claim by the art advisor or any of its transferees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93, 100.) This action followed on January 11, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff asserts federal claims against Dorfman and his business entities for violating and conspiring to violate the RICO Act, as well as state law claims for fraud, breach of warranty, and unilateral mistake. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103-265.) In particular, Plaintiff charges Defendants with engaging in numerous predicate acts of racketeering activity, including transporting stolen goods, mail fraud, wire fraud, and trafficking\n   in counterfeit labels with respect to works of visual art. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 167-229.) Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, rescission of the sale, treble damages and attorneys' fees under RICO, and punitive damages.

Plaintiff has therefore adequately alleged that Dorfman and Meyer engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that an association-in-fact enterprise existed consisting of Meyer, Dorfman, and Dorfman's business entities. Plaintiff alleges that Meyer and Dorfman shared a common purpose and goal of selling stolen art for profit. It has also alleged and articulated with sufficient detail the nature of the relationships between Meyer, Dorfman, Dorfman's entities, and the enterprise. In particular, Plaintiff alleges that Meyer was responsible for providing the stolen artwork and signing affidavits as to their \"authenticity,\" while Dorfman, by and through his business entities-the name, reputation and resources of which were critical to enabling the enterprise to succeed-would present those works to interested buyers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De Sole v.

Finally, Plaintiff has alleged that the enterprise had sufficient longevity-over six years-to permit its associates, Meyer and Dorfman, to pursue the enterprise's purpose of selling stolen Jasper Johns artwork to unsuspecting buyers. Indeed, in January 2010, when it appeared that they were at risk of being caught, Meyer and Dorfman joined forces to conceal their scheme and ensure the enterprise's survival.

(Pl.'s Mem. at 23.) In particular, Plaintiff claims it was lulled into inaction by: (1) the purchase agreement's confidentiality clause; (2) the January 20, 2010 email from Meyer indicating that the artworks were \"given\" to him; (3) the February 2, 2010 email from Dorfman's wife indicating that the artwork was a gift from Jasper; and (4) the September 2011 certification that the sold artwork would be included in the Jasper Johns' catalogue raisonne.

Equitable tolling is appropriate, however, only where the alleged misconduct comes\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   -and is entirely\n   <em>\n    distinct from\n   </em>\n   -the events giving rise to the underlying claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corsello,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719503\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/777/\">\n    944 N.Y.S.2d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5719503\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/777/\">\n    967 N.E.2d at 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Defendants are a highly esteemed art gallery and, at the time of the sale, Meyer, the purported seller, held himself out both as having good title and as Jasper Johns' aide for twenty-four years; under these circumstances, it is by no means clear how or why Plaintiff should have suspected that the sale was not legitimate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Further, Meyer's claim of good title to the artwork is certainly a matter uniquely within his knowledge and one which presented few viable options for ascertaining its truth. To be sure, Plaintiff does not allege that it ever tried to contact Meyer to verify his claims, but doing so would likely have been seen as unnecessary in light of the affidavit he provided. Moreover, requiring Plaintiff to have reached out to Jasper Johns himself to ascertain the artwork's authenticity and verify Meyer's title to it seems both unduly burdensome and impractical, not to mention in contravention of accepted industry norms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joseph P.

Plaintiff, however, alleges that it reasonably relied on Meyer's affidavit, which Defendants prepared and provided to the art advisor, because it lacked adequate means of verifying Meyer's assertions since the fact that the artwork was stolen was known only to Meyer-the purported owner-and Dorfman. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75, 103, 106, 111.) In addition, Plaintiff alleges that because the artwork was in fact created by Jasper Johns, and because it is common for artists to baiter or gift works to their aides, it was reasonable to believe the work was authentic and that Meyer held good title. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62, 74.) Whether Plaintiff engaged in particular \"diligence procedures,\" as Defendants characterize them, is beside the point; all Plaintiff must show is that its reliance was reasonable, which it may do without explaining the precise nature and extent, if any, of its due diligence. Ultimately, whether Plaintiff's reliance was reasonable remains a question for the trier of fact to decide after weighing all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     PLAINTIFF'S DEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, Defendants ask this Court to strike Plaintiff's demand for punitive damages since \"[t]he simple misrepresentation of a piece of artwork's provenance, whether intentional or unintentional, is not an extraordinary act that should subject a defendant to punitive damages.\" (Defs.
