However, CMS did not limit its consideration of Wills Eye's application to any single factor. Instead, noting that the parties did not dispute any of the material facts, it considered \"the history, current operations, staffing, location, and other facts and circumstances\" regarding Will Eye's facility. AR 3, 27, 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For instance, the agency considered that, since 2002, Wills Eye's facility at 840 Walnut Street has participated in the Medicare program as an Ambulatory Surgical Center (\"ASC\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 14, which by definition is an entity \"that operates exclusively for the purpose of providing surgical services to patients not requiring hospitalization and in which the expected duration of services would not exceed 24 hours following an admission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.2\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Wills Eye performed approximately 8,400 outpatient surgeries per year at the facility,\n   and more than 95% of the procedures during the period from July 2011 to June 2012 were done on an outpatient basis. AR 17, 40-41, 940, 1050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Then, in 2013, after completing certain renovations and adding four inpatient beds to this facility, Wills Eye applied to change its Medicare participation from an ASC to a hospital. AR 14. In its application, Wills Eye stated that there would be 112 employees, including forty-five registered nurses. AR 40, 995, 1049. However, as the agency noted, Wills Eye did not attempt to show a greater role for inpatient services by proffering any contrary evidence as to the facility's \"long focus on ASC services, its inpatient/outpatient ratio, its minimal number of inpatient beds, and its relative staffing,\" or the facility's square footage, operating costs, or revenues. AR 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In its consideration, the agency determined that the statutory requirement that a facility be \"primarily engaged\" in providing specified services to inpatients \"cannot be satisfied when treatment of a significant number of inpatients is not taking place or when the actual operations do not show inpatient services are the focus of the ongoing business concerns.\" AR 34. Rather than providing contrary evidence, Wills Eye argued that it should be allowed to receive the higher level of payments that hospitals receive under Medicare for inpatient services, rather than the lower level of payments available under the ASC fee schedule, because of the highly specialized and complex nature of the services that Wills Eye's facility provides. AR 15-16, 50;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 45-46, 50-51. Further, Wills Eye has conceded that \"the vast majority of its services do not require inpatient hospitalization.\" AR 3, 17. Moreover, Wills Eye has not established, or even contended, that CMS had \"overlooked some critical factor\" as to whether the facility was primarily focused on inpatient care. AR 43, 47.

However, the Secretary has not actually adopted such a \"test.\" Although the Secretary does consider comparative volume, it is only one factor in the evaluation, and is not dispositive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CMS,\n   <em>\n    Survey &amp; Certification Memorandum S &amp; C-08-08\n   </em>\n   , (Jan. 11, 2008), HHS,\n   <em>\n    Final Report to the Congress and Strategic and Implementing Plan Required under Section 5006 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005\n   </em>\n   , 79.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, as explained below, the Secretary's consideration of comparative inpatient and outpatient volume is not subject to the notice and comment requirements of either the APA or the Medicare Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Notice and Comment under the APA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The comparative volume factor is, at most, an interpretive rule, for which notice and comment procedures are not required under the APA.\n   <em>\n    Beazer E., Inc. v.

The comparative volume consideration does not itself alter the applicable legal standards. Rather, it merely provides CMS and regulated parties, such as Wills Eye, with some form of guidance as to how the legal standards are applied, and the agency maintains the same authority to grant or deny applications as it would without a stated public policy. Accordingly, the comparative volume consideration changes neither the legal standards that govern hospitals, nor the legal standards that govern the Secretary, and thus does not \"alter\" legal rights.

As discussed previously, the comparative volume consideration is not a hardline numerical test, but instead is one consideration in the Secretary's holistic review.

For instance, in 2005, the Secretary publically commented that specialty hospitals that do not primarily provide care to inpatients do not qualify as hospitals. Specifically, the Secretary stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [S]ome entities providing specialty care may concentrate primarily on outpatient care and thus may not qualify as hospitals.... In order to be a hospital, an institution must, among other things, be primarily engaged in furnishing services to inpatients....

This is problematic from CMS's perspective, however, since the Medicare program defines a \"hospital\" as an entity that provides care \"primarily\" to inpatients. To the extent that such a facility is not, in fact, primarily providing care to inpatients, it is inappropriately categorized as a hospital and should not be treated as one under the Medicare program....

Yet, the agency cautioned that \"the 51% test may not be dispositive in all cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It further warned that \"we consider the burden of proof (to demonstrate that inpatient care is the primary health care services) to reside with the applicant, and consider that burden to increase substantially as\n   the ratio of inpatient to other beds increases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, while the Secretary does consider whether a hospital is providing a majority of its services to inpatients, that numerical consideration is not dispositive. Rather, it is merely one factor considered by CMS, and the agency will consider other relevant and persuasive data, including that presented by the applicant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Such data considered would include \"the history, current operations, staffing, location, and other facts and circumstances\" regarding the applicant's facility.

Accordingly, Wills Eye, acting in good faith, would have been able to determine, with \"ascertainable certainty,\" that the Secretary's review of its application would strongly focus on how much inpatient care Wills Eye provided, and how many inpatient beds Wills Eye had.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arlen Specter '96\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085624\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/150/797/#p812\">\n    150 F.Supp.2d at 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gen.

Similarly, Wills Eye was on notice that the agency would also consider factors such as \"the history, current operations, staffing, location, and other facts and circumstances,\" as it did here. AR 3, 27, 43. Therefore, Wills Eye had notice of both the standard for \"primarily engaged\" and how it was applied, i.e., holistically and case-by-case. Thus, there was no Fair Notice violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
