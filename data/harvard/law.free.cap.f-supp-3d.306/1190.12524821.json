City of Sunnyvale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011538\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/991/#p994\">\n    779 F.3d 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 994 (9th Cir. 2015). In effect, Californians were allowed to keep large capacity magazines they had obtained prior to 2000, but no one, with a few exceptions such as law enforcement officers, has been allowed to obtain new large capacity magazines since 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 1, 2016, California enacted Senate Bill 1446 (\"SB 1446\"), which amended California Penal Code \u00a7 32310, criminalizing the possession of large capacity magazines as of July 1, 2017, regardless of when the magazines were obtained. Then, on November 8, 2016, the California electorate approved Proposition 63, which largely mirrors SB 1446. The amended version of Section 32310 enacted by Proposition 63 requires that anyone possessing a large capacity magazine either remove the magazine from the state, sell the magazine to a licensed firearms dealer, or surrender the magazine to a law enforcement agency for its destruction prior to July 1, 2017.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032310\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 32310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). The amended version of Section 32310 enacted by Proposition 63 also provides that possession of a large capacity magazine as of July 1, 2017 constitutes an infraction or a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $100 per large capacity magazine and/or imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032310\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 32310(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 28, 2017, plaintiffs filed the instant action alleging that Section 32310 is unconstitutional. After the original Complaint was amended, the court denied plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order and then denied plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. (Docket Nos. 45, 52.) In denying a preliminary injunction, the court held that injunctive relief was not warranted because, among other things, (1) the ban survived intermediate scrutiny under the Second Amendment; (2) a complete ban on personal property deemed by the state to be harmful to the public is likely not a taking for public use requiring compensation; (3) the ban was not void for vagueness because the version of the ban enacted by Proposition 63 controlled, as it was enacted after the passage of SB 1446; (4) the ban was not void for vagueness because it is not paradoxical to exempt possession of large capacity magazines for certain individuals while not allowing these individuals to manufacture, import, sell, transfer, or receive the magazines; and (5) the ban was not unconstitutionally overbroad because the overbreadth doctrine does not apply in\n   the Second Amendment context and the law does not prohibit a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. The court further noted that injunctive relief is generally not available for takings claims and that plaintiffs had not shown that the balance of hardships or public interest weighed in favor of injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs then filed their Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), which expands on their previously asserted claims and which adds (1) an Equal Protection claim under the U.S. and California Constitutions, based on the exemption for large capacity magazines used as props in movies and television; (2) an allegation that the ban operates as a taking under the California Constitution; and (3) allegations regarding SB 1446's alleged \"preamendment\" of Proposition 63 in support of their claim that the ban is void for vagueness because of the differences in the two versions of the ban.

In other words, California voters were told before they passed Proposition 63 that Proposition 63 would replace the version of the large capacity magazine ban enacted by SB 1446, such that it is clear that Proposition 63 was intended to replace SB 1446's version of the ban.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these circumstances, plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled that the large capacity magazine ban is unconstitutionally vague on account of the passage of both SB 1446 and Proposition 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs once again allege that the large capacity magazine ban is vague because (1) it is an \"absurdity\" to exempt possession for retired law enforcement officers, and in the case of SB 1446, certain other individuals, while prohibiting them from bringing such magazines into the state or giving or receiving them, and (2) the options for disposal, with the exception of turning the magazines over to the state, are \"illusory.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 95-101.)

Moreover, the court is unaware of, and plaintiffs have cited no authority holding, that a statute is unconstitutionally vague where one or more methods of compliance are impractical but another method of compliance is not impractical. Any difficulty plaintiffs or the public might have in seeking to sell their magazines to a licensed gun dealer or remove them from the state is not grounds to invalidate the ban as unconstitutionally vague, when it is clear that individuals may comply with the ban by surrendering them to a law enforcement agency for destruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Because plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that the large capacity magazine ban is void for vagueness, the court will dismiss plaintiffs' vagueness claims in Count III and Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Overbreadth Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the large capacity magazine ban is unconstitutionally overbroad because there is no evidence that application of the ban to current owners of large capacity magazines would further the objectives of reducing mass shootings and the harm inflicted during those shootings, as well as making the current regulations less difficult to enforce.

Kroger\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787942\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/1202/#p1208\">\n     622 F.3d 1202\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1207 (9th Cir. 2010), a bookstore and other plaintiffs brought an overbreadth challenge to Oregon's law criminalizing the provision of sexually explicit material to minors, where the court found the statute \"swe[pt] up a host of material entitled to constitutional protection\" under the First Amendment. The other two cases cited by plaintiffs involved both vagueness and overbreadth challenges but the courts addressed only the vagueness claims. While the petitioner in\n    <em>\n     Phelps v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768175\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/897/#p898\">\n     831 F.2d 897\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 898 (9th Cir. 1987), brought both a vagueness and overbreadth challenge to a federal statute regarding the release of persons adjudged not guilty by reason of insanity, the court addressed only the vagueness argument, finding the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the standard set forth in the statute was not too subjective and was applied regularly by judges in a variety of contexts. Similarly, the defendant in\n    <em>\n     United States v. Rodriguez-DeHaro\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9449079\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/192/1031/#p1038\">\n     192 F.Supp.2d 1031\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1038-39 (E.D. Cal. 2002) (Wanger, J.), challenged an indictment which was based in part on his prior conviction under a California domestic violence statute, raising both overbreadth and vagueness arguments, but the court specifically addressed only the vagueness argument, finding that the California statute's language was \"capable of being understood by a person of ordinary intelligence.\" (citation omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
