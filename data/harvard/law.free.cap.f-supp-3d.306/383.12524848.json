Shortly after Tapp's termination, WMATA's Metro Transit Police issued a \"Be On the Look-Out\" (\"BOLO\") flyer, warning the public that Tapp was no longer allowed on WMATA's property. When Tapp later filed a lawsuit against WMATA in Superior Court, WMATA removed his action to this Court. Tapp's amended complaint alleges that the termination of his employment violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process because WMATA failed to follow its own internal procedures (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 24, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25); that WMATA's issuance of the BOLO flyer transgressed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because it harmed his reputation and ability to obtain new employment in violation of his constitutional liberty interests under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 27-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); and that Tapp was treated differently than similarly-situated managers because of his gender, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e - 2000e-17 (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 39-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The amended complaint also claims that the BOLO flyer falsely depicted Tapp as a criminal to his friends and to the community at large, thereby placing him in a false light and invading of his privacy (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 34-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and that this action by WMATA also amounted to intentional infliction of emotional distress (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 53-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court at present is WMATA's renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). (Def.'s Renewed Mot. for J. on the Pleadings (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 25.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   WMATA argues that it is entitled to judgment in its favor on all five claims in Tapp's amended complaint, and this Court generally agrees with WMATA's arguments, except as they pertain to Tapp's allegation that he is the victim of gender discrimination in violation of Title VII (Count III). Specifically, as explained fully below, the Court finds that WMATA is entitled to judgment on Counts I, II, IV, and V as a matter of law for a variety of reasons, including the fact that Tapp does not hold a protectable property interest as is needed to establish a Due Process violation, and that WMATA is neither subject to Section 1983 claims nor able to be sued for the common-law torts that Tapp has brought in this lawsuit. However, Tapp's gender-discrimination claim cannot be resolved in WMATA's favor at this time, because WMATA's motion seeks judgment based on an affirmative defense that WMATA must plead and prove, even if Plaintiff does not oppose WMATA's assertion. Accordingly, WMATA's motion for judgment on the pleadings will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , as explained below.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Termination of Emp't Mem., Ex. 1 to Am. Compl., ECF No. 24-2, at 1-3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tapp last served as the Superintendent of Bus Transportation (\"BTRA\") of WMATA's Montgomery Division. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 41.) On or about January 2, 2015, approximately a month before his termination, Tapp suspended one of his subordinates-office manager Paul Hobbs (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10)-after Hobbs became \"angry and defensive\" during a discussion about Hobbs's \"various work[-]related issues of noncompliance\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Hobbs complained about the disciplinary action to Tapp's supervisor, Ted Harris, and alleged \"that he was assaulted during his discussions with Plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) As a result, Harris called a meeting with Tapp on January 7, 2015, and \"suspended [Tapp] for a period of nineteen (19) days\" pending an internal investigation into Hobbs's allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) At the end of this period, Tapp was \"contacted by WMATA'[s] Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) where a number of officials ... tried without success to force him to resign his position[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Then, on February 3, 2015, Tapp was officially terminated from his employment, allegedly without being provided any instructions as regarding how \"to appeal or grieve\" the decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Termination of Emp't Mem. at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Curiously, in the \"termination letter\" that Tapp received from WMATA, \"no reference to the allegations made by ... Hobbs\" appeared. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 22.) Instead, the letter recited several other events as grounds for Tapp's termination, including: (1) that Tapp had violated WMATA rules when he fired another employee on December 30, 2014, without first consulting with his superiors or obtaining a concurrence; (2) that Tapp had violated WMATA Comptroller Procedures when he failed to secure the Montgomery Division's petty cash in a safe under a combination lock; and (3) that Tapp had received poor overall performance evaluations during the immediately preceding year, along with reported incidents of improper and unprofessional conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Termination of Emp't Mem. at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after Tapp was fired, he \"learned that ... WMATA had caused its Metro Transit Police Criminal Investigative Division to publish a flyer with his photograph and employee number[,]\" warning readers that Tapp was not allowed on WMATA's property. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 28.) The flyer, which bore the \"BOLO\" acronym, was \"published throughout WMATA and in all of the metro stations that it operates[,]\" and was visible to Tapp's co-workers and friends, as well as to any \"visitors to WMATA facilities[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

On January 5, 2016, Tapp filed an Amended Complaint (ECF. No. 24), alleging that WMATA (1) \"wrongfully and illegally\" terminated his employment without \"observ[ing] its own rules ...

Moreover, after Tapp had allegedly \"inquir[ed] about the availability of petty cash\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), he discovered that his female predecessor, Jacqueline Smith, had not kept the petty cash funds in a safe or secure place herself (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 41-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )-instead, at a meeting on October of 2013, she proceeded to \"borrow $200.00 in cash from a co-worker, Mr. Summon Cannon, which she then handed over to [Tapp] for the Montgomery Division petty cash\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). Because Tapp was not provided with a safe or combination, he purportedly \"was left to secure the monies in his WMATA company vehicle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Furthermore, according to Tapp, while he was admonished for failing to secure the funds in a combination safe, \"it was clear that his predecessor superintendent, a female, did not have a safe in which she had secured petty cash funds\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42), and indeed, \"did not even have the petty cash funds available\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   WMATA challenged the original complaint with a motion for judgment on the pleadings that it filed on August 24, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 12.) However, subsequent to the filing of this motion, this Court granted\n   Tapp leave to amend the complaint, and WMATA's motion was thereafter dismissed as moot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order of Dec. 10, 2015.) WMATA has now filed a renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), with respect to all of the amended complaint's counts. WMATA argues that Count I fails because WMATA is a state agency that is not bound by internal procedures with respect to the firing of its employees, and because Tapp was an at-will employee without a constitutional interest in continued employment that could \"trigger a violation under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment[s].\" (Def.'s Mot. at 7 (citation omitted).) Alternatively, WMATA argues that it did, in fact, follow internal procedure when it terminated Tapp. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) WMATA further contends that it is entitled to the entry of judgment in its favor with respect to Count II, because WMATA is not a \"person\" subject to Section 1983 claims, and that even if it is not immune, harm to reputation alone does not amount to the unconstitutional deprivation of a plaintiff's liberty interest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 9-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) WMATA maintains that Tapp's claim of gender discrimination must also be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under Title VII, because \"[t]here is no record that [Tapp] has filed the requisite complaint with the EEOC[,]\" nor does the amended complaint allege such a filing or attach a copy of \"a right-to-sue letter[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Lastly, WMATA contends that Counts IV and V fail because WMATA \"enjoys sovereign immunity\" from suit for intentional torts committed in a discretionary or governmental capacity, and, here, the decision to issue the BOLO flyer was undertaken in WMATA's discretion to warn its personnel that Tapp was no longer allowed on nonpublic WMATA property and was carried out by Metro policemen. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 11-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For his part, Tapp makes a series of arguments that appear to be substantively related to Counts I, II, IV and V, and that seem to advance the contention that he opposes WMATA's motion for judgment on pleadings with respect to those counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In regard to Count I, Tapp argues that WMATA is not just a state agency, but also an agency of the District of Columbia, and as such it is bound to follow its own established termination procedures, or risk violating the Fifth Amendment, notwithstanding Tapp's at-will status. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"), ECF No. 27, at 6.) Next, with respect to Count II, Tapp argues that the injury he suffered by the posting of the BOLO flyer rises above mere reputational harm: it has foreclosed \"his future employment opportunities\" and deprived him of \"his right to live and ply his trade free from governmentally imposed stigma.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (citation omitted).)

Consequently, in order to confirm that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Tapp's tort claims (or, alternatively, in order to determine that no subject matter jurisdiction exists such that WMATA is entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to these claims), this Court must evaluate the scope of WMATA's immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is well established that WMATA has some degree of sovereign immunity by virtue of having been created through a compact entered into by two sovereign States-Maryland and Virginia-and a municipality that is controlled by Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend.

However, it is also clear that sovereign immunity can be abridged by statute, and Section 80 of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209-1107.01\">\n    D.C.

As relevant here, Section 80 provides that WMATA\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    shall be liable\n   </em>\n   for its contracts and for its torts and those of its Directors, officers, employees and agent\n   <em>\n    committed in the conduct of any proprietary function\n   </em>\n   , in accordance with the law of the applicable signatory (including rules on conflict of laws), but\n   <em>\n    shall not be liable\n   </em>\n   for any torts\n   <em>\n    occurring in the performance of a governmental function.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209-1107.01\">\n    D.C.

Thus, for present purposes, the key question is whether WMATA's decisions to issue a BOLO flyer and to disseminate it publicly were acts that were committed pursuant to a \"governmental function\" of the agency, or whether WMATA's acts can otherwise be characterized as committed in the conduct of WMATA's \"proprietary function\" (i.e., whether they are ministerial, non-discrete acts).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKethean v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 11-12.) WMATA also insists that, when WMATA police undertook to disseminate the BOLO flyer, they were performing a classic governmental function because \"[p]olice activity is quintessentially governmental.\" (Def.'s Mot. at 11.) Tapp responds that Metro police did not post the BOLO flyers \"in pursuit of standard police functions\" but, instead, were directed to do so by the \"WMATA agents who engaged in his illegal termination[.]\" (Pl.'s Opp'n at 9.) Further, Tapp argues that \"while Defendant WMATA may have sovereign immunity with respect to decisions to hire and fire, ... stigmatizing an employee and foreclosing\n   his right to future employment opportunities\" are not required aspects of terminating an employee's employment, and thus, the BOLO decision was \"not a discretionary function shielded by sovereign immunity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) As explained below, this Court finds that WMATA has the better of this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Because the distinction between proprietary and governmental functions has created a quagmire that has long plagued the law of municipal corporations,\" courts in this Circuit \"have interpreted section 80 as incorporating the distinction between discretionary and ministerial functions[,]\" which evolved under the jurisprudence that pertains to the Federal Tort Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202671\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2680.\n   <em>\n    KiSKA Const.

But if the governing regulation leaves room for the exercise of discretion, or if there is no regulation proscribing a particular course of conduct at all, the court considers a second question: \"whether the exercise of discretion is grounded in social, economic, or political goals[,]\" and if it answers that question in the affirmative, then the decision at issue is deemed susceptible to policy judgment and is seen as fitting \"within section 80's retention of sovereign immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Beebe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11902426,3709612\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/1283/\">\n    129 F.3d at 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At this stage, the key determinant is the decision-maker's\n   <em>\n    exercise of discretion\n   </em>\n   and the limits (if any) on his decision-making, i.e., only those acts that are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   discretionary are properly deemed to have been taken in furtherance of ministerial/proprietary functions and subject to suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    KiSKA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9366179,3718071\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/321/1151/\">\n    321 F.3d at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With this legal framework in mind, this Court concludes that WMATA's decision to issue a BOLO warning as part of Tapp's post-termination process was not an act that was taken in furtherance of a quintessential governmental function, but\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   an exercise of discretion by WMATA as an employer such that the agency's sovereign immunity shields it from liability for that\n   decision.

This means that WMATA's suggestion that it is entitled to judgment in its favor on exhaustion grounds simply and solely\n   because Tapp has failed to allege facts to establish exhaustion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 12-13) cannot be countenanced. Moreover, given that Tapp's amended complaint is devoid of any facts related to exhaustion, this Court would be \"required to consider matters outside the pleadings to determine the validity of the [Defendant's] affirmative defense[,]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3554745,4089149\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/713/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , which this Court cannot do when resolving a Rule 12(c) motion,\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"884658\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/403/39/#p47\">\n    403 F.Supp.2d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that, under Rule 12(c), \"the Court may not rely on facts outside of the pleadings\" in reaching the merits of the argument). In other words, even if WMATA had undertaken to provide this Court with evidence that demonstrated a lack of exhaustion by Tapp (it has not done so), this Court could only grant WMATA's Rule 12(c) motion if it was clear on the face of the amended complaint that Tapp failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chem-Met\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%2074541\">\n    1997 WL 74541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (denying a Rule 12(c) motion because it \"improperly seeks to require the plaintiff to plead facts to negate an anticipated affirmative defense\");\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1521744,3603593\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/777/8/\">\n    777 F.2d at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16-18 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Wright &amp; Miller,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1368 (explaining that \"[i]f the affirmative defense clearly is established in the pleadings ... then a judgment on the pleadings may be appropriate[,]\" but if \"matter[s] outside the pleadings would have to be introduced to establish [the affirmative] defense\" then \"a summary judgment motion rather than one for judgment on the pleadings undoubtedly [is] the appropriate procedure\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, because Tapp's amended complaint does not allege any facts that relate to the affirmative defense of non-exhaustion, this Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that \"plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts entitling him to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Lans v.

As a result, WMATA's motion must be denied with respect to Count III of Tapp's amended complaint, and the Court will permit the parties to engage in a limited period of discovery on the exhaustion issue, after which WMATA may move for summary judgment, proffering evidence to support its affirmative defense, if it so chooses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the reasons explained above, WMATA is entitled to judgment on Counts I, II, IV, and V because there is no material issue of fact with respect to these claims as Tapp has alleged them, and even so, these claims cannot be sustained as a matter of law. But, Tapp's Title VII employment-discrimination claim (Count III) survives WMATA's Rule 12(c) motion, because the Court cannot conclude that Tapp failed to exhaust his administrative remedies based solely on the information set forth in the amended complaint. Accordingly, and as set forth in the accompanying order, WMATA's motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , and the Court will permit the parties to engage in a period of limited discovery\n   solely with respect to the issue of whether Tapp exhausted the administrative remedies that are required to sustain his Title VII claim.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    As explained\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    in Part I.B, WMATA's initial Rule 12(c) motion was mooted when this Court granted Tapp leave to amend his original complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Page numbers herein refer to those that the Court's electronic case filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Tapp repeatedly states that \"on the twentieth day of his suspension[ ] he was terminated from his position.\" (Am.

But according to the documentation that was referenced in and attached to Tapp's amended complaint, Tapp was terminated on February 3, 2015 (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Termination of Emp't Mem. at 1), which was twenty-seven days after he was placed on suspension on January 7, 2015. However, as far as this Court can tell, the seven-day difference between the complaint's allegations and the evidence provided is not material to any of the legal issues presented in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Tapp's amended complaint inexplicably misorders the counts that it alleges-Count III is listed\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    Count IV (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Am.

The Court would ordinarily order Plaintiff to revise its pleading to reflect all five counts, properly labeled and ordered numerically, but given the disposition of Defendant's motion to dismiss as explained herein, the Court has opted to refrain from requiring Plaintiff to engage in that undertaking.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The Court hesitates in its description of Tapp's brief in opposition, primarily because he\n    <em>\n     claims\n    </em>\n    to be addressing only the arguments that WMATA has made regarding Counts I and II. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 8 (\"Here, not only did Defendant WMATA violate procedural due process granted through the 5th Amendment ... by failing to observe its own regulations when it terminated Plaintiff Tapp [ (Count I) ], it also deprived him of his constitutionally protected liberty interest also in violation of the 5th Amendment [ (Count II) ].\").) Nevertheless, the substance of the contentions that he makes plainly relate to WMATA's arguments under the other counts as well, except for Count III. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 9-10 (arguing that WMATA's actions are not discretionary or \"governmental, and thus, [not] entitled to sovereign immunity\").) Thus, this Court has construed Tapp's opposition brief liberally, even as it has struggled to ascertain the true nature of Tapp's contentions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Pleadings are closed for Rule 12(c) purposes when a complaint and an answer have been filed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.

In Count I, Tapp does not allege that the reasons behind his\n    <em>\n     termination\n    </em>\n    were publicized by WMATA, or that the basis for his discharge was so stigmatizing that it foreclosed his future employment opportunities. Moreover, the allegation that WMATA's actions regarding the distribution of the BOLO flyer caused these harms and implicated Tapp's liberty interests appears in Count II of Tapp's amended complaint. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am. Compl. \u00b6 33.)
