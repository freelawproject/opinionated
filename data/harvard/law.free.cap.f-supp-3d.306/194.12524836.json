KELLY, United States District Judge\n   Before the Court are Plaintiff Gamal Brown's Motion to Remand or Amend his Complaint, ECF No. 7, and Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 5. For the reasons set forth below, Brown's motion is (1) denied as to remand, and (2) denied without prejudice as to the amendment of his complaint. The Court will order Brown to file a motion to amend that complies with the Local Rules within 30 days. As a result, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For purposes of these motions, the Court assumes the truth of the facts set forth in Brown's complaint. On June 1, 2015, Brown was hired by the Defendant Potomac Electric Power Company (\"Pepco\") as a Substation Technician Trainee. ECF No. 1 (\"Removal Not.\"), Ex. A (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 4. This position required Brown to hold a valid driver's license. Compl. \u00b6 33. The position was also covered by a collective bargaining agreement (the \"CBA\"), and by virtue of his being hired, Brown became a member of a union.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24-25, 32, 34-35; Removal Not., Ex. E (\"Davis Decl.\"), Ex. 1 (CBA). The CBA regulated the bargaining, CBA \u00a7 2.01, promotion,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 8.09, and discharge,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 16.01-16.05, of covered employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 4, 2016, Brown applied for a promotion to the position of \"Helper-Transformer Tester NERC,\" another position covered by the CBA. Davis Decl. \u00b6 7; CBA at 85. He was given a conditional offer for that position on October 3, 2016. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. One of the conditions of Brown's promotion was that he obtain a Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") medical card within six months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Obtaining this card required passing a DOT physical, including a drug test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 14, 2016, Brown appeared for his drug test, provided a urine sample which was insufficient to enable the full range of tests to be completed, and left the testing site before providing a second sample.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10-12. Around 3:30 p.m. that same day, Brown was advised by Pepco's Senior Recruiter to return to the testing site and complete the test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brown returned to the testing site later that day and entered a bathroom stall with a male observer to provide the urine sample.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The observer used \"vulgar terms\" to communicate that he needed to observe the urine leave Brown's body and enter the receptacle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Brown then exited the stall and left the testing site, telling a Pepco representative that he felt \"sexually harassed\" and offering to redo the sample at a later date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Around 5:00 p.m., Pepco advised Brown that because he had failed to complete the drug test, he would be ineligible for the promotion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 27, 2016, Brown, after a meeting with representatives of Pepco and his union, was placed on \"Crisis Suspension,\" a disciplinary procedure outlined in Article 16 of the CBA, as a result of the incomplete drug test. Compl. \u00b6 22. During the course of this suspension, Pepco discovered that Brown had not held a valid driver's license since January 2016, and was therefore placed on \"Decision Making Leave,\" the final disciplinary step before discharge pursuant to CBA Article 16. Compl. \u00b6 33. After failing to negotiate the terms of a voluntary resignation, Brown was discharged on March 28, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 28, 2017, Brown filed this action in the Superior Court for the District\n   of Columbia, alleging a violation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.0\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 2-1401.0\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and a common law breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-48. The breach of contract claim asserts that Pepco had a contractual duty to promote Brown if he possessed a valid driver's license and obtained a DOT medical card within six months of his hire date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.0\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.0\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 40-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It goes on to allege that Pepco breached this purported contract in a number of ways, including by failing to give Brown the agreed-upon six months to obtain his DOT medical card and failing to treat Brown's departure from the drug testing center as a cancellation, which would have permitted him to take the test again.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.0\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.0\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 42-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The complaint also alleges that Pepco breached its contract by relying on Brown's \"Decision Making Leave\" status \"as the basis for ... any action ... relating to [Brown] and his promotion and/or retention\" because that status \"was limited by it[s] terms to issues related to timely arrival at work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.0\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1401.0\">\n    \u00b6 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 9, 2017, Pepco removed the case to federal court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1446 on the ground that Brown's breach of contract claim arises under federal law. Removal Not. at 1-2. Specifically, Pepco argued that the claim is preempted by Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which courts have held has such preemptive force that it converts certain state-law claims into ones arising under federal law. Removal Not. at 2. Pepco then moved to dismiss the complaint, ECF No. 5 (\"Def.'s MTD\"), while Brown moved to remand the case back to Superior Court or, in the alternative, to amend his complaint, ECF No. 7 (\"Remand Mot.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11 (\"Remand Opp.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Conclusion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For all of the above stated reasons, it is hereby ordered that Brown's Motion to Remand or Amend his Complaint, ECF No. 7, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to remand and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   as to the amendment of his complaint. Brown shall file a motion to amend that complies with the Local Rules within 30 days. Pepco's Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 5, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Pepco argues that the presumption against removal should not apply because the cases Brown cites for this proposition, Remand Mot. at 6-7, refer to general removal statutes, such as\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201441\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , not cases involving Section 301 preemption, Remand Opp. at 2. But Pepco removed this case pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201441\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Removal Not. at 1. And courts in this Circuit have applied the presumption against removal to Section 301 cases.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dist. No. 1\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232274\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/294/#p300\">\n     75 F.Supp.3d at 300\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Pepco also suggests that other terms in the CBA, such as the management rights clause, the section addressing promotions, and the grievance and arbitration provisions are generally applicable here, even if they do not speak to the precise issue at hand.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Remand Opp. at 6-7. In light of the Court's conclusion that Brown's breach of contract claim will require interpretation of the termination provisions in the CBA, it need not reach whether these provisions independently preempt Brown's claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
