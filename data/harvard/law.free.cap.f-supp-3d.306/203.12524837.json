BATES, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   If a defendant refuses on principle to appear in court, things usually do not end well for the defendant. But suppose we add two complicating factors. First, the lawsuit is clearly untimely under governing law. And second, the defendant is the Islamic Republic of Iran. Should a court rule against Iran in absentia? Or should the court consider the suit's timeliness on its own initiative? That is the question before this Court in the above-captioned cases, in which plaintiffs seek judgments against Iran for supporting the 1983 and 1984 U.S. embassy bombings in Beirut. Generally, it is up to the defendant to raise a timeliness defense. However, the Court finds that respect for other sovereign nations, the Court's duty to independently assess claims of state-sponsored terrorism, and the practical effect of ignoring the statutory deadline weigh against granting default judgments against Iran on plainly untimely claims. Hence, for the reasons explained below, the Court will set aside the defaults and dismiss the claims against Iran in both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 18, 1983, a car bomb exploded at the U.S. embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, killing sixty-three people and injuring over one hundred more. Over a year later, on September 20, 1984, a second bomb exploded at the U.S. embassy annex in East Beirut, killing at least eleven people and injuring over fifty. In 2002 and 2008, two sets of plaintiffs timely filed cases on behalf of (among others) the same bombing victims who are at the center of the two instant cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Doe v.

They, likewise, were unaware of the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   suit: they allege that Donna Salazar, the plaintiff in that suit, claimed that she was Mark's widow when the two were not legally married, and that she did not inform Kenneth and Kevin of her case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-7.

Plaintiffs have filed default judgment motions against defendants in both suits, and argued in those motions that judgment should not be withheld because of the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

That provision reads, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   An action may be brought or maintained under this section if the action is commenced, or a related action was commenced under section 1605(a)(7) (before the date of the enactment of this section) ... not later than the latter of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n   </strong>\n   10 years after April 24, 1996; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n   </strong>\n   10 years after the date on which the cause of action arose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(b). Thus, an action is timely if either the action itself is timely or a \"related action\" was timely. If the statute of limitations has run, but the defendant has not entered an appearance, the Court must decide whether to raise the timeliness issue sua sponte.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. These Actions Were Not Timely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs do not claim that their suits are timely. Indeed, Maalouf admits that his action falls outside of the statute of limitations. Maalouf Mem. at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This fact is equally true of the\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be timely in their own right, these actions must have been commenced not later than either (1) April 24, 2006, or (2) \"10 years after the date on which the cause of action\n   arose.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(b). These actions were filed in 2016, long after the April 24, 2006 deadline. Moreover, \"the plaintiffs' causes of action arose on ... the date[s] of the embassy bombings\"; therefore, \"the last day to file a new action under \u00a7 1605A was\" April 18, 1993 in\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and September 20, 1994 in\n   <em>\n    Maalouf\n   </em>\n   , \"ten years after the bombings.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens v.

Cir. 2017). Since plaintiffs did not file these suits until more than two decades after those deadlines, neither is timely under \u00a7 1605A(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nor was either case related to another timely action. The FSIA allows plaintiffs to hitch their wagons to another suit that was timely filed under the predecessor provisions to the NDAA if the cases \"aris[e] out of the same act or incident,\" and if plaintiffs filed \"within 60 days of the entry of judgment in the original action or of the enactment of the NDAA, whichever was later.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p800\">\n    864 F.3d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting NDAA \u00a7 1083(c)(3) ). Plaintiffs point to\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   as the cases from which the Court should draw for its liability findings in the current\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Maalouf\n   </em>\n   actions, respectively-though neither set of plaintiffs argues that these cases are \"related\" to those for statute of limitations purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maalouf Mot. at 2-3; Salazar Mot. at 2. Both\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   actions arose from the 1983 embassy bombing, and\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Maalouf\n   </em>\n   both arose from the 1984 bombing. However, plaintiffs here did not file within sixty days of the judgments in those earlier cases. The Salazar plaintiffs filed eleven years after entry of judgment in\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   , and the Maalouf plaintiffs filed nearly three years after entry of judgment in\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maalouf Mem. at 2 (conceding that the suit was filed too late to be \"related\" to\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   case was itself brought under the NDAA, not under the prior version of the terrorism exception as the statute of limitations requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175397\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/808/1/\">\n    808 F.Supp.2d at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because neither of the instant cases is timely in its own right, and neither is related to a timely-filed action, both run afoul of the FSIA's statute of limitations.

On this question, the ground is but lightly trodden. The Fourth Circuit has held that district courts may consider sua sponte res judicata defenses in FSIA default judgment actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clodfelter v.

For several reasons, the Court disagrees with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Worley\n   </em>\n   , and determines that it should consider the statute of limitations here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To begin with, these cases implicate concerns about international comity that rarely appear in the ordinary lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whatever Iran's misdeeds, it remains a foreign country equal in juridical stature to the United States, and the federal courts must respect \"the independence, the equality, and dignity of the sovereign.\"\n   <em>\n    The Schooner Exch. v.

The\n   <em>\n    Worley\n   </em>\n   court declined to exercise its discretion to dismiss sua sponte because it felt that Iran had to \"take the consequences\" of its choice not to appear.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n    75 F.Supp.3d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Maaloufs argue that the same logic should apply here, given that Iran is perfectly happy to litigate cases that do not involve terrorism charges. Maalouf Mem. at 10. But plaintiffs in FSIA cases are making conscious strategic decisions as well. And without some policing of time limits, plaintiffs may seek to exploit prior decisions finding nations liable for certain conduct to later pursue large damages awards decades after the fact.\n   <em>\n    Worley\n   </em>\n   itself illustrates this concern. The plaintiffs in that case sued Iran in December 2012 for its role in the 1983 Beirut bombing-a twenty-nine-year gap between injury and complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Worley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n    75 F.Supp.3d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To find liability, the court relied on evidence from a case decided a decade earlier.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n    at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The present cases are even more worrisome:\n   <em>\n    Maalouf\n   </em>\n   was filed thirty-one years and\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   thirty-three years after the bombings giving rise to each suit, and they rely for most of their evidence on cases filed eight and fourteen years previously. In this way, plaintiffs can continue piggybacking off of older decisions for decades to extract multimillion dollar judgments from absent sovereigns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For how long should such claims be allowed? From the standpoint of the judicial branch, only two principled time limits present themselves: either the ten-year statute of limitations Congress has imposed, or no time limit at all. After all, if a twenty-nine year (or a thirty-three year) gap is acceptable, there is little reason to prohibit suits brought forty, fifty, or more years after the fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claimants could easily glean evidence of a defendant's culpability by dusting off old volumes of the Federal Supplement.

Nor is it to suggest that the practical concerns just outlined would justify sua sponte consideration of non-jurisdictional defenses in the ordinary case. But long experience reminds us that judgments against other nations or their citizens often have serious import for American foreign relations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Treaty of Paris, Gr.

The Court's decision today ignores neither \"the fundamental rule that statutes of limitations are generally treated as affirmative defenses that may be waived,\" nor \"Congress's determination that the statute of limitations is not a requirement for exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Worley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231991\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/311/#p331\">\n    75 F.Supp.3d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Like all state sponsors of terrorism, Iran is liable to victims of the crimes it has committed or abetted. Yet as long as it remains a state, Iran is entitled to a certain baseline of respect from American courts. Particularly given the fraught relationship between the United States and Iran, courts must take seriously both the comity due between nations and the duty to independently scrutinize default judgment claims under the FSIA. Hence, for the reasons explained above, the Court will deny plaintiffs' motions for default judgments and instead dismiss both actions, with prejudice, as untimely. A separate order to this effect will issue in each case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Congress later amended this exception, codifying the new version at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A.
