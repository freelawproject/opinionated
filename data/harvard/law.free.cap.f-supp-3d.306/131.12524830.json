R, ECF No. 33-23 (describing differing lengths of time by size and complexity of audit, and an average period that at one point was approximately 15 months and at another was approximately 30 months); Pl.'s Ex. aa, ECF No. 33-32, at 04119 (performance review of another supervisory auditor indicating that \"she is not timely with her products and could better manage her people, projects, and time\"); he did supervise the relevant employee, who did in fact work during that time period at issue, Dep. of Paul Hicks at 36:3-22, 37:1, Def.'s Ex. 7, ECF No. 32-4 (describing the employee's role doing research and data mining); Dep. of Roy Simmons at 66:8-16, Pl.'s Ex. R, ECF No. 33-23 (confirming Plaintiff's supervision of the relevant employee); and although he admittedly did not use Team Mate for one of his audit reports, the Medicaid State Plan/Program Integrity audit, it was not loaded in Team Mate, he reviewed that report in paper form anyway, and other audit directors allegedly were not fully compliant in their Team Mate usage either,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dep. of Paul Hicks at 40:15-22, 41:1-12, Pl.'s Ex.

The Court also observes evidence in the record that the employee whom Defendant says did no work for two years remained employed at OIG for years after Plaintiff's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Roy Simmons at 65:4-21, 66:1-7 (stating unequivocally in 2017 deposition that \"[s]he still currently works there\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Other evidence as well tends to show that Defendant's performance rationale fails to account for certain key facts. In particular, the performance reviews Plaintiff did receive included significant amounts of positive feedback. His 2011-2012 annual performance review shows that he received an overall rating in the \"Competencies\" section of 4.40/5.00,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   making him a \"4 Highly Effective Performer,\" and in some specific areas, \"5 Role Model.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. B, ECF No. 33-7, at 039-041. While Defendant points to constructive criticism in the 2012-2013 review, that review contains primarily positive feedback, together with the overall finding that he is considered a \"3 Valued Performer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 3, ECF No. 32-4, at 11-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Notwithstanding any mixed message that a rating of three on a five point scale may suggest, elsewhere Defendant defines a rating of \"Valued Performer\" as showing that the individual \"consistently meet[s] and may occasionally exceed expectations, and therefore, meets the minimum requirements of the position. Contributions are essential to ensuring that agency goals are met.\" Pl.'s Ex. A., ECF No. 33-6, at 14-I-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As for other would-be indicators of performance, Plaintiff disputes that he ever received an \"unsatisfactory\" midterm review to which Mr. King referred in his May 16, 2014, memorandum revoking Plaintiff's AWS privileges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Paul Hicks at 16:8-15, 18:9-12, Pl.'s Ex. E, ECF No. 33-10; Def.'s Ex. 5, ECF No. 32-4, at 24. Plaintiff's 2012-2013 annual review that he looked at nearly six months beforehand could not have been what Mr. King was referring to, because that annual report noted that the mid-term review for that period expressly found Plaintiff's performance to be \"satisfactory\" at that point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 11; Def.'s Ex. 4, ECF No. 32-4, at 041. He also testifies that he was not placed on a performance improvement plan (\"PIP\"). Dep. of Paul Hicks at 13:21-22, 14:1-6, Pl.'s Ex. E, ECF No. 33-10. The parties dispute whether D.C. regulations require that an employee in the Management Supervisory Service was entitled to a PIP,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Mem. at 18, Reply Mem. at 16 n.2;\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court's reading of a District Personnel Manual submitted by Plaintiff suggests that his view is at least plausible,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. A, ECF No. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1410.1(f), 1410. Plaintiff's assembly of this evidence regarding performance feedback appears to show a rather rapid fall from grace that a reasonable jury could find, together with Plaintiff's direct rebuttal, is not fully explained by the type and timeline of performance issues that Defendant has identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's self-serving testimony is not enough to create a genuine issue of fact.

Plaintiff makes his case for age and racial discrimination by identifying comparators, namely other supervisory auditors who were working contemporaneously at OIG but who differed in age and, in one instance, race. Of the four comparators that Plaintiff identifies, all are at least sixteen years younger, three of whom are African American or African,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one of whom is white.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Opp'n Mem. at\n   9-10.

The difficulty comparing those audit reports, due in Defendant's words to the \"many variables affect[ing] how long each report will take,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, is among the factual issues that are appropriate for the fact finder, not for the Court at this summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, there are genuine disputes as to the assessment of Plaintiff's performance vis-\u00e0-vis other supervisory auditors, and the extent to which other supervisory auditors are sufficiently comparable for purposes of age and racial discrimination claims. This is a situation in which some of the material facts (e.g., audit report timeliness) are in dispute, and other undisputed facts (e.g., failure to use Team Mate for one report) are susceptible to divergent yet justifiable inferences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3543041,3668059\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/62/\">\n    571 F.3d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury must find the remaining facts and elect among the justifiable inferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   If the Court were not convinced by the disputes outlined above, it is Defendant's silence regarding Roy Simmons that raises a further dispute of material fact sufficient to warrant denying its motion for summary judgment on the age and racial discrimination claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Simmons, an African American in his sixties, is the one supervisory auditor who also fell within both of Plaintiff's protected classes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Ronald W. King at 14:17-21, 15:1-3, Pl.'s Ex. F, ECF No. 33-11; Pl.'s Ex. L, ECF No. 33-17, at 4321. Approximately one year after Plaintiff's termination, Mr. Simmons too was terminated. Pl.'s Ex. L, ECF No. 33-17, at 04321. OIG's internal memoranda show that Defendant's rationale was similarly the timeliness of an audit and supervision of staff.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 04309-04310.

The record reflects that Blanche Bruce, the then-Deputy Inspector General, did not respond substantively to the objector, rather insisting that he \"simply\" indicate whether he agrees or disagrees.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 04314 (identifying further response as \"disagree\").

On various of these occasions, he specifically discussed his further belief that the finding should be included in his audit report, a point which his superiors, in particular Mr. King, resisted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31-35; Def.'s Reply Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The record casts doubt, however, on Plaintiff's apparent presumption that he was disclosing something that was previously unknown. As a result, it would not be appropriate to refer to the payment non-suspension issue as a \"finding,\" and, critically, his activities may not qualify as a \"disclosure.\" \"District of Columbia case law suggests that a plaintiff's statements do not qualify as 'protected disclosures' under the [DC]WPA if the statements conveyed only information that was already known to the person to whom the information is reported...\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

At first blush, it is not entirely clear in the briefing whether the \"disclosure\" at issue is the underlying \"finding\" of payment non-suspension, or instead the issue of whether that \"finding\" must be included in the audit report. The parties seem to suggest that it is the latter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Mem. at 22-24; Reply Mem. at 20, but the Court shall address each possibility in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   There is at least one sign in the record that upper-level management may already have been aware of the underlying payment non-suspension issue when Plaintiff discussed it with them in April 2013.

Neither party attempts to explain the origin or import of this January 2013 report to which Mr. Willoughby refers. For example, it is not clear whether OIG produced the January 2013 report, and regardless, whether OIG's upper-level management was aware of this report and its findings by the time that Plaintiff was discussing his \"findings\" with his superiors beginning in April 2013. The existence of such a report, however, makes it more difficult for Plaintiff to discharge his burden that the payment non-suspension issue was a \"disclosure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As for the other possible \"disclosure,\" it is not clear that Plaintiff's superiors were previously unaware of the regulations that Plaintiff discussed with them, or of the implications of those regulations. According to Plaintiff, he brought two regulations to Mr. King's attention, namely the GAO's Government Auditing Standards and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20455.23\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Def.'s Reply Stmt. \u00b6 35. Surely OIG upper-level management already was familiar with GAO standards intended for auditors; Plaintiff says nothing to dispel that assumption. The specific portions of the GAO standards cited by Plaintiff are too general to support any notion of a revelation to management that he was \"duty-bound\" to include the payment non-suspension issue in his report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Mem. at 23-24 (asserting that inclusion of the payment non-suspension issue is part of the \"objective analysis\" called for by GAO standards); Pl.'s Ex.

But this section says nothing about including any findings to the contrary in an auditor's report.

In light of all the evidence, Defendant's failure to suspend payments to all Medicaid providers under investigation is, if an error at all, not an error so serious as to be \"not debatable among reasonable people.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209714\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/921/#p925\">\n    957 A.2d at 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's disclosure of this point to superiors at OIG did not account for colorable good cause bases for Defendant's not suspending the payments, even though Plaintiff disputes those good cause bases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 26 (describing, in FCA/DCFA context, the law enforcement exception and the administrative overturning of some suspensions as good cause bases for non-suspension); Opp'n Mem. at 20-21 (disputing law enforcement exception); Def.'s Ex. 13, ECF No. 32-4, at 0483 (discussing rescission of some suspensions); Reply Mem. at 18-19 (proffering other good cause bases that Plaintiff arguably would have to address). Nor does Defendant's decision not to disclose the payment non-suspension issue in the Medicaid State Plan/Program Integrity audit report rise to the level of such seriousness, where there is no standard\n   clearly requiring such a disclosure there. The record reflects that Defendant's OIG handled the payment non-suspension issue with a letter from the IG to DHCF that evidences interagency communication between DHCF and MFCU about the payment non-suspension issue. Defendant could have discharged its obligation to comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20455.23\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   through internal means such as this without discussing the issue in the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   It is true that Plaintiff may not have been aware of all the good cause arguments for non-suspension of the payments at issue.

DHCF issued suspension letters that were challenged by providers who received them and ultimately reversed by administrative law judges who found those letters to be deficient or otherwise found the suspension unsupportable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Mot. at 26; Dep. of Karen Shaw at 38:10-21, 39:1-21, 40:1-21, 41:1-21, 42:1-13, Def.'s Ex. 11, ECF No. 32-4; Def.'s Ex. 12, ECF No. 32-4 (containing administrative case reversing suspension due to deficient letter); Def.'s Ex. 13, No. 32-4, at 0483 (conveying IG's summary of this issue to DHCF director). Whether and how Defendant pursued those suspensions any further is not in the record.

Plaintiff's response is not entirely coherent, but appears to argue that this good cause rationale is only manufactured\n   <em>\n    ex post\n   </em>\n   and that it did not apply to all instances of non-suspension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n Mem. at 20-21; Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 25. Yet, Plaintiff has not identified any authority for the notion that Defendant must have labeled its efforts with a good cause exception at the time. And no one is arguing this good cause basis applies to all instances in which Defendant did not suspend payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Responding more generally to Defendant's asserted good cause, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has not attempted to offer a good cause basis for non-suspension of payments to\n   <em>\n    each and every\n   </em>\n   provider who is at issue. \"Defendant, without offering any evidentiary support, has assumed that the millions of dollars in D.C. Medicaid payments paid out to all the medical providers who were referred to Defendant's MFCU at issue was [sic] justified.\" Opp'n Mem. at 20 (emphasis omitted). Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, Defendant seems to admit that it did not pursue every last provider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Karen Shaw at 40:9-13, Def.'s Ex. 11, ECF No. 32-4 (\"So we [DHCF] worked through the problem of the letters being legally deficient and we sent out letters. But we did not send out letters every time we referred a case to [MFCU].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   But even at this point, after the close of discovery, the full list of providers who were subject to investigation is not before the Court. If that list were before the Court, then the Court could entertain line-by-line arguments as to the sufficiency of good cause arguments for not suspending payments to this or that provider. Absent that list, the Court in its discretion shall rule on good cause arguments put forward as to the class of providers under investigation. As observed above, Plaintiff forewent his opportunity to rebut other possible good cause arguments that Defendant suggests could apply to providers whose payments were not suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Even if Defendant lacked good cause not to suspend payments to one or more providers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20455.23\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), Plaintiff appears to be reporting on \"nothing more than his employer's non-compliance with federal or state regulations,\" which is not enough to sustain an FCA claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yesudian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338922,11707270\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/731/\">\n    153 F.3d at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, one reading of the mandatory nature of the C.F.R. provision could obligate DHCF to issue a fresh round of letters to those whose deficient letters were struck by the administrative law judge. If it did not do so, then, on this reading of the C.F.R., it would not be in compliance with federal regulations. But that is not enough for a violation that could sustain an FCA claim. Rather, as noted above, what is necessary is some evidence of \"false or fraudulent\" claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338922,11707270\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/731/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff has not produced any evidence that Defendant's DHCF falsely or fraudulently sought Medicaid funds from the federal government and/or from the District's general fund in order to pay providers under investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   It is a particularly steep challenge for Plaintiff to prove that he engaged in protected\n   activity because his efforts to raise an issue with his superiors appear to be part of his normal job responsibilities. For example, the OIG's Audit Handbook defines a \"performance audit\" as \"an objective and systematic examination of evidence for the purpose of providing an independent assessment of the performance of a government organization, program, activity, or function in order to provide information to improve public accountability and facilitate decision-making by parties with responsibility to oversee or initiate corrective action.\" Pl.'s Ex. Q, ECF No. 33-22, at 37 (citation omitted). Plaintiff did his job of examining the evidence of payments to Medicaid providers, rendering his independent assessment (as a non-lawyer) that DHCF was violating the law, and facilitating decision-making by his superiors in OIG as to appropriate corrective action. As the Court already has stated in this Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiff points to no evidence that this assessment need have been made in the audit report itself, nor that Plaintiff's superiors would be violating a rule by excluding his assessment from that report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   At no point in the record did Plaintiff clearly signal to his employer that he was engaging in protected activity rather than engaging in his normal job responsibilities as an auditor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin-Baker Aircraft Co., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9151912,3432885\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/1251/\">\n    389 F.3d at 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He did not, for example, appear to act outside his normal job responsibilities, threaten that he would report the payment non-suspension issue to the federal government or to the D.C. general fund, or suggest that OIG should hire counsel to defend its actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schweizer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3770440,3870270\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/1228/\">\n    677 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1239 ;\n   <em>\n    Omwenga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274651\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/244/214/#p218\">\n    244 F.Supp.3d at 218-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although he did speak about the payment non-suspension issue with Ms. Kennedy, possibly without his immediate superiors on one or two occasions, he did so only after speaking about the issue six months beforehand with his immediate superiors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32. Accordingly, the record does not reflect any activity by Plaintiff that would raise the \"reasonable possibility\" of litigation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schweizer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3770440,3870270\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/1228/\">\n    677 F.3d at 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , such that OIG, and in turn Defendant, should have known he was engaged in protected activity under the FCA even when he did not expressly raise the FCA with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   As a final point, the Court pauses momentarily to observe that Plaintiff's activity is not really the kind for which retaliation would be expected. He discussed an issue repeatedly with his superiors; whether or not because of him, they took some action (i.e., the IG's letter to DHCF) and rejected other action (i.e., including the issue in the Medicaid report); a month or two after his final salvo, he lost the privilege of an alternative work schedule, and a few months after that, he was fired. He had not called public attention to the issue such that Defendant could have objected to the negative publicity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.
