For the reasons that follow, the Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part and the Motion for Leave to File Reply in Excess of Page Limitation is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BNSF hired Plaintiff Shane Jones on January 26, 1998. Jones was hired as a\n   \"conductor/brakeman/switchman\" but became an engineer in 2001, a job he continues to hold today. On December 9, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jones was \"deadheading\" from Fort Madison, Iowa to Kansas City, Kansas. Deadheading is a means of transporting employees from location to location on a train already heading in that direction. While riding on locomotive 7162 that day, Jones stood up to use the bathroom at or near milepost 333.2. As he was stretching his back, the train hit a rough patch of track and he fell down several stairs into the locomotive's nose and injured his shoulders. Jones was never warned of any issues with the section of track surrounding milepost 333.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BNSF maintains standards for its tracks and locomotives, all of which either match or are more stringent than what regulations promulgated pursuant to the Federal Railroad Safety Act (\"FRSA\") require. At the time of Jones's injury, BNSF required visual inspection of the section of track where the injury occurred four times a week. Track inspectors inspected that section on November 23, 24, 25, 26, and 28, as well as on December 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. Defendant provided records of its inspections from December 2013 to December 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PARS Information Report for Mileposts 327 to 337 from December 9, 2013 to December 9, 2014, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. I, ECF Nos. 55-34-55-37. Although it claims these records show that no defects were found during those inspections, whether the records support that is not clear. It is clear, however, that at least two of the records indicate that BNSF got reports of rough track on the portion of track that it inspected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, ECF No. 55-35 (noting that on November 23 the maintenance desk called to report rough track);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (noting that on December 3 the record maker \"did not get headed to rough track call until 0230\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to requiring visual inspections, BNSF uses manned and unmanned geometry cars to inspect its tracks. Geometry cars use inclinometers, accelerometers, and lasers to measure track position. Measurements of the track's gauge, surface, and cross-level are fed into a computer program. BNSF has programmed its geometry cars to detect defects that, at a minimum, exceed FRSA standards. In some cases, the cars are programmed to more stringent standards mandated by BNSF. If the geometry cars detect no deviation from their programmed standards, BNSF considers the track safe for cars to travel on at full speed. If the car does detect a deviation, the defect is reported in real time. The report includes information about the defect as well as other details about the track. Sometimes defects lead to a track being \"slow ordered,\" which reduces the track's speed limit so that trains can safely travel along the track. Before a slow order is removed, the cause must be addressed or repaired. Even if a deviation is not reported, the track may still need repairs. Geometry\n   cars are also equipped with Vehicle Track Interaction Exception Inspections (\"VTI\"), designed to measure surface accelerations. In essence, the VTI measures the acceleration that people riding in the locomotive would feel. The section of track including milepost 333.2 was inspected by geometry car on November 19, 2014. The report indicated no deviation from FRSA standards and the VTI report showed no acceleration beyond a threshold value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BNSF also records reports of rough track. If there are two or more reports of rough track within a 0.3 mile stretch of track over a period of 30 days, the second report generates a repeat Rough Track Report. Once a repeat Rough Track Report is generated, the affected section of track is automatically slow ordered and cars on the track cannot travel faster than 25 miles per hour. A management level employee then must assess the section of track to determine whether the issue has been resolved. Milepost 333 was reported as rough on October 16 and milepost 333.2 was reported as rough on October 27. Because these were within 30 days, a repeat Rough Track Report was generated and the area was slow ordered. A repeat Rough Track Report was generated on December 9 for a nearby section because there were reports of rough track at milepost 333.6 on November 23 and at milepost 333.7 on December 9. When the track was inspected in response to the November 23 report, no deviations from BNSF standards were found. Another repeat Rough Track Report was generated on December 9 because of reports of rough track at milepost 332.3 on November 28 and at milepost 332.6 on December 9. Bill Moore, a BNSF track inspector, inspected milepost 332.3 in response to the November 28 report. Although BNSF claims that Moore found nothing wrong with the track,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Moore Dep. 42:20-25, Mot. Summ. J. Ex. E, ECF No. 55-29, Moore said that his report meant that the track \"was definitely good at [that] spot for track speed,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   43:2-6, and that he did not mean that no work was done on the track,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   44:4-7. Because of the two repeat Rough Track Reports on December 9, the track around those mileposts was inspected and two mud holes-spots in the track where ballasts are plugged and no longer drain, resulting in mud being pumped to the surface-were discovered. One mud hole caused a deviation of one and seven-eighths inches and the other a deviation of one and three-eighths inches. FRSA, and BNSF, standards required a slow order to be placed only where the deviation was two inches or more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jones asserts that there were long-term problems with the stretch of track between mileposts 332 and 334. For instance, that section of track was slow ordered 120 times in 2014, which is a larger than usual number of slow orders. Additionally, Moore was called to inspect that section of track often because it was degraded and muddy. Plaintiff asserts that BNSF had been working toward a permanent fix for that section of track, but BNSF counters that it merely intended to permanently fix the mud holes identified in December 2014. Furthermore, Doug Fotenos, another track inspector, recommended that milepost 332 be included on BNSF's 2014 capital plan due to the repeated rough track reports. He wanted the track to be undercut, which is more permanent than other types of repair. Milepost 332 was also on BNSF's list to receive funding for major repairs in November 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jones filed suit in this Court on December 3, 2015. Compl., ECF No. 1.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   BNSF seeks judgment against Jones on both his FELA and his LIA claims. Jones does not oppose BNSF's motion with respect to his LIA claims. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. 2 n. 1, ECF No. 56. Jones also failed to respond to the portions of BNSF's motion seeking summary judgment on his claims related to inspections of the locomotive Jones was riding in when injured,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. Summ. J. 23-24, his res ipsa loquitur claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25, and his claim that deadheading on a train was negligent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26. In his response to BNSF's summary judgment motion, Jones describes his FELA claims as claims that BNSF \"failed to properly maintain the track in a safe condition, failed to warn of the unsafe condition of the track, and/or failed to properly inspect the track to identify areas needing repair.\" Resp. Mot. Summ. J. 1. Failure to respond to a motion for summary judgment is an admission of the facts upon which the moving party relied.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerhartz v. Richert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012304\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/682/#p685\">\n    779 F.3d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685 (7th Cir. 2015). The Court can grant summary judgment on an issue \"if the motion and supporting materials-including the facts considered undisputed-show that the movant is entitled to it.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(3). In light of Jones's concession and the undisputed facts-and because Jones has not set forth any facts to support these claims-BNSF is entitled to judgment on the LIA claims, the res ipsa loquitur claim, and any other claims relating to deadheading or conditions on the locomotive itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As to the FELA claims, BNSF argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because all of Jones's FELA claims are precluded by FRSA. BNSF argues that it was in compliance with all FRSA regulations relevant to Jones's claims-track maintenance and track inspection-and Jones does not seem to disagree.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Resp. Mot. Summ. J. 4 (not disputing that FRSA regulations required track inspections twice per week and that the track where Jones was injured was inspected more than twice a week before his injury). BNSF argues that Jones's claims must fail because of this fact. Mot. Summ. J. 11-19. BNSF argues that FRSA precludes negligence claims brought under FELA to the extent that FRSA regulations substantially subsume the subject matter of the negligence claim, so long as the regulations are complied with.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Jones argues that FELA claims are not precluded by FRSA and that it has provided sufficient\n   evidence that BNSF was negligent. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. 14-23, 26-27. Perhaps in the alternative, Jones also argues that the FRSA regulations BNSF points to do not subsume the field of track inspection or maintenance, and thus that even if FRSA precludes some FELA claims, his claims are not precluded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    i. FELA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   If Jones's FELA claims are not precluded, BNSF's motion must be denied because it has not disputed the evidence set forth by Jones supporting a finding of negligence beyond stating that it was in compliance with FRSA regulations. Under FELA, railroads \"shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed\" by the railroad \"for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of [the railroad], or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence,\" in its tracks or equipment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2051\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Resp. Mot. Summ. J. 26-27. That section of track had been listed on the slow order log 120 times in 2014. An inspector went out to the area often to inspect the degraded and muddy track. There were numerous reports of rough track on that section in the weeks preceding Jones's injury. Despite BNSF's inspections, the reports kept occurring, indicating that the issues were not repaired. And BNSF itself had identified that stretch of track as needing major repairs. Jones was never warned about any of these issues. BNSF's response is that it complied with FRSA regulations. Reply Mot. Summ. J. 17-18, Mot. Leave File Reply Excess Page Limitation Ex. A, ECF No. 57-1. Jones was injured as the locomotive he was riding in hit a rough surface within this section of track. When the train hit the rough track, it caused Jones to fall down several stairs and injure his shoulders. If compliance with FRSA regulations does not immunize BNSF from liability, there is enough evidence from which a jury could find that BNSF was negligent in maintaining and inspecting the track, and in failing to warn Jones about the danger of the track, and that its negligence contributed to Jones's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.
