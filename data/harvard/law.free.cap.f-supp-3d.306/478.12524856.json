(Compl., Dkt. No. 1.) The United States elected to intervene for the limited purpose of effectuating a settlement agreement between the parties, which resolved the FCA claims regarding defendants' fraudulent acquisition of construction contracts. (Dkt. No. 12.) Rubar maintains an FCA retaliation claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and numerous common law tort claims against defendants, which were not covered by the settlement agreement.

(3d Am. Compl \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15.) Doyner and LeMoyne are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Hayner Hoyt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.) The Thurstons used Bennett, a service-disabled veteran employed as their warehouse manager, as a figurehead to fraudulently obtain federal contracts via a sham corporation, 229 Constructors, and to funnel illicit subcontract fees into their coffers via Doyner and LeMoyne. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rubar worked closely with the Thurstons as Vice President of Doyner, where he was employed for over two decades without ever receiving a negative review or complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 38.) Upon discovering the fraudulent scheme, Rubar refused to participate in it or assist in its coverup; instead, he notified the government and filed this\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After identifying Rubar as a whistleblower, defendants threatened him with criminal prosecution based on fabricated accusations, (\n   <em>\n    id. \u00b6\u00b6\n   </em>\n   42-43), terminated him from employment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), eventually levied false charges against him, (\n   <em>\n    id. \u00b6\u00b6\n   </em>\n   47-54), stalked him, (\n   <em>\n    id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   80), defamed him to several newspapers, subcontractors, and employers, (\n   <em>\n    id. \u00b6\u00b6\n   </em>\n   76-79, 84), maliciously interfered with his business opportunities, (\n   <em>\n    id. \u00b6\u00b6\n   </em>\n   84-86), caused him to be terminated from subsequent employment, (\n   <em>\n    id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   87), and attempted to physically harm him by crashing into a car that they believed he was driving, (\n   <em>\n    id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   81).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although the United States reached a settlement agreement with defendants regarding their fraudulent construction contract scheme, (Dkt. No. 12, Attach. 1), Rubar maintains a retaliation claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) and several common law tort claims, (3d Am. Compl.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss Rubar's claims of retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED), tortious interference with contract and prospective business relations, and prima facie tort. (Dkt. No. 30.) Thereafter, defendants filed a partial answer\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Rubar's Second Amended Complaint, which included their own common law tort counterclaims against Rubar for \"fraudulent, unlawful[,] and disloyal conduct undertaken by Rubar over a span of several years while he was an employee of Doyner.\" (Dkt. No. 53 at 25-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After some confusion born by procedural impropriety, (Dkt. Nos. 55, 94), Rubar filed a Third Amended Complaint, (3d Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 95). Given defendants' contention that \"the ... Third Amended Complaint does not cure the deficiencies that have been identified in [d]efendants' motion to dismiss,\" (Dkt. No. 56 at 2-3), the court applies defendants' previously-filed motion to dismiss, (Dkt. No. 30), against this newly-amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to resolving the arguments presented in defendants' motion to dismiss, the court must also resolve Rubar's motion for attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses related to the settled portion of the FCA claims, (Dkt. No. 31), as well as a subsequent motion to intervene filed by Travelers, (Dkt. No. 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The standard of review under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is well settled and will not be repeated here. For a full discussion of the standard, the court refers the parties to its prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Ellis v. Cohen &amp; Slamowitz, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3935486\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/701/215/#p218\">\n    701 F.Supp.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218 (N.D.N.Y. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Proper Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The FCA's anti-retaliation provision provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [a]ny employee, contractor, or agent shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make that employee, contractor, or agent whole, if that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, agent or associated others in furtherance of an action under this section or other efforts to stop [one] or more violations of [the FCA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1). Generally, to set forth a retaliation claim under this section, a relator must show that \"(1) he engaged in activity protected under the statute, (2) the employer was aware of such activity, and (3) the employer took adverse action against him because he engaged in the protected activity.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Chorches for Bankr. Estate of Fabula v. Am. Med. Response, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269781,12275486\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/71/\">\n    865 F.3d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (2d Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rubar argues that by eliminating any reference to \"employer\" in a 2009 amendment to the FCA, Congress \"effectively left the universe of defendants undefined and wide-open.\" (Dkt. No. 39 at 14-16) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Weihua Huang v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4283250\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/896/524/\">\n    896 F.Supp.2d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548 n.16 (W.D. Va. 2012) ). As such, he asserts a retaliation claim against all defendants, including the Thurstons and Bennett. (3d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 114-117.) However, defendants contend that the 2009 amendment does not allow a relator to maintain a retaliation claim against individuals as opposed to their actual employers. (Dkt. No. 42 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Neither side points to a Second Circuit decision resolving this relatively novel issue. However, courts in the Northern District have held that, under the post-2009 version of \u00a7 3730(h), liability may not be imposed on an individual either in an individual or official capacity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. N.Y. State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:13-CV-740,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201202587\">\n    2014 WL 1202587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    Monsour v. N.Y. State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:13-CV-0336,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20975604\">\n    2014 WL 975604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 2014). The Southern District recently considered this issue in depth and they too joined \"the overwhelming majority of courts, including the Fifth Circuit, [that] have held that the current version of \u00a7 3730(h) does not create a cause of action against supervisors sued in their individual capacities.\"\n   <em>\n    Diffley v. Bostwick\n   </em>\n   , 17-CV-1410, slip op. at 4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206948358\">\n    2017 WL 6948358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2017). Therefore, in an effort to promote consistency within this district and for the reasons cited by defendants, (Dkt. No. 42 at 2-3), the court grants defendants' motion to the extent that it seeks dismissal of the FCA retaliation claims against the Thurstons and Bennett.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, defendants urge the court to dismiss Rubar's retaliation claim against all defendants except Doyner because, in their view, the FCA does not extend liability to a parent corporation and thus a claim can only lie against Doyner-Rubar's immediate \"employer.\" (Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1 at 2-5; Dkt. No. 42 at 3-4.) Rubar argues that the court is free to pierce the corporate veil in the FCA context using the alter ego doctrine and, alternatively, that Hayner Hoyt maintained an \"employment-like\" relationship with Rubar sufficient to fit within the scope of FCA liability. (Dkt. No. 39 at 16-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Given the high-level of control, commonality of ownership, and close relationship between Hayner Hoyt and its subsidiaries, including Doyner, (3d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-32), and other reasonable inferences\n   that can be drawn from this relationship, the court will not dismiss the retaliation claim against Hayner Hoyt at this stage. However, Rubar does not allege facts to demonstrate that either LeMoyne or 229 Constructors maintained a similarly-situated relationship with him or level of control over him as an employee. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206948358\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Notably, Rubar also does not object to defendants' motion in this regard. (Dkt. No. 39 at 14-19.) Accordingly, Rubar's retaliation claim is dismissed as against 229 Constructors and LeMoyne.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.N.Y. L.R. 7.1(b)(3);\n   <em>\n    Burns v. Trombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229367\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/624/185/#p197\">\n    624 F.Supp.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (N.D.N.Y. 2008) (finding that a party's failure to oppose a properly-filed and sound motion is consent to the relief sought).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    b. Post-Employment Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants also seek dismissal of Rubar's retaliation claim against them to the extent that it relates to conduct occurring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Rubar was terminated. (Dkt. No. 42 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although allegations consisting only of post-employment conduct may not be actionable under FCA \u00a7 3730(h)(1),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weslowski v. Zugibe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221564\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/14/295/#p306\">\n    14 F.Supp.3d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)\n   <em>\n    aff'd on alternative grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=626%20Fed.%20Appx.%2020\">\n    626 Fed.Appx. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21 (2d Cir. 2015), the court is satisfied that Rubar has sufficiently detailed conduct occurring before or at the time of his termination to state an FCA retaliation claim. (3d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-43, 48.) Therefore, this portion of defendants' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    2. IIED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants also argue that the court should dismiss Rubar's common law claim for IIED because, as they posit, the complaint does not contain allegations that satisfy the high standard of \"extreme and outrageous conduct,\" (Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1 at 5-8), or sufficient specifics regarding the \"severe emotional distress\" Rubar suffered, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7), and the alleged conduct falls within the ambit of Rubar's defamation claim, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 n.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Indeed, the threshold for conduct that constitutes IIED is quite demanding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v. Am. Home Prods. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4388018\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/58/293/#p303\">\n    58 N.Y.2d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=461%20N.Y.S.2d%20232\">\n    461 N.Y.S.2d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20N.E.2d%2086\">\n    448 N.E.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). However, the court finds that Rubar's allegations demonstrate a combination of public humiliation, threatening behavior, and other actions contrary to public policy that is sufficiently \"extreme and outrageous.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stuto v. Fleishman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381286\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/820/#p828\">\n    164 F.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 828-29 (2d Cir. 1999) (collecting cases in which courts have sustained claims of IIED when a collection of similar conduct was alleged). Additionally, Rubar has sufficiently demonstrated plausible grounds to support a finding that he suffered severe emotional distress. (3d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 88-91.) Lastly, even assuming that claims are barred \"where the conduct complained of falls well within the ambit of other traditional tort liability,\"\n   <em>\n    Fischer v.

(Dkt. No. 30, Attach. 1 at 10-11.) Although defendants' knowledge may be\n   reasonably inferred at this stage based on the surrounding allegations, Rubar indeed fails to allege that a contract was breached by a third-party. Instead, he merely states that, as a result of defendants' conduct, he was \"forced to leave\" and \"lost his job at [another company].\" (3d Am. Compl \u00b6 87.) Even if the court infers that Rubar had an employment contract with this subsequent employer and that it terminated him, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83, 87), Rubar fails to allege that this amounted to a contractual breach. Additionally, although Rubar alludes to lost opportunities with subcontractors because of defendants' conduct, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-86), he does not allege the existence of any specific contracts or whether they were breached. Furthermore, Rubar does not respond to this aspect of defendants' argument in his opposition. (Dkt. No. 39 at 24-25, 25 n.11.) As such, Rubar's tortious interference with contract claim is dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229367\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/624/185/#p197\">\n    624 F.Supp.2d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    5.

No. 30, Attach. 1 at 11.) However, given that the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party at this stage, Rubar's allegation that defendants interfered with his business relationship with MCK Builders involving a masonry project, (3d Am.

No. 30, Attach. 1 at 11-12), and a claim for prima facie tort is inapplicable where another specified tort provides a remedy, (Dkt. No. 42 at 10). However, these arguments fail because Rubar sufficiently alleges that \"on October 24, 2014, [d]efendant ... informed a client of [r]elator's employer that it would not work with any company that had any relation to [r]elator, which resulted in the loss of several hundred thousand dollars.\" (3d Am.

No. 31, Attach. 1 at 16), is well within the reasonable range for partners and the most experienced attorneys, and the in-District average is $280.00 per hour for less-experienced associates, and $150.00 per hour for paralegals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Given Katz and Sadowski's specialized expertise in FCA cases, the length of time spent on the case, the amount involved in the case, and the results obtained (for both Rubar as well as the United States), an award of attorneys' fees at the higher end of the prevailing District rate is reasonable. Therefore, a reasonable, paying client seeking attorney services would be willing to pay an hourly rate of $450.00 for Sadowski, $400.00 for Katz, $280.00 for DeRienzo, and $150.00 for support staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Given the degree of vagueness in the annexed invoice entries, as highlighted by defendants, (Dkt.

Rubar objects to Travelers' motion on the grounds that it is untimely, (Dkt. No. 66 at 5-7), and the third-party's interests are adequately represented by existing parties, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [1] [o]n timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who ...

No. 66 at 7-8) (citing\n   <em>\n    Carroll v. Am. Fed'n of Musicians of U. S. &amp; Canada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719634\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/33/353/#p353\">\n    33 F.R.D. 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353 (S.D.N.Y. 1963) ), Travelers' has demonstrated an unparalleled interest in recovering the amount that they disbursed under the indemnity agreement due to Rubar's alleged conduct, (Dkt. No. 65, Attach. 6 at 6-7). Rubar himself admits that \"[Travelers'] and [d]efendants' interest[s] are potentially adverse.\" (Dkt. No. 66 at 8.) Furthermore, Travelers, as the insurer who has disbursed a reimbursement, and Doyner, as the insured who collected the reimbursement, are so situated that the ability to protect this interest may be impaired by denying intervention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

Thus, the issue boils down to timeliness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A determination on timeliness resides within the court's sound discretion and requires it to consider the following factors: \" '(1) how long the applicant had notice of the interest before it made the motion to intervene; (2) prejudice to existing parties resulting from any delay; (3) prejudice to the applicant if the motion is denied; and (4) any unusual circumstances militating for or against a finding of timeliness.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ley v.

(Dkt. No. 53; Dkt. No. 65.) As Rubar himself points out, the statute of limitations on the proposed intervenor's claim extended until at least January 23, 2017. (Dkt. No. 66 at 6.) Although the statute of limitations has now lapsed, it would be unjust to penalize proposed intervenor for a factor beyond their control, such as a court's deliberate consideration of their timely-filed motion and proposed complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. for Use &amp; Benefit of Canion v.

Most importantly, the existing parties would not be prejudiced by allowing the proposed intervenor to seek an assertion of its subrogation rights in this matter as discovery is still ongoing and the conduct that is the subject of proposed intervenor's claims is already at the forefront of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As such, Travelers' motion to intervene is granted.

As such, even though Rubar divides invoices by firm, pinning down exactly which firm was representing Rubar when is immaterial to the court's analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The only associated cost that defendants contest is the $775.00 process server fee because Rubar \"never requested that [d]efendants waive service of the complaint ...

Although Rule 4(d) does allow a party to recover costs associated with service of process when an opposing party fails to waive service, Rubar seeks costs under the FCA, not pursuant to this rule. However, for the same economical reasons underlying Rule 4(d), Rubar should have given defendants the opportunity to avoid this expense. Therefore, the court reduces this expense by 50% to reflect both Rubar's unreasonableness and the uncertainty surrounding whether defendants would have actually agreed to such a request.

However, the court finds that these entries appear to be sufficiently related to the successfully-settled claims,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Quaratino v.

Furthermore, the court disagrees with defendants' contention that all time entries purportedly related to Rubar's entitlement to an award under the FCA and clerical tasks must be excluded. (Dkt. No. 37, Attach. 1 at 20-21.) In any event, the across-the-board reduction of 10% adequately addresses these entries as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    In its reply, intervenor's counsel asserts that \"[t]he proposed [i]ntervenor is The Charter Oak Fire Insurance Company [ (Charter Oak) ], which is an affiliate of [Travelers] and an underwriting company for Travelers.\" (Dkt.

In fact, the reply opens by stating \"Charter Oak ... respectfully submits this [r]eply ... in further support of\n    <em>\n     its\n    </em>\n    [m]otion to [i]ntervene in this acton to assert\n    <em>\n     its\n    </em>\n    subrogation and reimbursement rights.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1.)
