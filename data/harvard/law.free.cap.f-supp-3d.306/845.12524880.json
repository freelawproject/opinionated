BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Space Systems/Loral LLC, (\"SSL\" or \"Plaintiff\"), is a limited liability company that specializes in the design and manufacturing of geostationary satellites, space systems, and robotics technology. ECF No.1. Orbital ATK, Inc., (\"Orbital\" or \"Defendant\") is a Virginia based company that performs similar work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. In 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (\"NASA\") solicited project proposals through an RFP entitled \"Utilizing Public Private Partnerships to Advance Tipping Point Strategies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. This project, commonly referred to as \"Tipping Point,\" was aimed at expanding opportunities and capabilities in the commercial space industry through public-private partnerships.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 8 at 8. NASA awarded SSL a contract for its \"Dragonfly\" project and Orbital for its \"CIRAS\" project respectively. ECF No. 1 at 3; No. 8 at 8. To facilitate the sharing of information with the various contractors, NASA established the \"NX\" server. ECF No. 8 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 6, 2016, NASA informed SSL that a data breach occurred that included proprietary data from SSL located on a NASA NX server at NASA's Langley Research Center. ECF No.1 at 3. NASA provided further updates and informed SSL that an Orbital employee committed the breach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. SSL also learned that at least four files containing its proprietary data had been opened/and or viewed by as many as six Orbital employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Following up on this information, SSL contacted Orbital regarding the details and scope of the breach, and Orbital provided a response. ECF No. 1 at 4-6; No. 8-2 at 1. SSL filed this action seeking judicial intervention to protect its confidential and proprietary information and damages as a result of Orbital's alleged unauthorized access. ECF No. 1 at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Orbital does not deny the breach occurred, but argues that because the former employee was authorized to access certain files on NASA's NX Server as a part of its work on the CIRAS Tipping Point Project, SSL's propriety and confidential information was not accessed within the statute's meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8 at 11-15; No. 15 at 11-12.

The Court finds these cases distinguishable however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State Analysis\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the defendant did not \"exceed authorization\" within the meaning of the CFAA because the complaint did not allege that the defendant had obtained or altered information it was not entitled to: rather the allegation was that the defendant had used the information in an inappropriate way.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226126\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/621/309/\">\n    621 F.Supp.2d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court held that because the licensee had given the competitor permission to access the software using its license, the competitor could not have intentionally acted without\n   authorization or in excess of its authority within the meaning of the statute.\n   <em>\n    SecureInfo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928605\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/387/593/\">\n    387 F.Supp.2d at 609-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This case is distinguishable however. Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    SecureInfo\n   </em>\n   , that accessed the software through a valid license which permitted authorization, SSL's pleading, that an \"employee accessed files on NASA's NX Server beyond the files the employee was authorized to view,\" essentially alleges that SSL never granted Orbital access to view its files.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at 3-4. Indeed, such an inference is supported by Orbital's own brief which explains that the NX server was set up \"[i]n order for NASA to share information with the various contractors working with NASA\n   <em>\n    on their respective Tipping Point projects\n   </em>\n   -including Orbital ATK and SSL.\" ECF No. 8 at 8 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, Orbital's argument fails because it is contrary to the Fourth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    WEC Carolina Energy Sols.

In opposition, Orbital argues that SSL fails to adequately plead damages or loss. ECF No. 15 at 6-8. To Orbital, SSL's alleged losses are not actionable because losses under the CFAA are costs incurred by the party responsible for the system that was breached-not a third party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Moreover, Orbital contends that SSL has not sufficiently pled damages because the complaint is unsupported by any evidence that the integrity or availability of its documents were impaired or that such information was used, altered or removed from the server.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8 at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The CFAA defines loss as any \"reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(11) (2008). Although Orbital argues that the CFAA only contemplates costs incurred by the party responsible for the system but not third parties, ECF No. 15 at 8, this conclusion is contrary to the statute's plain language which states that loss means any \"reasonable cost to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any victim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1030 (e)(11) (emphasis added). Indeed, neither the plain language of the statute nor the case law excludes third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, the Fourth Circuit has held that loss under the CFAA is a \"broadly worded provision,\" and considers \"costs incurred as a part of the response to a CFAA violation, including the investigation of an offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A.V. ex rel Vanderhye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897429\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/630/#p645\">\n    562 F.3d at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
