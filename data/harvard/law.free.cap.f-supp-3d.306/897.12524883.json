AFRICK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When Nelson and Lazaro Arce decided to challenge the Louisiana criminal justice system's treatment of the deaf, the Court doubts that they anticipated having to navigate through two of the murkiest waters in American law: federalism and separation of powers. Yet this case raises weighty questions about the federal government's authority to provide private citizens with the power to haul a State into federal court without its consent, and about the powers of executive branch agencies to authoritatively interpret federal statutes-and thus requires nothing less than a deep plunge into both pools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State of Louisiana, through the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (\"Louisiana\"), moves for dismissal of Lazaro Arce's claims against it on the ground that neither Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"Title II\") nor \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"\u00a7 504\") provides a cause of action based on associational discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Louisiana also requests dismissal of plaintiffs' Title II claim on behalf of Nelson as barred by sovereign immunity-a request that the Court construes as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cantu Serv., Inc. v.
