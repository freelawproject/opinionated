Defendant cross-moves for summary judgment, citing three provisions from the parties' insurance policy (\"the policy\") that purportedly exclude the flood damage from coverage. For the reasons set forth below, plaintiff's motion is granted in part and denied in part. Defendant's motion is also granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed. Plaintiff owns a rental property in Eugene, Oregon. On September 4, 2016, a water main owned and regulated by the Eugene Water and Electric Board (\"EWEB\"), located on a hill behind plaintiff's house, burst. The water flowed downhill onto plaintiff's land and caused damage to the residence. Plaintiff filed a claim with defendant. On September 16, 2017, after an inspection of the damage, defendant denied plaintiff's claim. Defendant's denial letter cited three provisions of the policy: Insured Peril subsection 15 and Exclusions 7 and 17. Plaintiff then filed this action, asserting claims for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Plaintiff contends that defendant breached the policy by denying coverage for damage to the structure as well as by denying coverage for mitigative repairs, lost rent, and debris removal. Defendant asserts that the water damage to the structure falls within two policy exclusions-7 and 17-and that there is no coverage for mitigative repairs, rent, and debris removal because no Insured Peril caused the damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Structural Damage\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The pertinent sections of Exclusions 7 and 17 state\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   We do not insure loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following regardless of any other cause of event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   7.

Conversely, Plaintiff asserts that Exclusion 7(a) applies only to natural water sources and so does not exclude coverage for damage caused by EWEB's burst water main. I agree with plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because there is no explicit definition of \"surface water\" or \"flood water\" within the confines of the policy, I must ask whether the terms \"surface water\" or \"flood water\" are prone to multiple interpretations. \"Surface water\" is defined in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary as: \"natural water that has not penetrated much below the surface of the ground: drainage water.\" Surface Water, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/surface%20water (last visited Jan. 23, 2018). Black's Law Dictionary defines \"surface water\" as: \"1. Water lying on the surface of the earth but not forming part of a watercourse of lake. Surface water most commonly derives from rain, springs, or melting snow.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1825 (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Floodwater\" is described as \"the water of a flood\" by Merriam-Webster's Dictionary. Floodwater, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/floodwater (last visited Jan. 23, 2018). Further, \"flood\" is defined as \"1a: a rising and overflowing of a body of water especially onto normally dry land ... 2: the flowing in of a tide 3: an overwhelming quantity or volume ...[.]\" Flood, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flood (last visited Jan. 17, 2018). Lastly, Black's Law Dictionary defines \"flood water\" as \"water that escapes a watercourse in large volumes and flows over adjoining property in no regular channel ...

This interpretation is further supported by the fact that the terms in controversy here are listed alongside other natural water sources-\"waves, tidal water, tidal waves, storm surge, tsunami\"-and thus do not suggest any meaning beyond naturally occurring water. Gower Decl. Ex. 1 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, defendant directs the Court's attention to the final provision of Exclusion 7, which states: \"This exclusion applies whether or not there was widespread damage and\n   <em>\n    whether or not it was caused by a human activity\n   </em>\n   or an act of nature.\" Gower Decl. Ex. 1 at 20 (emphasis added). Defendant offers this proviso to the Court as evidence that \"surface water\" unambiguously includes water from a burst water main, arguing that flood or surface water may be both \"caused\" by human activity (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , water mains) and \"caused\" by an act of nature (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , rivers), but I am not convinced. The question is what the pronoun \"it\" references: the water source or the water damage. I read this provision to say \"whether or not [\n   <em>\n    the damage to the residence\n   </em>\n   ] was caused by a human activity,\" not, as defendant would have it, \"whether or not [\n   <em>\n    the water\n   </em>\n   ] was caused by a human activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2137528\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/261/606/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant also submits\n   <em>\n    Citi Gas Convenience, Inc. v.

The loss must ... be caused by any of the following perils unless the loss is excluded elsewhere in this policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The policy then lists and defines sixteen Insured Perils.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff argues the provision explaining Coverages A and B makes clear his mitigative repair and debris removal costs are covered because he is making a structure damage claim and not a personal property claim. That argument is misguided and would require me to ignore the specific policy provisions on debris removal and emergency repairs, which require the source of the damage to be caused by an Insured Peril. A reasonable reader can understand that the purpose of capitalizing \"Insured Peril\" in the debris removal and emergency repair provisions is to reference the list of Insured Perils in the policy. Certainly, the provisions surrounding this issue could have been organized more artfully. However, the wording in \"Your Additional Coverages\" unambiguously refers to\n   <em>\n    Insured Perils\n   </em>\n   as a term of art within the contract. If I were to accept plaintiff's argument, it would render superfluous the express reference to \"Insured Perils\" under \"Debris Removal\" and \"Emergency Repairs After Loss.\" Such a reading runs contrary to longstanding principles of contract interpretation under Oregon law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I-L Logging Co. v. Mfrs. &amp; Wholesalers Indem.

All portions of a policy should be considered in construing it.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In order for plaintiff's mitigative repairs and debris removal to be covered, therefore, the source of the damage would have to be one of the enumerated options in the list of Insured Perils. In other words, as relevant here, the list of Insured Perils serves two purposes: it limits the circumstances under which a contents claim may be made and\n   <em>\n    separately\n   </em>\n   limits the circumstances under which emergency repairs and debris removal are covered. Here, it is undisputed that the cause of the damage is EWEB's burst water main. As defendant highlights in its motion, only subsection 15 of the Insured Perils \"comes close to applying to the facts of this loss.\" Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 13. That subsection states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   15. Discharge, release or overflow of water or steam from plumbing, heating, or air conditioning systems, automatic fire protective sprinkler systems or domestic appliances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   But we do not insure loss:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   b. Caused by accidental discharge or overflow which occurs off your premises[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Gower Decl. Ex. 1 at 19 (emphasis omitted). Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the water main in question is considered \"plumbing\" in the first paragraph of subsection 15, coverage is still excluded, because the water that damaged plaintiff's structure was an \"accidental discharge or overflow\" that occurred off plaintiff's property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5099362\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/202/277/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant is entitled to summary judgment with respect to the additional coverages of debris removal and emergency repairs; there is no coverage for those costs under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Loss of Rents\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff's Complaint alleges $19,200 for lost rents.

The applicable provision of the policy states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   If an insured loss occurs at the dwelling ..., we will pay for your loss of normal rents resulting from that insured loss while the dwelling is not fit to live in or use, less charges and expenses that do not continue during that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   We will pay loss of normal rents only for the shortest time needed to make the dwelling habitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Gower Decl. Ex. 1 at 16. This provision authorizes coverage for lost rents if the structure is at any point inhabitable. However, nothing in the record establishes how lost rents were calculated. Plaintiff has the burden of proof on this issue as well as the burden of identifying evidence in the record that shows lack of a question of material fact; he has not, at this point, carried either burden. Plaintiff's complaint does not serve the same purpose as an affidavit or exhibit; it cannot be relied upon to support his motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Lastly, in order to breach the duty of good faith, the Supreme Court of Wyoming requires the plaintiff to show: \"(1) the absence of any reasonable basis for denying a claim for benefits; and (2) the insurer's knowledge or reckless disregard of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

Together, these cases show that most states require something beyond mere breach to state a breach of the duty of good faith claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   It does not appear that Oregon law requires bad faith. Nonetheless, even in the absence of a bad faith requirement, it seems unlikely that every breach of contract claim is a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   breach of the duty of good faith. The Arizona Supreme Court has explained that \"[f]ailure to perform the express covenant to pay the claim is not the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   for an action for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\"\n   <em>\n    Rawlings v.

The law should not allow every breach of contract, even those accidental, inadvertent, or caused by honest mistake to deliver to plaintiff a successful additional claim for the breach of the duty of good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On the specific facts of this case, the claim for the breach of the duty of good faith cannot survive a motion for summary judgment. There likely are cases where an insurer's interpretation of policy language is so patently unreasonable that denial alone could support a breach of good faith claim, but that is because an insurer's adoption of a truly beyond-the-pale interpretation of contractual language is evidence that the insurer was willing to disregard the objectively reasonable contractual expectations of the insured. Here, however, defendant adopted a plausible yet ultimately incorrect reading of the contract language. Under such circumstances, a breach of the duty of good faith claim requires evidence of something beyond the mere breach of contract to proceed. Plaintiff has identified no such evidence here. Although plaintiff made some allegations of bad faith in the complaint, pleadings are not evidence, and there is insufficient evidence in the summary judgment record to support those allegations. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record of fraud, misrepresentation, or any other indicia of bad faith on the part of defendant. Defendant is therefore entitled to summary judgment on the good faith claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (doc. 10) is GRANTED with respect to the question of coverage for structural damage and Exclusions 7 and 17; the motion is DENIED with respect to the request for damages for emergency repairs, debris removal, and lost rents.
