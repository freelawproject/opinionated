[Record No. 118] On June 6, 2016, this Court transferred Lundy's tendered motion to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Rule 9 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings. [Record Nos. 112, 113] On November 17, 2016, the Court of Appeals granted Lundy permission to file a successive petition, and remanded the motion to this Court with instructions to hold the case in abeyance pending the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Beckles v.

[Record No. 116] Lundy filed a supplemental brief addressing his claim for relief under\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) [Record No. 120], and this matter was stayed pending resolution in\n   <em>\n    Beckles.\n   </em>\n   [Record No. 121] On March 6, 2017, the Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   , holding that the advisory sentencing guidelines are not subject to a due process vagueness challenge and, therefore, \u00a7 4B1.2(a)'s residual clause is not void for vagueness.\n   <em>\n    Beckles v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p896\">\n    137 S.Ct. 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 896-97,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p896\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Because that decision foreclosed Lundy's argument that he is not entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , his motion will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On March 28, 2008, Lundy pleaded guilty to a one-count indictment for possession with the intent to distribute a\n   quantity of pills containing oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance, all in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). [Record Nos. 53, 54] Following an October 6, 2008, hearing, Lundy was sentenced to 200 months' imprisonment, followed by six years of supervised release. [Record Nos. 79, 83] Lundy received an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 based on previous state convictions for bank robbery and delivery of controlled substances. Lundy argues that his bank robbery conviction can only be considered a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)'s residual clause. [Record No. 112-1 at 4] Because\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   held a similar, statutory, residual clause void for vagueness, a decision that was made retroactive to cases on collateral review by\n   <em>\n    Welch v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), Lundy seeks an extension of that rationale to disallow the enhancement he received under the Sentencing Guidelines. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Record No. 120 at 3]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Supreme Court took up this issue directly in\n   <em>\n    Beckles v. United States\n   </em>\n   , and found that\n   <em>\n    Johnson's\n   </em>\n   void for vagueness ruling has no bearing on the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   foreclosed Lundy's sole claim for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1.
