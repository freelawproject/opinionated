After careful consideration, the Court is of the opinion defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) should be granted in part and denied in part, and defendants' motion to dismiss or for summary judgment based on mootness should be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The named plaintiffs in this proposed class action are Andrea Beleno, Geoffrey Courtney, and Keith Taylor, who allege they are the parents of children born in Texas between December 23, 1993, and January 10, 2009, and Nancy Pacheco, who had her first child after suit was filed in August of 2009. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief on their behalf and on behalf of others similarly situated for alleged deprivations of liberty and privacy rights, and rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. They also assert violations of search and seizure rights arising from Article I, Section 9 of the Texas Constitution and Texas common law. As relief, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The named defendants are the Texas Department of State Health Services (\"DSHS\") and its Commissioner, David L. Lakey, M.D. Plaintiffs also named as defendants Texas A &amp; M University (\"TAMU\"), together with Nancy W. Dickey, M.D., and Roderick E. McCallum, Ph.D. (collectively \"Texas A &amp; M defendants\"). Defendants contend plaintiffs do not correctly state these officials' positions. Defendants maintain that Nancy W. Dickey, M.D., is Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs of the Texas A &amp; M University System (\"TAMUS\" or \"the System\") and President of the Texas A &amp; M University System Health Science Center (\"TAMHSC\"), which is a component of TAMUS, but is a wholly separate entity from TAMU. Defendants state that Roderick E. McCallum, Ph.D., is Interim Dean of the School of Rural Public Health (\"HSC-SRPH\"), which is part of TAMHSC. All individual defendants are sued in their official capacities only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that since 2002, defendants have unlawfully collected or \"seized\" blood samples taken from all babies in Texas at the time of birth (sometimes referred to as \"NSB testing\"); and continue to unlawfully store those samples or \"spots\" indefinitely for undisclosed purposes unrelated to the purposes for which\n   the blood was originally drawn without knowledge or consent of the infants' parents. The law in effect requiring NSB testing when this suit was filed on March 12, 2009, was found in Chapter 33 of the Texas Health &amp; Safety Code. Plaintiffs do not challenge the State's interest in having a NBS program in the interest of public health or challenge that the blood samples are taken for the NBS testing pursuant to Chapter 33. Plaintiffs contend, however, that \"defendants, without any authority or legal justification, have added to the practice of the State's forty-four year old mandated newborn screening program in which hospitals, birthing centers, and midwives draw blood from a baby's heel-no parental consent is required-so the sate can test for a variety of birth defects. Thus, plaintiffs acknowledge, \"babies who show detectable disorders often can be treated early to prevent disabling disorders from developing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs state they \"do not object to the State's mandated newborn screening program so long as safeguards are in place to destroy an infant's samples within a reasonable period of time.\" They state that they challenge defendants' alleged \"expropriating an infant's blood sample indefinitely, without their knowledge or consent, effectively making it their property for undisclosed non-consensual purposes unrelated to the purposes for which the infants' blood was originally drawn.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Moreover, plaintiffs contend, because \"the blood spots contain deeply private medical and genetic information, plaintiffs are concerned about the potential for misuse of that information and fear the possibility of discrimination against their children and perhaps even relatives through the use of such blood samples and research activity thereon.\" According to plaintiffs, \"[u]nder defendants' current policy and practice, researchers can use the infants' samples, which consist of five blood spots on a card, for cancer research, lab equipment calibration, and other undisclosed matters indefinitely, without the knowledge or consent of their parents, which are unrelated to the purposes for which the infants' blood was originally was drawn.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendants contend this Court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims under Rule 12(b)(1) because (1) Eleventh Amendment immunity bars plaintiffs' claims brought directly against DSHS and TAMU; (2) Eleventh Amendment immunity bars plaintiffs' claims brought against the individual defendants under the Texas Constitution and Texas common law; and (3) plaintiffs lack standing to bring this suit because they have not alleged an injury-in-fact. Defendants also contend plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) because: (1) there is no cause of action against the individual defendants directly under the United States Constitution; (2) plaintiffs have failed to allege a Fourth Amendment claim because there has been no unlawful search and seizure; (3) plaintiffs have failed to allege a Fourteenth Amendment claim because there has been no violation of constitutionally protected liberty or privacy rights; and (4) plaintiffs have stated no specific claim against any Texas A &amp; M defendant and therefore the claims against this defendant should be dismissed. Defendants additionally contend that, had plaintiffs brought suit against DSHS or TAMU \"as such claims should be brought-pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -they nevertheless would have stated no cognizable claims against DSHS or TAMU.\" Accordingly, defendants seek dismissal of plaintiffs' claims against DSHS and TAMU under Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to defendants' motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), plaintiffs do not dispute that they have misstated the individual defendants' positions. Accordingly, the style of the case shall be amended to reflect their correct designations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Regarding this Court's jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims, plaintiffs apparently do not dispute that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars plaintiff's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims brought directly against DSHS and TAMU. However, plaintiffs do argue: (1) Eleventh Amendment immunity does not bar plaintiffs' claims brought against the individual defendants; (2) Eleventh Amendment immunity does not bar claims brought under the Texas Constitution and Texas common law for injunctive and declaratory relief; and (3) that plaintiffs have standing to bring this action. Plaintiffs further argue they have stated claims upon which relief may be granted because: (1) plaintiffs have stated a cause of action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Texas Constitution and Texas common law; (2) plaintiffs have stated a Fourth Amendment claim; (3) plaintiffs have stated a claim for violation of constitutionally protected liberty and privacy rights; and (4) the Texas A &amp; M defendants' official roles in the NBS program are matters of fact which are not appropriate for resolution in a motion to dismiss. Defendants filed a reply contending that, even considering plaintiffs' responsive arguments, the motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Legislation passed by the Texas Legislature in the 81st Regular Legislative Session, HB-1672 and SB 2421 (hereinafter referred to as \"HB-1672\"), amends the existing law to add provisions for additional disclosures to parents, to allow for parents, legal guardians, and managing conservators to instruct DSHS to destroy an infant's blood spots after testing is complete and to address confidentiality and permissible post-testing use of the blood specimens. HB-1672 was signed into law on May 27, 2009, and was effective immediately. Defendants contend the new law, together with plans by DSHS to implement the new legislation, moots plaintiffs' lawsuit. Defendants address the mootness issue by a separate motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. Specifically, defendants argue HB-1672 satisfies all Fourth Amendment and constitutional privacy concerns raised by plaintiffs' lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that their claims remain a live controversy before the Court because newly enacted HB-1672, which defendants invoke, only partially provides plaintiffs prospective relief. Plaintiffs further argue that defendants fail to consider plaintiffs' position which seeks to provide relief for the class. Defendants reply that the relief plaintiffs seek has been afforded or will not redress their claims, they lack standing, and their claims are moot; notice of the Chapter 33 amendments is adequate to advise parents of their rights, including for the pre-HB-1672 group and the purported class; and lack of standing and/or mootness precludes class certification. Defendants additionally argue that plaintiff Nancy Pacheco's claims are moot because plaintiff Pacheco's child was not born at the time suit was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    I.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 12.001(a). Relevant to this case, Chapter 33 of the Texas Health and Safety Code confers authority upon DSHS to establish and carry out programs and activities to combat morbidity, including mental retardation, in persons who have heritable diseases, and to establish and maintain a laboratory to \"conduct experiments, projects, and other activities necessary\" to develop screening and diagnostic tests for such diseases and to discover methods to prevent and treat such diseases, and to \"serve other purposes considered necessary by the department to carry out the program.\" TEX.

Plaintiffs do not challenge the initial collection of blood which is used for NBS testing, and do not object to the State's mandated newborn screening program, so long as safeguards are in place to destroy an infant's samples within a reasonable period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants contend plaintiffs' complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because it does not specify any particular actions on defendants' part which gives rise to such violations. Plaintiffs allege that, since 2002, defendants have routinely collected blood samples from all babies in Texas at time of birth and stored this blood or \"spots\" indefinitely at the TAMHSC (the Texas A &amp; M University System Health Science Center) for undisclosed research unrelated to the purposes for which the blood was originally drawn, without the knowledge or consent of the parents, and will continue to do so. Plaintiffs further allege defendants' actions, \"done under color of state law and official authority, intentionally, and with complete, deliberate, conscious and callous indifference to the constitutional rights of plaintiffs' children and of the class, deprived them of their right to be free from unlawful search and seizure and continue to do so.\" The Court finds plaintiffs have pleaded enough facts to state a claim for relief under the Fourth Amendment which\n   is plausible on its face,\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and have pleaded factual content which allows this Court to draw the reasonable inference that defendants are liable,\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. at 1949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the alleged violation of plaintiffs' right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures.

Defendants contend plaintiffs make only a vague and generalized privacy claim without satisfying even the threshold requirement of such a Fourteenth Amendment claim-to define and clearly articulate a recognized specific liberty or privacy interest that they allege defendants are violating. Plaintiffs allege \"the infant blood spots contain deeply private medical and genetic information, and were expropriated without knowledge or consent,\" a claim which involves bodily integrity.

They maintain that, to the extent plaintiffs have any privacy interest in use of the stored blood specimens, after the NBS testing is completed, those interests are protected by a comprehensive federal regulatory scheme, by Texas law, and by DSHS (Texas Department of State Health Services) and TAMUS (Texas A &amp; M University System) policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs allege in their complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Not only does [defendants' handling of the blood spots] violate the law, but it violates standard, mandatory medical research protocols of first obtaining informed consent from subjects before they are studied, using a method that explains all the privacy facets of the study.

Nor have they disclosed what kind of financial interest or transactions are involved, such as taxpayer expense or whether the samples are sold.\" Moreover, plaintiffs continue, \"[p]rior to 2002, defendants engaged in\n   the same practice, but claim they kept the infant blood spots for a period of limited duration.\" With regard to plaintiff Mary Overath, plaintiffs allege she:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   had two children born prior to 2002, but she has no assurance or confidence that defendants have actually destroyed her children's blood sample. Nor does she have any idea whatever what kind of research was performed on her sons' blood samples and spots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Given the law governing motions to dismiss and the substantive claims made in this case, the Court declines to find at this early stage in the proceedings that defendants' citations to general protocols show that plaintiffs have failed to state a violation of Fourteenth Amendment liberty and privacy interests for defendants' alleged handling of their infants' blood spots since 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    4.

They also argue \"nor is there any claim to be made\" because \"no Texas A &amp; M defendant has anything to do with the newborn screening testing, and has no role in any policy or practice related to the NSB program other than to store the statutorily-authorized blood samples at the HSC-SRPH [Texas A &amp; M Health Science Center-School of Rural Public Health, which is part of TAMHSC, the Texas A &amp; M Health Science Center] and to occasionally process retrieval of specimens, only at the direction of DSHS [Texas Department of State Health Services].\" A plaintiff must generally \"identify a custom or policy which gives rise to the plaintiffs injury before a plaintiff may prevail.\"\n   <em>\n    Mack v.

Chapter 33 provides for screening of newborns (\"NBS\") for heritable diseases. TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 33.012. It confers authority upon DSHS (Texas Department of State Health Services) to conduct programs and activities to combat morbidity in persons who have heritable diseases, and to maintain a laboratory to (1) \"conduct experiments, projects, and other activities necessary\" to develop screening and diagnostic tests for such diseases, (2) discover methods to prevent and treat such diseases, and (3) \"serve other purposes considered necessary by the department to carry out the program.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3626680\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/529/519/#p527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33.002.

Those decisions were left to the discretion of DSHS, which is charged with specific public health responsibilities, as well as authority to establish programs and conduct activities for the protection and promotion of public health. TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 12.001(a). Before May of 2009, DSHS' activities involving the blood specimens at issue were conducted under this more general statutory authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    C. House Bill 1672 Amendments to Chapter 33\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants contend House Bill 1672, passed by the Texas Legislature in the 81st Regular Legislative Session, and signed into law on May 27, 2009, effective immediately, amended Chapter 33 in ways which specifically address plaintiffs' concerns in this lawsuit. The new law requires that DSHS develop a disclosure statement informing the parent of a newborn child:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   * That the genetic material used to conduct the newborn screening tests or \"specimens\" may be retained for use by the department or laboratory;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   * How the specimens are managed and used; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   * That the parent limit the use of the specimens by providing a written statement prohibiting the department from retaining the specimens or using them for any purpose other than the conducting of newborn screening tests authorized under this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 33.0111(a). Apart from mandating the content of the disclosure statement, the new law also specifies the form of the statement and the mechanics for its completion and return.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33.0111(b). These mandated disclosures are required to be made by the physician or other person attending the birth at the time the specimen is taken, and such disclosure must be verified by the physician or other person attending the birth using procedures developed by DSHS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33.0111(c), (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In addition to these disclosures, the new law provides a parent may, by signing a written statement on a form to be provided by DSHS, prohibit the department from retaining any genetic material related to the newborn screening tests or using it for any purpose other than the NBS testing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33.0112(a). This option to direct destruction is available to a parent regardless of when the specimen was drawn, and therefore applies to the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, or any other parent whose child's specimen is currently maintained by DSHS. If such demand is made the specimen must be destroyed within sixty days of receipt of the written statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 33.0112(b).

Specifically, such information is not subject to the Texas Public Information Act, is not subject to subpoena, and may not otherwise be released or made public except under the limited circumstances set out in\n   the new law, including with consent of the person authorized to give such consent. The new law provides a list of permissible post-testing uses for the blood spot specimens, including public health research purposes if approved by an institutional review board or privacy board of the department as authorized by HIPAA and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Defendants' Mootness and/or Lack of Standing Arguments Under HB-1672\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants contend plaintiffs' proposed class action claims are moot and/or plaintiffs lack standing to proceed because these recent amendments to Chapter 33 satisfy all Fourth Amendment and privacy concerns raised by plaintiffs' lawsuit. Regarding plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim, defendants argue the new law satisfies plaintiffs' concerns about consent and scope of the alleged \"search\" or \"seizure\" because it provides for notice to the parent of the uses to which the NBS specimens may be put (in addition to the NBS testing), and allows the parent to opt out of such use by giving notice directing DSHS to destroy the infant's blood specimen once the NBS testing is complete. According to defendants, \"[t]hese same disclosure, opt-out, and destruction-on-demand provisions of the new law also satisfy the privacy claims plaintiffs have asserted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs acknowledge that the question of whether plaintiffs' claim for prospective relief may be moot depends on implementation of legislation just passed by the Texas Legislature in HB-1672. Plaintiffs also do not dispute the amendments to Chapter 33 satisfy their request for destruction of the blood samples. They argue, however, \"[e]ven if they were to order destruction of their children's specimens, they cannot be certain that defendants have not used or permitted to be used their children's blood spots for purposes unrelated to newborn screening, or that information has not been unlawfully collected from the blood spot (such as DNA information) and stored in unknown databases.\" Plaintiffs therefore contend, under the case or controversy requirement, they continue to have a \"personal stake in the outcome\" of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   , 523 U.S. at 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p7\">\n    118 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   With the exception of plaintiff Pacheco, the Court agrees that the proposed class of plaintiffs have \"suffered or continue to be threatened with an actual injury traceable to\" defendants which is \"likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503101\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/1/#p7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The proposed class of plaintiffs seek an injunction directing defendants to: (1) destroy the blood spots and any information gathered therefrom (such as DNA profiling ); (2) certify the class and thereafter \"destroy all blood spots gathered since\n   2002 without informed parental consent or otherwise secure informed consent from affected parents to maintain such blood samples and spots\"; (3) advise plaintiffs as to what use the blood spots have been put and disclose all financial transactions involved in the use of blood spots; and (4) to the extent defendants have obtained information on the specimens, defendants must destroy this information or see to it that it is destroyed if it has come into the hands of another entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Amendments to Chapter 33 remain silent as to whether defendants must (1) secure permission for the specimens they have gathered or destroy the specimens; (2) advise to what use infants' blood spots already gathered have been put; and (3) disclose all financial transactions involved in the use of blood spots. Additionally, the amended section in Chapter 33 requiring disclosure applies only to parents giving birth after DSHS properly implements HB-1672, which DSHS has not yet done. It does not require disclosure to parents previously affected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 33.0111(c). Specifically, section 33.0111(c) requiring disclosure is applicable \"at the time a newborn child is subjected to screening tests\" and, although section 33.0112(a) allows parents prior to HB-1672's enactment to direct destruction, the amended Chapter 33 does not explicitly require parents be notified that their child's blood spot has been retained by DSHS in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As noted, defendants argue the new law contains specific protections for maintaining the confidentiality of information obtained or developed by DSHS under the newborn screening program. TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 33.017. This provision, however, does not address the blood spots protected by confidentiality laws which are already in the possession of DSHS without parental consent. Even if plaintiffs were to direct destruction of their samples as defendants suggest, they have no assurance their infants' blood spots have not been used for research or that information has not been gathered therefrom, such as DNA profiling, while in defendants' possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In this light, plaintiffs acknowledge the new law provides the ability for parents, guardians, or managing conservators (collectively referred to as parents) to direct destruction of their children's blood spots upon discovering the spots have been stored indefinitely. Plaintiffs, however, challenge HB-1672's \"silence on how already affected parents would be notified\" would be notified of the amendments. Plaintiffs argue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Notice to affected parents is absent in the new Chapter 33. Defendants accurately state the option to direct destruction is available to a parent regardless of when the specimen was drawn, and applies to any parent whose child's specimen is currently maintained by DSHS.\n   <em>\n    See Dfs' Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , Doc #25, at 6. However, parents cannot direct destruction if they are unaware their child's blood spot is being stored. Chapter 33 is silent to how the 2 to 4.2 million parents will even be made aware that their child's blood spot has been stored indefinitely for purposes unrelated to newborn screening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Defendants respond that plaintiffs' claims are moot because DSHS intends to conduct an extensive public outreach program to give statewide notice of the Chapter 33 amendments. As defendants note, however, courts have declined to find that a claim is moot under circumstances such as these where a defendants' proposed conduct is voluntary, as opposed to mandated by statute.\n   <em>\n    Buchanan v. Consolidated Stores Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"215709\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/217/178/\">\n    217 F.R.D. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. MD. 2003) (declining to find that plaintiff's\n   claims were moot where only assurance Court had that defendants would carry out particular action was defendants' voluntary enactment of policy or procedure);\n   <em>\n    Mack v. Suffolk County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"99344\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/191/16/#p21\">\n    191 F.R.D. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21 (D. Mass 2000) (declining to find that plaintiffs' claims were moot in absence of statutory imperative imposed upon defendants). At this early stage in the proceedings, and in the absence of an imperative imposed by the amendments to Chapter 33, the Court declines to find that plaintiffs' claims are moot or that plaintiffs lack standing based on defendants' voluntary assurance that all members of the proposed class will receive notice of HB-1762. For these and the reasons set forth above, to this extent, defendants' motion to dismiss or for summary judgment based on mootness is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   With regard to plaintiff Nancy Pacheco, defendants argue her claims are moot because her child is not yet born. Plaintiffs filed an advisory (docket no. 40) after briefing closed informing the Court that Ms. Pacheco's baby was born on August 14, 2009. Plaintiffs contend in their advisory that plaintiff Pacheco has stated a claim for relief despite the fact that her child was not yet born at the time suit was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In defending their case against mootness and lack of standing, plaintiffs take the position that \"[t]he salient question at this juncture in the case is what to do with the blood specimens that defendants secretly collected between 2002-2009, without legal authority and parents' knowledge or consent, and are now storing, and any information taken therefrom.\" Under plaintiffs' salient definition of the issues, plaintiff Pacheco would not be a member of the proposed class because her child's blood was not collected and stored between 2002 and 2009. This conclusion is supported by plaintiffs' definition of the proposed class set forth in their motion to certify this matter as a class action. (Docket no. 16). Plaintiffs state they \"seek class declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of all similarly situated parents who have given birth in Texas since 2002, and their infants' blood samples or 'spots' were routinely and unlawfully collected, and stored indefinitely, at the Texas A &amp; M Health Science Center School for Rural Public Health for undisclosed purposes unrelated to the purposes for which the infants' blood was originally drawn, without the knowledge or consent of the parents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Under this definition of the class, plaintiff Pacheco would not be included because, as set forth above, she does not satisfy the criteria plaintiffs has set forth the for proposed class members. To this extent, defendants' motion to dismiss for mootness shall be granted. In all other respects, the motion shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) should be granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, the Court finds that: (1) Eleventh Amendment immunity bars plaintiffs' claims brought directly against DSHS and TAMU; (2) Eleventh Amendment immunity bars plaintiffs' claims brought against the individual defendants under the Texas Constitution and Texas common law; and (3) plaintiffs lack standing to bring this suit against Roderick E. McCallum because they have not alleged an injury-in-fact. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) shall be granted to the extent that The Texas Department of State Health Services, Texas A &amp; M University, and Roderick E. McCallum will be dismissed as party-defendants to the above-styled and numbered cause; plaintiffs' claims brought under the Texas Constitution and Texas common law will also be dismissed. In the absence of any objection by plaintiffs, the style of the case shall\n   be amended to reflect that Nancy W. Dickey, M.D., is named as defendant \"in Her Official capacity as Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs of the Texas A &amp; M University System and President of the Texas A &amp; M University System Health Science Center.\" To the extent defendants move for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for plaintiffs' failure to state a claim, the motion is denied. Thus, plaintiffs' claims brought against defendants Lakey and Dickey in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures and the Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from unlawful intrusions into privacy rights remain pending for disposition. The Court further finds that defendants' motion to dismiss or for summary judgment based on mootness should be granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, the Court finds that Nancy Pacheco should be dismissed as a party-plaintiff to this case. In all other respects, the motion shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Original Complaint (docket no. 11) pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is GRANTED in PART and DENIED in PART. Specifically, the motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(1) is GRANTED such that The Texas Department of State Health Services, Texas A &amp; M University, and Roderick E. McCallum are DISMISSED as party-defendants to the above-styled and numbered cause and plaintiffs' claims brought under the Texas Constitution and Texas common law are DISMISSED.
