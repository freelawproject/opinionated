INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This action arises from a fire that caused damage to personal property and a structure located in Independence, Iowa. Plaintiffs Mark and Debra Merfeld and Merfeld Transport, Inc., allege that the fire was caused by a defective refrigerator manufactured and sold by defendant Dometic Corporation (Dometic).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is currently before me on two motions. The first is Dometic's motion (Doc. No. 26) for summary judgment. Dometic's supporting brief (Doc. No. 26-5) includes,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , arguments concerning the alleged spoliation of evidence. Plaintiffs filed a resistance (Doc. No. 36) and Dometic filed a reply (Doc. No. 43-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The second, filed the same day, is Dometic's separate motion (Doc. No. 28) for the sanction of dismissal based on spoliation of evidence. In support of this motion, Dometic relies entirely on the spoliation section of its summary judgment brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 28-1 at 1. Plaintiffs filed a resistance (Doc. No. 33) and Dometic filed a reply (Doc. No. 35).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   I find that oral argument is not necessary on either motion. Both are fully submitted and ready for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action on August 15, 2016, by filing a complaint (Doc. No. 1) against Dometic. They allege that on October 10, 2014, plaintiffs Mark and Debra Merfeld owned a 2003 Forest River Cardinal 33TS RV (the RV) and that Dometic had \"manufactured, designed and/or assembled refrigerators that were equipped in Forest River's RVs.\" Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, 10. They further allege that during the relevant time period, Dometic was the \"exclusive retailer of Dometic brand refrigerators in the United States\" and, upon information and belief, that the RV was \"equipped with a refrigerator designed, Manufactured [sic], assembled and sold\" by Dometic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to the complaint, a failure in the RV's refrigerator caused a fire that consumed the RV and caused damage to a building owned by Mark and Debra Merfeld and to personal property owned by all of the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. The complaint includes the following counts against Dometic: (1) negligence in the manufacturing and/or design of the refrigerator, in the construction and/or assembly of the refrigerator and in the distribution of the refrigerator; (2) breach of express and/or implied warranty; (3) post sale failure to warn and (4) strict liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 3-4. Plaintiffs invoke the court's diversity jurisdiction and allege damages in excess of $75,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dometic filed an answer (Doc. No. 5) on September 15, 2016, in which it denies liability and raises various defenses. Dometic then filed the motions at issue on November 27, 2017. In responding to Dometic's summary judgment motion, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Count 2 (breach of express and/or implied warranty) and Count 3 (post sale failure to warn). Doc. No. 36-5 at 3 n. 2. Thus, Count 1 (negligent manufacture and/or design) and Count 4 (strict liability) remain for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. RELEVANT FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following facts are undisputed except where otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mark and Debra Merfeld are residents of Iowa and owners of a storage building (the Building) located in Independence, Iowa. They owned personal property in the Building. Merfeld Transport, Inc., is an Iowa corporation that also owned personal property in the Building. The Building was over 12,000 square feet, was wired for electricity and contained numerous vehicles, boats, farm equipment, tractors and other items, including the RV. Debra Merfeld purchased the RV in 2005. The RV contained a refrigerator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dometic is a retailer of various products, including refrigerators. Prior to 2009, Dometic purchased refrigerators from Dometic AB, a distinct entity, to sell to its customers. In 2009, Dometic assumed manufacturing responsibilities from Dometic AB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2006, and again in 2007 or 2008, Dometic issued a recall for Dometic brand RV refrigerators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 11, 2014, a fire occurred at the Building. The fire caused damage to the RV, the Building, and other personal property stored in the Building, with the dollar value of the loss allegedly reaching at least $1.5 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the\n   fire, plaintiffs were insured by State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State Farm). State Farm retained George Howe, a fire investigator, to determine the cause of the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Howe viewed the scene for the first time on October 14, 2014. He did not conduct a thorough investigation at the time, as he intended to wait for a joint inspection with representatives of parties who may have been responsible for the fire. On October 16, 2014, State Farm sent a notice of claim and inspection to Dometic. This notice stated that Dometic may be responsible for the loss and invited Dometic to send a representative to participate in the joint inspection, which was scheduled to take place on November 4, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before the joint inspection took place, Mark Merfeld and his son Ryan Merfeld, along with other individuals, removed debris from the north, east and west sides of the Building, up to the area in which the RV was located. Some cleanup also occurred on the south side of the building, without disturbing the RV. A substantial amount of debris was removed from the scene before the joint inspection occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Additional facts will be addressed as necessary, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.

Thus, Iowa law applies to this action. As noted above, the remaining causes of action are (1) strict liability and (2) negligence in the manufacturing and/or design of the refrigerator, construction and/or assembly of the refrigerator and distribution of the refrigerator.

Just as one who has some role in the assembly process retains statutory immunity absent some contribution to the product's dangerous condition, the same concept logically applies to one who has some role in the design process. Here, then, Dometic's limited involvement in the design of the refrigerators\n   manufactured by Dometic AB cannot deprive Dometic of statutory immunity absent evidence that Dometic's activities \"contribute[d] to the condition that underlies\" plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   That condition involves the refrigerator's boiler tube. The recall notice Dometic issued for Forest River RVs in 2007 stated that the refrigerators in certain RVs \"may have a defect in the boiler tube\" and \"pressurized coolant solution could be released into an area where an ignition source (gas flame) is present.\" Doc. No. 36-2 at 186. This notice also stated that the release of the coolant under certain conditions could result in a fire.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8464206\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/721/159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dometic's recall notice issued in 2006 stated that the potential defect in the refrigerators is \"associated with [the] cooling unit at the back\" and that some of the \"potentially affected refrigerators have experienced a fatigue crack that may develop in the boiler tube in the area of the weld between the boiler tube and the heater pocket.\" Doc. No. 26-2 at 14. The notice stated that this defect may release coolant into an area where an ignition source is present.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8464206\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/721/159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs' experts state that the RV refrigerator at issue in this case experienced a failure in the boiler section. Doc. No. 36-1 at 38. Specifically, corrosion of the boiler tube allowed combustible gases to be released and ignite, causing the fire. Doc. No. 36-2 at 161; 36-1 at 71-72, 76, 85; 36-1 at 38; 36-3 at 2. Thus, the alleged defect in this case, according to plaintiffs' experts, relates to the refrigerator's boiler tube.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As described above, McConnell, on behalf of Dometic, had some limited involvement in design-related activities with regard to refrigerators made and sold by Dometic AB. However, the record contains no evidence that McConnell's activities related in any way to the boiler tube. Nor is there any other evidence suggesting that Dometic had any role in designing the boiler tube or otherwise \"contribute[d] to the condition that underlies\" plaintiffs' claims. As such, I find as a matter of law that Dometic was not a \"designer\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20613.18\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 613.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Because Dometic was neither a \"manufacturer\" nor a \"designer,\" it is entitled to statutory immunity under Iowa law as to plaintiffs' product defect claims.

Remaining Negligence Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Apart from their product defect claims, plaintiffs claim Dometic was negligent in the assembly and distribution of the refrigerator. However, plaintiffs do not dispute that Dometic did not assemble the refrigerator. As such, I will grant summary judgment in Dometic's favor on the negligent assembly claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As for negligent distribution, Dometic argues that Iowa law does not recognize a cause of action against a seller for \"negligent distribution\" and notes that plaintiffs have not presented any evidence supporting such a claim, even if it exists.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20613.18\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20613.18\">\n    at 15-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doc. Nos. 26-2 at 115; 26-3 at 9. Ryan Merfeld, Mark Merfeld's son, estimated that twenty 40-foot semi-trailers of material were removed and between 20-30 people came through the Building prior to the inspection. Doc. No. 26-1 at 12. The RV itself was preserved and covered with tarp during the cleanup. Doc. No. 36-3 at 168. The parties agree that the Building had been substantially altered when the November 4 inspection occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The parties also agree that Combs and Howe directed Mark Merfeld not to alter the scene in any way before the joint inspection. Doc. Nos. 26-3 at 28, 30-31. Howe also suggested to Merfeld that the RV and the area between the RV and the wall be covered with tarp in order to preserve it. Doc.

He claims that he did not authorize a cleanup to the extent that the building was ultimately cleaned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Howe's testimony about what he told Mark Merfeld is similar. Doc. No. 26-2 at 89, 90. Howe stated that he authorized Mark Merfeld to inventory a portion of the building and \"to just stay away from the area around the RV.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94. He also said the Merfelds could knock down a precarious wall on the north side of the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, he testified that he did not believe the conversation authorized Mark Merfeld to remove and dispose of the physical debris to the extent it was ultimately cleaned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Mark Merfeld testified that he cleaned up some \"trash and fire debris\" but, to his\n   knowledge, did not remove or destroy evidence because any items found in or around the location of the fire, the RV, were preserved. Doc. No. 36-1 at 20. He stated that he was instructed not to clean up anything in the first days after the fire and did not do so, but then Combs gave him permission to \"clean up everything up to the point and around\" the RV. Doc. No. 36-3 at 171, 173.

He also testified that they were told to keep the side near the RV, the south wall, intact because of the \"electricity ... just in case they found something over there,\" but they were allowed to clean up everything else.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He stated they were never told specifically not to disturb the scene to the east, north or west side of the RV.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Under these circumstances, it is clear that State Farm's directives to the Merfelds were unclear and, indeed, bordered on the ridiculous. With a joint inspection already scheduled, it is absurd that State Farm authorized its insureds to take any action concerning the Building. However, the evidence does not permit a finding of intentional destruction of evidence\n   <em>\n    for the purpose of suppressing the truth.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs held off on doing any work with regard to the Building until they received permission from Combs. The extensive cleanup work that followed arose from a miscommunication about the scope of the area plaintiffs were authorized to clean. There is no evidence that either State Farm or the Merfelds acted with the intent to destroy evidence that would have revealed an alternative cause of the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

Due to the cleanup, Dometic was unable to perform a thorough inspection of other areas of the building to determine whether there was an alternative origin point for the fire. Walter Oliveaux, Dometic's fire inspector, stated in his report that testing of other possible fire origins was not possible due to the extent of cleaning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107-08.

No. 36-3 at 165. Ryan Merfeld also reported that he first noticed smoke and flames between the wall of the camper and where the kitchen was located in the camper. Doc. Nos. 36-3 at 167; 26-3 at 106. Plaintiffs argue that these accounts are sufficient to show there was no prejudice because the fire clearly started at the RV and the RV itself was preserved. However, the existence of these eyewitness accounts do not change the fact that the Dometic was deprived of the opportunity to investigate other possible causes. According to Oliveaux, because of the cleanup there was \"extremely limited evidence to verify the statements provided by all parties and virtually no evidence to support any statements of Ryan Merfeld.\" Doc. No. 26-3 at 107-08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Clearly, the fire scene is the unique and primary source of evidence concerning the cause of the fire. The significant disturbance that occurred in this case was prejudicial to Dometic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   , 354 F.3d at 748. Thus, but for the lack of evidence establishing an intent to destroy evidence, I would find spoliation to be an alternative basis for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     VI. CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   1. Defendant's motion (Doc. No. 26) for summary judgment is granted in its entirety and all claims are hereby dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   2. Trial, currently scheduled to begin July 23, 2018, is hereby canceled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   3. Judgment shall enter in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   4. Defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 28) for spoliation of evidence is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    In their resistance (Doc. No. 33), plaintiffs argue that Dometic's separate motion for sanctions is improper and should have been brought as a motion for summary judgment (which, of course, it was). Plaintiffs cite no authority for this proposition. In fact, Eighth Circuit authority suggests that a request for sanctions based on spoliation may be brought as an independent motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Menz v. New Holland N.

Iowa 2011). In any event, Dometic covered all of its bases by including its spoliation arguments in its summary judgment motion and its sanctions motion. I will address both motions in this order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The parties dispute whether the refrigerator has been identified as a Dometic brand refrigerator.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    As will be discussed further below, the parties dispute whether Dometic had some role in manufacturing and/or designing refrigerators prior to 2009.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The precise amount of the loss is unclear. Dometic claims it is over $1.5 million. Doc. No. 26-5 at 5. Plaintiffs claim it is over $1.7 million. Doc. No. 36-5 at 3. The exact number is immaterial for purposes of the pending motions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    As noted above, with regard to a design defect claim the Iowa Supreme Court has eliminated the labels of strict liability and negligence, instead directing that the claim be designated \"as a design defect claim without reference to strict liability or negligence.\"\n    <em>\n     Wright\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11345951\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/652/159/#p169\">\n     652 N.W.2d at 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court also noted that the elements of a design defect claim are based on negligence principles.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11345951\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/652/159/#p169\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11345951\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/652/159/#p169\">\n     at 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because \u00a7 613.18(1) provides immunity only with regard to \"any suit based upon strict liability in tort or breach of implied warranty of merchantability,\" there is some question of whether design defect claims still fall within the scope of the statutory immunity.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Anderson v. Kmart Corp.\n    </em>\n    , No. 4:13-cv-00216-RAW,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2011514683\">\n     2014 WL 11514683\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *4 (S.D. Iowa Oct. 20, 2014) (identifying the issue without deciding it). As in\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    , the parties have not briefed the question of whether design defect claims in the post-\n    <em>\n     Wright\n    </em>\n    era are subject to \u00a7 613.18. I do note that the statute itself refers to \"an alleged defect in the original\n    <em>\n     design\n    </em>\n    or manufacture of the product.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20613.18\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7 613.18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1)(a) (emphasis added).
