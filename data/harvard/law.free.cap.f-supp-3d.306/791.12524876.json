In December 2013, Edward and Vickie Fangman (represented by the same counsel involved in this case) filed a complaint against Genuine Title involving essentially identical allegations in the Circuit Court of Baltimore County that was removed to this Court in January 2014. (\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Fangman v. Genuine Title, LLC\n  </em>\n  , Case No. RDB-14-0081 (D. Md.), at ECF No. 1 (\"\n  <em>\n   Fangman\n  </em>\n  \").) The Fangmans alleged that Genuine Title, in exchange for the referral of title services on their mortgage loan, paid cash kickbacks to loan brokers and provided \"marketing materials for free or at a drastically-reduced rate (collectively 'Free Marketing Materials') for various loan officers who were part of the mortgage lending process.\" (\n  <em>\n   Fangman,\n  </em>\n  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-23, ECF No. 2.)\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At the request of counsel, this Court conducted a\n   <em>\n    consolidated\n   </em>\n   motions hearing for five cases related to Genuine Title's alleged kickback scheme with various financial institutions.

(\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , Mem. 3, ECF No. 7-1.) In early 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel used these records to identify and notify affected borrowers and prospective plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   4.) By June 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel was \"able to pull data ... that appears to represent ... buyers' names, addresses, telephone numbers, property addresses, settlement dates, lender and in some cases mortgage broker information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 150-2 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 2, 2015, plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   filed a First Amended Complaint naming other financial institutions, including E Mortgage Management, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    See Fangman\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 47.) That First Amended Complaint in\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   alleged violations of RESPA, Maryland's state-law analog to RESPA, and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   filed a Second Amended Complaint on May 20, 2015, adding additional parties and clarifying some of their previous allegations.

This Court applied that test in the\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   action in the context of Plaintiffs' counsel's significant investigatory efforts, which by June 2015 had successfully identified borrowers referred to Genuine Title between 2006 through 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fangman v. Genuine Title, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206600509\">\n    2016 WL 6600509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Md. Nov. 8, 2016).) Accordingly, this Court found in December 2015 that facts had been sufficiently concealed from the\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, who did not know about their claim until contacted by counsel.\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208315704\">\n    2015 WL 8315704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. In terms of due diligence, this Court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs' counsel has undergone a large-scale review of Defendant Genuine Title's computer system. It is only through this review, aided by early discovery and a proprietary software system, that potential plaintiffs have been identified. The Second Amended Complaint, filed by Plaintiffs' counsel, clearly states that \"[a]ll Plaintiffs learned of the illegal kickbacks less than one year prior to filing of the [Second Amended] Complaint and could not have known about the Kickback Scheme until contacted by undersigned counsel.\" Second Am. Compl. at \u00b6 94, ECF No. 138. In light of these unique circumstances, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that equitable tolling is warranted in this case and that all Plaintiffs, with the exception of the Eagle National Plaintiffs, brought their claims within one year of the date they could have first known of their cause of action through due diligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Fangman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208315704\">\n    2015 WL 8315704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following discovery concerning Genuine Title's business practices and relationship with other lenders, some defendants have struck class settlements which have been the subject of public filings and class notices. For example, Plaintiffs' counsel and E Mortgage Management, LLC requested preliminary approval of a settlement on October 27, 2016, proposing the following E Mortgage Settlement Class for settlement purposes only:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   All individuals in the United States who were borrowers on a federally related mortgage loan (as defined under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202602\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) from E Mortgage Management, LLC (\"E Mortgage\") that was closed through Genuine Title either (1) whose E Mortgage loan was originated by loan officers Jeffrey Krasner or Pat Walker (\"Subclass 1\"); or (2) whose E Mortgage loan was originated prior to May 14, 2012, or after July 2, 2013, and not by loan officers Jeffrey Krasner or Pat Walker (\"Subclass 2\"). The Settlement Class shall not include any employees of E Mortgage, or its related entities, any members or employees of Plaintiffs' Counsel, the Judge(s) presiding over this action, any members of the Judge's immediate family or staff, or any persons who submit a complete and valid Request for Exclusion by the Exclusion Deadline.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   , Mem.

(\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 468.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Enforcement Actions by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") and Maryland Attorney General\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") and the Maryland Attorney General initiated an enforcement action in this Court on January 22, 2015 against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. predicated on similar schemes involving Genuine Title. (\n   <em>\n    See CFPB v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. RDB-15-0179 (D. Md.) (\"\n   <em>\n    Lender Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   \").) The pendency and ultimate settlement of the\n   <em>\n    Lender Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   in January 2015 was widely publicized. Specifically, the CFPB issued a press release on January 22, 2015, and local and national news media, including\n   <em>\n    The Baltimore Sun\n   </em>\n   , CNN, and the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   , published stories about the case. (\n   <em>\n    See Dobbins, et al. v. Bank of America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    N.A.,\n   </em>\n   RDB-17-540 (D. Md.), ECF Nos. 17-3, 17-4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The CFPB and Attorney General also filed an enforcement action on April 29, 2015 directly against Genuine Title, its principals, and affiliates arising out of the same alleged scheme. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CFPB v. Genuine Title LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. RDB-15-1235 (D. Md.) (\"\n   <em>\n    Genuine Title\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   \") ). The CFPB issued a press release on April 29, 2015 in which the CFPB outlined the enforcement action against Genuine Title based on the same facts alleged by the\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs. On May 1, 2015, the CFPB and Maryland Attorney General announced a settlement with Genuine Title, and this Court entered a Stipulated Final Judgment and Order approving the settlement. (\n   <em>\n    See Genuine Title Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18.) As with the\n   <em>\n    Lender Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Genuine Title Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   settlement was also reported by various news media outlets and other publications in May 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See Dobbins,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17-4.) The settlement orders in these enforcement actions explicitly contemplate related litigation by affected consumers (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g., Genuine Title Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   , Genuine Title Order 5, ECF No. 18), but neither the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau nor the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland required that any financial institutions issue formal notices to the public (\n   <em>\n    see Lender Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   , JPMorgan Chase Order, ECF No. 10;\n   <em>\n    Lender Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   , Wells Fargo Order, ECF No. 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. James v. Acre Mortgage &amp; Financial, Inc. (RDB-17-1734)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff Renita James closed her loan with Acre Mortgage &amp; Financial (\"Acre\") on or about December 21, 2012 and filed this action on June 23, 2017. Plaintiff's Class Action Complaint asserts a RESPA claim based on an alleged kickback scheme between Genuine Title and Brian and Jeffrey Krasner, who were employees of Acre from May 2012 to January 2013. The Krasners allegedly created their own company in 2008, Morgan Management, to receive these personal kickbacks. (\n   <em>\n    See James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   Compl. 9, ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff James seeks to represent the following purported class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   All individuals in the United States who were borrowers on a federally related mortgage loan (as defined under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202602\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) originated or brokered by Acre Mortgage &amp; Financial, Inc. for which Genuine Title provided a settlement service, as identified in Section 1100 on the HUD-1, between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014. Exempted from this class is any person who, during the period of January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2014, was an employee, officer, member and/or agent of Acre Mortgage &amp; Financial, Inc., Genuine Title LLC, Competitive Advantage Media Group LLC, Brandon Glickstein, Inc., and/or Dog Days Marketing, LLC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   14.)

At oral argument, Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant's\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   failure to disclose the true nature of its relationship with Genuine Title by sending notices to all customers known to have used Genuine Title's services constitutes an act of\n   <em>\n    continued\n   </em>\n   concealment by the Defendant.

What's more, the Krasners-\"the only individuals at Acre who Plaintiff specifically accuses of engaging in improper behavior with Genuine Title-were involved in the\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   case for identical activities,\" and the extensive\n   court filings in that case were discoverable public records.

Plaintiff's counsel filed suit in January 2015 against E Mortgage Management, Jeffrey Krasner's prior employer (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   , Mem. Prelim. Approval 6, ECF No. 394-1), and counsel acknowledged they gained comprehensive access to Genuine Title data by June 2015. Accordingly, the Defendant's alleged continuing fraudulent concealment was simply not the only circumstance delaying the filing of this lawsuit. In spite of this fact, Plaintiff argues that this Court should focus on the Defendant's \"ongoing\" failure to broadly notify customers of a potential claim related to Genuine Title. Plaintiff's view of equitable tolling essentially demands that this Court order the Defendant, and similarly situated lenders, to send out such notices to stop the ongoing equitable tolling of any RESPA claim by any Genuine Title customer. This theory swallows RESPA's one-year statute of limitations, which was set by Congress, and asks this Court to regulate lenders in a way that was specifically not requested by those federal and state enforcement agencies that have actively investigated Genuine Title and its associated financial institutions. (\n   <em>\n    See Lender Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   (RDB-15-0179), JPMorgan Chase Order, ECF No. 10;\n   <em>\n    Lender Enforcement Action\n   </em>\n   , Wells Fargo Order, ECF No. 11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Furthermore, the Defendant's alleged concealment effort did not \"st[and] in [James'] way\" up until the time she was contacted by counsel.\n   <em>\n    Menominee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, it was\n   <em>\n    within the Plaintiff's control\n   </em>\n   to discover a basis for her action in May 2015 at the latest,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   over a year and a half prior to being contacted by counsel on March 10, 2017 and more than two years prior to the filing of the Complaint on June 23, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n    at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike in the\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   case, the Plaintiff in this case could have discovered a substantial amount of public information on Genuine Title's illegal scheme that was brought to light through the\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   and enforcement litigation. The publicly available information was sufficiently specific and applicable to the Plaintiff that contact by counsel was not the only method by which she could have learned of her claim. While Plaintiff contends she was unaware of the\n   <em>\n    illegal\n   </em>\n   nature of the relationship between Genuine Title and the Defendant, she does not disclaim knowledge of having\n   used Genuine Title for title and settlement services. (\n   <em>\n    See James\n   </em>\n   , Compl \u00b6 56, ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff here alleges that Genuine Title provided kickbacks to Acre in the form of \"Referring Cash\" and \"Free Marketing Materials\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17), the same two methods alleged in\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see Fangman\n   </em>\n   , Second Am.

She merely argues that she was not yet on \"notice\" of the need to search for such information. The issue of notice, however, is not relevant to the extraordinary circumstances analysis, which asks whether the circumstances combine to render \"critical information,\n   <em>\n    reasonable investigation notwithstanding\n   </em>\n   , undiscoverable.\"\n   <em>\n    Gould\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1807330\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/905/738/#p745\">\n    905 F.2d at 745-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Supermarket of Marlinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413062\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/119/#p122\">\n    71 F.3d at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring the plaintiff to show that it \"failed to discover those facts within the statutory period, despite ... the exercise of due diligence\").

Plaintiff alleges that between 2009 and 2014 she and other class members were \"deprived of impartial and fair competition between settlement service providers in violation of RESPA and paid more for [their] settlement services\" because Genuine Title used a portion of each settlement payment to cover the cost the cash payments, marketing materials, and marketing credits. (\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 71, ECF No. 1.)
