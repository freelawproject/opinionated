Through counsel, he brings this action under the Rehabilitation Act, the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), and the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause to prohibit defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from transferring him to a detention facility outside of this judicial district. Plaintiff's interests are represented in this litigation through his parent and next friend, Avram Palamaryuk. Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Currently before the Court is defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Dkt. 21. Plaintiff opposes the motion. Dkt. 25. Having considered the parties' submissions, the balance of the record, and the governing law, the Court recommends that defendants' motion to dismiss be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, as explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following factual allegations are taken from plaintiff's amended complaint. Plaintiff is a native of the U.S.S.R. and a citizen of Ukraine who came to the United States as a refugee in 1995 when he was six years old. Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 2. Shortly thereafter, he became a lawful permanent resident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff was the victim of two serious assaults, one in 2009 and a second in 2013, which resulted in head injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. Following the second assault, he started to experience short-term memory loss, such as difficulty recalling the details of recent events, and cognitive impairments, such as difficulty with reading comprehension and occasional difficulty understanding spoken speech.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In March 2016, ICE officials arrested plaintiff, detained him at the Northwest Detention Center, and placed him in removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. He proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and following a merits hearing on October 3-4, 2016, the immigration judge denied his request for asylum-related protections and ordered him removed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 10, 2016, plaintiff hired attorney Minda Thorward to appeal the removal order to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") and to help him pursue other immigration-related relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Through Ms. Thorward, plaintiff filed an appeal with the BIA, requesting a remand because he demonstrated indicia of incompetency during his first merits hearing before the immigration judge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Ms. Thorward met with plaintiff in person numerous times to work on his case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 13, 2017, while plaintiff's BIA appeal was pending, defendants issued a \"Detainee Transfer Notification,\" informing plaintiff that he would be moved to a detention facility in Alabama.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. At Ms. Thorward's request, defendants delayed plaintiff's transfer for one week to permit him to meet with his mother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. On March 17, 2017, Ms. Thorward made an in-person oral request to Jack Lippard, ICE Supervisory Detention &amp; Removal Officer, that plaintiff be permitted to remain at the Northwest Detention Center because it would make representing him very difficult if he were moved to Alabama.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On Sunday, March 19, 2017, Ms. Thorward sent a letter via email and fax, asking for confirmation from defendants that they would not transfer plaintiff as scheduled on Monday, March 20, 2017, and asserting that moving him would interfere with their ongoing attorney-client relationship and would impact his rights under the Rehabilitation Act due to his disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. On the morning of Monday, March 20, 2017, plaintiff was advised by defendants that he would be transferred to Alabama later that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At approximately 6:00 p.m. on March 20, 2017, plaintiff filed his original complaint and an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") prohibiting his transfer out of this judicial district. Dkt. 1. Ms. Thorward and plaintiff submitted declarations attesting that plaintiff requires in-person meetings with his attorney for him to effectively understand her. Dkt. 3 at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; Dkt. 4 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14 at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 22, 29. That evening, the Honorable James L. Robart granted a TRO and enjoined plaintiff's transfer for 14 days. Dkt. 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 (Amended Order Granting TRO).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 23, 2017, the government filed a motion with the BIA to remand the removal proceedings to the immigration judge, and the BIA remanded plaintiff's case for a competency evaluation. Dkt. 14 at \u00b6 27. On April 18, 2017, Dr. Ivan Molton, a licensed psychologist specializing in psychology and traumatic brain injury and a professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Washington, performed a traumatic brain injury assessment and neuropsychological evaluation of plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. His report revealed significant cognitive impairment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With regard to immigration proceedings, Dr. Molton stated that plaintiff \"does not have the mental competency to participate ... without safeguards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Dr. Molton recommended that plaintiff meet with his attorney in person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On June 5, 2017, the immigration judge held a competency hearing and found that plaintiff was incompetent but could proceed with safeguards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the TRO expired in these proceedings, plaintiff did not seek a preliminary injunction. His counsel filed a status report informing the Court that defendants notified Ms. Thorward by telephone that they are no longer seeking to transfer him out of this district at the present time. Dkt. 8 at 2. Counsel argued, however, that the government's voluntary cessation did not render the matter moot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 19, 2017, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which alleges that defendants violated his rights under the Rehabilitation Act, the APA, and the Due Process Clause, and seeks an order prohibiting defendants from transferring him outside of this judicial district. Dkt. 14. On November 7, 2017, after several extensions of time, defendants filed the motion to dismiss that is currently before the Court. Dkt. 21. Plaintiff filed his response on December 11, 2017. Dkts. 23-25. Defendants filed their reply on December 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiff fails to state a viable Rehabilitation Act claim, the Court does not have jurisdiction over his APA and Due Process Clause claims, and even if the Court does have jurisdiction, plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Dkt. 21. As discussed below, the Court concludes that plaintiff should be permitted to proceed with his Rehabilitation Act and Due Process claims, but his APA claim should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standards for Dismissal Under Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court construes the complaint in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Livid Holdings Ltd. v.

Section 504 of the Act provides: \"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Defendants challenge plaintiff's factual allegations by arguing that he could work with his counsel remotely, continue to meet with her in person, obtain new counsel, or rely on his guardian.
