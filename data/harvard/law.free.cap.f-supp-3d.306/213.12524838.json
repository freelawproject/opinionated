And the proceeds of a business operated in violation of that statute are subject to civil forfeiture. The government typically deploys these statutory authorities against non-bank financial institutions like wire remitters and currency exchangers. Rarely, if ever, have they been applied to ostensible nonfinancial professional-services firms that also transfer funds for clients. Until now, apparently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The government alleges that Pennsylvania-based lobbyist Joseph Szlavik ran an unlicensed money transmitting business by accepting large sums of money from foreign clients-principally the President of Gabon, Ali Bongo, and his associates-and then, for a commission, transferring those funds from accounts he controlled to numerous recipients in the United States as directed by the clients. The underlying funds, the government suggests, are derived from official corruption on the part of President Bongo and his family. On the basis of these allegations, the government filed a verified complaint seeking forfeiture of $475,405.21 in seized funds that it contends are connected to Szlavik's business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Szlavik and his wife have asserted claims to the money and now move to dismiss the government's complaint. The Szlaviks insist that Mr. Szlavik does not operate a money transmitting business but rather a government-affairs and public-relations \"consultancy\" which is beyond the reach of the money transmitting statute as a matter of law. But this argument rests more on semantics than substance. While Szlavik may offer bona fide professional services to his clients, the complete nature of his business activities remains disputed at this stage. The government's theory is that among the suite of services he has provided is money transmitting. And its complaint, while novel perhaps, contains sufficient allegations concerning the volume, frequency, and circumstances of Szlavik's money transfers to bring his purported activities within the broad ambit of the statute, regardless of what name one assigns them. The Court will therefore deny the Szlaviks' motion to dismiss and permit the case to proceed to discovery, where the factual record can be developed further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

But, at the threshold, the Szlaviks contend that the government has failed to plead that Mr. Szlavik has engaged in \"money transmitting\" as defined in \u00a7 1960(b)(2), which would mean that his conduct falls outside of subsection (b) altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Specifically, the Szlaviks argue that the government has not alleged that Mr. Szlavik \"offered the services of his alleged 'money transmitting business'\n   <em>\n    to the public\n   </em>\n   .\" Reply at 11 (citing \u00a7 1960(b)(2) ). This argument faces two potential obstacles. First, as noted above, the statute says that \" 'money transmitting'\n   <em>\n    includes\n   </em>\n   transferring funds on or behalf of the public by all means....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201960\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Congress's use of the word \"includes\" generally indicates that what comes next is \"illustrative, not exclusive.\"\n   <em>\n    Puerto Rico Mar. Shipping Auth. v.

The parties have not presented any legislative history on this point and the case law interpreting this language is sparse. But based solely on the statutory language and the structure and purpose of the statute, the Court is inclined to accept the Szlaviks' more restrictive interpretation: that this is one of the rare statutes where \"includes\" should be read as \"means.\" The language in subsection (b)(2) is so capacious that it is hard to imagine Congress intended it as merely illustrative. That interpretation would leave courts with no meaningful boundary as to what counts as money transmitting; it would potentially sweep in all conduct and make subsection (b)(2) unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corley v.

But a business need not participate in systematic money transmissions that amount to matters of national concern in order to qualify as a \"domestic financial institution.\" The actual definition of \"domestic financial institution\" is found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205312\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and it is broader than the label suggests.

The relevant Treasury Department regulations echo this broad understanding of \"financial institution\"-the term covers \"any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business concern\" who accepts currency or funds and transmits the currency or funds \"by any means\" or engages \"in the transfer of funds.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201010.100\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1010.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (t)(3) ; (ff)(5)(i).

They also fall within the broad definition of \"financial institution\" in \u00a7 5312 and its implementing Treasury regulations (for instance, a person who engages in the transmission of funds \"as a business in an informal money transfer system\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Szlaviks argue that Mr. Szlavik's business falls outside even these broad definitions of a \"money transmitting business\" and \"financial institution\" because any funds transfers that he executed were merely courtesies \"incidental\" to his nonfinancial consulting services. Mot. Dismiss at 21. Speaking to this point, the Treasury regulations provide that whether a person engages in money transmitting is \"a matter of facts and circumstances\" and someone who \"[a]ccepts and transmits funds only integral to the sale of goods or the provision of services, other than money transmission services\" is not a money transmitter.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201010.100\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ff)(5)(ii). The facts and circumstances here may ultimately establish that the money transfers catalogued in the complaint fit within this safe harbor. But for now the government's allegations support an inference that Szlavik was paid specifically for transmitting funds rather than for other services-for instance, when he retained a \"fee\" from the bulk cash he allegedly imported from Gabon and distributed to people in the United States-and therefore that his funds transfers were not all \"integral\" to other bona fide transactions. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. That is enough to sustain the government's complaint at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In a similar vein, the Szlaviks suggest that applying \u00a7 1960 to businesses that transfer funds as part of work they do for clients would subject other professional services firms, including law firms, to misguided prosecutions and civil forfeiture actions. Mot. Dismiss at 21. This concern may well be valid. But the Court's job at this juncture is to decide whether the government has statutory authority to seek forfeiture based on the conduct alleged in its complaint. It is not to predict how the government might choose to exercise its authority in future cases. In any event, the government has described a number of transfers-such as those to President Bongo's ex-wife, a jewelry store, and a dentist-that strike the Court as falling well beyond the heartland of customary government-affairs or legal services that the Szlaviks warn are threatened by the forfeiture sought in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, the Szlaviks argue that because some of the funds were transferred\n   into the accounts\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they had been seized, the government has failed to allege how those funds could be \"traceable\" to a money transmitting business. Mot. Dismiss at 29. But at this stage the government must only demonstrate a\n   <em>\n    reasonable belief\n   </em>\n   that it will be able to prove that Mr. Szlavik operated an illegal money transmitting business-it need not account for every dollar that passed through the accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. 5443 Suffield Terrace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9404241\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/209/919/#p923\">\n    209 F.Supp.2d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923 (N.D.

The Court will therefore decline to dismiss this count of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Under subsection (b)(1)(A), a \"money transmitting business\" must \"affect interstate commerce\" and be \"operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in a State where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony under State law.\" The government alleges that Szlavik failed to obtain the required license in the District of Columbia and Pennsylvania.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The District of Columbia Money Transmitters Act states that \"no person shall engage in the business of money transmission without obtaining a license issued by the Superintendent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2026-1002\">\n    D.C.

But this argument suffers from the same flaw as the Szlaviks' argument under \u00a7 1960(b)(1)(B) : the nature of Mr. Szlavik's business activities is a matter of disputed fact that the Court cannot resolve at the motion to dismiss stage. Again, the question is whether the allegations in the complaint support a reasonable belief that the government can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Szlavik violated the D.C. statute and, consequently, \u00a7 1960(b)(1)(A). The government argues that it has met this burden by alleging that Szlavik maintained offices in the District of Columbia for two of his businesses, Scribe Strategies &amp; Consulting and Scribe Strategies &amp; Advisors.\n   <em>\n    See Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Szlaviks counter that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2026-1002\">\n    D.C.

Mot. Dismiss at 28. But that, too, is a factual issue that cannot be resolved through a motion to dismiss. In any case, even if Szlavik did not engage in money transmitting in the District, the government has still adequately pled a violation of \u00a7 1960(b)(1)(A) because the complaint also alleges that Szlavik violated Pennsylvania's unlicensed money transmitting statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 17.

The Szlaviks argue that the government was on \"inquiry notice\" of its claims as of February 2010, when the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report that detailed how President Bongo and his family used financial institutions to launder proceeds of corruption. According to the Szlaviks, the existence of this report put the government on notice of its claims in this case. Mot.
