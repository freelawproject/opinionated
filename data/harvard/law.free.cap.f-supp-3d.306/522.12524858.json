Although Lisnitzer's monthly income exceeded the customary limit to qualify for Medicaid, Lisnitzer requested that the County Agency approve Medicaid payment of his monthly Medicare Part B premium pursuant to a state policy directive, contained in Attachment II of Administrative Directive 87 ADM-40, designed to maximize Medicare coverage for high users of medical services.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20431.244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; JPTO Exh. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   3.

On January 14, 2013, the Court administratively closed the action, and on April 2, 2015, when efforts to reach a settlement failed, the action was reopened.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 28; Order entered April 2, 2015. After the action was reopened, the parties continued efforts to settle, but again were unsuccessful. On February 26, 2016, Lisnitzer renewed his motion for class certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 38; Order entered February 26, 2016. The Court again denied the motion for class certification without prejudice, advising the parties that the issue could best be determined at the bench trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order entered October 6, 2016. After trial, Lisnitzer again renewed his motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants contend that this action became moot when the County Agency determined on May 17, 2012 that Medicaid would pay Lisnitzer's monthly Medicare Part B premium,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   JPTO Exhs. 18, 19. Moreover, defendants oppose the renewed motion for class certification, mainly on the grounds that Lisnitzer failed to renew the motion during the trial and that Lisnitzer is not an adequate class representative. In response, Lisnitzer argues that he properly renewed his motion for class certification and that (1) his claims are not moot because they are \"capable of repetition yet evading review,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

Even though Lisnitzer has not had a fair hearing since 2011, he offered evidence at trial concerning additional proceedings in 2012 and 2016 concerning his periodic recertification and continued eligibility for payment of his Medicare Part B premium.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Soc.%20Serv.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20366\">\n    N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -a(5) (requiring reconsideration of benefits \"from time to time, or as frequently as may be required by the regulations of the [DOH]\"). Such proceedings are relevant to the extent that they demonstrate that Lisnitzer could suffer repeated deprivations under the challenged policy and practice, with such deprivations evading timely review. Such proceedings are also relevant in that they demonstrate that similarly situated individuals could suffer repeated deprivations under the challenged policy and practice, with such deprivations evading timely review. Regarding class certification and the relation-back doctrine, the Second Circuit has explained that \"the relation-back doctrine ... has unique application in the class action context, preserving the claims of some named plaintiffs for class certification purposes that might well be moot if asserted only as individual claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Amador\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827759\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/89/#p100\">\n    655 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, the Second Circuit observed in\n   <em>\n    Amador\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   We have applied the relation-back theory to recipients of public assistance alleging that action for public assistance was unlawfully delayed by the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robidoux v.

In that decision, we concluded that because the state would almost always process a delayed application before relief could be obtained through litigation and some of the appellants alleged that they expected to need public assistance in the future, the claims were not mooted by their receipt of benefits after the filing of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515627\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/931/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515627\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/931/\">\n    at 938-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Amador\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827759\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/89/#p100\">\n    655 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, the claims of unnamed members of the class are not moot, as a continuing class of similarly situated persons would suffer the claimed harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amador\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827759\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/89/#p100\">\n    655 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court rejects defendants' mootness defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Subject to further proceedings, the Court finds that Lisnitzer sufficiently demonstrates (1) that the prerequisites for a class action are met, namely, numerosity, typicality, commonality, and adequacy of\n   representation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FRCP 23(a) ; and (2) that defendants, have acted on grounds that apply generally to the class as defined by Lisnitzer,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Reply Mem. of Law in Further Support of Motion for Class Cert., at 2 (DE 13), so that final injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FRCP 23(b)(2). Individualized issues among Lisnitzer and class members seem unlikely to impair the Court's ability to issue effective and appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Legality of Defendants' Alleged Policy and Practice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Lisnitzer challenges the legality of an alleged statewide policy and practice of defendants to \"terminate ... administrative appeals by remanding the matter back to [the local agency] for further review rather than ruling on the correctness of the challenged action.\" Plaintiff's Reply Mem. for Class Cert. at 3; Plaintiff's Post-Trial Brief at 1 (challenging an alleged policy and practice by which defendants \"terminate fair hearings pertaining to the denial or adequacy of Medicaid benefits by remanding the contested action back to [the local agency] ... whose adverse determination triggered the fair hearing request.\"). Lisnitzer contends that defendants \"remand\" matters \"[r]ather than develop[ ] an administrative record to support a substantive ruling on the merits.\" Plaintiff's Reply Mem. for Class Cert. at 3. According to Lisnitzer, \"[b]ereft of supervision from State Defendants, [the local agency is] then free to issue a post-remand determination matching the one that spawned the initial fair hearing request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827759\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/89/#p100\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, Medicaid applicants are left \"to exhaust an administrative remedy that potentially has no end.\" Plaintiff's Post-Trial Brief at 5. Lisnitzer claims a \"federal constitutional and statutory right to a definitive and final fair hearing decision which determines [an applicant's] eligibility for the contested Medicaid benefit and that defendants' 'reverse and remand' policy violates that federal right.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Lisnitzer primarily rests his argument on the following comment in \u00a7 2903.2 of the Manual: \"Remanding the case to the local unit for further consideration is not a\n   <em>\n    substitute\n   </em>\n   for definitive and final administrative action.\" JPTO Exh. 6 (emphasis added). According to Lisnitzer, the regulatory background demonstrates \"that the federal agency charged to implement 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(3) expected participating States to render a 'definitive and final' fair hearing decision and expressly prohibited a decision which simply remanded the contested action back to the local agency for further review.\" Plaintiff's Post-Trial Brief at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants deny that any such policy and practice exists or that Lisnitzer was denied any federal right. Defendants point out that Lisnitzer's fair-hearing request raised the question of \"whether the local agency was wrong in not considering 87 ADM-40 in deciding whether Mr. Lisnitzer was entitled to payment of his Medicare Part B premiums?\" State Defendants' Post-Trial Mem. of Law at 17. According to defendants, the fair hearing decision answered that question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   The Agency's failure to make a determination as to whether it was cost effective to pay for [Lisnitzer's] Medicare Part B Premium notwithstanding the fact that his income is in excess of the standard, on the grounds that [Lisnitzer] fit into the criterion of \"high user of medical services\", including persons over 65, for whom it is usually cost effective for a local district to pay premiums for Medicare Part B if the applicant/recipient is not already enrolled is not correct and is reversed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   JPTO Exh. 14, at 8. The decision then specifically directs the local agency \"to make the determination of cost effectiveness in this case following the directives set forth in 87 ADM-40 Attachment II and notify [Lisnitzer] accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants further note that, upon remand, Lisnitzer was advised of his right to complain to the Compliance Unit if he did not receive a decision within 10 days. Rather than complain upon the expiration of 10 days, he filed this action, and then he waited almost eight months before notifying the Compliance Unit. Once he notified the Compliance Unit, he received a decision within three days determining that he was eligible for payment of his Medicare Part B premium. JPTO Exh. 18, 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Neither the Medicaid Act nor governing regulations define the phrase \"final administrative action.\" Nor do they prohibit a hearing officer from remanding a matter. Indeed, the ALJ did not simply remand Lisnitzer's matter to the local agency \"for further review,\" as Lisnitzer suggests,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Post-Trial Brief at 13. Rather, as noted, the ALJ gave specific direction to the local agency to determine cost effectiveness following the directives set forth in 87 ADM-40. Nevertheless, Lisnitzer was entitled to \"final administrative action\" on his claim within 90 days after the fair hearing request, notwithstanding the remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Konstantinov v.

The Court agrees with Lisnitzer that the 90-day requirement for \"final administrative action,\" a permissible construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(3), means that the state was required to provide a final determination of his eligibility for benefits within that time period, not simply any disposition, including a \"remand,\" of the appeal. As the First Department observed in\n   <em>\n    Konstantinov\n   </em>\n   , \"any remand should specify the time in which the agency must act and report back so that the ALJ can render a final determination within that 90-day period.\"\n   <em>\n    Konstantinov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701824,3702475\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/101/520/\">\n    101 A.D.3d at 520-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702475\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/101/520/3702475/#p39\">\n    956 N.Y.S.2d at 39-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The open-ended remand of Lisnitzer's appeal, allowed under defendants' policies and practices, led to a violation of Lisnitzer's right to a final determination of his eligibility for benefits,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"final administrative action,\" within 90 days of his fair hearing request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Renewed Motions to Intervene\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In December 2016, Lisnitzer filed two motions to intervene, seeking the intervention of several Medicaid appellants also represented by Lisnitzer's counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 48, 51. The Court denied the motions, as stated at a conference on January 23, 2017, particularly given the prejudice to defendants of allowing intervention more than five years after this action was commenced and only shortly before the trial, which was then scheduled to begin on March 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 43, 63.
