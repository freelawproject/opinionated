Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this action, Philadelphia taxicab companies assert that the governmental agency responsible for regulating taxicabs, Defendant Philadelphia Parking Authority (\"PPA\") and its former executive director, Defendant Vincent Fenerty, violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause and Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution for failing to regulate so-called \"Transportation Network Companies\" (\"TNCs\"), such as Uber and Lyft, before their statewide legalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 29, 2018, this Court granted summary judgment as to PPA only, and allowed the parties to submit additional briefing on the issue of whether Fenerty was entitled to qualified immunity. With briefing now complete, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motions for summary judgment as to Fenerty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The background of this case, as well as its lengthy procedural history, was detailed in this Court's memorandum of January 29, 2018. (Mem. Granting PPA Mot. for Summ. J., ECF 173.) A brief review of the legal theories asserted by the parties and the proceedings at summary judgment is necessary to resolve whether Fenerty is entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This lawsuit was initially filed by a group of medallion-holding Philadelphia taxicab companies (collectively referred to as \"Checker\"), which asserted that by failing to regulate TNCs prior to their statewide legalization, PPA and Fenerty violated the U.S. Constitution in two ways:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First, that PPA's failure to apply taxicab regulations to or otherwise regulate TNCs amounted to disparate treatment of similarly situated for-hire transportation and selective enforcement of taxicab violations in violation of the Equal Protection Clause; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, that the diminution in value of taxi medallions caused by the failure to regulate TNCs constituted a taking of Checker's property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Intervenor Germantown Cab Company (\"Germantown\"; together with Checker, the \"Taxi Companies\"), a taxicab company that does not hold taxi medallions, asserted, like Checker, that PPA's failure to regulate TNCs constituted selective enforcement of taxicab regulations in violation of Germantown's right to equal protection of the laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants PPA and Fenerty jointly filed two motions for summary judgment: one motion for summary judgment as to Checker, and a separate summary judgment motion as to Germantown. After briefing on the summary judgment motions was complete, the Court held oral argument on January 24, 2018. The Court issued a ruling on January 29, 2018 in which the Court found that no genuine issue of material fact existed on the Taxi Companies' selective enforcement and disparate treatment equal protection theories, or on Checker's takings claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, the Court granted summary judgment as to PPA only, and did not make any ruling as to Fenerty. (Order Granting PPA Mot. for Summ. J., ECF 174.) The Court deferred ruling on whether Fenerty was entitled either to summary judgment, or to a defense of qualified immunity based on his actions. The Court opined that it \"believe[d] that under settled Supreme Court and Third Circuit law, that Mr. Fenerty has a very strong legal argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity.\" (Mem. Granting PPA Mot. for Summ. J. at 60, ECF 173.) The Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   First, because the Court is rejecting the Taxi Companies' claims of constitutional violations, the Court believes it is likely proper to make the same conclusion as to Mr. Fenerty. Alternatively, given the extensive discussion of law in this Memorandum and the very vigorous disputes over the applicable law, the Court is inclined to find that the applicable law was not \"clearly established,\" at least in this factual context of PPA regulations and practices, emerging TNCs and their relationship to established taxicab companies.

(\"PPA\") have not moved for summary judgment on its claim that former Executive Director, Vincent J. Fenerty (\"Fenerty\") is entitled to qualified immunity. Absent a pending motion for summary judgment on this issue, the PPA must first move for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and establish that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law because there are no genuine disputes of material facts at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Taxi Companies' Joint Mem. Regarding Qualified Immunity at 1, ECF 175.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Turning to the qualified immunity analysis itself, the Taxi Companies assert that Fenerty engaged in an \"abuse of power\" that is \"not entitled to immunity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) The Taxi Companies argue, as they did in their prior summary judgment briefing, that Fenerty stated inconsistent positions regarding TNCs, and \"failed to engage in any meaningful action to remedy\" what the Taxi Companies saw as a disparity in regulatory burdens on taxicabs and TNCs prior to the enactment of statewide TNCs-inaction that purportedly led to a decline in taxi medallion values. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Taxi Companies also argue, more generally, that Fenerty is not entitled to qualified immunity because \"Fenerty's tenure as Executive Director of the PPA was marred in corruption and caused the public to doubt whether the PPA could even function in its current design.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Specifically, the Taxi Companies rely on the negative findings of two PPA audit reports regarding various aspects of Fenerty's tenure as PPA executive director, such as financial irregularities at PPA and issues with PPA's institutional culture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6.) With respect to both lines of argument, the Taxi Companies conclude that \"Fenerty is not entitled to a defense of qualified immunity because he abused his power as Executive Director of the PPA for his own benefit and failed to perform his duties as a public official in a reasonable manner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Fenerty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Fenerty responds that this Court rejected the Taxi Companies' Equal Protection and Takings Clause challenges as to PPA, and because Checker asserts no further facts in its memorandum showing that Fenerty violated the Taxi Companies' constitutional rights-and the Taxi Companies brought no claims as to Fenerty alone in their respective Complaints-the Court should consider the issue of qualified immunity to be moot. (Fenerty Mem. Regarding Qualified Immunity at 1-3, ECF 177.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the alternative, Fenerty argues, the law regarding the constitutional obligations of regulators toward TNCs was not \"clearly established\" at the time of the events at issue in this lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-9.) Finally, Fenerty takes exception to Checker's reliance on the audit reports, which made no findings as to PPA's treatment of TNCs, as irrelevant-and whose inclusion in the record was already rejected by this Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether Fenerty Is Entitled to Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In its memorandum granting summary judgement as to PPA, this Court expressed its tentative belief that Fenerty likely would be entitled to qualified immunity, but wanted to give the parties an opportunity to brief the issues, specifically by allowing the Taxi Companies \"an opportunity to present facts the Taxi Companies still believe warrant the Court denying the Fenerty motion for qualified immunity,\" and to file a brief, supporting memorandum of law \"citing to matters already in the record.\" (Mem. Granting PPA Mot. for Summ. J. at 60, ECF 173.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The requested briefing has confirmed the Court's belief. The Taxi Companies have pointed to no facts in the voluminous record of this case warranting denial of summary judgment as to Fenerty, and have marshaled no apposite case law supporting their position that a qualified immunity defense should be unavailable to Fenerty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As discussed above, \"[q]ualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages liability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589956\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2042/#p2044\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Third Circuit put it, \"[w]hen a qualified immunity defense is asserted, a court must determine (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   whether the facts alleged by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right, and (2) whether that right was clearly established at the time of the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Mann v. Palmerton Area Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264028\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/165/#p170\">\n    872 F.3d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 170 (3d Cir. 2017). Thus, the Taxi Companies cannot obtain damages from Fenerty unless he (1) violated a statutory or constitutional right of the Taxicab Companies,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) that right was clearly established at the time of the events in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The parties' supplemental briefing has now satisfied this Court that Fenerty is entitled to summary judgment: Fenerty did not violate the constitutional rights of the Taxi Companies in the course of PPA's failure to regulate TNCs more aggressively, and even if he had, he would be entitled to a defense of qualified immunity. Fenerty is therefore entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In its memorandum granting summary judgment to PPA, the Court found that PPA had not violated the constitutional rights of the Taxi Companies under the Equal Protection Clause or the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution. As Fenerty points out in his supplemental brief, the Taxi Companies' supplemental briefs have not shown any record evidence whatsoever raising a factual issue that Fenerty-separately from PPA-violated the rights of the Taxi Companies to equal protection of the laws or Checker's right to be protected from takings of its taxi medallions for public use without just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, even if Fenerty had violated the Fifth and/or Fourteenth Amendment rights of the Taxi Companies, the Taxi Companies have provided no case law that showing that the particular rights they assert were clearly established at the time of Fenerty's challenged actions. The Court, which is obliged by\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   and other cases to construe the Taxi Companies' asserted rights at low level of generality, considers the Taxi Companies to be asserting two rights that Fenerty allegedly violated: first, that the Taxi Companies are entitled under the Equal Protection Clause to aggressive regulatory or enforcement action by the executive director of a taxicab regulatory agency against unlicensed competitors; and, second, that holders of taxi medallions have a right under the Takings Clause both to the value of the medallions they hold and to a stable credit market in taxi medallions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As the Court discussed in its review of taxicab challenges in its prior memorandum granting summary judgment to PPA, theories comparable to those advanced by the Taxi Companies in this action have been largely rejected by courts. (Mem. Granting PPA Mot. for Summ. J. at 33-56, ECF 173.) The closest the Taxi Companies come to showing any case law whatsoever in which a court found for plaintiff taxicab companies against a regulator on similar facts and legal theories during the relevant period in this lawsuit is\n   <em>\n    Boston Taxi Owners Ass'n, Inc. v. City of Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172485\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/180/108/\">\n    180 F.Supp.3d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2016), in which the district court found that the plaintiff taxicab companies had stated a claim for an equal protection violation on a failure-to-regulate theory comparable to that advanced by the Taxi Companies in this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed in this Court's prior memorandum granting summary judgment to PPA, that court actually dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for an unconstitutional taking of their medallions, which had fallen in\n   value; thus, no court has ever found that a governmental taxicab regulator has effected an unconstitutional regulatory taking based a drop in medallion values.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172485\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/180/108/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A lone decision of a district court is not the \"applicable Supreme Court precedent,\" controlling Third Circuit authority, or \"robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority in the Courts of Appeals\" required by the Third Circuit to find a right to be clearly established.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263673\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/136/#p142\">\n    877 F.3d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2017). Thus, even if Fenerty had violated the rights of the Taxi Companies under the Equal Protection Clause and the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution-or if there were a factual debate as to whether he had done so-Fenerty is entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the Taxi Companies provide no support for their assertion that PPA-which is no longer party to this lawsuit-must file a separate motion for summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity on behalf of its former co-defendant, Vincent Fenerty, whom the Taxi Companies named as a Defendant in their respective Complaints. Fenerty filed a joint motion with PPA as to the constitutional claims asserted by the Taxi Companies, which is still pending. Qualified immunity is a defense often raised at the summary judgment stage, and is often asserted as the grounds entitling governmental defendants to summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277567\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/549/#p570\">\n    848 F.3d at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming district court's grant of summary judgment to defendant prison officials because the prison officials were entitled to qualified immunity). It is perfectly appropriate to grant summary judgment to Fenerty on the pending summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant Vincent Fenerty's Motions for Summary Judgment (ECF 147 and 148) are hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .
