Yet they are strangely absent from the papers submitted by Defendants in defense of their actions toward plaintiff James Deferio, a Christian evangelical who regularly proselytizes at the Central New York Pride Parade and Festival (\"Pride Event\"). This annual event, which is free and open to the public, attracts thousands of attendees each year who wish to celebrate the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (\"LGBT\") community and its allies in Central New York. Like many similar events across the country, however, it also attracts attendees who wish to communicate messages to LGBT individuals and their allies that are controversial and may be hurtful.

No. 116-25 (\"Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4. He is a resident of the City of Syracuse, New York, Dkt. No. 109-10 (\"Deferio Deposition\") at 11, and, since 2004, he has attended the Central New York Pride Parade and Festival in Syracuse almost every year,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 88. The event is organized by CNY Pride, Inc., a private nonprofit organization, Pl.'s SMF \u00b6 13, and CNY Pride receives a special events permit from the City in order to host the event each June,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. The event is free and open to the public. Dkt. No. 109-6 (\"Locastro Deposition\") at 9; Dkt. No. 109-2 (\"Shepard Deposition\") at 13, 37; Dkt. No. 109-3 (\"Gewanter Deposition\") at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Since 2012, the Pride Event has taken place in Syracuse's Inner Harbor neighborhood. Pl.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 14-18. Although its route has varied because of road construction,\n   Shepard Depo. at 14, the Pride Parade has generally begun at the corner of Belden and Plum Streets, traversed north along Van Rensselaer Street, and ended on the West Kirkpatrick Street, which forms the southern border of Inner Harbor Park, Dkt. No. 109-2, Ex. 2 (\"2014 Parade Permit\"). Inner Harbor Park is public property managed by the Syracuse Parks Department, and the Pride Festival takes place following the Parade at the Inner Harbor Amphitheater inside the park. Shepard Depo. at 14, 37. Plaintiff has chosen to proselytize from the public sidewalk on the north side of West Kirkpatrick Street, adjacent to the driveway entering Inner Harbor Park, during the Pride Parade and Festivals because of the large number of people at that location during the event. Pl.'s SMF \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Prior to the event, CNY Pride applied for a \"Parade/Public Assembly Permit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Permit. The first substantive section of the permit is entitled \"Parade Application,\" and CNY Pride provides formation and dispersal locations, start and finish times, and estimated number of participants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the second substantive section, entitled \"Public Assembly Location,\" the \"Location(s) of Assembly\" are described as \"sidewalks bordering Kirkpatrick Street @ Inner Harbor Park for security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response to the prompt, \"Sound System,\" CNY Pride answered \"N/A,\" and, in response to the prompt \"Speakers, names,\" it answered, \"No speakers @ sidewalks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The City granted the permit application without modification. Pl.'s SMF \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sergeant Locastro was assigned to supervise the police officers at the 2014 Pride Event. Locastro Depo. at 7-8. Prior to the event, he reviewed the 2014 Permit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. When the parade concluded, Locastro was called to the intersection of West Kirkpatrick Street and the driveway into Inner Harbor Park.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. At that time, Plaintiff was standing on the sidewalk along the north side of West Kirkpatrick Street, holding a sign that said,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   WARNING: Do you not know that the unrighteous shall inherit the Kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the Kingdom of God. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dkt. No. 109-20 (\"Locastro Affidavit\"), Ex. 2. Plaintiff also had a sound amplification device, and Sergeant Locastro was told that Plaintiff had used \"inflammatory\" words prior to Locastro's arrival. Locastro Depo. at 10. When Locastro arrived, \"five or six different festivalgoers ... were trying to get at\" Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sergeant Locastro told Plaintiff that he was \"in violation of the permit that the parade has, sir,\" Dkt. No. 109, Ex. T at 00:07-00:08, and that Plaintiff would be required to move to the south side of West Kirkpatrick Street, Locastro Depo. at 18. In his deposition, Locastro provided two reasons for requiring Plaintiff to move across the street, under the threat of arrest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   It was a two-fold reason. Firstly, it was that he was in violation of the permit. Where he was ... standing, he's not allowed to be there based on the way that I interpreted the way the permit was written.... Secondly, and almost what I want to say was equally as important to me, was for his safety.... Where he was standing, there were people there actively trying to get at him. I was concerned for his safety because he, very impressively, stands his ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   More specifically, Locastro understood the sidewalk on the north side of West Kirkpatrick Street to be part of CNY Pride's permitted area, and so CNY Pride\n   could \"sort of control what they want going in the festival and what they don't.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

So someone similar to [Plaintiff].\") When asked what distinguished Plaintiff from the hundreds of other people who were standing or walking on the north side of West Kirkpatrick Street, Sergeant Locastro said, \"Nobody else was holding a large anti-gay sign, standing in the middle of the sidewalk, upsetting people.\" Locastro Depo. at 20. Under the threat of arrest, Plaintiff left his position on the north side of the street and remained on the south side of the street for approximately four hours. Locastro Aff. \u00b6 17-19. Plaintiff was not arrested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    2. Plaintiff's Correspondence with the City\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Following the 2014 Pride Event, Plaintiff contacted relevant City officials through his attorneys to express concern about the permit issued to CNY Pride and Sergeant Locastro's actions. The first letter, dated September 5, 2014, sought,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"written assurance that Syracuse will no longer apply the ban on [Plaintiff's] expression on public sidewalks during future Pride parades and festivals.\" Dkt. No. 116-8 (\"Plaintiff's First Letter\") at 5. On October 24, 2014, Joseph Doyle, Syracuse's Corporation Counsel, replied to the letter, stating that \"the City will closely review the geographic aspects of similar future permit applications as they relate to locations of traditional public fora,\" and \"the City of Syracuse will continue to diligently ensure that the free speech rights of all citizens are protected within the City ...\" Dkt. No. 116-9 (\"Syracuse's Letter\") at 6. While Plaintiff responded to Doyle, stating that his \"response is lacking\" and requesting a supplemental response to avoid litigation, Dkt. No. 116-10 (\"Plaintiff's Second Letter\") at 1-2, Doyle did not reply again and Plaintiff did not initiate litigation, Pl.'s SMF \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    3. 2015 Pride Event\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The 2015 Pride Event occurred on June 20, 2015. CNY Pride again applied for a special events permit, though its submissions were more involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 109-2, Ex. 4 (\"2015 Parade Permit\"); 109-2, Ex. 5 (\"2015 Festival Permit\"). First, CNY Pride wrote, \"We request exclusive use of sound amplification along parade route, on Kirkpatrick and on Van Rensselear at end of parade period and at dispersal point.\" 2015 Parade Permit. Second, CNY Pride identified the \"Location(s) of Assembly\" as the \"Driveway into Inner Harbor Park on Kirkpatrick and adjacent sidewalks for 20ft to either side of driveway on [north] side of Kirkpatrick.\" 2015 Festival Permit. CNY Pride stated that it would use a sound system \"within festival grounds adjacent to this location.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   CNY Pride also made two related requests in reference to the assembly point: (1) \"We request exclusive use of this location for access to festival site, during festival, for set up time, [and] for First Amendment activities related to festival [and] parade\"; and (2) \"We request exclusive use of sound amplification on this portion of these sidewalks and on sidewalks directly across street on Kirkpatrick during specified hours.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Barrie Gewanter, an attorney who voluntarily assisted CNY Pride with its permit applications, these requests would address potential counter-protesters at the entrance to the festival. In an email she sent to relevant City officials, Gewanter stated that these requests \"should reduce the kind of friction and confrontation that has occurred at that location in past years that has required police attention.\" Dkt. No. 109-2, Ex. 3 (\"Gewanter Email\") at 1-2. Further, \"any such counter-protester\n   would still have adequate proximity to his intended audience, but constitutional precedent doesn't require that such a counter-protester be allowed to be immediately adjacent to his audience.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 19, 2015, Sam White, then the Right-of-Way Permit Coordinator in the City's Central Permit Office, Dkt. No. 109-2 (\"White Affidavit\") \u00b6 2, conditionally approved CNY Pride's 2015 Parade and Festival Permits. Dkt. No. 109-2, Ex. 6 (\"Central Permit Office Manifest\"). The CPO Manifest states, \"[CNY Pride] is granted exclusive control to the entry area into the inner harbor festival area as well as the 40-feet on either side of the northern portion of Kirkpatrick street for the limited purpose of allowing exclusive use of sound amplification and access to the festival.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to White, the relevant officials \"determined that that would be an appropriate measure to protect everyone's First Amendment right, given the request from CNY Pride.\" Dkt. No. 109-2 (\"White Deposition\") at 21. When asked to describe the criteria for determining whether an exclusive-use zone should be approved, White replied, \"[T]here's no specific criteria ... we review it, make sure everyone's rights are respected in our approval or denial of the application.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 20, 2015, Plaintiff attended the 2015 Pride Event with a large sign and a sound amplification device. The sign stated, \"Thousands of Ex-Homosexuals Have Experienced the Life-Changing Love of Jesus Christ,\" which also provided links to relevant websites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 109, Ex. X at 00:17. During the parade, Plaintiff made generalized statements to the crowd regarding his religious beliefs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 109, Ex. Z at 01:15-01:22 (\"Time to repent people. You are not guaranteed tomorrow. No one is. Where's your love for God?\"). Plaintiff also engaged with other attendees of the event, some of whom were clearly angered by Plaintiff's messages. For example, one person said to the crowd closest to Plaintiff, \"Nobody talk to him. Do not feed the monkey.\" Plaintiff responded, \"Homofascist right there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 00:33-00:37. Two other people attempted to take Plaintiff's camera phone from him, and Plaintiff requested that his daughter, who was filming Plaintiff from the south side of West Kirkpatrick Street, call 911 to report that a man had hit him in the face. Dkt. No. 109, Ex. Y at 05:20-05:58. She did so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 06:00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Captain Sweeny was assigned to supervise the police officers at the 2015 Pride Event. Dkt.

No. 109, Ex. Y at 14:45. When Captain Sweeny first spoke to Plaintiff, Sweeney did not address the 911 call or the interactions between Plaintiff and other festival attendees; Sweeny told Plaintiff that he could be arrested if he stayed at that location, because CNY had \"exclusive use of this side of the street, and you don't have a permit to be using any amplification devices, which they do.\" Dkt.
