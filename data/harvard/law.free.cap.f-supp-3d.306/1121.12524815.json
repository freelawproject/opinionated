Compl. [\"FAC\"] \u00b6 17, ECF No. 15) These tracks are re-recorded and released on CD+G (\"compact discs plus graphics\") or MP3+G (\"MPS3 plus graphics\") formats. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19) \"Separately from the communicative content of the karaoke accompaniment tracks (i.e., the sound recording and the synchronized lyric and cueing displays), SOUND CHOICE-branded karaoke accompaniment tracks are marked with an identifying logo that appears at the beginning and end.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20) The \"tracks are wildly popular among karaoke entertainment providers, patrons, and home consumers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22) \"According to some estimates ... more than half of all accompaniment tracks played at karaoke\n   shows in the United States originated from [Phoenix's] recordings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This popularity is attributed to the tracks usually being \"the most faithful to the sound of the original recording artist and as providing the most accurate singing cues as part of the video display.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23) Similarly, the association of the SOUND CHOICE brand with a karaoke operator's business or an establishment's karaoke shows \"confers on the operator and venue a perception in the marketplace-and among karaoke patrons-of legitimacy and professionalism.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ryco contracts with Church to put on karaoke shows at its establishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30-31) These shows are advertised as being, and are held, at specific times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32) Church provides the sound equipment over which the tracks are played, \"control[s] the organization and flow of the performances,\" and encourages the establishments' \"patrons to purchase food and/or beverages and tip their servers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ryco and Church (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Defendants\") cause or permit the SOUND CHOICE marks to be displayed \"repeatedly and frequently\" during the karaoke shows. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34) The display of the marks \"in connection with the services, regardless of the particular song being played, acts as a general advertisement for the services as well as an indicator of the quality of the services being provided.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38) Neither, however, has a \"license, permission, authorization, or acquiescence from Phoenix\" for playing the SOUND CHOICE tracks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41) Moreover, Church, known as DJ Churchdogg, copied the tracks \"from an illicit source.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 35)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Phoenix alleges that \"the frequent, repeated display of the SOUND CHOICE Marks across numerous instances of widely disparate songs\" \"likely\" causes patrons to \"view the display of the Sound Choice Marks as an indicator of the affiliation, connection, or association of the Defendants with Phoenix, or of Phoenix's sponsorship or approval of the services and related commercial activities, rather than merely as indicating Phoenix as the creator of the underlying communicative content of any particular song being performed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39) Thus, the patrons are \"likely to be confused regarding the origin or sponsorship of the services being supplied regarding the affiliation or connection of [Defendants] with Phoenix, based on their mistaken belief that the services being provided are provided with Phoenix's knowledge and approval.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42) Defendants profit from the display of the SOUND CHOICE marks during karaoke show; however Phoenix contends it has been damaged through loss of revenues and loss of the ability to control the quality of services provided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43-46) Defendants also profit from infringing \"numerous other producers' intellectual property rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For its damages, Phoenix seeks to hold Church directly liable and Ryco secondarily liable. Phoenix also seeks equitable and injunctive relief. Defendants seek the dismissal of this action. Because Church's memorandum in support of its motion incorporates all but one section of Ryco's supporting memorandum,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court will address both motions as one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Rule 12(b)(6) Standard.\n   </em>\n   \"To survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, 'a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted\n   as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    McShane Constr.
