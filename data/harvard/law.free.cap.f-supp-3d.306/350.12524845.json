Environmental organizations have previously had limited success in court challenges to supplemental elk feeding initiatives that the federal government (specifically, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service) planned to undertake within Wyoming's National Elk Refuge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife v.

Cir. 2011). The instant lawsuit involves a different challenge: Plaintiffs here contest the U.S. Forest Service's issuance of a special-use authorization permit that allows\n   <em>\n    a Wyoming state agency\n   </em>\n   -the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission-to undertake supplemental elk feeding activities on the Alkali Creek Feedground in the Bridger-Teton National Forest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 1.) Plaintiffs have filed the instant action against the Chief of the U.S. Forest Service (Thomas Tidwell) and the Secretary of Agriculture (Sonny Perdue) in their official capacities, claiming that the issuance of the permit violates the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-6, 15-16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court at present is a motion that Defendants have filed, seeking to transfer the venue of the instant action to the District of Wyoming. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. to Transfer Venue and Mem. in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. to Transfer Venue (\"Defs.' Mot.\"), ECF No. 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' choice of forum is not entitled to the usual deference because of the attenuated ties of the instant dispute to the District of Columbia, and that transfer of venue is appropriate because localized controversies should be decided at home. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 9-11, 13-14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs oppose the transfer motion, arguing that just like three previous cases related to \"the Jackson elk herd,\" this case, too, should be resolved in the federal courts of the District of Columbia.

Accordingly, Defendants' motion to transfer will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and this action will be\n   <strong>\n    TRANSFERRED\n   </strong>\n   to the District of Wyoming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Supplemental Feeding Of Elk On Federal Lands In Wyoming\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The supplemental feeding of elk began in northwestern Wyoming in the early 1900s in response to large-scale dying of elk in the wintertime. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 30; Final Record of Decision,\n   <em>\n    Long Term Special Use Authorization for the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission to Use National Forest System Land for their Winter Elk Management Activities at Alkali Creek Feedground\n   </em>\n   (December 1, 2015) (\"Final ROD\"), Ex. A to Defs.' Mot., at 2). Feedgrounds also serve the purpose of preventing elk from roaming onto private lands and damaging stored crops. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31; Final ROD at 2.) The state of Wyoming has relied on feedgrounds since the 1930s, when Wyoming state statutes began to impose liability on the state-and specifically, on the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission (\"WGFC\")-for property damage caused by roaming elk herds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final ROD at 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, feeding areas are often \"strategically placed on and near National Forest System lands\" to draw the elk migration routes away from private property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Today, the WGFC conducts supplemental elk feeding at twenty-one feedgrounds and one staging area; eight of those locations are situated on National Forest System lands. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Notably, the use of the feedgrounds on National Forest System lands requires authorization from the U.S. Forest Service (\"Forest Service\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20251.50\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 251.50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"Before conducting a special use [of such lands], individuals or entities must submit a proposal to the authorized officer and must obtain a special use authorization from the authorized officer[.]\"). Under the NEPA, prior to providing\n   a special use authorization permit, the Forest Service must prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") that evaluates the environmental impact of its decision and must also \"issue 'a concise public record of decision[,]' \" which is hereinafter referred to as an \"ROD.\" (Compl. \u00b6 23 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201505.2\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1505.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The WGFC's Use Of Feedgrounds In The Bridger-Teton National Forest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At issue here is the Alkali Creek Feedground, which is located in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in northwestern Wyoming. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) There are several different feedgrounds that host the WGFC's elk feeding activities inside the Bridger-Teton National Forest, and the Forest Supervisor of the Bridger-Teton National Forest is the Forest Service official who bears the responsibility of deciding whether or not to authorize supplemental feeding activities on those feedgrounds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final ROD at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Significantly for present purposes, in 2008, the Forest Supervisor issued a Final EIS and signed an ROD that authorized the WGFC's elk feeding activities in five feedgrounds other than the Alkali Creek Feedground, but postponed the decision regarding the Alkali Creek Feedground to allow for additional analysis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201505.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201505.2\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) More than six years later, on January 23, 2015, the Forest Supervisor finally addressed the Alkali Creek Feedground, by releasing a Final Supplemental EIS and a draft ROD that proposed to authorize the WGFC's use of that feedground. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 46; Final ROD at 3.) The draft ROD prompted a number of written objections, including from several of the Plaintiff organizations in the instant case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 54; Final ROD at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Despite those objections, on December 15, 2015, Forest Supervisor Patricia M. O'Connor issued the Final ROD outlining her decision to allow the WGFC to use the Alkali Creek Feedground for its supplemental feeding program. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final ROD at 1.) O'Connor reasoned that the use of the feedground was appropriate \"because State-operated feedgrounds on National Forest System lands reduce damage to haystack yards and winter pastures on private lands, maintain elk population numbers, and reduce commingling of elk and livestock that can lead to brucellosis transmission.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) At the same time, O'Connor's final ROD recognized that supplemental feeding programs can be problematic for various reasons, including the fact that such programs play a role in contributing to the spread of chronic wasting disease among elk. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201505.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, the ROD stated that the 2008 special use permit that had been issued to the WGFC with respect to the other feedgrounds in the Bridger-Teton National Forest would be amended to include the Alkali Creek Feedground, but that \"this amendment [would] not occur until the [state's] Chronic Wasting Disease Management Plan update is completed and a review by the Forest Supervisor finds that the plan adequately addresses risks and management options for feedgrounds on National Forest System lands.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) O'Connor also instructed the Forest Service to \"review the management practices of all feedgrounds on the [Forest] annually and [to] prepare a report recommending any needed changes.\" (Compl. \u00b6 57 (quoting Final ROD at 4).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Forest Service subsequently approved the Wyoming state agency's Chronic Wasting Disease Management Plan, and on December 9, 2016, the agency amended its 2008 special-use authorization, thereby permitting the WGFC to use the\n   Alkali Creek Feedground for supplemental feeding until 2028. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs are various environmental organizations that are headquartered in Idaho, California, Wyoming, and Montana. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-12; Pls.' Opp'n at 24 n.3.) Plaintiffs filed the instant complaint on June 5, 2017, challenging the Forest Service's \"approval of the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission's ... request to amend a special use permit to include Alkali Creek Feedground[.]\" (Compl. \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint contains two counts. In Count One, Plaintiffs generally allege that, in refusing to give adequate consideration to phasing out elk supplemental feeding programs entirely, the Forest Service \"violated its obligations under NEPA to 'study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E) ).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Count Two, Plaintiffs cast as a violation of the APA this same allegedly arbitrary \"fail[ure] to articulate a reasoned explanation for [the Forest Service's] decision to permit artificial feeding on federal grounds for the foreseeable future in light of the [National Park Service] and the [Fish and Wildlife Service's] 2007 decision to phase out artificial feeding [on the National Elk Refuge].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) Plaintiffs also maintain that the Forest Service violated the APA by \"ignor[ing] its own statutory management obligations\" for National Forest Service lands and \"rel[ying] on factors that Congress did not intend for it to consider[,]\" because the special-use permit impermissibly \"defer[s] the decision regarding Alkali Creek Feedground and management goals for the Jackson herd to the WGFC[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) As relief for these alleged violations, Plaintiffs seek a declaration and an injunction that stops the operation of the Alkali Creek Feedground, sets aside the Forest Service's Final Supplemental EIS, ROD, and special-use permit, and compels Defendants to prepare and issue annual reports examining the management practices of feedgrounds on the Bridger-Teton National Forest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Prayer for Relief, \u00b6\u00b6 1-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The government Defendants seek transfer of the instant action to the District of Wyoming under 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1404(a). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot.) In the transfer motion, the government argues that, because the events that form the basis of the lawsuit all occurred in Wyoming, there is \"strong local interest in this dispute,\" such that the interests of justice are better served by transferring the case to Wyoming. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Plaintiffs oppose the transfer request, asserting that their choice of forum deserves deference. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 6.) Moreover, Plaintiffs contend that this case should be resolved in the District of the District of Columbia, in particular, because of the \"highly pertinent rulings\" in this District that purportedly bear on the issues in this case (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and because the case involves \"issues of national significance and interest, which is consistent with litigating\n   these matters in the District of Columbia\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD FOR MOTIONS TO TRANSFER UNDER SECTION 1404\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 1404 of Title 28 of the United States Code provides that \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\" 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1404(a). The Supreme Court has held that this venue-transfer provision \"accords broad discretion to the district court,\" but it has also made clear that the district court's discretion should be informed by a number of factors borrowed from the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart Org., Inc. v.

The challenged federal agency action is the issuance of a special-use authorization permit that allows the state of Wyoming to conduct supplemental feeding of elk at a particular site in northwest Wyoming, and the central issue is the management of local land and local wildlife, because if the addition of the site for supplemental feeding changes the behavior of the free-ranging elk, Wyoming and its people, and their property, are most directly affected by the disposition of this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31; Final ROD at 2 (describing the large-scale winter die-offs and damage to stored crops that initially motivated supplemental feeding, and the strategic placement of feeding sites to accommodate those interests).)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663785\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/42/#p50\">\n    437 F.Supp.2d at 49-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (transferring case to Florida where management of the local lands \"directly affects the citizens of Florida[,]\" despite the national significance of the Everglades and the national interest in the snail kite species as an endangered species).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The fact that the instant dispute is ultimately about the authorized use of one particular feeding site in Wyoming further undermines Plaintiffs' suggestion that the instant matter has national implications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SUWA I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9236612\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/315/82/#p86\">\n    315 F.Supp.2d at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting\n   transfer where, \"[n]otwithstanding ... national attention, the dispute remains focused on 21 parcels of land in Utah\"). Despite the complaint's grandiose contentions regarding the well-being of the Jackson elk herd and the deleterious effects of supplemental feeding, Plaintiffs' claims and requested relief are truly aimed only at the Forest Service's decision to authorize the WGFC's use of the Alkali Creek Feedground, not at any broader policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-71;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9236612\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/315/82/#p86\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Prayer for Relief \u00b6\u00b6 1-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To be sure, Plaintiffs vigorously maintain otherwise; indeed, they have struggled valiantly to style their lawsuit as a broad challenge to nefarious government-wide policies pertaining to supplemental elk feeding writ large. For example, Plaintiffs' complaint expressly links the instant permit challenge to a beleaguered federal feeding program that the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service adopted in 2007-\"the Bison and Elk Management Plan\"-by asserting that the special-use permit the Forest Service issued here \"is even more arbitrary when considered in conjunction with the National Park Service [ ] and the Fish and Wildlife Service's [ ] joint decision to phase out [the] artificial feeding on the [National Elk Refuge]\" as contemplated by those agencies' Bison and Elk Management Plan. (Compl. \u00b6 5.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Defs. of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3766714,3753484\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/112/\">\n    651 F.3d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Though admirable in their creativity, Plaintiffs do not (and cannot) answer\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the Forest Service's actions here should be \"considered in conjunction\" with what the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service did in 2007. After all, the Bison and Elk Management Plan\n   <em>\n    is entirely distinct\n   </em>\n   from the dispute in this case. The federal agencies involved with that program are completely different than the one at issue here, and that supplemental feeding policy concerned the National Elk Refuge and the Grand Teton National Park, not the Bridger-Teton National Forest. Moreover, even if the federal government's stance on supplemental feeding as articulated by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service somehow implicates the claims at issue here, that, by itself, does not elevate Plaintiffs' challenge of a particular, local\n   <em>\n    application\n   </em>\n   of that wider policy (i.e., the complaint's administrative challenge to the procedures that the local office followed in the context of that application) into an issue of national proportions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    SUWA I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9236612\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/315/82/#p86\">\n    315 F.Supp.2d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (transferring case where \"the actual lease decisions ... in dispute\" were made by the local office, even though a broader agency-wide wilderness policy was implicated in that decision). In other words, there is no national policy or agency-wide plan at stake here, and no amount of careful crafting can transform a local permit challenge into a matter of national concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs' only other argument that the instant case is national in character appears to rely primarily on the fact that courts in this District have previously adjudicated disputes that touched upon on the Jackson elk herd-a fact that, Plaintiffs say, essentially constitutes\n   <em>\n    res ipsa\n   </em>\n   support for their contention that \"the well-being of the Jackson elk herd ... [is a] matter[ ] of national importance and concern[.]\" (Pls.' Opp'n at 26.) No one can deny that there are several published cases from this jurisdiction that pertain to policies involving the Jackson elk herd,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mayo v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 10, 13, 15.) Plaintiffs argue that this must mean that the government had no grounds to request such a transfer (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370212\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/27/8/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370212\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/27/8/\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and thus this Court should find that the government has no grounds to request a transfer now, but given the \"factually analytical, case-by-case determination\" that a motion to transfer involves,\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777077,836941\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/587/1149/\">\n    587 F.2d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1978), any such inference is unfounded. Whatever the reasons might have been for the government's decision to forgo seeking a transfer in those prior cases, the only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn now is that none of the prior courts actually reached or resolved the question of whether litigation involving the Jackson elk herd is necessarily national in scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To be clear: this Court by no means intends to suggest that the opinions from other judges in this District that treat the Jackson elk as \"iconic\" and that wax eloquently about the \"considerable ecological, economic, and cultural value\" of this species (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 26 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) ) have it wrong, or that they have disingenuously inserted themselves into matters that were plainly local in character and were best left to Wyoming's courts. Indeed, notably, prior cases involved\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   programs, giving them a \"national\" aura that is plainly absent here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355720\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/91/\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (challenging \"the NPS's and the FWS's actions in managing the annual elk reduction program\");\n   <em>\n    Defs. of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3927988\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/698/141/\">\n    698 F.Supp.2d at 145-146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (challenging the NPS's and the FWS's \"comprehensive Bison and Elk Management Plan\" for failing to assign a definite end date to the federal supplemental feeding program on the National Elk Refuge);\n   <em>\n    Fund for Animals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370212\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/27/8/\">\n    27 F.Supp.2d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (challenging \"the proposed plan of the federal government to reduce the size of a herd of American bison\"). All this Court is saying is that none of these prior cases actually evaluates the significance of the Jackson elk herd\n   <em>\n    in the context of determining the appropriate venue\n   </em>\n   , and all of them involved challenges to a federal-agency decision, which makes them of little utility for this Court's present task of deciding whether the interests of justice are better served by transferring the instant elk-related challenge to a one-off federal-agency permit that approves state-directed feeding activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   All things considered, then, the 'localized controversy' public interest factor weighs in favor of transfer, because a transfer to the District of Wyoming recognizes the strong local interest in land and wildlife management and the particularized nature of the instant dispute over the WGFC's use of one particular feeding site in northwestern Wyoming, and thereby promotes the interests of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Relative Congestion Of The Courts And The Courts' Relative Familiarity With The Governing Law Factors Are Neutral\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The remaining public interest factors, which pertain to judicial economy, do not weigh heavily in favor of either forum. In regard to congestion, Defendants note that there are fewer cases pending in the District of Wyoming than in this District, but they also acknowledge that this District generally resolves civil cases more quickly on average. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 12.) Plaintiffs contend that the faster resolution of\n   cases in the District of Columbia District disfavors transfer (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 25); however, taking these metrics together, court-congestion considerations do not push strongly in either direction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gulf Restoration Network v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305310\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/303/#p315\">\n    87 F.Supp.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (D.D.C. 2015) (\"Absent a showing that the docket of either court is substantially more congested than the other, this factor is neutral\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The factor concerning the courts' relative familiarity with the governing law is also neutral. The District of the District of Columbia is often called upon to apply federal statutes and regulations to particular agency decisions, but it is well settled that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   \"federal court is competent to decide federal issues correctly[.]\"\n   <em>\n    In re Korean Air Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758400,4332389\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/829/1171/\">\n    829 F.2d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1175 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Thus, Plaintiffs' observation that the instant forum \"regularly resolves administrative record cases involving challenges under the National Environmental Policy Act ... and the Administrative Procedure Act\" (Pls.' Opp'n at 7) is not an especially weighty consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Furthermore, with respect to core competencies, Plaintiffs cannot credibly contend that the District of Wyoming is ill-equipped to handle a case of this nature. While the instant forum does have prior cases in which \"extensive factual and legal findings concerning the federal government's management of the Jackson elk herd\" were made (Pls.' Opp'n at 7-8), the three cases that have been decided in this District involving the elk herd over the past two decades have all involved different federal agencies, different actions, and/or different lands than the instant dispute, and indeed, neither\n   <em>\n    Fund for Animals\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   involved a direct challenge to an elk\n   <em>\n    feeding\n   </em>\n   program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355720\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/91/\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reviewing a challenge to a federal elk hunting program);\n   <em>\n    Fund for Animals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370212\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/27/8/\">\n    27 F.Supp.2d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reviewing a challenge to a federal bison hunt in the context of a preliminary injunction, and finding that agencies had to consider the impact of the elk and bison feeding programs when managing the bison). Thus, it is not at all clear why Plaintiffs suggest that this Court's consideration of the instant (dissimilar) facts and issues would ensure \"judicial efficiency[,]\" \"economy[,]\" and consistency. (Pls.' Opp'n at 8.) Quite to the contrary, a rudimentary Westlaw search reveals that myriad environmental challenges involving wildlife species within the state of Wyoming have been brought and fully adjudicated in the District of Wyoming, including challenges involving elk and bison.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ketcham v.

Thus, far from leading inexorably to the\n   <em>\n    denial\n   </em>\n   of a request to transfer such a matter to the District of Wyoming, Plaintiffs' stated concern about the risk of inconsistent rulings counsels\n   <em>\n    in favor\n   </em>\n   of sending this matter to Wyoming's federal courts-or at least strongly suggests that federal courts outside of Wyoming should more routinely defer to that district's obvious familiarity with the governing law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
