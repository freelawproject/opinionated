Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Legal challenges by the taxicab industry to the advent of so-called Transportation Network Companies (\"TNCs\") such as Uber and Lyft are not new. This lawsuit, brought by taxi companies, does not seek to impose liability on TNCs themselves, but rather against the governmental agency responsible for regulating taxicabs in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Parking Authority (\"PPA\"), for not doing more to combat TNCs before TNCs were legalized in Philadelphia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, Checker Cab Philadelphia and several hundred other medallion-holding taxi companies (collectively, \"Checker\"), seek damages from Defendant PPA and its former executive director, Defendant Vincent Fenerty, alleging their inaction toward TNCs violated the U.S. Constitution in two ways:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, that PPA's failure to apply taxicab regulations to or otherwise regulate TNCs violated the Equal Protection Clause; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, the diminution in value of taxi medallions caused by the failure to regulate TNCs constituted a taking of Checker's property without just compensation of law in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Checker initially sought damages, declaratory relief, and an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After this lawsuit was filed, the Court permitted intervention to Germantown Cab Company (Germantown), a non-medallion-holding taxi company serving several Philadelphia neighborhoods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants' motions for summary judgment as to both Checker and Germantown are presently before the Court. Checker and Germantown (collectively, the \"Taxi Companies\") have separately opposed these motions; both have also filed a motion pursuant to Rule 56(d) and a motion to file a supplemental memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Act 164 added a new chapter to the Parking Authorities Law, entitled \"Transportation Network Companies,\" which is codified at 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 57A01 -22, and amended the definition of \"taxicab service\" or \"call or demand service\" in 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5701 to exempt TNCs. 2016 Pa. Legis. Serv. Act 2016-164. Sections of the newly enacted Chapter 57A govern issues such as TNC licensure, insurance requirements, driver credentials, fare rates, and the like. 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 57A01 -22. In addition, Act 164 lessens certain regulatory requirements on traditional taxicabs, and requires TNCs to pay assessments of 1.4% of gross revenues in Philadelphia to PPA. 2016 Pa. Legis. Serv. Act 2016-164. Act 164 also directs PPA to enact a new set of regulations governing for-hire transportation in Philadelphia that also governs TNCs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201011\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Checker Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Intervenor Germantown Cab Company is a company operating partial-rights taxicabs. Germantown holds a certificate of public convenience from the Public Utilities Commission allowing it to provide taxicab service in various towns in Montgomery County, as well as the Philadelphia neighborhoods of Germantown, Mt. Airy, Roxborough, Manayunk, and Chestnut Hill. (Germantown Second Am. Compl \u00b6 1, ECF 89; Germantown SOF \u00b6 100, ECF 152-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Penalties for Unauthorized Taxicab Vehicles and Additional PPA Powers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In Philadelphia, vehicles \"may not be operated as a taxicab with citywide call or demand rights ... unless a certificate of public convenience is issued by the authority authorizing the operation of the taxicab and a medallion is attached to the hood of the vehicle.\" 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5714(a)(1). Although the Parking Authorities Law does not define \"authorized vehicle\" or \"unauthorized vehicle,\" the statute contains a section entitled \"Certificate and medallion required\" and sets forth penalties for \"unauthorized vehicles\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (f) Unauthorized vehicles.-Operating an unauthorized vehicle as a taxicab, or giving the appearance of offering call or demand service with an unauthorized vehicle, without first having received a certificate of public convenience and a medallion is a nontraffic summary offense in the first instance and a misdemeanor of the third degree for each offense thereafter. The owner and the driver of a vehicle being operated as or appearing as a taxicab without a certificate of public convenience and a medallion are also subject to civil penalties pursuant to section 5725. Civil penalties which have been assessed and collected shall be deposited in the fund.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5714(f).

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 29, 2016, Plaintiff Checker Cab Philadelphia, Inc. and several hundred other medallion-holding taxicab companies filed this action. (Compl., ECF 1.) At that\n   time, TNCs, most notably Uber and Lyft, had operated in Philadelphia for several years, but Pennsylvania had not yet enacted permanent legislation or regulations allowing TNCs to operate legally in Philadelphia, as discussed further below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Checker asserted that PPA \"arbitrarily violated [their] constitutional rights by applying burdensome and costly tariffs and regulations to Philadelphia taxicabs, while not equally taxing or regulating ... Transportation Network Companies ... which operate in Philadelphia as\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taxis in direct competition\" with Checker. (Compl. \u00b6 4.) Checker further asserted that PPA had \"unconstitutionally deprived Checker of their exclusive taxicab medallion property rights by allowing thousands of other vehicles to provide taxi service in Philadelphia despite not owning taxicab medallions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On September 1, 2016, Checker moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. (Mot. for TRO and Prelim. Inj., ECF 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Germantown moved to intervene on September 21, 2016. (Germantown Mot. to Intervene, ECF 20.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Germantown did not file a separate motion for TRO and/or preliminary injunction. Germantown's motion to intervene was granted on October 4, 2016. (Order Granting Mot. to Intervene, ECF 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court heard two days of testimony in conjunction with the preliminary injunction on September 28 and 29, 2016, and held oral argument the following week. (N.T. 9/28/17-10/4/17, ECF 50, 51, 53.) Checker presented six witnesses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   1) Robert Willis, who ran a business marketing advertisements on LCD screens on the tops of taxicabs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   2) Robert Familant, an employee of Progressive Credit Union, a major lender to the taxicab industry;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   3) Frank Walker, a taxi driver;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   4) Everett Abitbol, founder and owner of Freedom Taxi;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   5) Khalid Alvi, a taxi driver; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   6) Inna Friedman, a taxi industry lender and medallion broker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (N.T. 9/28/17, ECF 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants presented testimony from four witnesses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   1) Defendant Fenerty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   2) PPA General Counsel Dennis Weldon;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   3) PPA Deputy Director of the Taxi and Limousine Division and Manager of Enforcement William Schmid; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   4) PPA Deputy Executive Director Corinne O'Connor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; N.T. 9/29/17, ECF 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Checker's witnesses testified to the extensive safety regulation and rising monetary assessments to which the taxicab industry was subject, as well as the decline in business and concomitant fall in medallion values since TNCs had arrived in Philadelphia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants' witnesses described the difficulties of enforcing the law against a popular, disruptive, and well-financed industry that by that time had been legalized in the remainder of the Commonwealth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The parties entered settlement discussions before Magistrate Judge Rice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Checker and Defendants (but not Germantown) reached agreement on several issues. (Tr. of Settlement Conference, ECF 66.) Defendants agreed that if then-pending legislation to legalize TNCs in Philadelphia were passed, PPA would immediately begin enforcing the requirements of that law; in return, Checker would withdraw the portion of the case requesting injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On November 4, 2016-the day that the contemplated legislation, Act 64, was enacted-Checker filed a three-count Amended Complaint, its operative Complaint in this litigation, which did not seek injunctive relief. (Checker Am. Compl., ECF 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Count I alleged that PPA had violated the taxi companies' equal protection rights by applying taxicab regulations and levying assessments against medallion-holding taxicabs but not TNCs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 113-122.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Count II asserted that PPA's inaction toward TNCs had allowed TNCs to intrude on Checker's exclusive property rights in medallions, which amounted to a taking of private property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123-138.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Count III requested declaratory judgment on the equal protection and takings theories. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 139-143.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Checker also sought compensatory and punitive damages, interest, and attorneys' fees. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 144.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Germantown filed a five-count Second Amended Complaint, its operative Complaint, on January 4, 2017. (Germantown Second Am. Compl., ECF 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Count I alleged that PPA had violated Germantown's equal protection rights by regulating and taxing them but not TNCs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Count II alleged an equal protection violation because Germantown, and not TNCs, was subject to territorial restrictions in the wake of Act 164. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Count III asserted that the 1.4% annual revenue assessment on TNCs, 1% annual revenue assessment on medallion taxis, and the per-vehicle assessments on Germantown imposed as a result of Act 164 violated Germantown's equal protection rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Count IV alleged that Act 164 was unlawful special legislation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Count V sought injunctive relief as to Act 164's alleged unconstitutionality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss both operative Complaints for failure to state a claim. (Mot. to Dismiss Checker Am. Compl, ECF 74; Mot. to Dismiss Germantown Second Am. Compl., ECF 96.) Checker filed a memorandum in partial support of Defendants' motion to dismiss Germantown's Second Amended Complaint, in which it asked this Court to dismiss the claims raised by Germantown that \"exceed[ed] the scope of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint and the relief requested therein.\" (Mem. in Partial Support of Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF 107 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On June 6, 2017, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss. (Order, ECF 130.) The Court found that Checker and Germantown had stated a claim for an equal protection violation based on the theory that PPA had arbitrarily failed to regulate TNCs while enforcing regulations on traditional taxicabs prior to the enactment of Act 164 (Count I of the respective operative Complaints). (Mem. on Mot. to Dismiss, ECF 129.) In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied extensively on a district court decision from Boston finding that taxi companies had stated a claim on a similar failure-to-regulate\n   theory, and distinguished other cases in which taxi companies had brought equal protection challenges to separate regulatory regimes for taxicabs and TNCs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11 (citing\n   <em>\n    Boston Taxi Owners Ass'n, Inc. v. City of Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172485\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/180/108/\">\n    180 F.Supp.3d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2016) ) ). The Court also allowed Checker's takings claim to proceed (Count II), noting that Pennsylvania law defined medallions as property and emphasizing the differences between the Pennsylvania statutory scheme and the regulations in Boston and other cities where courts had dismissed claims on similar takings theories. (Mem. on Mot. to Dismiss, ECF 129 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   While the Court allowed Germantown's arbitrary-failure-to-regulate equal protection claim to proceed (Count I), it dismissed the remainder of Germantown's claims because those claims (Counts II-IV) did not relate to the theory of the case brought by Checker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 n.5.) The Court also noted that counsel for Germantown had stated at oral argument that it was no longer seeking prospective injunctive relief (Count V). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n.2.) Finally, the Court denied Defendant Fenerty's qualified immunity defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Thereafter, the parties engaged in substantial discovery, which included both written discovery, document discovery, and depositions. The Court required PPA and Germantown to make one or two individuals available, and Checker was to make between one and three individuals available, for depositions to be taken pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6). (Order re: Discovery, ECF 146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   At the close of discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment. (Mot. for Summ. J. as to Checker, ECF 147; Mot. for Summ. J. as to Germantown, ECF 148.) Thereafter, Checker sought relief pursuant to Rule 56(d) to be permitted additional discovery on the grounds that Defendants' corporate designees had been insufficiently prepared for their depositions. (Mot. for Relief, ECF 150.) Germantown filed a short statement joining Checker's Rule 56(d) motion. (Mot. for Relief, ECF 151.) After summary judgment briefing was completed, Checker sought leave to file a supplemental memorandum to their opposition to summary judgment. (Mot. to File a Supplemental Mem., ECF 161.) Germantown filed a short statement joining this motion as well. (Mot. to File a Supplemental Mem., ECF 162.) The summary judgment motions, the Rule 56(d) motion, and the motion to file a supplemental memorandum are now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Oral argument was held on January 24, 2018. The Court has considered the post-argument letters, which are docketed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants filed separate motions for summary judgment as to Checker and Germantown. (Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. as to Checker, ECF 147; Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. as to Germantown, ECF 148.) Defendants also filed separate statements of undisputed facts as to Checker and Germantown in numbered paragraphs in accordance with this Court's rules. (Defs.' Checker SOF, ECF 147-2; Defs.' Germantown SOF, ECF 148-2.) The statements of facts, which are largely identical, describe PPA's statutory authority to regulate taxicabs, the operation of TNCs, enforcement efforts by PPA against TNCs, PPA's role in crafting legislation intended to legalize TNCs statewide, and that legislation's ultimate enactment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In memoranda accompanying the motions to dismiss, Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on all theories advanced by Checker and Germantown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Taxi Companies' Equal Protection Clause Theories\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   With respect to both Taxi Companies, Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the Taxi Companies' claims for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Defs.' Mem. in Support of Mot. for Summ. J as to Checker (\"Defs.' Checker Br.\") at 27-64, ECF 147-1; Defs.' Mem. in Support of Mot. for Summ. J as to Checker (\"Defs.' Germantown Br.\") at 27-65, ECF 148-1.) Defendants reproduce their briefing on the equal protection issues essentially verbatim in the two memoranda of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants address the Taxi Companies' equal protection claims as presenting two theories:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   1) PPA arbitrarily failed to regulate TNCs in violation of the Equal Protection Clause; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   2) PPA selectively enforced existing taxicab regulations on taxicabs, but not TNCs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the Taxi Companies' arbitrary-failure-to-regulate theory because numerous other courts-including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, and various other federal district courts-have held that TNCs and taxicabs are not similarly situated classes for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause in the context of failure-to-regulate equal protection claims such as asserted in this litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Defendants, the fact that TNCs and taxicabs are not similarly situated precludes any equal protection disparate treatment claim (such as the failure-to-regulate claim), and in any event, the Taxi Companies fail to meet their burden on rational basis review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants argue that they are also entitled to summary judgment on the Taxi Companies' selective enforcement equal protection theory for several reasons. (Defs.' Checker Br. at 48-64; Defs.' Germantown Br. at 48-65.) Proceeding from the position that TNCs were illegal taxicabs, Defendants contend that the only enforcement action PPA was legally allowed to take with respect to TNCs was to impound vehicles and issue citations. (Defs.' Checker Br. at 50-51; Defs.' Germantown Br. at 50-51.) Defendants next contend that taxicabs as legal market participants and TNCs as illegal market participants are not similarly situated, and the equal protection rights of legal market participants such as the Taxi Companies are therefore not affected by the amount of enforcement against illegal competitors. (Defs.' Checker Br. at 50-52; Defs.' Germantown Br. at 51-53.) Finally, Defendants assert that PPA did not act with an unlawful or discriminatory motive toward the Taxi Companies, as is necessary to support a claim for selective enforcement. (Defs.' Checker Br. at 53-65; Defs.' Germantown Br. at 53-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Checker's Takings Clause Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants argue that they are also entitled to summary judgment on Checker's claim that PPA's failure to regulate TNCs amounted an unconstitutional taking of taxi medallions. (Defs.' Checker Br. at 65-75.) Although Defendants concede that Checker had a property interest in taxicab medallions, Defendants argue that any takings claim offered by Checker necessarily rests on the assumption that Checker had a right either to the value of a taxicab medallion, or a right to exclude TNCs from the transportation-for-hire market itself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both of these premises, Defendants argue, have been universally rejected by other courts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Judicial Estoppel Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In a consolidated reply brief filed as to both Checker and Germantown, Defendants respond to the Taxi Companies' arguments regarding judicial estoppel. (Defs.' Consolidated Reply Br. at 3-5, ECF 158.) As discussed below, the Taxi Companies argue that PPA should be judicially estopped from arguing that TNCs and taxicabs are similarly situated classes by virtue of positions that PPA took before the Court of Common Pleas in litigation over citations on TNC drivers,\n   <em>\n    Than My Trinh v. Philadelphia Parking Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203566288\">\n    2016 WL 3566288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Com. Pl. May 18, 2016). Defendants assert that the doctrine of judicial estoppel simply does not apply in this case because PPA had asserted a different legal position in the Court of Common Pleas litigation. PPA states it had previously asserted that TNCs were illegally providing call or demand service within the text of the statute and that position is not the same as Defendants' argument in this case that TNCs and taxicabs are not similarly situated under the Equal Protection Clause. (Defs.' Reply Br. at 3-5.) Defendants further assert that PPA did not take these positions in bad faith, as would be required for the Court to apply judicial estoppel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Taxicab Companies' Responses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Checker and Germantown each separately oppose Defendants' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Checker Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The PPA Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Checker begins its opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment with a review of the PPA statute in order to refute Defendants' argument that PPA's enforcement powers relative to TNCs were limited to citations and impoundments. Checker lists many powers PPA enjoyed pursuant to 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5505(d), including the ability \"[t]o sue and be sued\" and \"[t]o do all acts and things necessary ... to carry out the powers granted to the authority by this chapter or any other statute.\" (Checker Mem. in Opp. to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss (\"Checker Br.\") at 30.) Checker then argues that TNCs provided \"call or demand service\" or \"taxicab service\" within the meaning of 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5701, thereby bringing TNCs within the regulatory jurisdiction of PPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-38.) Checker argues that \"[t]he breadth of \u00a7 5701's language afforded PPA the flexibility to regulate both foreseen and unforeseen actors that provided 'call or demand service,' such as partial-rights taxicabs, unauthorized service providers known as 'hack taxicabs,' and even TNCs.\" (Checker Br. at 34.) Thus, pursuant to the powers set forth by statute, PPA could have promulgated emergency regulations for TNCs or sought an injunction against the operation of TNCs in Philadelphia, but chose to do neither. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    2. PPA's Failure to Regulate in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In the next major section of its brief, Checker asserts that Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on Checker's Fourteenth Amendment failure-to-regulate claim because, as a threshold matter, taxicabs and TNCs are similarly situated for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause-both taxicabs and TNCs provided \"call or demand\" service in the Philadelphia market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.) In Checker's view, the fact that PPA enforced existing regulations against taxicabs but did not issue regulations for TNCs or seek an injunction against them constituted disparate treatment in violation of the Equal Protection Clause for which Defendants offered no rational basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-49.) Without much specificity, Checker asserts that genuine\n   issues of material fact exist so as to defeat summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Checker's Selective Enforcement Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Checker then offers a brief alternative argument, largely devoted to distinguishing Defendants' case law support, that PPA's failure to regulate satisfied the elements for a selective enforcement claim under the Equal Protection Clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-53.) This argument will be discussed in greater detail,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Checker's Takings Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Checker argues that PPA inaction toward TNCs caused substantial drops in taxicab medallion values, which \"amount[ed] to a taking without just compensation\" in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.) Unlike their counterparts in other cities, Philadelphia taxicab medallions are statutorily defined as \"property\" in 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5713(a), and, as Checker would have it, therefore conferred \"exclusive property rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.) Checker describes the PPA statute as \"expressly provid[ing] that Philadelphia taxicab medallions possessed exclusive property rights that would be insulated from large-scale 'illegal' 'call or demand service' providers by its exclusive regulator-the PPA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because of the uniqueness of the Pennsylvania statutory scheme, Checker considers case law from other cities to be inapposite. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Relying on the testimony of Robert Familant, an employee of a credit union involved in the taxi lending industry, who had testified in support of Checker at the preliminary injunction hearing, Checker also argues that PPA had approached medallion lenders to encourage them to lend in Philadelphia, and then destroyed that very lending market through inaction toward TNCs, which caused medallion values to plummet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Taxi Companies' Claim re: Judicial Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Finally, Checker contends that PPA should be judicially estopped from arguing to this Court that taxicabs and TNCs are similarly situated by virtue of positions it took before the Court of Common Pleas in appeals of PPA citations on private vehicle owners and impoundments of vehicles used for transportation for hire, without a medallion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-72.) In one such case, PPA defended the citation and impoundment as follows in its brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   [Appellant]'s vehicle was being operated as an unauthorized service provider, and therefore subject to the Authority's jurisdiction. [Appellant] argues strenuously that Lac was operating not as a taxicab or limousine, but rather as a TNC which is not regulated by the Authority simply because the trip was booked using the UberX application on a cellphone, rather than the traditional telephone call or on-street hail. However using an alternate means of technology to secure the service does not redefine what the service is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Quite simply, [Appellant] allowed Lac to use her vehicle to hold himself out as a common carrier to transport individuals between two points in Philadelphia in a vehicle not authorized for such a purpose, with the expectation of receiving compensation for doing so. Regardless of the name ascribed to it ... such activity is clearly in violation of the Parking Authorities Law and the Regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   (PPA Br. to Com. Pl. Ct. at 9, Ex. 16 to Checker Br., ECF 153-5.) Thereafter, the Court of Common Pleas found that the service at issue was \"simply a variant of a 'hack' taxi cab.\"\n   <em>\n    Than My Trinh v. Philadelphia Parking Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203566288\">\n    2016 WL 3566288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1 (Pa. Com. Pl. May 18, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Rejecting the arguments that PPA was without jurisdiction, Judge Carpenter found the ride \"was hailed via the UBERX phone app, which falls within the legislative definition of a 'telephone call' and a 'hail' and, thus, [the appellant's] vehicle was providing 'call or demand' taxi service. Such 'call or demand' taxi service within the City was provided without the requisite PPA certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Because the PPA had jurisdiction to enforce its regulations, the court upheld the fine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Checker regards the above passage in the PPA brief to the Court of Common Pleas as a representation by PPA that TNCs and taxicabs provide the same service; thus, any argument made to this Court subsequent to its successful briefing represents a \"bad faith change in positions on taxicabs and TNCs.\" (Checker Br. at 65.) Checker requests that Defendants be estopped from asserting five legal positions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   (1) The PPA lacked the statutory authority to regulate TNCs similarly to taxicabs under 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5505(d) and 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5701, et seq.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   (2) Taxicabs and TNCs are not similarly situated and direct competitors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   (3) TNCs do not provide the same \"call or demand service\" as taxicabs under 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5701.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   (4) The term \"hail\" is limited to street hails under 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5701.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   (5) The fact that taxicabs rely primarily on street hails and TNCs rely e-hails [sic] to secure its riders is a valid basis for distinguishing the two entities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    (\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In the alternative, Checker requests that PPA's change in position relative to TNCs be construed as an admission that genuine issues of material fact exist in this case: \"PPA's contradictory and inexplicable 'about face' on its obligations to regulate TNCs creates genuine issues of material fact that must be decided by the jury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Germantown Brief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Selective Enforcement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Germantown frames its equal protection challenge in terms of selective enforcement, which Germantown asserts it has \"proven.\" (Germantown Br. at 7, ECF 152-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As a threshold matter, Germantown sets forth some six reasons why Germantown, as a partial-rights taxicab company, is similarly situated to TNCs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   a. Germantown is similarly situated to TNCs because the PPA's regulations do not permit Germantown to pick-up street hails outside of their territory in Philadelphia, yet prearranged rides are permitted, like Uber and Lyft.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   b. Germantown is similarly situated to TNCs because, like Uber and Lyft, Germantown maintains a certificate of authority issued by the PUC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   c. Germantown is similarly situated to TNCs because, like Uber and Lyft, Germantown's certificate of authority issued by the PUC allows it the ability to offer its services on an exclusive and non-exclusive basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   d. Germantown is similarly situated to TNCs because, like Uber and Lyft, Germantown also provides prearranged trips.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   e. Germantown is similarly situated to TNCs because, like Uber and Lyft, when prearranged trips are dispatched by Germantown, the identity of the rider is made known to the driver of the dispatched taxi prior to the commencement of the trip.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   f. Germantown is similarly situated to TNCs because Uber drivers at times pick-up anonymous passengers who have no contract with Uber.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Germantown next argues that, through PPA's failure to regulate TNCs, Defendants engaged in arbitrary and capricious action that \"should not be entitled to governmental deference.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) It argues that PPA could have issued regulations for TNCs pursuant to 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5722 -which allows PPA to promulgate rules and regulations \"as it deems necessary to govern the regulation of taxicabs\"-but failed to exercise its statutory authority. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-18.) In addition, PPA lacked any rational basis for its failure to promulgate TNC regulations or seek injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.) According to Germantown's reading of the record, agency decisions, and statutory authority, PPA employees witnessed but ignored illegal TNC activity in Philadelphia, and entrusted TNC enforcement to an inadequate enforcement team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-23.) At the time that PPA was doing next to nothing to combat TNCs, \"PPA did not hold back at its efforts in revoking Germantown Cab's certificate for public convenience\" or \"disputing a 2015 assessment approximating $250,000 that the PPA lodged on Germantown.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Finally, Germantown asserts that when PPA vigorously enforced existing laws on Germantown at the same time as it failed to regulate TNCs, PPA acted with an improper motive-namely, in retaliation for Germantown's voicing its opposition to PPA policy, including by speaking up at public meetings and filing lawsuits against PPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Together, these courses of conduct constituted \"selective enforcement of [PPA's] regulations,\" which \"should be found violative of Germantown's Equal Protection rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Judicial Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Germantown also echoes Checker's argument that positions PPA took in appeals of citations on TNC vehicle owners and impoundments of TNC vehicles judicially estops Defendants from arguing that taxicabs and TNCs are not similarly situated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.) Unlike Checker, Germantown did not request that these purportedly inconsistent litigation positions be construed as an admission that genuine issues of material fact exist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. TNCs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The parties do not attempt to define Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) before proceeding to discuss the purported similarities or differences between taxicabs and TNCs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court, however, infers from the submissions of all parties that TNCs are a business model through which customers must use a smartphone app to arrange transportation from a driver, who picks up and transports a passenger, usually in the driver's personal vehicle. Compensation is handled by requiring the customer to \"register\" a credit card with the TNC's website, which then makes a charge for the ride on the customer's credit card. No cash is accepted unless the customer voluntarily gives the driver a gratuity. (Defs.' Checker SOF at \u00b6 22; Checker Br. at 16, 33; Germantown SOF \u00b6 22.) Two well-known TNCs are Uber and Lyft. (Defs.' Checker SOF at \u00b6 22; Checker Br. at 1; Germantown Br. at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Defendants make several contentions about the operation of TNCs, which emphasize\n   the differences between taxicabs and TNCs, that the Taxi Companies dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Defendants assert that TNCs may not accept \"anonymous street hails\"-i.e., a raised hand-and that the identity of a TNC rider is known to a TNC driver. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 22, 26; Defs.' Germantown SOF \u00b6 22, 26.) Germantown states that it is possible for a passenger to hail a TNC anonymously if a third party arranges a ride. (Germantown SOF \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Checker denies Defendants' assertion that TNCs do not accept cash, but instead require payment through an app user's verified credit card. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 24; Defs.' Germantown SOF \u00b6 24.) Checker denies this, but offers no facts of its own. (Checker SOF \u00b6 24.) Germantown claims that it is possible to pay for an Uber ride via gift certificate. (Germantown SOF \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Defendants assert that TNC drivers often work part-time to earn supplemental income, drive their own private vehicles, and put less wear and tear on those vehicles by driving fewer miles. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 26; Defs.' Germantown SOF \u00b6 26.) The Taxi Companies deny this without providing additional facts. (Checker SOF \u00b6 26; Germantown SOF \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Defendants assert that TNCs \"serve a customer base which desires to use only a smartphone to complete the entire transaction, including arranging and paying for the trip, with no need for cash or credit cards, and which has come to expect timely responsiveness which taxicabs have not historically provided, particularly outside urban centers.\" (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 27; Defs.' Germantown SOF \u00b6 27.) Checker notes that taxicab companies also allowed customers to order taxis through apps even before the arrival of TNCs in Philadelphia. (Checker SOF \u00b6 27.) Germantown denies knowing whether this statement is correct. (Germantown SOF \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Overall, to the extent that the operations of TNCs are relevant to the issue of \"similarly situated\" under the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Claim, the disputes about TNCs are not material. The Court can take judicial notice that TNCs are a novel transportation service made possible by digital technology that did not exist until, approximately, the last five years but TNCs have proven immensely popular with the public, particularly in an urban environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

At oral argument, both the Taxi Companies and PPA agreed that TNCs were operating illegally in Philadelphia until Act 164 came into effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Between October 14, 2014, and June 2016, PPA impounded one hundred TNC vehicles, which were towed at a cost of $1,000 each to recover. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 51; Checker SOF \u00b6 51.) PPA also issued \"hundreds\" of citations of $1,000 to TNCs and drivers. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 51; Checker SOF \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   PPA filed administrative complaints before its own adjudicative body against Uber in August 2015 and against Lyft in January 2016, seeking fines of $1,000 for each day that those companies operated illegally in Philadelphia. (Administrative Complaints, ECF 147-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   On June 6, 2016, PPA, Uber, and its wholly owned subsidiary Rasier-PA executed a \"Settlement Agreement and Mutual\n   Release\" in which PPA agreed to \"cease all impound and enforcement actions\" until September 30, 2016 against drivers for those TNCs and to stay all matters involving drivers and/or the parties to the agreement in exchange for payment, pending the legalization of TNCs in Philadelphia. (Temporary Settlement Agreement, ECF 147-13 at 23-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   PPA did not file any court action seeking to enjoin the operation of TNCs in Philadelphia or promulgate regulations governing TNCs prior to the enactment of Act 164 on November 4, 2016.

(Application of Rasier-PA, ECF 147-14.) The PUC decision explicitly did \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   authorize Rasier-PA to provide experimental service originating or terminating at points in the City of Philadelphia.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78 n.25) (emphasis original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   PPA was involved in efforts to craft legislation that would legalize TNCs across the Commonwealth, including Philadelphia. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 64; Defs.' Germantown SOF \u00b6 65; Checker SOF \u00b6 64; Germantown SOF \u00b6 65.) On June, 11, 2015, Defendant Fenerty testified before the Consumer Affairs Committee of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   TNCs currently operate in Philadelphia. At the end of the day, a TNC is a vehicle that picks up a customer upon request, drives that customer to a desired destination and charges a fee to do so.

Otherwise, an imbalance in competition will imperil further limousine advances and ... major taxicab initiatives ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   I would be remiss if I did not mention the Authority's frustration with the on-going illegal activities of Uber (through Uber \"X\") and Lyft in Philadelphia ... Without legal precedent and over the Authority's clear prohibition, both Uber and Lyft have opted to launch illegal \"for hire\" vehicle transportation services in Philadelphia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   (Fenerty Testimony, Ex. 21 to Defs.' Checker Mot. to Dismiss, ECF 147-15.) On February 4, 2016, PPA chairman Joseph Ashdale wrote a letter to Representative Bob Godshall, chair of the committee, in which Ashdale stated, \"We have never concealed our objective, which is to reach consensus on a bill to legalize TNC's in a way that benefits Philadelphia's traveling public ... for over a year the Authority has consistently supported the legalization of TNCs, if done properly. That position may not sit well with many taxicab and limousine owners in Philadelphia, but we believe it is the right thing to do for the public.\" (Ashdale Letter, Ex. 22 to Defs.' Checker Mot. to Dismiss, ECF 147-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   PPA was involved in negotiations with legislators, representatives of Uber and Lyft, and the City of Philadelphia as the legislation that became Act 164 progressed. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 64-68; Checker SOF \u00b6 64-68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Act 164 was signed by Governor Wolf on November 4, 2016. Act 164 added an entirely new Chapter 57A to the Parking Authorities Law, entitled \"Transportation Network Companies,\" which is codified at 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 57A01 -22, and amended the definition of \"taxicab service\" or \"call or demand service\" in 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5701 to exempt TNCs. 2016 Pa. Legis. Serv. Act 2016-164. The new sections of Chapter 57A contain sections governing TNC licensure, insurance requirements, driver credentials, fare rates, and the like. 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 57A01 -22. As noted above, Act 164 also lessens certain regulations on taxi cabs, and requires TNCs to pay assessments of 1.4% of gross revenues in Philadelphia to PPA. 2016 Pa. Legis. Serv. Act 2016-164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Disputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Although both Checker and Germantown assert a number of disputes of fact, the overarching dispute is essentially one of narrative. PPA portrays itself to this Court as an aggressive regulator doing its best, with limited resources, to carry out enforcement actions as it traditionally did. PPA emphasizes the challenges it faced in navigating the divergent interests of the taxicab industry, TNCs, the legislature, and the public. The Taxi Companies depict PPA as ineffectual at every turn in enforcing laws against TNCs-an enforcement effort they assert that the taxicab industry subsidized-and the PPA was all too eager to overlook flagrant violations of the law, even when personally witnessed by top PPA employees. The Taxi Companies detail the changing positions of PPA regarding TNCs, allege a \"secret\" deal between PPA and Uber in summer 2016, and imply that they were excluded from legislative efforts to craft TNC legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Additional discussion of Checker's and Germantown's statements of undisputed facts, which both Checker and Germantown divide into two sections-first responding to PPA's facts and then adducing facts of their own-is set forth below. In many cases, Germantown denies Defendants' contentions without citing to facts in the record, and the Court will therefore discuss only those portions of the counter-statements of facts that contain record support. The Court will omit discussion of the statutory framework, which is discussed elsewhere in this memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Taxi Companies dispute that PPA enforcement was the reason an early TNC, SideCar, left Philadelphia. (Checker SOF \u00b6 28; Germantown SOF \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Taxi Companies deny that Uber began operating its UberX service in Philadelphia on October, 14, 2014. (Checker SOF \u00b6 29; Germantown SOF \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Checker asserts that the limited relevant discovery period concerning TNC activity in this case is from October 2014 to the passage of Act 164 of November 4, 2016; however, Checker notes that Defendant Fenerty met with Uber executives prior to 2014, who advised Fenerty that they were coming to Philadelphia and refused to submit to regulation. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 29; Checker SOF \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The Taxi Companies sharply contest PPA's assertion that \"PPA took steps from the very outset to combat the illegal operations of TNCs.\" (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 35; Checker SOF \u00b6 35; Germantown SOF \u00b6 36.) Germantown asserts that \"PPA did nothing to combat the operations of TNCs, but instead looked the other way while TNCs operated.\" (Germantown SOF \u00b6 36.) Checker asserts, with numerous citations, facts that PPA failed to take steps from the very outset to combat the illegal operation of TNCs, including the fact that PPA had previously met with representatives of TNCs, who had effectively put PPA on notice that TNCs would be expanding into the Philadelphia market. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 35; Checker SOF \u00b6 35.) Checker implies that part of the motivation was to seek approval from the TNCs that PPA would be a \"friendly regulator\"-although Checker does not specifically use that phrase. Checker asserts that PPA \"failed to seek injunctive relief against Uber to shut down the use of its smartphone app, which would have crippled its operations and forced them to submit to fair regulation.\" (Checker SOF \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Checker cites a number of other facts concerning Uber operations and PPA enforcement. (Checker SOF \u00b6 41-44.) While Checker cites to testimony regarding software Uber used to thwart regulators, it repeatedly mentions the fact that PPA failed to seek injunctive relief; in one of\n   many somewhat repetitive assertions, Checker asserts that \"while PPA was swinging its regulatory hammer against taxicabs, its enforcement actions against TNCs were virtually non-existent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Checker denies PPA's statement that PPA \"solicited the assistance of both taxicab medallion owners and drivers to provide new phones to create 'fresh' TNC accounts to continue these enforcement efforts,\" and asserts that PPA pushed all of its costs associated with regulating TNCs on to the taxicab industry. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 45; Checker SOF \u00b6 45.) Checker therefore implies that PPA increased the taxicabs' costs of doing business at the same time PPA's inaction allowed Uber to establish a foothold in Philadelphia and begin its marketing activity without any kind of regulatory oversight, let alone a regulatory oversight similar to what PPA was exercising against taxicabs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Checker cites testimony from Defendant Fenerty that PPA refused to join a taxicab lawsuit against TNCs in this Court,\n   <em>\n    Checker Cab Philadelphia, Inc. v. Uber Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A. 14-7265,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20966284\">\n    2015 WL 966284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. Mar. 3, 2015), described above. (Checker SOF \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   PPA and the Taxi Companies differ in their interpretation of the 2014 decision of the Public Utilities Commission on the application of Rasier-PA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber, to operate in much of Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia. PPA reads the relevant language of the decision granting TNCs legal authority to operate in parts of the Commonwealth to mean that PPA had jurisdiction over TNCs whose starting point\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ending point were both in Philadelphia. The Taxi Companies interpret that same language to mean that PPA could enforce the law against TNCs whose starting point\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   ending point was in Philadelphia. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 47-48; Checker SOF \u00b6 47-48; Germantown SOF \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As a result of their respective readings of the PUC decision on TNCs outside of Philadelphia, the parties disagree as to whether PPA willfully overlooked or discounted the significance of Uber's violations of law or PPA regulations, particularly with respect to TNC vehicles operating at 30\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street Station in Philadelphia and Philadelphia International Airport whose point of origin or destination might be in a place where TNC service had been legalized. (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6\u00b6 51-61; Checker SOF \u00b6\u00b6 51-61; Germantown SOF \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.) Checker quotes former Mayor Nutter about the failure of regulation over TNCs, because PPA was a state agency over which the City had no control. (Checker SOF \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Checker asserts that Defendant Fenerty was involved in drafting proposed TNC regulations in Harrisburg-which Defendants do not deny-and emphasizes that the taxicab industry criticized PPA for taking inconsistent positions on TNCs. (Checker SOF \u00b6 64-68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The parties characterize the implications of the \"Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release\" entered into between PPA, Uber, and its subsidiary Rasier-PA in sharply contrasting terms. PPA describes the agreement as \"a temporary agreement to help alleviate a temporary transportation crisis in Philadelphia-pursuant to which PPA agreed to temporarily stay enforcement for 90 days.\" (Defs.' Checker SOF \u00b6 71; Defs.' Germantown SOF \u00b6 72.) Germantown asserts that \"[t]he PPA Uber Deal authorized Uber to provide citywide taxicab service in Philadelphia without complying with ... 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5701 - 5745.\" (Germantown SOF \u00b6 81.) Checker describes this agreement as a \"secret deal\" allowing Uber \"to operate during the Democratic\n   National Convention.\" (Checker SOF \u00b6 130.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The Court finds that many of the Taxi Companies' additional facts overlap with the previous disputes over PPA's statement of undisputed facts. (Checker SOF \u00b6 79,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .) Many of the Taxi Companies' disputed facts also rephrase the main position of Checker that there are \"no differences between taxicabs and TNCs.\" (Checker SOF \u00b6 103; Germantown SOF 95-105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Checker describes PPA's communications with financial lenders concerning the taxicab industry, and the finances of PPA itself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80-90.) According to Checker, PPA refused to endorse deregulation of the taxicab industry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) Checker describes the increase and subsequent decrease of the value of taxicab medallions, which occurred at the same time as PPA increased its annual medallion assessments and fees on taxicabs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88-89.) Finally, Checker implies that PPA's resources were not at all limited during the relevant time period, noting that PPA holds over $370 million in assets, including over $107 million in restricted cash and investments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Checker makes many additional assertions about meetings with members of the Pennsylvania legislature or with Uber, and testimony given by Defendant Fenerty and others about the operations of TNCs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91-96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Conclusion re Disputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that these disputed, or purportedly disputed, facts are either irrelevant to the principles of constitutional law governing this litigation, or insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that would defeat Defendants' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The Taxi Companies have raised a number of issues as to whether PPA could have, or should have done, more to regulate TNCs as they were starting up their business operations in Philadelphia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   PPA asserts that that there are no material disputes of fact. The Court agrees. What PPA did or did not do is not in dispute. PPA's motivations, intent, and competence are disputed, but these disputes are not relevant under established law. The Court has reviewed above the extensive argument and contentions about PPA's failures to act as it was arguably authorized to act, with regard to the advent of TNCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The Court can conclude, from the Taxi Companies' evidence taken in the light most favorable to the Taxi Companies, that PPA at times was ineffective, inconsistent, contradictory, and confusing-in its public conduct and in its statements made in various venues such as the testimony before the legislature, and in certain judicial proceedings. The Taxi Companies have also shown that at times PPA appeared conciliatory to the advent of the TNCs, knowing that their growing popularity among the public posed a threat to the economic vitality and viability of taxicabs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the movant can show \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Taxis but not TNPs are permitted to take on as passengers persons who hail them on the street. Rarely will the passenger have a prior relationship with the driver, and often not with the taxicab company either; and it makes sense therefore for the City to try to protect passengers by screening the taxi drivers to assure that they're competent and by imposing a uniform system of rates based on time or distance or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   So taxi service is regulated by the City of Chicago, but so is TNP service, though differently because the service is different from taxi service. A major difference is that customers, rather than being able to hail an Uber car, must sign up with Uber before being able to summon it, and the sign up creates a contractual relationship specifying such terms as fares, driver qualifications, insurance, and any special need of the potential customer owing to his or her having a disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   Unlike taxicab service Uber assumes primary responsibility for screening potential drivers and hiring only those found to be qualified, and the passengers receive more information in advance about their prospective rides-information that includes not only the driver's name but also pictures of him (or her) and of the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   Furthermore, the TNPs use part-time drivers extensively, and it is believed that these part-timers drive their cars fewer miles on average than taxicab drivers, who are constantly patrolling the streets in hope of being hailed; and the fewer miles driven the less likely a vehicle is to experience wear and tear\n   that may impair the comfort of a ride in it and even increase the risk of an accident or a breakdown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (paragraph breaks added).

Considering the disputed facts in the light most favorable to the Taxi Companies, as the Court must do on a summary judgment motion by Defendants, no fact disputes warrant the Court denying summary judgment to PPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   At oral argument, PPA counsel asserted that the determination of whether two entities are similarly situated is a question of fact. Counsel for the Taxi Companies did not disagree. The following citations warrant the Court's conclusion that the issue of whether two classes are similarly situated is fundamentally a legal issue\n   which can be decided as a matter of law, and in numerous cases has been decided as a matter of law, which conclusions have been upheld by the Third Circuit. Yet, whether it is a factual issue or whether it is a legal conclusion, the result on the present record is that taxicabs and TNCs are not similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Third Circuit has in numerous cases delineated what it means to be similarly situated in the context of the Equal Protection Clause, and has approved a district court's determination of whether two entities are similarly situated as a matter of law, including at the summary judgment stage. When presented with equal protection claims such as those in this litigation, district courts must decide whether two entities are similarly situated.\n   <em>\n    Congregation Kol Ami v.

Are Taxicabs and TNCs Similarly Situated?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   In this case, the parties have had extensive opportunities to develop the facts but the Court concludes that the issue of \"similarly situated\" can be determined from the Undisputed Facts, and also taking the facts alleged by Checker and Germantown, in the light most favorable to Checker and Germantown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   The factual record supports a conclusion that the only common aspect between taxicabs and TNCs, at least in Philadelphia, is that they provide single ride transportation by a car and driver for a fee. Otherwise, the business models and legal status are substantially different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   First, the business model of the taxicab companies is substantially different than the business model of transportation network companies. Even if the governing statute, by reference to the \"telephone\" availability of both taxicabs and TNCs, were to be determinative, any similarity stops there. To start with, what is now called a \"landline\" telephone is totally useless to order a TNC vehicle. Only a person with a \"smartphone,\" which most importantly operates on a wireless basis, without a telephone \"wire\" line, can engage a TNC vehicle. The smartphone combines both telephone communication plus other data such as the precise location of the customer, and the available vehicles in the customer's area. There is also a totally different payment model, as referenced above. The passenger does not pay the driver, but payment for the service will automatically appear on the passenger's pre-registered credit card. Although the Taxi Companies assert that some taxicabs can now be engaged on a basis similar to TNCs, the Taxi Companies have not made any showing this was a common practice prior to Act 164. Further, the fact that taxicabs now accept credit cards for payment does not make the two different business models \"similarly situated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Secondly, as noted above, the taxicab companies have been operating lawfully. However, until the effective date of Act 164, the TNCs were operating illegally in the Philadelphia market. The fact that PPA did not act as aggressively as it might have, which the Court will accept as a fair statement that Checker and Germantown have proven, does not make the taxicab companies and the TNCs similarly situated. From the record in this case, this Court can only conclude, prior to Act 164, that the TNCs were making transportation available to the public in a widespread basis, but were not complying with existing legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Third, the Court deems it significant that the Pennsylvania legislature enacted substantially new legislation specifically governing TNCs, rather than simply amending the existing law to authorize PPA to regulate TNCs in the same manner PPA was regulating taxicabs. The legislature therefore clearly considered TNCs\n   to be a new form of for-hire transportation, separate and distinct from taxicabs. If the legislature had instead authorized PPA to regulate TNCs under the existing taxicab statutes, then Checker and Germantown would have a stronger argument that they were similarly situated to TNCs during the relevant period. However, Act 164, which separates TNCs and taxicabs into separate statutory chapters with separate legal requirements, reveals the extent to which the legislature acted and concluded TNCs and taxicabs should be treated differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Fourth, the Taxi Companies have offered no legal support for the proposition that a legal participant in a regulated market is \"similarly situated\" to an illegal participant in the same regulated market. The Taxi Companies have identified no case law in which a court has found that a legal market participant suffered a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment through the laxity of a regulator toward an illegal competitor, and this Court has found none. The Taxi Companies have not shown that regulated market participants may be awarded damages on the theory that a regulator did not take specific steps, such as seeking an injunction, to shut down illegal competition. Whether the PPA could have come down harder on TNCs-for instance, by seeking an injunction or itself promulgating new regulations-and whether the Equal Protection Clause required it to have done so, are entirely different questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Lastly, the precedents cited above, such as\n   <em>\n    Illinois Transportation\n   </em>\n   , although not dealing with the specific facts in this case, are substantial authority for a legal conclusion that taxicabs and TNCs are not similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   One of the decisions cited above,\n   <em>\n    Melrose Credit Union\n   </em>\n   , specifically held that TNCs and taxicabs were not similarly situated.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274479\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/247/356/#p369\">\n    247 F.Supp.3d at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[q]uite simply, medallion taxicabs are not similarly situated to FHVs because medallion taxicabs, as alleged by Plaintiffs, have, effectively, a collective, government-sanctioned monopoly over one particular form of hailing\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Even if the Taxi Companies are Similarly Situated, PPA is Not Liable on a Disparate Treatment Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Assuming arguendo that taxicabs and TNCs are \"similarly situated,\" the Court does not find genuine issues of facts that are material to the question of PPA's liability in this case, and settled law requires granting PPA's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Two courts have accepted the proposition that TNCs and taxicabs are similarly situated for the sake of argument, but nonetheless ruled for the defendant industry regulators on the grounds that \"rational bases\" exist to justify the different regulatory frameworks, or that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden.\n   <em>\n    Boston II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20354010\">\n    2017 WL 354010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"[e]ven taking as true all of plaintiffs' allegations that taxicabs and TNCs are similarly situated, plaintiffs have failed to negate all of the purported bases\" for enacting state law governing TNCs but not taxicabs);\n   <em>\n    Desoto CAB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270315\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/950/#p960\">\n    228 F.Supp.3d at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (assuming, without deciding, that TNCs and taxicabs were similarly situated, but finding \"a reasonably conceivable set of facts\" to justify separate regulatory regimes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   At oral argument, counsel for Checker vigorously asserted that the Philadelphia situation is radically different, such that these decisions are not applicable in this case.

It continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   the Court finds persuasive plaintiffs' argument that many of the obvious differences between taxis from TNCs, such as the kind of vehicle used and the fact that taxicabs must be clearly labeled, are caused by the City's application of the requirements of Rule 403 to taxi operators but not to TNCs. The City may not treat the two groups unequally and then argue that the results of that unequal treatment render the two groups dissimilarly situated and, consequently, not subject to equal protection analysis. Such circular logic is unavailing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   Other qualities cited by defendants fail to differentiate taxi operators from TNCs. Rides with taxis may now be requested and initiated through an app in an identical manner to rides with TNCs. For instance, one TNC app, Uber, allows consumers to use the same platform to initiate a ride with either a TNC vehicle or a traditional taxicab. Similarly, both TNCs and taxicab operators accept credit cards as a form of payment. The fact that taxicabs also may initiate rides through street hails and accept other forms of payment does not necessarily mean they are dissimilarly situated to TNCs for the purpose of equal protection analysis. In fact, taxis and TNCs are clearly similarly situated in one important respect. They are both \"hackney carriages\" as the term is defined in Rule 403.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172485\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/180/108/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boston I\n   </em>\n   did not definitively resolve the issue of whether taxicabs and TNCs were similarly situated; \"[b]ecause several noticeable differences exist between taxis and TNCs the issue is not easily disentangled and is subject to reassessment as the transportation industry evolves apace.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172485\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/180/108/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court further found that the reasons advanced by the city for not subjecting TNCs to Rule 403-the desire for cost-effective transportation and the possibility of state legislation that would preempt Rule 403-were not rationally related to the distinctions between TNCs and taxis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172485\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/180/108/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172485\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/180/108/\">\n    at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

PPA also had reason to anticipate that the Pennsylvania legislature would enact legislation to regulate TNCs, which was preferable to all other alternatives. The passage of the legislation justifies PPA's expectations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   PPA may have moderated its enforcement approach because it was aware that there was a great public acceptance of TNCs, and that the competition between TNCs and taxicabs was beneficial to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   PPA's regulation of taxicabs was, at least to some extent, safety-oriented and, as developed at the prior hearing on the Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction, there were good and sufficient reasons established on the record for many PPA regulations for safety of passengers, drivers, and other drivers on the highway. Some regulations were economic in nature. The Court urged PPA to reconsider these as putting a burden on taxicabs coping with the advent of TNCs. This was a primary reason why the Court suggested that PPA and the taxicab industry mediate these economically based regulations before Magistrate Judge Rice, which resulted in a settlement of those regulatory issues, as a result of which the amended complaint, which is presently before the Court, only alleges damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Selective Enforcement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The Taxi Companies, especially Germantown,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   also argue their arbitrary-failure-to-regulate theory under the doctrine of selective enforcement. Germantown complains that PPA failed to seek a court injunction against the operation of TNCs or to promulgate TNC regulations while at the same time vigorously enforcing existing regulations against Germantown, such as the PPA's attempt in summer 2016 to revoke Germantown's certificate of public convenience for failing to attend an inspection and its imposition in 2015 of a $250,000 assessment, which Germantown then later successfully challenged in court. (Germantown Br. 24-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Germantown further argues that the PPA acted with an improper motive because of Germantown's \"exercise of its\n   First Amendment Rights,\" such as filing lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of PPA rules and regulations, appealing citations, testifying against the PPA at hearings, and making public comments critical of the PPA and the PPA's lower assessments for medallion taxis at PPA board meetings and public meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-32). Germantown further claims, in the selective enforcement section of its brief, that PPA's inaction constituted arbitrary and capricious agency action that is not entitled to deference, and lacked a rational basis. (Germantown Br. at 7-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Defendants argue, correctly, that a selective enforcement theory does not fit the facts of this case. In particular, Germantown cannot proceed on a selective enforcement claim because legal market participants and illegal market participants are not similarly situated, and the record does not support that PPA acted with an improper purpose.

Germantown Br. at 48-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Indisputably, \"[s]elective discriminatory enforcement of a facially valid law is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Jewish Home of E.

This argument construes a state agency's regulation in much too general and nebulous a way. Requiring the PPA to enforce taxicab regulations on Germantown as harshly as on another partial rights operator-perhaps one less vociferously opposed to the PPA-is one thing.

There is no allegation that the government seized or confiscated medallions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Checker's remaining arguments are unavailing. The purported differences between\n   the taxicab medallion regimes in Philadelphia and in other cities-which often cap the number of medallions and sometimes term medallions \"licenses\" or \"permits\" rather than property-are less salient than Checker would have the Court believe.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Joe Sanfelippo Cabs, Inc. v.

Moreover, Checker's arguments, however originally couched in terms of credit markets and investment-backed expectations, ultimately rest on the same resoundingly rejected assumption of constitutionally protectable property interest in the value of the medallions. Checker essentially argues that it is constitutionally entitled to a liquid market in medallion lending-for which valuable medallions are a necessary predicate-a proposition for which it offers no legal support. This Court has found no legal precedent in which a medallion-holding taxi company survived a motion to dismiss on a comparable takings theory, much less received a damage award.

For example, Defendants assert that taxis and TNCs serve different customer bases, TNC drivers often work part-time and drive their own vehicles; and only taxicabs may accept anonymous street hails. (Defs.' Checker Br. at 45-46; Defs.' Germantown Br. at 45-46.) Defendants' position regarding incidental aspects of TNC and taxicab service is not \"irreconcilably inconsistent\" with PPA's earlier statement that \"using an alternate means of technology to secure the service does not redefine what the service is.\" (PPA Br. to Com. Pl. Ct. at 9, Ex. 16 to Checker Br., ECF 153-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   Furthermore, there is no indication that Defendants argue either their former or current position in bad faith. Rather, they\n   seek to persuade this Court to follow the lead of other courts considering equal protection challenges by taxicab companies against regulators, as in\n   <em>\n    Illinois Transportation\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the PPA's representations to the Court of Common Pleas do not meet the exacting standard for judicial estoppel, and the Court declines to impose such a penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   <strong>\n    XII. 56(d) Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   After Defendants moved for summary judgment, Checker sought relief pursuant to Rule 56(d) on the grounds that Defendants' corporate designees were insufficiently prepared for their depositions, and requested either that summary judgment be denied or that they be allowed to take additional discovery. (ECF 150.) Germantown filed a brief statement joining this motion. (ECF 151.) The record shows that the PPA's corporate designees, Christine Kirlin and William Schmid, answered the questions they were posed, and provided testimony on the vast majority of the topics designated for deposition; in Schmid's case, three of the four remaining topics were withdrawn. (Kirlin Dep., ECF 150-1; Schmid Dep. 5-16, ECF 150-1.) The Taxi Companies have already received substantial discovery in this case. Although they clearly seek a greater understanding of why the PPA did not come down harder on TNCs, it is unclear how additional discovery would not create a genuine issue of material fact relevant to the Taxi Companies' claims. The motions for relief are therefore denied. At oral argument, the Taxi Companies failed to articulate any real need for this discovery as a prelude to the Court's decision on the pending motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   <strong>\n    XIII. Motions to File a Supplemental Memorandum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   Checker moved to file a supplemental memorandum in further opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment, which principally sought to add a PPA audit report as an attachment to the prior memorandum. (Supp. Mem., ECF 161.) Germantown filed a brief statement joining this motion. (Supp. Mem., ECF 162.) The PPA audit report contains a number of negative findings, none of which pertains to taxi regulation, medallions, or TNCs. As such, the audit report is irrelevant to the claims in this lawsuit and the motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   <strong>\n    XIV. Defendant Vincent Fenerty's Claim of Qualified Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   As previously noted, Vincent Fenerty, former Executive Director of PPA, was named as an individual defendant in this case, and moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of qualified immunity. The Court denied the motion because no discovery had yet taken place, consistent with Third Circuit jurisprudence. Mr. Fenerty also testified at the preliminary injunction hearing, and as the briefs note, he has authored many documents and also testified before the state legislature on issues involved in this case. The Court believes that under settled Supreme Court and Third Circuit law, that Mr. Fenerty has a very strong legal argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity. First, because the Court is rejecting the Taxi Companies' claims of constitutional violations, the Court believes it is likely proper to make the same conclusion as to Mr. Fenerty. Alternatively, given the extensive discussion of law in this Memorandum and the very vigorous disputes over the applicable law, the Court is inclined to find that the applicable law was not \"clearly established,\" at least in this factual context of PPA regulations and practices, emerging TNCs and their relationship to established taxicab companies. This Court held in\n   <em>\n    Bradley v. West Chester University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269675\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/226/435/\">\n    226 F.Supp.3d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.

Therefore, the Court, consistent with Rule 56 procedures, will give the Taxi Companies an opportunity to present facts the Taxi Companies still believe warrant the Court denying the Fenerty motion for qualified immunity, and by filing a brief memorandum of law citing to matters already in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   <strong>\n    XV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   The economic plight of the taxicab industry has been extensively documented in the media as well as in economic journals. TNCs have proven themselves to be immensely popular. The migration from taxicabs to TNCs, facilitated by the digital revolution, has caused severe hardship for many taxicab owners, operators, and drivers. This suit reflects an effort by the taxicab companies to collect damages from PPA for the loss of income and diminution in the value of their assets. The Court has concluded that the Taxi Companies' legal claims are without foundation under settled legal principles. A court is not suited to protect market participants from competition, or from changing consumer preferences. The marketplace still speaks loudly, probably louder than a court can, and the resolution of competitive combatants must take place in the marketplace, rather than in a courtroom. The Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment in favor of PPA, only, at this time. The Court has considered the Taxi Companies' motions for additional filings and discovery, but finds these motions do not have merit in view of the discussion above.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-300\">\n    Bucks County Services, Inc., which also holds a certificate of public convenience from the PUC and which provides taxicab services to Bucks County and part of northeast Philadelphia, also moved to intervene on September 19, 2016.
