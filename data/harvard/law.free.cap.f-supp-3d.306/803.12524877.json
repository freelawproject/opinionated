Eagles, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Last fall the North Carolina General Assembly abolished primaries for partisan judicial elections in 2018. No other mechanism was provided to reduce the number of candidates on the general election ballot. Candidates self-designate party affiliation and may change party affiliation as late as the day of filing. This change burdens the associational rights of the plaintiff political parties by impeding their ability to focus support on one candidate and to advance their political and electoral goals in the general election. The defendants have offered a legitimate governmental interest in this change as to elections of superior and district court judges, as the legislature plans to redistrict these seats this year and primaries using current district lines may be unnecessary and will cause confusion if and when the redistricting is complete. The defendants have made no showing of any governmental interest supporting the abolishment of a mechanism to narrow the field in partisan appellate judicial races, as those judges are elected statewide and are not subject to redistricting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff political parties are not likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that this statute unconstitutionally infringes their First Amendment rights of association to the extent their claim concerns partisan superior and district court judicial races. The plaintiff political parties are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that this statute infringes their First Amendment rights of association as to partisan appellate judicial races and have otherwise met the requirements for a preliminary injunction. The motion for a preliminary injunction will be granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The North Carolina Constitution requires that the people elect the judges and justices of the district courts, superior courts, and appellate courts.

Both S.L. 2016-125 and S.L. 2017-3 provided for semi-closed primary elections\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for major political parties to determine their nominees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.L. 2016-125, \u00a7 21(a); S.L. 2017-3, \u00a7 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 163A-989). This is consistent with North Carolina's general approach to primary elections for non-judicial partisan races.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 163A-989 (allowing, but not requiring, political parties to hold semi-closed primaries). At the same times, the legislature repealed the provision authorizing elections without primaries when vacancies occur.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.L. 2016-125, 4th Extra Session, \u00a7 21(e) (appellate judges); S.L. 2017-3, \u00a7 13 (superior court judges).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In October 2017, the General Assembly made additional changes to election procedures, including the provisions related to judicial elections challenged here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 656, ratified as S.L. 2017-214. Most of the provisions of S.L. 214 were directed at expanding ballot access and were not limited to judicial elections. For example, it reduced the number of signatures required to recognize groups as political parties and for unaffiliated candidates to be listed on the ballot. S.L. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2(a). This law became effective on January 1, 2018. S.L. 214, \u00a7 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   S.L. 214 also made a number of changes specific to judicial elections in 2018. As a result, in 2018 judges will be elected through a process substantially different from both historical practice and from the election process for other, non-judicial partisan races.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   First, and specifically at issue in this case, S.L. 214 eliminated party primaries for judicial candidates seeking election to the district courts, superior courts, and the appellate courts for the 2018 elections only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.L. 214 \u00a7 4(a). Primaries were not eliminated for any non-judicial elections, which are scheduled for May 8, 2018. Doc. 14-1 at \u00b6 19; Doc. 34 at 3. For judicial races, all candidates will appear only on the general election ballot,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.L. 214, \u00a7 4(a), and the candidate who receives the most votes in the general election will win.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20163-292\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 4(k). The elections remain partisan, so that a candidate's party affiliation will be listed on the ballot. The law did not establish any other approved mechanism for a political party's nominee to be listed on the ballot, nor did it establish any other means for reducing the number of candidates who will appear on the general election ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, the filing period is different: S.L. 214 establishes a candidacy filing period from June 18 to June 29, 2018, for judicial candidates, S.L. 214, \u00a7 4.(a); the candidacy filing period for non-judicial races is from February 12, 2018, to February 28, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. State Bd. of Elections &amp; Ethics Enf't, Candidate Filing Information,\n   <em>\n    available at\n    <em>\n     http://www.ncsbe.gov/Elections/Candidate-Filing\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   (last visited on 1/30/2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, access to the ballot as a candidate is significantly more open for judicial candidates than for other races. Unaffiliated candidates in non-judicial elections must file petitions signed by a certain number of registered voters before they qualify to be placed on the ballot. S.L. 214, \u00a7 2(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But judicial candidates unaffiliated with a party can file without meeting the petition requirement. S.L. 214, \u00a7 4(b), (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As is relevant here, such a judicial candidate need only file a notice of candidacy with the State Board and verify unaffiliated status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, S.L. 214 permits a judicial candidate to change party affiliation immediately before filing for office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.L. 214 \u00a7 4(b) (containing no minimum requirements for party affiliation for judicial elections in 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, for example, a candidate could change from Republican or Unaffiliated to Democrat on the day of filing, and the candidate would then be listed on the ballot as a Democrat. Candidates for other offices must be registered as affiliated with a particular party for at least 90 days before they file to run as a member of that party. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 163A-973.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As a result of these changes, all candidates for judicial office will appear on the general election ballot. For each race, each candidate will be identified by the political party or unaffiliated status, as chosen by the candidate. There is no majority-vote requirement, so if multiple candidates file, it is entirely possible, even likely, that a candidate with only a plurality of votes will win.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.L. 214, \u00a7 4(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The legislative history indicates and all parties agree that the General Assembly's stated purpose for cancelling primaries for all judicial elections in 2018 was so the legislature would have more time to enact legislation redrawing the boundaries of existing judicial Superior and District court districts. Legislation to redistrict these seats had been introduced in the House during the summer of 2017, Doc. 14-4 \u00b6 6, and a committee was appointed to study the matter early in the fall. Doc. 14-4 at \u00b6 9. During floor debate on the bill that became S.L. 214, the representative who moved to pass the bill over the governor's veto stated that the reason judicial primaries were abolished was so the legislature could \"take our time\" in redistricting judicial seats. Doc. 36 at 9 (statement by Representative Lewis);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14-4 at \u00b6 14; Doc. 36 at 11 (statement by Representative Lewis during floor debate that no districting was contemplated for appellate judicial races); Doc. 34 at 19 (defendants' brief stating that \"[n]ew boundaries, if enacted, will not be in place in time for the filing of judicial candidates in February, and it is unlikely that the implementation of any new boundaries will be complete in time for the May primaries\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There will be some 150 judicial races on the ballot in 2018. Doc. 14-7 at \u00b6 19. Although the exact breakdown is not in the record, it appears to include at least one Supreme Court race, three Court of Appeals races, more than 30 superior court races, and more than 115 district court races. Doc. 36 at 12 (statement by Representative John during floor debate). The appellate races will appear on the general election ballot statewide, while the superior and district court races will appear on local ballots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. This Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Some two months after the law was enacted, the plaintiffs-the North Carolina Democratic Party and seven county Democratic party organizations-filed this lawsuit against the State of North Carolina; the North Carolina Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement; Kim Strach, in her official capacity as the Executive Director of the State Board; Phillip E. Berger, in his official capacity as the President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate; and Timothy K. Moore, in his\n   official capacity as the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives. The plaintiffs contend that the abolishment of a primary for partisan judicial elections infringes upon their fundamental rights of association in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Doc. 2 \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the same time, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. Doc. 14. They ask the Court to enjoin enforcement of Section 4(a) of S.L. 214 and seek an order to restore the status quo for judicial elections before enactment of S.L. 214. Doc. 14 at 2-3. The Court ordered expedited briefing, which has been completed; held a hearing on January 25, 2018; and authorized supplemental briefing that also has been completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Preliminary Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendants contend that the Court lacks jurisdiction to decide this matter for several reasons. None of these arguments have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, the defendants contend this case is nonjusticiable. However, it is well established that the federal courts have jurisdiction to hear First Amendment challenges to state election laws.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eu v. San Francisco Cty. Democratic.

A cluttered ballot threatens the freedom of political parties to join together to further common beliefs.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/\">\n    530 U.S. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that representative democracy is \"unimaginable without the ability of citizens to band together in promoting among the electorate candidates who espouse their political views\"). The burden and likelihood of harm is not speculative, as the State Board's own report about the 2014 election makes clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For these reasons, the statutory provision abolishing primaries for appellate judges and justices while requiring such elections to be partisan, providing no other process to winnow down candidates for the general election ballot, and allowing candidates to self-designate their political party affiliation and to change party affiliation as late as the filing date is likely unconstitutional. Given the over-inclusive nature of S.L. 214, \u00a7 4(a) and the General Assembly's lack of any stated interest in cancelling judicial primaries for the appellate courts, the Court concludes that the State's interest is likely not sufficient to justify burdening the plaintiffs' well-established associational rights. As to the appellate court races, the plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   However, as to the district and superior courts, the plaintiffs have not shown a clear likelihood of success on the merits. The burden is lower at the local level and the state has proffered a facially valid legitimate interest in reducing voter confusion in the likely event that the legislature redraws judicial districts for these courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   A party seeking a preliminary injunction must make a \"clear showing of irreparable harm\" that is \"actual and imminent.\"\n   <em>\n    Scotts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9374685\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/264/#p272\">\n    315 F.3d at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court has already summarized many of the burdens imposed by \u00a7 4(a) as to appellate races.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Since \u00a7 4(a) only applies in 2018, it can hardly be disputed that the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed if the statute were followed for the 2018 elections and thereafter found to be unconstitutional. The regularly scheduled filing period is immediately upcoming and the primary is just a few short months away. The State Board's own report confirms problems with voter confusion and delays on election day when there are multiple candidates for appellate judgeships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   At the hearing on the motion, the Legislative Defendants argued that there is no\n   imminent harm, since a judicial primary could easily be held later in the summer, before the General Election, should the plaintiffs ultimately prevail on the merits. The State defendants did not disagree. This is not ideal, since special elections increase costs, as the Legislative Defendants have repeatedly argued in other cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Legislative Defendants' Position Statement, Doc. 161 at 10,\n   <em>\n    Covington v.

Balancing the equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The presumption of constitutionality that attaches to legislative acts \"is not merely a factor to be considered in evaluating success on the merits, but an equity to be considered in favor of applicants in balancing hardships.\"\n   <em>\n    Walters v. Nat'l Ass'n of Radiation Survivors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11359328\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1323/#p1324\">\n    468 U.S. 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1324,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20S.%20Ct.%2011\">\n    105 S.Ct. 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20908\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Nonetheless, as to the appellate judicial races, the Court is satisfied that the balance of the equities tips in favor of the plaintiffs. While the State has a substantial interest in structuring and regulating elections,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/\">\n    530 U.S. at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413964\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/567/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it has offered\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   reason for this particular provision as to appellate judges. In the absence of any stated legitimate interest in abolishing primaries for statewide partisan judicial races in which candidates self-affiliate and can change affiliation immediately before filing, and in view of the harm caused by the absence of such a primary, the balance of the equities tips in favor of the plaintiffs. State law already establishes a filing period and a primary is already scheduled, so there are few additional costs of the state to adding several races to the ballot. The plaintiffs seek a return to historical North Carolina practice and to follow the same process for judicial elections as for other partisan elections, which reduces voter confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The defendants contend that eliminating judicial primaries in 2018 is in the public interest, principally because it is unlikely that judicial redistricting would be complete in time for the May primaries. Doc. 34 at 19. This reason, of course, does not apply to appellate judicial races. The defendants have offered no other public interest in support of the elimination of judicial primaries for appellate judgeships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The plaintiffs have shown that there is a history in North Carolina of multi-candidate judicial contests when there is no primary. Doc. 14-1 at \u00b6 16. They also have shown that in the 2014 general election, 19 candidates ran for a single court of appeals seat, which contributed to longer voter wait times and caused substantial voter confusion. Doc. 14-6 at 7-8. Likewise, they\n   have shown that eliminating primaries for the appellate judicial races would likely lead to no candidate receiving a majority of the vote, Doc. 14-1 at \u00b6 16, 17, and cause voter confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14-6 at 7-8; Doc. 14-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.
