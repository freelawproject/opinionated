In brief: Borda made three FOIA requests in 2013.\n   <em>\n    Borda II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274552\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/52/\">\n    245 F.Supp.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Executive Office for United States Attorneys (\"EOUSA\") did not respond, and Borda filed suit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274552\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/52/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   EOUSA then conducted an initial search, revealing no responsive records, Dkt. 28-3 at 3-4 (Cunningham Decl. \u00b6 8), and moved for summary judgment, Dkt. 10. Borda did not oppose EOUSA's motion, instead moving to amend his complaint. Dkt. 20. The Court denied the motion for summary judgment because no other components of the Department of Justice had conducted searches, and the Court granted Borda's motion for leave to amend his complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Borda I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066032\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/125/196/\">\n    125 F.Supp.3d at 199-200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After Borda filed his amended complaint (adding a challenge to an EOUSA response to a 2015 records request), Dkt. 22, EOUSA forwarded his inquiries to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. The Criminal Division performed a search, released some responsive records to Borda while withholding others, Dkt. 28-3 at 5-7 (Cunningham Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-17), and EOUSA then filed another motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Borda II\n   </em>\n   , the Court substituted the Department of Justice as the proper defendant,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274552\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/52/\">\n    245 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   52 n.1, and granted in part and denied in part the Department's motion for summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274552\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/52/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274552\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/52/\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that summary judgment was inappropriate as to one aspect of the adequacy of the search and as to whether the Department had properly applied Exemption 7(D) to four sealed plea agreements. With respect to the former, \"[t]he Department ha[d] not adequately explained how its decision to consolidate Borda's four FOIA requests into a single 'search request'-to the exclusion of at least some of Borda's specific search terms,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31 at 5-was 'reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.' \"\n   <em>\n    Borda II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274552\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/52/\">\n    245 F.Supp.3d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    DeBrew v.

Cir. 2015) ). The Court noted in particular that \"Borda's request for 'all grand jury records in the public domain' related to his case appears to sweep more broadly than the five fact-specific search terms the Criminal Division included in its synthesized search request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279626,4276180\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/118/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court, accordingly, denied summary judgment on \"this limited issue, and ... permit[ted] the Department to file a renewed motion that either explains how the prior search encompassed all of the relevant search terms or indicates that the Department has engaged in a further search for possibly responsive records.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279626,4276180\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/118/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With respect to the four plea agreements, the Court held that \"the Department ha[d] not explained how Exemption 7(D)-or any other exemption-permits it to withhold the agreements in their entirety.... Nor ha[d] the Department shown that it [was] impractical to segregate the non-exempt material from the material that [was] exempt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62. Although the Department had also argued that the plea agreements were exempt from disclosure because they were sealed, the Court observed that \"sealed documents are not categorically exempted from disclosure under FOIA,\" and thus, \"if the Department intends to rely on the sealed-status of the records in its renewed motion, it will need to demonstrate that the seal was issued 'with the intent to prohibit the [Department] from disclosing the [plea agreements] as long as the seal remains in effect.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63 n.8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

Cir. 1991) ). The Court also ordered the Department to produce the disputed\n   plea agreements for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 9, 2017, the Department moved for summary judgment (the third such motion filed by the government in this case) and produced (1) a supplemental declaration describing the additional search efforts undertaken in response to\n   <em>\n    Borda II\n   </em>\n   and the rationale for withholding in full the eleven responsive documents those efforts produced; (2) correspondence with the district court judges who sealed the plea agreements that previously had been withheld in full; and (3) the plea agreements themselves for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 40. The Court then advised Borda of the consequences of failing to respond to the motion for summary judgment and ordered him to file a response on or before July 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41. Borda moved for an extension of time to respond on July 28, 2017, Dkt. 43, which the Court granted, Minute Order (Aug. 3, 2017). On August 17, 2017, Borda filed a second motion for leave to amend his complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44. The Court again instructed Borda of the consequences of not responding to Defendant's motion for summary judgment and specifically \"cautioned\" him \"that he should not assume that his [motion to amend] will be granted.\" Minute Order (Sept. 5, 2017). Borda still has not filed a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

It then considers the adequacy of Defendant's supplemental search, before turning to the decision to withhold in full both the four plea agreements previously at issue and the eleven responsive documents located in the course of the Department's supplemental search. Although Borda has failed to respond to Defendant's motion for summary judgment, the Court \"must always engage in the analysis required by Rule 56 before acting on a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Winston &amp; Strawn, LLP v.

On August 17, 2017, Borda filed the motion to amend currently pending before the Court. Dkt. 44 at 1. That motion seeks leave to amend Borda's complaint a second time to add challenges to EOUSA's response to two additional records requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. These requests were submitted on September 27, 2014, and October 3, 2014.

First, it argues that he \"has unduly delayed seeking to add his claims concerning the [a]dditional FOIA [r]equests,\" because the requests were sent in late 2014-that is, more than six months before Borda successfully sought leave to amend his complaint in June 2015 to add a request filed\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the two requests he now seeks to incorporate. Dkt. 46 at 4. Second, the Department argues that it would be substantially prejudiced by the proposed amendment because of the considerable work involved in preparing a summary judgment motion in a FOIA case, an effort that would then need to be undertaken a fourth time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. Finally, the Department asserts that further amendment of the complaint would significantly delay the resolution of this matter by necessitating a renewed round of briefing despite the limited scope of the issues currently before the Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Borda has not filed a reply brief, but his motion for leave to amend arguably anticipated at least portions of the Department's opposition by noting that he had referred to the September and October 2014 FOIA requests in an earlier pleading in this litigation. Dkt. 44 at 2 (noting references to the September and October 2014 requests at Dkt. 31 at 21-22, 24). That earlier pleading-Borda's opposition to the Department's second motion for summary judgment-argued that the Department was not entitled to summary judgment because the Department had not shown that it had \"searched for and reviewed any of the documents/information described in\" Borda's September and October 2014 FOIA requests.

Borda fails to offer any explanation for why the September and October 2014 FOIA requests were not included in his first amended complaint, which was filed many months later in June 2015. Dkt. 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31 at 13 n.2 (noting that the requests were omitted for \"unknown\" reasons). Borda also does not dispute that he then possessed the records he now submits as evidence of having submitted the September and October 2014 requests. The delay here, moreover, is substantial. Forty-two months elapsed from when Borda filed this suit to when he sought leave to amend the complaint for a second time to add substantial, new allegations, and he could easily have sought leave to amend long before he did so. Indeed, even giving him the benefit of the doubt and assuming that he was unaware that the September and October 2014 FOIA requests were not included in his first amended complaint at the time it was filed, he recognized that omission in his opposition to the Department's second motion for summary judgment, which was filed in early April 2016, and he indicated at that time that he would seek leave to file a second amended complaint. Dkt. 31 at 13 n.2. He did not do so, however, until August 2017-over sixteen months later.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31 at 1,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In short, there is no reason why Borda could not have included his allegations regarding the September and October 2014 FOIA requests in his first amended complaint; he failed to demonstrate due diligence in seeking to correct this omission when it came to his attention; and adding these additional allegations now would delay the resolution of this case, which has been pending for over four years and which has already generated three rounds of briefing on summary judgment. Although leave to amend must be freely granted, there are limits to that principle. Borda's motion for leave to amend not only tests those limits, but exceeds them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.
