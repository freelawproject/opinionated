Montana, Missoula Division.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Signed January 31, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <attorneys id=\"p-5\">\n  Caitlin Boland Aarab, Samir Faerevik Aarab, Boland Aarab PLLP, Michael J.

Molloy, District Judge\n   The question in this case boils down to a simple issue: Who is the beneficiary of a lawsuit stemming from an ERISA employee's misfortune? Is it the ERISA plan or is it the unfortunate employee? While the all or nothing propositions asserted by both parties here are not reasonable interpretations of the ERISA plan in question, the facts of this case favor the plaintiff. The defendant's shortcoming, among other mistakes, was to prioritize its plan interpretation to its financial interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Unum Group Corporation (\"Unum\"), the defendant here, argues that it is entitled to offset its disability payments for lost income against every penny recovered because of the employee's misfortune. The unfortunate victim of medical malpractice in this case, the plaintiff Dawn Rustad-Link (\"Rustad-Link\"), argues there should be no offset because her below-the-knee amputation settlement was not for lost income, but encompassed a multiplicity of other damages that are not subject to the ERISA plan's offset provisions. Unum insists that it payed disability benefits regardless of the basis of the claim, whether in this case multiple sclerosis, below-the-knee amputation, or a variety of other medical problems that impact Rustad-Link's entitlement to disability benefits. This being the case, so goes the reasoning, it is entitled to an offset against the entirety of the proceeds of Rustad-Link's medical malpractice settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rustad-Link's motion for summary judgment is granted as the reasoning supporting it is more persuasive. First, Washington law mandates a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review. Second, Unum cannot assert the attorney-client privilege against Rustad-Link, its fiduciary, as to communications with counsel that occurred before the parties became adverse. Finally, Unum breached its fiduciary duty to Rustad-Link when it changed her disabling diagnosis following notice of her third-party settlement and deducted against her disability payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rustad-Link is a resident and citizen of Roseglen, Mclean County, North Dakota. (Doc. 11 at 2.) At all times relevant to this action, she was an employee, or disabled former employee, of Defendant Providence Health and Services at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Polson, Montana (\"Providence\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Providence is the policyholder of a long term disability insurance plan, Policy Number 138177002 (the \"Plan\"). (Doc. 16-3 at 43; AR 000043.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unum is the disability insurance underwriter for the Plan, (Doc. 16-3 at 000003), and is the claims fiduciary for the Plan, (Doc. 16-3 at 56; AR 000056). As a private, employer-provided plan, the Plan is governed by the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (\"ERISA\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Coverage History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rustad-Link was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (\"MS\") in 1996. (Doc. 16-8 at 98; AR 000714.) In 2010, she suffered a below-the-knee amputation resulting from negligent medical care. (Doc. 16-5 at 2-4;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   AR 000152-54.) The amputation occurred after an occlusion in her iliac artery blocked blood flow to her foot. She applied for disability benefits under the Plan, and Unum informed her on June 16, 2010, that her MS was a pre-existing condition that would not be covered for a period of 12 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 26 at \u00b6 3; AR 000156-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 21, 2010, Rustad-Link responded that the amputation, not the MS, had disabled her. (Doc. 16-5 at 8-9; AR 000158-59.) She stated in part that \"multiple sclerosis is not the reason for filing this claim .... This amputation is the reason for the disability claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 11, 2010, Judith L. Gustafson, a certified nurse practitioner, identified MS as Rustad-Link's primary disability, her amputation as her secondary disability, and recorded her assessment in an Unum disability claim form. (Doc. 16-4 at 113-15; AR 000113-15.) She noted Rustad-Link had severe weakness and tremors, and that her disability was likely permanent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 14, 2010, in a separate evaluation, Daniel Ramsch, M.D., identified the amputation as the primary disability, the MS as secondary, and also indicated Rustad-Link's disability was likely permanent. (Doc. 16-5 at 2-5; AR 00152-54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 23, 2010, Unum granted Rustad-Link six month short-term disability under the Plan. (Doc. 16-4 at 146-47; AR 000146-47.) Unum did not communicate the specific condition or conditions that supported its disability determination to Rustad-Link. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rustad-Link's attending physician, Mark Weber, informed Social Security Disability, noting that Rustad-Link's \"[MS] ... along with her new amputation has resulted in profound impariment of her functional mobility.\" (Doc. 16-8 at 132; AR 000748.) On July 23, 2010, Rustad-Link submitted a disability report to Social Security Disability listing the following physical and mental conditions that limited her ability to work: \"(1) multiple sclerosis ; (2) right transtibial amputation; (3) right iliac artery occlusion ; (4) chronic gastritis ; (5) hypokalemia; (6) chronic pain; (7) phantom limb pain ; (8) anemia.\" (Doc. 16-8 at 91; AR 000707.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 7, 2010, an Unum claim director, Tom Salce, held a round-table review of Rustad-Link's file to determine approval of her long-term disability. (Doc. 16-8 at 22; AR 000637.) The review confirmed disability due to the amputation, and indicated recovery \"would be 4-6 months from present as [claimant] indicated she is still cleaning wound.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also noted it was \"[u]nclear what [Rustad-Link's] work capacity will be as she also has MS,\" and that it was \"[n]ot clear why [restrictions and limitations] for [Rustad-Link's] [right upper extremity]\" existed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Also on September 7, 2010, Unum granted Rustad-Link's request for Long Term Disability benefits. (Doc. 16-8 at 30; AR 000646.) The letter notifying Rustad-Link did not explain what condition or conditions supported its disability determination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 28, 2011, Unum received an updated physician's statement from Rustad-Link's primary care provider, certified nurse practitioner Michelle Hellwig, which once again identified her amputation as the primary disability and MS as the secondary disability. (Doc. 16-12 at 134-36; AR 001350-52.) On March 3, 2011, Unum had another round-table review and\n   noted that Rustad-Link's restrictions and limitations were medically supported but that \"fine motor skills [were] not supported since [Rustad-Link] had mild tremors prior to [the amputation].\" (Doc. 16-12 at 146; AR 001362.) Hellwig provided Unum another attending physician's statement on September 14, 2011, which also indicated the amputation was the primary cause of disability, with MS and chronic pain as secondary diagnoses. (Doc. 16-13 at 53-55; AR 001419-22.) The assessment noted \"pain, limp, [and] tremors\" as clinical findings supporting the diagnosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 18, 2011, Unum held another round-table review, concluding that Rustad-Link's \"[injury causing disability] should be updated to reflect [below knee amputation] and MS as secondary.\" (Doc. 16-13 at 119; AR 001485.) Rustad-Link was not notified of the change. (Doc. 26 at \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Unum wrote Rustad-Link on November 21, 2011, to inform her that, beginning in August 2012, her coverage would be subject to a stricter definition of disability as she reached 24 months of payments. (Doc. 16-14 at 36-38; AR 001554-56.) Unum received an Attending Physician's Statement from neurologist Stephen Johnson\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on August 21, 2012, which identified MS as the primary disability diagnosis, and did not identify any other causes of disability. (Doc. 16-14 at 147-49; AR 001665-67.) Unum prepared a summary of Rustad-Link's condition on September 14, 2012, noting she had been awarded Social Security disability for her amputation and her MS, and that a vocational rehabilitation consultant noted it might be possible to identify light or sedentary employment. (Doc. 16-15 at 37; AR 001705.) Unum determined Rustad-Link's \"Injury Causing Disability\" should be updated to MS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 7, 2012, Helwig provided another attending physician's statement, which again stated Rustad-Link's primary disability diagnosis impacting functional capacity was her amputation, and that secondary diagnoses were MS and chronic pain. (Doc. 16-15 at 71-74; AR 001739-42.) Unum held another round-table review on October 22, 2012, in which Rustad-Link's medical history was reviewed, and concluding that Rustad-Link's restrictions and limitations regarding her upper extremities due to MS, the poor labor market in North Dakota (where she had moved), and the likelihood that her conditions would deteriorate qualified her for continued long-term disability. (Doc. 16-15 at 101-02; AR 001769-70.) The review also concluded Rustad-Link's injury causing disability should be updated to MS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unum informed Rustad-Link that continuation of her disability payments under the stricter definition of disability had been approved that same day. (Doc. 16-15 at 116-18; AR 001784-86.) Unum did not advise Rustad-Link that her injury causing disability had been updated to MS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Settlement Deduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 14, 2014, Rustad-Link's attorney informed Unum of a pending third-party settlement regarding her amputation. (Doc. 16-17 at 110-11; AR 000283-84.) Unum responded with a letter asserting a right to recover benefits as deductible sources of income under the Plan. (Doc. 16-17 at 137; AR 002118.) Unum then began the process of assessing whether Rustad-Link's settlement would qualify as a deductible source of income. (Doc. 16-17 at 135; AR 002116.) On August\n   19, 2014, Unum sent another letter, requesting information regarding Rustad-Link's settlement. (Doc. 16-17 at 141-42; AR 002122-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rustad-Link's attorney wrote back on September 15, 2014. (Doc. 16-17 at 145-46; AR 002126-27.) The letter informed Unum that Rustad-Link's settlement was solely on the basis of her amputation, and did not involve any recovery for her MS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following receipt of that letter, Unum consulted in-house counsel and initially concluded that the settlement would not qualify for application of the third party settlement offset because it would represent attorney fees and past and future medical expenses. (Doc. 11 at \u00b6 29; Doc. 3-28.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unum also concluded that a medical review was not necessary. (Doc. 3-29.) Despite these conclusions, Unum's Financial Recovery Unit then initiated an evaluation of Rustad-Link's injury causing disability to resolve whether Unum would \"be supporting the claim for MS despite the amputation.\" (Doc. 16-18 at 12; AR 002146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 5, 2014, Unum concluded that \"[t]here is no indication at this time that [Rustad-Link's] MS [symptoms] have worsened to suggest that they rise to the level that would impact [her] functional capacity. Any support for decrease in function appears to be related to her [amputation]. It does not appear that [she] had an MS exacerbation sepsis and [amputation], and her [symptoms] increase was more likely to her noncompliance with medication. [Injury Causing Disability]: Need to switch [Injury Causing Disability].\" (Doc. 16-18 at 27; AR 002167.) Unum subsequently informed Rustad-Link that \"MS is not a basis for [Rustad-Link's] disability and that she is impaired only as a result of her below-the-knee amputation. This condition alone causes her current inability to work in any gainful occupation.\" (Doc. 16-18 at 30-31; AR 002171-72.) Unum informed Rustad-Link that as a result of her third-party settlement, Unum had overpaid benefits in the amount of $46,856.28, and that it would begin reducing her payments by the monthly amount of $1,924.60, resulting in a monthly payment of $115.71. (Doc. 16-18 at 35-36; AR 002176-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Rustad-Link's attorney responded December 2, 2014, noting that Unum's position \"ignore[d] the unambiguous medical opinions of all providers that the MS and the amputation combine to render her disabled.\" (Doc. 16-18 at 43; AR 002184.) The letter also disputed the pro-ration of the lump sum settlement for life long losses, which it asserted should have been calculated over Rustad-Link's life expectancy instead of her work-life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a December 10, 2014 letter, Unum responded that it was \"not required under the policy to apportion a deductible source of income with respect to the disabling diagnostic condition associated with that source of income,\" and that \"the third party settlement ... [would] be considered a deductible source of income for the duration of [Rustad-Link's] claim.\" (Doc. 16-18 at 55; AR 002199.) On January 7, 2015, Unum sent a follow-up letter notifying counsel that it had begun to reimburse itself for the \"overpayments\" by deducting from Rustad-Links' monthly disability payments, and that Rustad-Link \"w[ould] not receive a benefit payment until the overpayment [was] paid in full.\" (Doc. 16-18 at 70-72; AR 002215-17.) Rustad-Link timely appealed the decision with Unum on June 30, 2015. (Doc. 16-18 at 119; AR 002267.) Unum denied the appeal on July 14, 2015. (Doc. 16-18 at 130-33; AR 002281-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Unum again asserted the Plan did not require it \"to consider an apportionment of the settlement with respect to the disabling condition(s) associated with th[e] deductible source of income.\" (Doc. 16-18 at 131; AR 002282.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Present Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rustad-Link filed suit on October 20, 2016. (Doc. 1.) She claims Unum's assertion of the offset and repayment provisions constitute a breach of the terms of the Plan and a wrongful refusal to pay the benefits due, in violation of ERISA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) and (a)(3). (Doc. 3 at 15.) She seeks an award of all disability benefits available under the Plan, including reimbursement for past benefits wrongly withheld, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney's fees. (Doc. 3 at 16.) Both parties have moved for summary judgment, and agree that resolution of this matter is appropriate on the administrative record. (Docs. 17, 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A party is entitled to summary judgment if it can demonstrate that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A threshold question here involves the standard of review regarding Unum's decision to offset against Rustad-Link's personal injury settlement. Rustad-Link insists\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review should be applied, (Doc. 19 at 18), while Unum argues abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard of review, (Doc. 25 at 5). Rustad-Link has the better argument, although, as discussed below, the outcome is the same under either standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Supreme Court has held that \"a denial of benefits challenged under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

The Unum Plan contains a \"discretionary clause,\" which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-37\">\n   The Plan, acting through the Plan Administrator, delegates to Unum and its affiliate Unum Group discretionary authority to make benefit determinations under the Plan.

Benefit determinations include determining eligibility for benefits and the amount of any benefits, resolving factual disputes, and interpreting and enforcing the provisions of the Plan.

She insists that, in any event, to enforce the discretionary clause would violate the \"strong public policy\" in Washington. (Doc. 19 at 20.) Unum responds that, because the Regulation became effective after the Plan, it does not void the discretionary clause, (Doc. 25 at 10), and insists that to apply the Regulation retroactively would interfere with its vested contract rights, (Doc. 28 at 6).

Critically, the district court specified that it \"expresse[d] no opinion on whether the Regulation would apply retroactively to an administrator's decision made\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    the Regulation was issued.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *7 (emphasis in original).\n    <em>\n     Landree\n    </em>\n    is therefore not at odds with\n    <em>\n     Murray\n    </em>\n    , but simply reflects\n    <em>\n     Landree\n    </em>\n    's rule that the Regulation applies if it was in effect at the time a plaintiff's cause of action accrued-in this case, at the time Unum decided to offset Rustad-Link's settlement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Finally, Unum looks to several district court decisions from other circuits to support its argument that a plan's \"Anniversary Date\" does not make it subject to \"subsequently-effective, prospective-only prohibition on discretionary clauses.\" (Doc. 25 at 13.)

As outlined above, that conflict is apparent in the record, where Unum's determination of Rustad-Link's disabling condition changed from amputation to MS over time, but reverted to MS when it became apparent settlement money might be available for an offset.

However, neither they nor the definition of \"disability\" include language stating or implying that disability constitutes a time period.

(Doc. 27 at 14.) Rustad-Link also accurately notes that Unum's assertion that \"same disability\" does not mean same medical condition is undercut by its decision to switch Rustad-Link's injury causing disability from MS back to amputation after it learned of her settlement, due to her amputation and a settlement agreement that excludes \"income\".

Reinstatement of benefits\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Rustad-Link seeks all disability benefits available under the Plan, including reimbursement for past benefits wrongfully withheld. (Doc. 3 at 16.) ERISA provides for the \"recover[y] of benefits due to h[er] under the terms of h[er] plan, to enforce h[er] rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify h[er] rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\" 29 US.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). It is thus necessary\n    to decide what benefits Rustad-Link is entitled to under the Plan, given that the record shows her disability involves both MS and amputation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    She argues Unum changed her injury causing disability designation from MS to amputation to take advantage of her third-party settlement. (Doc. 27 at 7.) The record supports her argument. Unum determined Rustad-Link's disabling injury was MS in 2012. (Doc. 16-15 at 37.) In 2014, after Rustad-Link informed Unum of her settlement, Unum changed its assessment. (Doc. 16-18 at 26-27, 30.) It did so apparently not as a result of any new medical information-as none is reflected in the record-but to take advantage of the settlement by treating the entirety of her misfortune as income.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The Plan does not provide for apportionment based on different medical conditions, as Unum's correspondence with Rustad-Link emphasize. On November 6, 2014, after deciding to deduct against Rustad-Link's benefit payments, Unum informed her that \"[u]pon review of Ms. Rustad-Link's medical records, it is apparent that her condition of MS is not a basis for her disability and that she is impaired only as a result of her below-the-knee amputation. This condition alone causes her current inability to work in any gainful occupation.\" (Doc. 16-18 at 30-31; AR 0002170-71.) In its correspondence with Rustad-Link following its decision to deduct from her benefit payments, Unum also stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    [w]e are not required under the policy to apportion a deductible source of income with respect to the disabling diagnostic condition associated with that source of income. In this case, the third party settlement received by Ms. Rustad-Link will be considered a deductible source of income for the duration of her claim.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    (Doc. 16-18 at 55; AR 002199.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Where the Plan does not require Unum to apportion a deductible source of income with respect to the disabling condition, allowing it to apportion to Rustad-Link's detriment would not be a reasonable benefit determination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Examination of the Plan language also shows Unum's assertion that the entirety of Rustad-Link's settlement constitutes a deductible source of income casts too wide a net. The Plan lists seven deductible sources of income. (Doc. 16-3 at 32-33; AR 000032-33.) The first six deductible sources are amounts received (1) under worker's compensation or similar laws; (2) as disability income payments under state law, automobile liability insurance policy, group insurance, or government retirement system; (3) as disability payments under Social Security; (4) as retirement payments under Social Security; (5) as disability payments under an employer's retirement plan; and (6) under the Jones Act.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In contrast, the seventh deductible source-the one at issue here-provides that Unum may offset against amounts received as third party \"judgment[s], settlement[s] or otherwise.\" This list can be read one of two ways: either the seventh deductible source carves out a much wider range of deductible sources of income, sources potentially unrelated to any disability, or it is bounded by the preceding six, and pertains only to disability-related payments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Because it is susceptible to two different readings, the deductible income clause is ambiguous. That ambiguity must be resolved in Rustad-Link's favor, meaning\n    that the offset for income described at paragraph seven must be narrowly construed. Such a reading is supported by the manner in which the Plan calculates disability benefits-as a percentage of \"monthly earnings,\" at her workplace (and not as a percentage of any income she might receive). (Doc. 16-3 at 28; AR 000028.) Rustad-Link's settlement states that \"Releasor [Rustad-Link] represents that no amount of the Settlement payment is allocated to lost wages.\" (Doc. 16-17 at 148; AR 002129.) While that self-serving characterization does not bind the Plan, Unum nonetheless bore the burden of disputing that contention by showing it was reasonably entitled to offset under the Plan. But Unum failed to take the reasonable course.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Rustad-Link is entitled to reinstatement of the full amount of the amputation settlement offset Unum has taken against her disability payments. First, Unum's definition of \"same disability\" is unreasonably self-serving. Second, Unum's assertion of the deductible source of income offset rests on an ambiguous policy provision that must be read in Rustad-Link's favor. This conclusion does not mean that all third-party settlements would be beyond the reach of the Plan's deductible sources of income, nor that simply allocating settlement proceeds away from wages would prevent a reasonable offset. Instead, it reflects that Unum has attempted to benefit from Rustad-Link's misfortune by unreasonably asserting an offset against a settlement for a different disabling condition. Thus while neither party's absolutist argument is compelling, applying \"a fair, reasonable, and sensible construction as would be given to the [Plan] by the average person purchasing insurance,\"\n    <em>\n     Quadrant\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%20733\">\n     110 P.3d at 737\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , means Rustad-Link prevails here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <strong>\n     C.
