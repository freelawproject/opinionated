Lesniak, et al.,\n   </em>\n   8-cr-506 (N.D. Ohio), ECF Nos. 54, 245. Although he continues to assert his innocence and apparently was acquitted of what he describes as \"identical charges\" in state court, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, Plaintiff remains incarcerated despite numerous unsuccessful challenges to his conviction.\n   <em>\n    See e.g., Lesniak\n   </em>\n   , 8-cr-506 (N.D. Ohio), ECF No. 541. Several of those challenges involved claims that his criminal proceedings were tainted by prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. After sentencing, Plaintiff filed numerous motions and appeals (including voluminous exhibits) raising these claims. United States District Court Judge Donald Nugent-who presided over Plaintiff's federal criminal trial and sentenced him-held at least two day-long evidentiary\n   hearings on the motions and issued numerous decisions denying post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff now theorizes that Judge Nugent turned a blind eye to the alleged misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel in Plaintiff's case in order to protect himself from potential embarrassment and/or prosecution. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Viola supports this theory by pointing to proceedings in another Ohio federal criminal matter:\n   <em>\n    United States v. Calabrese\n   </em>\n   , in which the defendant was charged and convicted of conspiracy, bribery, extortion, and mail fraud after a three-year investigation into public corruption in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. 11-cr-437 (N.D. Ohio), ECF No. 104 pp. 1-2; ECF No. 119. Calabrese's case was randomly assigned to Judge Nugent, but the government successfully sought reassignment to Judge Sarah Lioi, who was handling other cases arising out of the same investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 104. Calabrese twice sought to have the case reassigned, but argued that reassignment back to Judge Nugent was inappropriate because of his alleged connection to some of the individuals targeted during the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although she denied the motion to reassign, Judge Lioi found that there was no basis to disqualify Judge Nugent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The predicate for defendant Calabrese's motion is the apparent fact that brief telephone calls involving Judge Nugent [and some of the individuals targeted and/or charged in the Cuyahoga County investigation] were a part of the materials turned over by the government in discovery. The calls do not reveal any wrong doing or criminal activity on the part of Judge Nugent, and there is an absence of any indication that Judge Nugent knew of or was a part of the charged conspiracy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 58 p. 3. Subsequently, Calabrese's attorney received, from an \"unknown source ... a portion of an FBI Form 302\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   summarizing a[n]...interview between Judge Nugent and FBI agents\" during which the \"agents advised Nugent of the existence of the public corruption investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 104 pp. 4-5. Calabrese argued that Judge Nugent was disqualified because of the telephone calls and because the interview took place before his case was originally assigned to Nugent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After reviewing Calebrese's supporting documents-many of which are sealed-Judge Lioi noted that \"[t]he production of the FBI interview summary demonstrates that Judge Nugent was aware at the time of the [case] transfer of both the interception of the calls, and of the fact that he had been interviewed in connection with the FBI's investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 55, 58, 102 at p. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff theorizes that the records and evidence from Calabrese's case could show that Judge Nugent had ulterior reasons for denying Plaintiff's post-trial motions.

This theory does not explain why the Sixth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court also denied Plaintiff's appeals, but Plaintiff nonetheless seeks, through FOIA, recordings and documents relating to Judge Nugent and the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff also seeks records regarding Paul Tomko, an FBI \"expert\" and \"informant,\" whom Plaintiff alleges reviewed key documents in Plaintiff's criminal case, Compl. \u00b6 42, and who was later imprisoned for mortgage fraud.

Records were additionally withheld pursuant to Exemption 7(E), which applies to records that \"would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions,\n   or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\" Second Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 57-61 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(E) ). Hardy declared that Exemption 7(E) applied because the records contained information concerning installation and location of monitoring devices, as well as the types of devices the FBI uses; targets of pen registers/trap and trace devices; undercover operations; and internal FBI email and IP addresses. Second Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 55-61. Hardy also stated that the \"FBI conducted a line by line review of the responsive records ... and failed to identify any information that could reasonably be segregated for release without posing any harm to the asserted FOIA\" exemptions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, the FBI withheld the recordings and transcripts of Judge Nugent for two reasons: First, under Exemption 3, which allows agencies to withhold records \"specifically exempted from disclosure by statute ....,\" because the tape recordings and transcripts are protected pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 2510 - 2520, concerning lawful interception and recording of electronic communications. Second Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-41. Second, because the recordings and transcripts were sealed pursuant to a court order, which was itself sealed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 38-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiff did not respond to the FBI's exemption arguments, nor did he respond to its Statement of Facts. However, he asserts that the tapes were \"widely\" disseminated during discovery in the Cuyahoga County proceedings, were played in open court, and the government did not seek a protective order. Pls. Resp. pp. 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Construing Plaintiff's assertions as a challenge to the exemptions, the court finds his argument unavailing. Plaintiff has proffered no evidence that the recordings were played in court or were disclosed without a protective order. Indeed, the court takes judicial notice of the docket in the Calabrese case, which contains several motions and orders-some of which are sealed-involving protective orders.\n   <em>\n    See United States v. Calabrese\n   </em>\n   , 11-cr-437 (N.D. Ohio), ECF Nos. 31, 38, 46. Plaintiff's unsupported allegations are therefore insufficient to overcome Hardy's declaration that the tape recordings and transcripts are sealed pursuant to a court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff has offered no arguments or evidence that the FBI violated FOIA in withholding the responsive records and the court will therefore grant Defendant's motion for summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Appointment of Counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In his reply to Defendant's second motion to for summary judgment, Viola asks this court to appoint him counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Resp. p. 5. A plaintiff in a civil case does not have an absolute constitutional or statutory right to court-appointed counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ray v. Robinson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1369919\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/640/474/#p477\">\n    640 F.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477 (3d Cir.1981). In this district, appointment of counsel from the Civil Pro Bono Panel is available to\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs who are proceeding\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis. See\n   </em>\n   LCvR 83.11(b)(3). Viola is not proceeding\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and has not demonstrated that he qualifies for this status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Moreover, even if he did quality for\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status, a decision on whether to appoint counsel \"must take into account, among other things, the nature and complexity of the action, the potential merit of the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   party's claims, the demonstrated inability of the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   party to retain counsel by other means, and the\n   degree to which the interests of justice will be served by appointment of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Plummer v. D.C.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A.07-1161 RMU,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203972183\">\n    2008 WL 3972183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.D.C. Aug. 27, 2008) ; LCvR 83.11(b)(3). Plaintiff has not established that there is any potential merit to his claims. Instead, he has barely survived summary judgment on a single issue, which the Defendant failed to address in its reply brief, and which, even if resolved in his favor, may not lead to disclosure of the records he seeks. Plaintiff also has failed to demonstrate that he is unable to retain counsel by other means. Accordingly, the interests of justice would not be served by appointing counsel in this action, and his request will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the court will GRANT Defendant's motion for summary judgment except with respect to the Tomko exhaustion issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The EOUSA and the FBI are components of the United States Justice Department (\"DOJ\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    FBI representative David M. Hardy submitted two declarations in support of the Defendants' summary judgment motion. The first declaration is located at ECF No. 23-2 pp. 62-72. The second is located at ECF No. 23-2 pp. 20-55. The court will refer to the Declarations as the Hardy Decl. and the Second Hardy Decl. respectively.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    As a result of Plaintiff's numerous post-trial motions and appeals, the District Court declared him a \"vexatious litigator\" and enjoined him from further filings associated with his sentence, unless he obtained permission from the Sixth Circuit.\n    <em>\n     Lesniak\n    </em>\n    , 8-cr-506, ECF No. 541.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    According to Hardy, a Form 302 (or FD-302) \"Form for Reporting Information That May Become the Subject of Testimony\" is \"used to record the results of FBI interviews.\" Second Hardy Decl. \u00b6 31.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    James Dimora and Frank Russo are referenced in one of Viola's exhibits, a television station website article reporting on recorded conversations between the two men and Judge Nugent during the Cuyahoga County investigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Hardy Decl. \u00b6 6, Ex. A.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    There is no evidence in the record that Plaintiff objected to, or administratively appealed, the EOUSA's lack of response to his request for records regarding Nugent and Tomko. Moreover, the parties have not addressed the issue of administrative exhaustion as it relates to the EOUSA records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Plaintiff did not separately address each agency's search, but the court interprets his arguments as relating to the EOUSA search because he challenges the EOUSA's assertion that all responsive records were located in the Northern District of Ohio office.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls. Resp. p 1. Out of an abundance of caution, however, the court will also address Plaintiff's arguments as they relate to the FBI search.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Although Viola does not indicate the source of this document, the government did not dispute its authenticity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    As discussed above, Plaintiff did not specifically challenge the sufficiency of the FBI's search, but instead challenged Luczynski's statement that all EOUSA responsive records were located in its Ohio office.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls. Resp. p. 1. Even if Plaintiff had challenged the FBI search, none of his arguments regarding the \"missing\" MFTF evidence would have been relevant to the FBI search for records on Judge Nugent because the FBI interviewed Judge Nugent during a separate investigation of Cuyahoga County corruption; there is no allegation that Nugent is tied to the MFTF investigation. However, the MFTF records would have been relevant to a search for records on Tomko.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
