(\"Amway\") pursuant to a contract that, among other things, compensated her through commissions and bonuses; the contract was renewed in 2015. In 2017, Plaintiff brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that an arbitration agreement (the \"Arbitration Agreement\") embedded in her contract with Amway was unconscionable and thus unenforceable. Assuming the Court agreed with this position, Plaintiff then advanced claims for damages, alleging that Amway had wrongfully deprived her (and other distributors) of an annual sales bonus for performance in 2016. Perhaps more significantly, Plaintiff alleged that Amway had deprived her of this bonus on account of her race, and that Amway had similarly withheld sales bonuses from 75 to 100 other distributors of Chinese extraction of whom she was aware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Relying on the Arbitration Agreement, Amway moved to dismiss the Complaint or to stay the case and compel arbitration. For the reasons outlined below, the Court holds that the Arbitration Agreement is valid and thus grants the motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Amway's Registration Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Amway is a Michigan corporation, which touts itself as \"a leader in the direct selling\n   industry, offering entrepreneurs an exceptional business opportunity.\" (VanderVen Decl. \u00b6 3). That \"exceptional business opportunity\" consists of registering distributors, to which Amway refers as \"Independent Business Owners\" (or \"IBOs\"), to sell Amway's \"nutrition, wellness, beauty, and home products\" and \"sponsor others to do the same.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Amway's sales platform compensates IBOs through \"various commissions and bonuses ... under the IBO Compensation Plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2011, shortly after arriving from China, Plaintiff registered as an IBO at the behest of a Chinese couple who had previously worked for Amway. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8). She renewed her registration with Amway in 2015, and it is that renewal agreement that is relevant to Plaintiff's current claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VanderVen Decl. \u00b6 8 n.1). To register, Plaintiff was required by Amway to sign a Registration Agreement that incorporated a separate document containing the Rules of Conduct and Compensation Plan that were applicable to all IBOs. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The face of the Registration Agreement contains a section reading, \"AGREEMENT TO MEDIATE AND ARBITRATE DISPUTES.\" (Reg. Agmt.). That provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Amway ... and its IBOs mutually agree to resolve all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to an Independent Business, the Amway Independent Business Owner Compensation Plan (\"IBO Compensation Plan\"), or the Rules of Conduct ... under the Dispute Resolution Procedures described in the Rules of Conduct, specifically Rule 11. The Rules of Conduct shall be part of this IBO Registration Agreement and are incorporated by reference. A copy of the Rules of Conduct is available to review at www.amway.com.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In turn, Rule 11 of the Rules of Conduct (the \"ADR Provision\") subjects disputes between Amway and its IBOs to a three-tiered dispute-resolution process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VanderVen Decl. \u00b6 9-13). These procedures, explained more fully below, are also outlined in the Registration Agreement itself, which further contains a clause delegating issues of arbitrability to an arbitrator: \"The Arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the enforceability of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.\" (Reg. Agmt.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Registration Agreement speaks in relevant part to the first step in the dispute-resolution process, requiring an IBO to \"agree to submit any dispute [the IBO] may have with ... Amway ... that is not resolved informally ... to conciliation[.] The conciliation requirement is reciprocal and binds Amway, IBOs[,] and Approved Providers.\" (Reg. Agmt.). The Rules of Conduct describe \"conciliation\" as a non-binding process \"designed to resolve disputes efficiently in a non-confrontational setting.\" (Rules \u00a7 11.4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   VanderVen Decl. \u00b6 10). Conciliation initiates upon the complaining party's \"providing a Request for Conciliation form to the other affected Parties\" as well as \"the Amway Business Conduct and Rules Department.\" (Rules \u00a7 11.4). A mediator oversees the process; he or she is selected by the Board of the Independent Business Owner Association International (\"IBOAI\"), \"an independent trade association comprised of Amway distributors that represents the interests of all Amway IBOs.\" (VanderVen Decl.\u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An IBO may object to the IBOAI mediator, however, in which case Conciliation proceeds before a neutral mediator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Rules of Conduct provide further that \"[i]f any part of [a] dispute is not resolved by mediation ..., any IBO who is a Party to the remaining dispute may request a Hearing Panel[.]\" (Rules \u00a7 11.4.2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Hearing Panel consists of \"a disinterested three-person ... panel selected by the IBOAI Board Executive Committee.' \" (VanderVen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). At this stage, the complainant presents evidence, and at the conclusion of the proceeding, the Hearing Panel issues a written, non-binding recommended resolution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After proceeding before a Hearing Panel, either party may disregard the proposed resolution and proceed to the final dispute resolution mechanism-binding arbitration. (VanderVen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13). Arbitration is thus the third and final step to dispute resolution under the Registration Agreement and Rules of Conduct. The Registration Agreement requires an IBO to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   agree that if any dispute cannot be resolved by good faith efforts in Conciliation ..., [the IBO] will submit any remaining claim or dispute arising out of or relating to [the IBO], the IBO Compensation Plan, or the IBO Rules of Conduct (including any claim against ... Amway Corp. ...) ... to binding arbitration[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Reg. Agmt.). Rule 11.5 of the Rules of Conduct, in turn, requires \"[t]he Parties [to] submit any Disputes that were not resolved through the process described in Rule 11.4, through binding arbitration[.]\" (Rules \u00a7 11.5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Registration History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties agree that Plaintiff first registered as an IBO in 2011 and registered again in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. 5-6; VanderVen Decl. \u00b6 8 n.1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But they vehemently dispute the specifics of the process by which Plaintiff re-registered as an IBO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Amway contends that Plaintiff's 2015 Registration Agreement-including the provision requiring IBOs to resolve any disputes pursuant to Rule 11's ADR Provision-was presented to her in Mandarin Chinese. (VanderVen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). Indeed, Amway attached as an exhibit to its motion a Registration Agreement in Chinese bearing Plaintiff's name, signature, and other identifying information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chinese Reg. Agmt.). Amway has also provided the Declaration of a Chinese translator, which confirms that the Chinese version of the Registration Agreement includes the exact arbitration provision as the English version. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Huijie Decl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In contrast, Plaintiff contends that when she re-registered as an IBO in 2015, the agreement she signed was available only in English and Spanish, and that she \"did not re-register in 2015 on an on-screen Chinese version of the Website because there wasn't one.\" (Pl. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25 (emphases removed) ). Instead, Plaintiff claims that when she re-registered in 2015, she \"merely ... click[ed] on the 'Accept' button\" on the online registration agreement, which was \"in English, on the English version of\n   the Registration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31 (emphasis removed) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff states that while going through this process, she \"never once considered whether [she] was entering into a contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Initiation of the Dispute-Resolution Process and the Instant Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In October 2016, Plaintiff learned that she would not receive an annual bonus. (Compl. \u00b6 27). She claims to have determined that \"approximately 75 to 100\" other IBOs did not receive the annual bonus, all of whom \"are of Asian/Chinese extraction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29 (emphases removed) ). Soon thereafter, on November 13, 2016, Plaintiff requested to engage in Conciliation with Amway to resolve the dispute, which was scheduled for a telephonic proceeding on March 17, 2017. (VanderVen Decl. \u00b6 15). On March 6, 2017, however, Plaintiff withdrew her Conciliation request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this action on April 11, 2017. (Dkt. # 1). It seeks several forms of relief. First, Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief holding unconscionable the Registration Agreement and Rules of Conduct that incorporate the ADR Provision, which relief would allow Plaintiff \"to dispute the failure to pay [her a] [b]onus and pursue her claims ... in this Court.\" (Compl. \u00b6 47). Second, the Complaint appears to plead two claims-breach of contract and unjust enrichment-under a single cause of action, alleging that by refusing to pay Plaintiff approximately $170,000 as an annual bonus, Amway both breached its contract with Plaintiff and was \"unjustly enriched by retaining those Bonus monies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50). Third and finally, the Complaint includes a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for racial discrimination, based on Plaintiff's contention that Amway deprived \"somewhere between 75 and 100 individuals all of the same ethnicity\" of their bonuses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 31, 2017, Amway filed the instant motion to dismiss the Complaint or compel arbitration based on the Registration Agreement and its incorporation of the ADR Provision. (Dkt. # 18-22). On October 2, 2017, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of law opposing Amway's motion (Dkt. # 27, 30), and on October 16, 2017, Amway replied to Plaintiff's opposition (Dkt. # 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   Court thus held that although the online contract before it presented the Terms of Service containing an arbitration provision only as a hyperlink on a screen requiring payment before a consumer could create an account with the defendant web company, those terms were nonetheless valid and enforceable as part of the contract, because \"notice of the Terms of Service [was] provided simultaneously to enrollment, thereby connecting the contractual terms of the services to which they apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   So too here.

Plaintiff's unconscionability claim thus does not foreclose sending her dispute to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff argues further that the Arbitration Agreement is invalid because \"neither Plaintiff nor other similarly situated IBOs had actual or constructive knowledge\" of the terms of the agreement. (Pl. Opp. 15 (capitalization and emphasis removed) ). This position is both factually and legally flawed. The Registration Agreement, which Plaintiff concedes she signed, outlined the dispute-resolution procedures contained in the Rules of Conduct, and it directed putative IBOs to refer to those Rules. Thus, by providing an overview of the dispute-resolution process in addition to pointing to the more comprehensive framework in the Rules of Conduct, the Registration Agreement went further than simply \"connect[ing] the contractual terms of the services to which they apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263702\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/66/#p73\">\n    868 F.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the Registration Agreement\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   delineated the dispute-resolution procedures to which claims between an IBO and Amway would be subject. A reasonably prudent user of Amway's registration process would thus have had actual notice that \"any dispute [the user] may have with ... Amway\" would be subject to arbitration if not resolved through the nonbinding conciliation process. (Reg. Agmt.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nor does Plaintiff's professed unfamiliarity with the English language invalidate her agreement with Amway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues that \"the average Chinese IBO would not have been put on notice and therefore\n   <strong>\n    not have been informed\n   </strong>\n   about the Rules of Conduct such that they would not have consented to those Rules.\" (Pl. Opp. 16-17 (emphasis in original) ). But \"[a] person who is illiterate in the English language is not automatically excused from complying with the terms of a contract simply because he or she could not read it.

The scope of this dispute thus falls squarely within Plaintiff's contractual relationship with Amway. And the Registration Agreement provides that \"if any dispute cannot be resolved by good faith efforts in Conciliation,\" an IBO must submit \"to binding arbitration\" \"any remaining claim or dispute arising out of or relating to [the IBO's] Independent Business, the IBO Compensation Plan, or the IBO Rules of Conduct\" that is \"against another IBO, or any such IBO's officers, directors, agents, or employees; or against Amway Corp.\" (Reg.
