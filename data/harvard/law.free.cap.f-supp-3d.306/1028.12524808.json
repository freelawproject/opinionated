Tharp, Jr., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises out of a decision by Calumet City (the \"City\") to deny Plaintiff Shaneka Dyson a business license to operate a banquet hall. Dyson, along with two of her businesses, Jump N' Jam Inflatables, Inc. (\"JNJ\") and The Atrium Venue, Inc. (the \"Atrium\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   have filed suit against the City and several of its officials, alleging, among other theories, that the City's handling of her license application violated her federal and state equal protection and due process rights, as well as constituted a taking without just compensation. The defendants responded by moving to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state any claim for relief. Because the Court concludes that the complaint does not plausibly allege any federal constitutional violations, it grants the defendants' motion with respect to Dyson's federal claims and declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\n   over the remaining state-law claims. Nevertheless, the complaint is dismissed without prejudice. Dyson is afforded another opportunity to address the deficiencies outlined in this opinion, if she is able. Any amended pleading is due no later than February 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the complaint and are taken as true for purposes of the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    Yeftich v. Navistar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063116\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/911/#p915\">\n    722 F.3d 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 915 (7th Cir. 2013). Dyson has owned and operated JNJ in Calumet City for several years. (Compl. \u00b6 15.) In early 2015, she sought to open a banquet hall called the Atrium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Dyson executed a lease agreement in March 2015 that allowed her to combine the property used to operate JNJ with the property next door, and renovate both into a banquet hall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.) (The two properties have since been converted into a single address-1582 Huntington Drive in Calumet City-and are referred to in this opinion simply as the \"property.\") On the same day, Dyson applied to the City for a business license to operate a banquet hall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dyson started the process for obtaining City approval to renovate the property in March 2015 as well. After meeting with city inspectors and a city engineer, Dyson's drawings were approved for \"assembly\" and she was instructed by Defendant Randy Barron, the then-director of inspectoral services, to apply for building permits, which would allow her to begin the necessary renovations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 20-22.) In June 2015, Dyson was issued three building permits; one for plumbing, one for electrical work, and another for a sprinkler system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28-29.) In reliance of these building permits, Dyson began renovating the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Around the same time Dyson applied for building permits, she also inquired with the City about obtaining a liquor license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) That inquiry attracted the attention of Defendant Michelle Qualkinbush, the mayor of Calumet City, who visited the site in April 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The following month, Dyson emailed the mayor an explanation of her business proposal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Dyson followed up with Qualkinbush about her proposal \"every few days\" thereafter, and on June 11, 2015, Qualkinbush informed Dyson that she would bring the liquor license request before the city council. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 27.) The two met again on August 4, 2015, at which time Qualkinbush told Dyson that the liquor license would be discussed and decided during a city council meeting the following week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later in August, however, Dyson's business plan began to unravel. At first, she was informed that the property passed its electrical and plumbing inspections and that an occupancy permit would be issued once an HVAC problem was corrected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) But then, on August 27, 2015, Qualkinbush informed Dyson that the property \"had outstanding issues with zoning\" and that she would need to present her liquor license request to the city council personally during a meeting in early September. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) The following day, Barron delivered a letter to Dyson which indicated that \"no further permits would be issued\" until Dyson obtained a business license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) The letter further stated that \"a banquet hall\" or \"special venue meeting room\" license was not \"permitted under the current zoning of the property\" and that \"the Zoning Board and City Council must approve a change in the zoning to permit this use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) According to Dyson, late August was the first time she was \"made aware there was an issue with how the property was zoned.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Moreover, between May 2015, when she obtained her first building\n   permit, and August 28, 2015, the date she received the letter from Barron, Dyson spent over $150,000 renting and renovating the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2015, Dyson attempted to get her business plan back on track. She first attended a city council meeting on September 8, 2015, during which she met briefly with Alderman Antoine Collins and obtained a dry bar permit for the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Later in September, Dyson filed a petition with the Calumet City Zoning Board of Appeals (\"ZBA\") to allow her banquet hall as a special use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) The ZBA held a public hearing on that request on November 2, 2015, and ten days later, issued its findings and recommendations to the city council. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) By a vote of two to two, the ZBA determined not to favorably recommend Dyson's special use application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The following month, on December 10, 2015, the city council met and adopted the ZBA's finding and recommendations, thereby \"codifying\" the denial of Dyson's request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) The city attorney then sent Dyson a letter on December 18, 2015, which stated that she would not be issued a business or liquor license for the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Dyson inquired about how to appeal the decision (with whom, the complaint does not say), and was informed that she \"would have to begin the process anew.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2016, Dyson submitted a second application for a business license, but proposed a new business plan. Instead of operating a banquet hall, she proposed to open a youth center for teens called the \"JNJ Spot, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Dyson followed up on this application several times over the next month. In early June, she emailed Defendant James Patton, the special assistant to the mayor, to check on the status of this application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Patton responded that the application was in the process for zoning approval by Rose Bonato of the City Clerk's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Two weeks later, Dyson followed up with Bonato, but was told there \"was no update\" on the application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Having still not received a resolution on her request, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56), Dyson filed suit in December 2016. She alleges in her complaint that the City's handling of her business license and special use requests violated numerous federal and Illinois constitutional guarantees, including equal protection, due process, and the prohibition of takings without just compensation. Dyson further alleges that city officials conspired to violate her constitutional rights and that the denial of her requests amount to tortious interference of contract and business expectancy, as Dyson lost future clients and business when she was unable to open her banquet hall. In April 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that Dyson failed to state any claim for relief. (Defs. Joint Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 30.) The motion having been fully briefed, the Court finds that none of Dyson's claims may proceed to discovery as alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendants move to dismiss the complaint in its entirety under Rule 12(b)(6). To overcome a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, \"a complaint must 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

While a municipality is subject to suit under section 1983, liability may flow to the municipality only by way of a claim under\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

A\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim requires that a plaintiff plead and prove that she was injured not by the unlawful actions of a municipality's agents, but by (1) the enforcement of an express policy, (2) a widespread practice that is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law, or (3) a person with final policymaking authority.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Sims ex rel.

The Court might be warranted in dismissing these claims against the City on that basis alone, but doing so would elevate form over function. The crux of this suit is that the defendants improperly denied Dyson's business license and special use requests. According to the complaint, the basis of those denials was a zoning decision that was voted on and \"codifi[ed]\" by the city council. (Compl. \u00b6 47.) A codification of a zoning decision by the city council is nothing if not the \"policy\" of the City, enacted by those with final policy-making authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benedix v.

Thus, the Court\n   addresses the claims against the City to the extent they would be cognizable under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   ; that is, to the extent they are clearly based on the City's enacted policy, rather than vicarious liability for its agent's actions. Moreover, because Dyson asserts her federal constitutional claims in a collective fashion, the Court assesses each constitutional theory as to all of the defendants at once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Class-of-One Equal Protection (Count IV)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court turns first to Dyson's contention that she has been deprived of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. The Equal Protection Clause prohibits state action that discriminates on the basis of membership in a protected class or that irrationally targets an individual for discriminatory treatment as a so-called \"class of one.\"\n   <em>\n    Brunson v. Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173001\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/698/#p705\">\n    843 F.3d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 705 (7th Cir. 2016) (citing\n   <em>\n    Geinosky v.

Dyson proceeds under the later theory. In short, she argues that the defendants singled her out for abuse by stringing along her business license application and then pulling the rug out from underneath her, all while ignoring local law and all because of the defendants' spite for Alderman Collins, with whom Dyson is affiliated. (Pl. Mem. in Opp'n to Defs. Joint Mot. to Dismiss 17-18, ECF No. 44.) The defendants counter that Dyson's class-of-one claim fails for two reasons. First, there is a conceivable rational basis for the denial of her business license and special use requests; namely, that the property did not comply with existing city zoning requirements. (Defs. Mot. 16-17.) Second, Dyson fails to identify any similarly situated individuals to demonstrate that city officials acted irrationally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.) The defendants have the better of this argument, but they are only half right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The elements of a class-of-one claim have been in flux since the Seventh Circuit's en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    Del Marcelle v.

In that case, the judgement dismissing a purposed class-of-one claim was affirmed by a tie vote, which resulted in three decisions.

Her story seems to be that city officials lured her into believing that she could operate a banquet hall, but then short-circuited those plans by revealing that the property was not zoned for such use and denying her special use and business license requests. (Pl. Opp'n 17-18.) As evidence of this scheme, Dyson points to the fact that city officials waited several months to raise the zoning issue and only after she had spent roughly $150,000 to get her new business up and running. She also argues that the ZBA disregarded its own rules to deny her special use application (more accurately, elected to send her application to the city council with an unfavorable recommendation) in that it voted with less than a quorum and reached a tie vote. Finally, she asserts that after her requests were denied, she was told to start the process over again, and after she did, her application was held in limbo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Geinosky\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Swanson\n   </em>\n   , however, this story does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that Dyson was the target of an illegitimate exercise of municipal power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fares Pawn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063528\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/839/#p845\">\n    755 F.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] given action can have a rational basis and be a perfectly logical action for a government entity to take even if there are facts casting it as one taken out of animosity.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Flying J Inc. v.

Government abuse may be one possible explanation for what happened, but it certainly is not the only one. To begin with, it is conceivable that the City's issuance of the building permits, which supposedly led Dyson to believe the property was zoned to permit a banquet hall, was simply a\n   mistake, perhaps due to a misinterpretation of the municipal code, oversight by some official, or some other reason. Dyson alleges that it was an \"intentional\" act rather than \"the result of government incompetence,\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 82, 84), but the Court need not accept this wholly conclusory allegation at face value,\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , especially when class-of-one claims must be based on something more than \"ordinary and inevitable mistakes by government officials,\"\n   <em>\n    Geinosky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752221\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/743/#p747\">\n    675 F.3d at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he purpose of entertaining a 'class of one' equal protection claim is not to constitutionalize all tort law nor to transform every claim of improper provision of municipal services ... into a federal case.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 44-48.) Moreover, the municipal code, which Dyson cites throughout the complaint, shows that applicants must meet several requirements before the ZBA will recommend a special use request to the city council. Calumet City, Ill., Code App'x B, \u00a7 12.7 (1980) (special uses). But Dyson fails to state whether her special use application met any of the six requirements listed. Thus, she fails to negate at least one reasonable explanation for the adverse action that forms the basis of her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, Dyson has not even established that the ZBA's vote on her special use application was out of the ordinary. She contends that a quorum for the ZBA consists of more than the four members who voted on her application-how many more is unclear-(Pl. Opp'n 17), but offers no support for that proposition. At most, Dyson points to a section of the municipal code that states that the ZBA \"shall consist of seven (7) members.\" Calumet City, Ill., Code App'x B, \u00a7 12.5 (1980). But that provision says nothing about how many members must be present for a vote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6881125\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/55/1081/#p1089\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dyson also argues that, at a minimum, the ZBA must cast three-not two-concurring votes to recommend granting or denying a special use permit.

Dyson claims that she was targeted by the defendants because of her affiliation with Alderman Collins. But the complaint has little to say about Collins. In particular, it fails to explain who she is (other than a city council member), how Dyson is affiliated with her, or how Collins has inspired animus among the defendants. Although it is unclear whether Dyson needs to plead animus in light of the split in\n   <em>\n    Del Marcelle\n   </em>\n   , the complaint's fleeting reference to Collins would not pass muster if she does.

The defendants move to dismiss these claims on several grounds, including that they are not ripe, that Dyson fails to plead a threshold property interest, and that Dyson has otherwise failed to allege the remaining requirements under the Due Process and Takings Clauses.

Dyson rejoins that the doctrine is inapplicable because her damages are much more extensive than a state court could award in an inverse condemnation action and because this case is \"not simply a land use dispute,\" but rather a dispute about procedures due to Dyson and the City's failure to follow those procedures.

For purposes of due process, the complaint alleges that Dyson has an interest in the business licenses, and to some extent the special use permit, that she was denied. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60, 87, 95). But in her brief, she argues only for a property interest in the building permits and dry bar license she was issued by the City. (Pl. Opp'n 7-8). On the takings front, Dyson alleges that she was deprived of the use \"of the properties referenced in the complaint\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\" (Compl. \u00b6 73), which could mean anything from her actual use of the property as a banquet hall to any one of the licenses or permits discussed above, though her brief indicates that the former is the focus of her takings claim, (Pl. Opp'n 14 (\"There was no other viable use for the space outside of a banquet hall, therefore Defendants' actions constituted an over regulation and taking of property.\") ). Despite the lack of clarity and consistency, the Court will address each interest in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The first two interests are the business license and special use permit. As Dyson impliedly admits by abandoning this argument in her opposition brief, neither qualifies as property in this case.

Dyson, however, fails to identify any ordinance that dictates when and how a business license must be issued. And although the municipal code sets forth standards for the approval of special use applications, the city council ultimately has discretion in granting such permits.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-37). That means that the permits issued to Dyson were invalid when issued and could not have provided her with a property interest in proceeding with her project.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Space Station 2001, Inc. v.

At bottom, Dyson protests that she is unable to use the property she has leased for the business purpose she desires.

This claim largely mirrors Dyson's class-of-one equal protection claim, which is unsurprising considering both types of claims address arbitrary conduct by state actors.

Having already concluded that Dyson has failed to establish that the City's denial of her special use and business license requests is conceivably rational, the Court dismisses her substantive due process claim on the same basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodpaster v.

Before a court will consider if there was an arbitrary and irrational interference with property, a plaintiff must \"first establish either an independent constitutional violation or the inadequacy of state remedies to redress\n   the deprivation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Gen. Auto Serv. Station v.

Dyson has done neither. Turning to the easy question first, the Court is dismissing Dyson's procedural due process, takings, and equal protection claims, so she cannot point to an independent constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaBella Winnetka, Inc. v.

(Pl. Opp'n 10-11, 15.) The Court disagrees. For starters, Dyson could have asserted an equitable estoppel claim against the City to address her license and permit issues. Illinois courts may in some circumstance prevent a municipality from enforcing a zoning ordinance-the root of Dyson's problems-where the plaintiff had begun construction on a project upon \"affirmative action and apparent approval by public authorities.\"\n   <em>\n    Cities Serv. Oil Co. v.

Moreover, with regard to her damages, Dyson could have asserted the same state-law tortious interference claim that she asserts in this litigation to recover for her lost business opportunities. Therefore, because Dyson's substantive due process claim fails on several fronts, Count I is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Dyson's procedural due process claims do not fare any better. She argues that a number of procedural irregularities occurred during her bid to open up a banquet hall. The Court has already addressed two of those issues-that only four ZBA members voted on her special use application and that the ZBA's vote resulted a tie-and found that Dyson has not establish that those actions were unlawful or even out of the ordinary. Even if the ZBA's vote were irregular, moreover, Dyson cannot show that that it amounted to a deprivation of due process. As a general matter, \"the procedures 'due' in zoning cases are minimal.\"\n   <em>\n    River Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p165\">\n    23 F.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Seventh Circuit has stated that \"[w]hen zoning decisions are confided to a legislative rather than a judicial body,\" as is the case here, \"the affected persons have no right to notice and an opportunity for a hearing: no right, in other words, to procedural due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Indiana Land Co., LLC v.

The Court needn't go that far here, because the complaint fails even to suggest that Dyson lacked notice of the hearings in which her applications were discussed and decided. Nor does she allege that the hearings she attended provided no opportunity to be heard. She therefore has no basis to contend that she lacked the opportunity to seek remedial action under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The other two issues that Dyson raises are not actionable either. She first contends that the defendants' decision to keep her second application for a business license (for the youth center) \"in a state of limbo\" violates due process. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 94-102.) But the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    River Park\n   </em>\n   shows the futility of this argument. In that case, a property owner applied for a zoning change to permit the development of a residential subdivision.\n   <em>\n    River Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p165\">\n    23 F.3d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After nominally approving the zoning variance, city officials\n   stalled the implementation, which forced the developer to start the process over again.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After city officials sat on the developer's second application, he filed suit claiming that the city's tactics were a due process violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Seventh Circuit disagreed. It held that the Due Process Clause permits municipalities to use political methods-which may mirror \"procedural maneuvers that prevent[ ] [a] question from reaching the floor for a vote\"-to decide zoning issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p165\">\n    at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, it found that because \"the only procedural rules at stake [in zoning disputes] are those local law provides,\" the suit should have been brought in state not federal court, especially considering the developer could have asserted a common law writ of certiorari to contest the runaround it had receiving from the city.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504627\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/164/#p165\">\n    at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same is true here. The allegations in the complaint show that Dyson's second business license application hinge on a change in zoning, just as her first application did. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-55.) Thus, her application is subject to the (alleged) political machinations of the Calumet City government. Moreover, any grievance Dyson has about her application being held in limbo is a matter of local law in which Illinois provides adequate protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The final procedural issue relates to the City's improper issuance of building permits.

Here, nothing in the complaint establishes that defendants Figgs, Barron, or Patton caused any of the alleged constitutional violations. Figgs is barely mentioned in the complaint; it provides only a description\n   of her role as the City Clerk, which includes administrating and maintaining business licenses, and an allegation that the \"City Clerk\" has not \"formally denied\" Dyson's license application. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 101.) But these allegations do not suggest that Figgs personally had a hand in denying the business license request. Rather, the complaint indicates that the application was rejected based on decisions made by the ZBA and city council. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The allegations concerning Barron, the former director of inspectional services, and Patton, the special assistant to the mayor, are similarly deficient. So far as is alleged, Barron's involvement in this case is limited to issuing the building permits, overseeing the inspection of Dyson's renovations, and informing Dyson in August 2015 that no further permits would be issued until she obtained a business license. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 20-22, 34-35.) None of those activities, however, show that he had anything to do with Dyson's special use or business license requests. Nor does Barron's role in issuing the building permits expose him to liability; as discussed above, issuing permits in violation of local law does not raise a constitutional concern. Patton's connection to this lawsuit is even weaker than Barron's. The only role he played was to inform Dyson that her second request for a business license was pending a zoning approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)
