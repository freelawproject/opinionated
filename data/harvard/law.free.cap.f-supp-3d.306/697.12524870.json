PRATTER, United States District Judge\n   Are there adequate protections for American citizens petitioning for citizenship on behalf of their alien spouses? And if there are, did the Government violate those legal protections here? The plaintiffs, Kristine Bruno and her husband Mohammed Zizi, challenge a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) final decision denying Ms. Bruno's I-130 petition for citizenship on behalf of Mr. Zizi. The Board denied the petition because it found that Mr. Zizi had previously entered into a fraudulent marriage. Mr. Zizi challenges this final agency action, arguing that it runs afoul of both due process and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court finds Mr. Zizi's claims without merit and grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Necessarily, the Court's role is limited when reviewing agency action, and here, within that limited role, the Court finds that the agency properly reviewed the evidence before it, made a reasoned and reasonable determination, and adhered to at least the minimum demands of the APA and due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts presented are as follows: The plaintiffs are Mohammed Zizi, an alien, and Kristine Bruno, an American citizen. Mr. Zizi entered the United States in 2001. He married his first wife, Michelle Crozier, in May 2005. Eight months after they married, Ms. Crozier filed an I-130 \"Petition for Alien Relative\" form\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on behalf of Mr. Zizi for his permanent residency. This petition, if approved, would have allowed Mr. Zizi to become a permanent resident of the United States because of his marriage to Ms. Crozier, but it was never approved. The form was disapproved because Ms. Crozier failed to appear for her required interview, and she never appealed that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Zizi and Ms. Crozier divorced after less than a year of marriage. Fifty (50) days after his divorce with Ms. Crozier, Mr. Zizi married her cousin and his current wife, Ms. Bruno.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, Ms. Bruno filed a new I-130 petition (the subject of this litigation) on behalf of Mr. Zizi. The United States Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) director denied the petition in September 2009, and the plaintiffs appealed. Upon review, the Board remanded the case to the USCIS director for failure to consider all of the evidence, and in September 2016, the USCIS director denied the petition again. The Board affirmed the USCIS director's decision. This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The USCIS director and BIA denied Ms. Bruno's I-130 request because they determined that Mr. Zizi had previously entered into a sham marriage with her cousin, Ms. Crozier. \"[N]o [I-130] petition shall be approved if (1) the alien has previously been accorded or has sought to be accorded, an immediate relative or preference status as the spouse of a citizen of the United States [if that marriage was] entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The Board had found that Mr. Zizi's previous\n   marriage, the brief one to Ms. Crozier, was fraudulent. Hence, the Board denied Ms. Bruno's I-130 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Board based its denial in large part on Ms. Crozier's sworn testimony to USCIS agents where she admitted: \"I entered into this marriage as a friend for the sole purpose of aiding [Mr. Zizi] in gaining his legal residence in the United States. I don't consider this marriage to be a true marriage.\" Ms. Crozier admitted that they never consummated the relationship; they maintained separate residences; and they both were involved with intimate relationships with other people during the ostensible marriage. However, she recanted these statements and the information contained in them during Mr. Zizi's pursuit of this I-130 petition, apparently for two reasons. First, she stated that her statement was coerced because she was afraid that she was liable for assisting Mr. Zizi's alleged fraud. Second, she claims she was on antidepressants when she gave the testimony. The USCIS director and BIA weighed this evidence but ultimately found it unavailing. In a twelve-page single-spaced decision, the director outlined the evidence, weighed the relative merits of it, and found that Mr. Zizi's previous marriage was a sham. Accordingly, the director denied the I-130 petition. The Board also considered the USCIS director's opinion and affirmed it in a two-page opinion outlining the relevant considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Zizi filed a complaint in federal court, asserting that the decision violated due process and was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. The Government moved for summary judgment based on the administrative record, and Mr. Zizi cross-moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although \"summary judgment is the proper mechanism for deciding, as a matter of law, whether an agency's action is supported by the administrative record\" the district court is acting as an appellate tribunal, and \"the usual summary judgment standard does not apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Dorley v.

Under the APA, a district court may only set aside agency action if it is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). This standard has two different categories. The first, \"arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion\" looks at the reasoning the agency employed in coming to its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mirjan v.

Failure to Disclose Information\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The first argument that Mr. Zizi makes is that the agency failed to disclose necessary information, which violates\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.2\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(16) and various agency procedures. He makes this argument in two respects. First, he claims that the record here is incomplete. Second, he claims that he was not given full access to the record to defend his appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Incomplete Record\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Mr. Zizi first claims that the administrative record is incomplete. In support, he points to redactions in the record, then to the USCIS director's reliance on interviews that were not recorded. Mr. Zizi asserts that this must mean that the decision is arbitrary and capricious because the record analyzed by the agency was incomplete. Neither of his arguments have merit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <em>\n     1. Redactions\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Mr. Zizi first argues that there are redactions that indicate an incomplete record. Mr. Zizi does not point to any law that prohibits such redactions, but simply maintains that the extent of the redactions means that the agency has not reviewed the full record. Given that the agency must articulate a \"rational connection between the facts found and the choice made\"\n    <em>\n     State Farm\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     463 U.S. at 43\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     103 S.Ct. 2856\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , Mr. Zizi argues that an incomplete record means that the agency's decision must be arbitrary and capricious.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The Court disagrees. The redactions complained of are minimal. They consist mostly of names, addresses, policy numbers and contact information redacted by the United States Attorney's Office to comply with federal and local rules regarding identifiers. Nothing would indicate that these redactions reveal any important information, nor do plaintiffs point to any reason why these redactions matter. They baldly assert that they are integral to defending the denial of the petition. The Court fails to see how these would aid anyone in the defense of the petition, nor how these redactions prejudice Mr. Zizi in any meaningful way. Moreover, this information is more than enough to pass the arbitrary and capricious standard.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Section IV,\n    <em>\n     infra.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     2. Interview Procedures\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Mr. Zizi next claims that the USCIS investigators failed to record and transcribe interviews with witnesses. Instead, the interviews were summarized in \"post-hoc investigative documents\" such as memoranda from investigating officers. Pl. Br. at 11. Mr. Zizi's argument here does not rest on the adequacy of the evidence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    He never claims here that the failure to follow these procedures means that \"the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion but compels it.\"\n    <em>\n     Abdille\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11125752\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/477/#p483\">\n     242 F.3d at 483-84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Rather, he rests his argument on the fact that the summarized interviews violate separate legally-cognizable rights. In support, Mr. Zizi points to the USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual (AFM), which outlines parameters for recording interviews. Mr. Zizi also cites to the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) which requires videotaped interviews to be transcribed. He argues that these two facts lead to the conclusion that an agency cannot take interviews into account unless they are videotaped and transcribed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Although \"the AFM is instructive as to proper agency practice, it does not hold authority over this Court.\"\n    <em>\n     Jessop v.

Similarly, the EOIR regulations (requiring transcription of interviews as a clerical matter, not as an evidentiary matter) are inapplicable to the Board. Therefore, this argument fails to satisfy the requirement that the agency action is not \"in accordance with law.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2)(A).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Withholding of Derogatory Information\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Mr. Zizi's next argument is that he was denied access to important information. He focuses here on Ms. Crozier's admission that the marriage was a sham, claiming that the actual statement she made had indicia of unreliability such that he should have been shown the actual handwritten statement, not just a summary. Mr. Zizi is correct that the petitioner must be shown \"[d]erogatory information unknown\" to him.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.2\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(16)(i). But Mr. Zizi does not allege that he was denied notice of this derogatory information-only that he was given summaries of the information rather than the actual statements. Mr. Zizi claims that he must be given the primary documents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The Court disagrees. The regulation at issue merely requires that the government disclose the \"derogatory information\" unknown to Mr. Zizi. The regulation does not require the government to turn over the evidence in its primary form. A summary therefore suffices to meet the requirement\n    under the regulation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Sehgal v.

A more free exchange of information between the government and applicants would not only decrease the risk of erroneous deprivations, but it would also decrease litigation costs like this. However, the government is under no obligation to do so. The government complied with the regulation when it supplied Mr. Zizi with a summary of the information.

They argue that there is no substantive due process right, nor is there a property interest sufficient to trigger due process.

At first blush, this would mean that the government must give due process for the approval of I-130 petitions, because the approval of that petition allows a petitioner's spouse to become a permanent resident. But I-130 forms do not change any familial composition. After the petition is granted or denied, nothing happens to interfere with a family. It is only after the government's initiation of removal proceedings that an alien may be taken away from his or her family. Although the removal may implicate due process, the step of simply denying an I-130 form does not.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parella v.

Rather, the approval of the I-130 petition is discretionless insofar as it requires the Attorney General to act once the requirements have been met. The Attorney General's action then creates another discretionless action on the part of the Secretary of State, who must inform the appropriate consulate of the approved petition. In essence, the approval of the I-130 petition allows an American citizen to expedite the visa process for a family member.

One would be hard-pressed to find (and the Court cannot fathom) how more process could be given here. Ms. Bruno's petition has been back and forth between the agency and the plaintiffs for the past twelve (12) years. They received an unbiased tribunal, notice of the intent to deny, an opportunity to oppose the denial of the application, notification of derogatory evidence against them and the\n    right to present evidence disputing it, the right to have counsel advocate on their behalf, the making of a record and a statement of reasons for denial, as well as judicial review of the agency's decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Henry J.

Given the robust protections outlined above, and the fact that Mr. Zizi received a summary of the note, the Court fails to see how Mr. Zizi's due process rights were infringed upon.

Incorrect Standard of Denial\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Mr. Zizi next argues that the USCIS director and the Board used the incorrect standard to find he had entered into a fraudulent marriage, and their decisions were therefore not \"in accordance with law.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2)(A). The proper standard to deny an I-130 petition on this point is whether the government found \"substantial and probative evidence\" of an attempt to enter into a fraudulent marriage. 8 C.F.R.\u00a7 204.2(a)(1)(ii) (outlining the requirements to find a marriage to be fraudulent). If the government finds substantial and probative evidence, the I-130 petition must be denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Mr. Zizi's argument here rests on the notes of the officer investigating the case. In those notes, the officer wrote that the evidence does \"not show clearly and convincingly that [Mr. Zizi and Ms. Crozier] live in a marital union.\" Pl. Br. at 6. Whatever the officer investigating the case thought, both the USCIS director and the Board expressly recited and applied the \"substantial and probative\" standard when assessing the evidence before them. The investigating officer's legal thoughts are irrelevant. For example, a police officer may have an erroneous view that the standard for a criminal conviction is \"preponderance of the evidence.\" But this belief does not somehow vitiate a judicial opinion convicting a criminal \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The investigating officer's incorrect thoughts in the field are irrelevant to the standard that is actually applied. Mr. Zizi has presented no actual evidence that these standards were misunderstood or applied incorrectly by the USCIS director or the Board.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Alternatively, Mr. Zizi's attorney argued at oral argument that in light of the supposedly scant evidence of a sham marriage presented to the USCIS director and the Board, the Court should infer that they used the wrong standard to analyze the burden, even though both the Board and USCIS director recited the correct one. This argument should more properly be used to argue that the decision itself was arbitrary and capricious.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Section IV,\n    <em>\n     infra.\n    </em>\n    The Court is bound to assess the statements made by the agency, and without any evidence that the standard was misapplied or misunderstood, such an unsupported argument cannot stand.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.

The evidence does not compel the opposite conclusion. The two decisions combined for 14 single-spaced pages analyzing a record that had been built over a 12-year period. Both the USCIS director and the Board found that the initial statement by Ms. Crozier was more credible than her later recantation, because Ms. Crozier's initial statement was under oath, signed, and against her interest.
