The verified complaint alleges constitutional violations and seeks various forms of relief. (Docket 1). Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction based on three arguments claiming violations of the First Amendment. (Docket 14). Plaintiffs seek to open and operate a retail store\n   the City would regulate as a \"sexually oriented business\" based on the store's inventory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. Defendant denied plaintiffs the necessary permit for operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6. Because some factual issues were embedded in the preliminary injunction motion, the court entered a briefing schedule that provided a discrete time period for discovery. (Docket 18). The court held a hearing on plaintiffs' motion. (Docket 22). Based on the analysis set forth below, the court grants plaintiffs' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In April of 2017, David Eliason met with Vicki Fisher of the Rapid City Community Planning and Development Services Department about opening his business. (Docket 1 at pp. 11-12). They specifically discussed where Mr. Eliason could run a store that the city would regulate as a \"sexually oriented business.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12. Plaintiffs intend to name the business they seek to open \"Dick &amp; Jane's Naughty Spot\" or \"Dick &amp; Jane's Super Spot.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10. The business would sell videos and magazines with sexual content.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 11. Under Rapid City Municipal Code (\"RCMC\" or \"City Code\" or \"ordinance\"), sexually oriented businesses include adult-only bookstores, adult novelty shops and adult video stores. RCMC \u00a7 17.50.186(C). The ordinance states the purpose of regulating these businesses is \"to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city.\" \u00a7 17.50.186(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Eliason, along with his attorney, met with Ms. Fisher and other Rapid City employees in May 2017. (Docket 1 at p. 12). The City employees indicated Mr. Eliason could likely operate his sexually oriented business on Deadwood Avenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the meeting, the Deadwood Avenue Business Park was suggested as a viable location not prohibited by the City Code, specifically RCMC \u00a7 17.50.186(D). (Docket 1 at p. 12). RCMC \u00a7 17.50.186(D) prohibits sexually oriented businesses from operating within 1,000 feet of various facilities such as churches, parks and schools. One category of facilities included in \u00a7 17.50.186(D) is defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   A public or private educational facility including but not limited to child day care facilities, nursery schools, preschools, kindergartens, elementary schools, private schools, intermediate schools, junior high schools, middle schools, high schools, vocational schools, secondary schools, continuation schools, special education schools, junior colleges, and universities; school includes the school grounds, but does not include facilities used primarily for another purpose and only incidentally as a school[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   RCMC \u00a7 17.50.186(D)(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following his meetings with City employees, Mr. Eliason obtained a leasehold interest in a piece of real property at 1141 Deadwood Avenue in Rapid City. (Docket 1 at p. 12). The properly is in one of the City's general commercial zoning districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13. The City Code provides, \"[a]ny sexually oriented business lawfully operating in a location permitted by this section shall be classified as a conditional use, and\n   authorized by \u00a7 17.54.030.\" RCMC \u00a7 17.50.186(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Working with Renner Associates LLC, Mr. Eliason arranged the materials necessary to apply to the Rapid City Planning Commission (\"the Planning Commission\") for a conditional use permit. (Docket 1 at p. 13). RCMC \u00a7 17.54.030 sets forth the procedures and criteria the Planning Commission uses for deciding whether to issue a conditional use permit. The criteria the Planning Commission must consider relate to building design, landscaping, parking, signage, public utilities and other matters. RCMC \u00a7 17.54.030(E)(1)-(12). The Planning Commission must also determine whether the requirements in \u00a7 17.50.186 are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In order to secure a conditional use permit, Mr. Eliason and Renner Associates submitted an application for development review to the Planning Commission in July 2017. (Dockets 1 at p. 13 &amp; 1-5). On August 24, 2017, the Planning Commission approved the conditional use permit. (Dockets 1 at pp. 13-14, 1-6 &amp; 1-7). Before voting to approve the permit, the Planning Commission considered whether the proposed business would be in compliance with \u00a7 17.50.186(D). (Exhibit 102 at p. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under \u00a7 17.54.030(F), the Planning Commission's decision was appealed to the Rapid City Common Council (\"Common Council\" or \"City Council\") by BHT,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a martial arts studio in the area of the location of Mr. Eliason's planned business. (Docket 1 at p. 14). Among other things, BHT has classes teaching martial arts to people as young as age four. (Docket 1-8 at p. 4). BHT argued in its appeal that Mr. Eliason's business should not receive a conditional use permit because BHT, which is within 1,000 feet of Mr. Eliason's proposed location, is an \"educational facility\" under \u00a7 17.50.186(D).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1-10; (Docket 1 at p. 15). Mr. Eliason filed a response contending BHT should not be viewed as an \"educational facility.\" (Docket 1-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 18, 2017, Carla Cushman, an Assistant City Attorney in the Office of the City Attorney, wrote a legal memorandum to the Common Council on whether BHT was an educational facility. (Docket 1-10). The memorandum concluded BHT was not an educational facility, stating \"Karate for Kids is not an educational facility as contemplated by the sexually-oriented business ordinance, and the 1000 foot buffer zone should not be applied to this situation to deny the [conditional use permit.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. The memorandum provided several grounds for its conclusion: BHT is not regulated by any government as a school; the limited extent to which BHT's purpose is educational; other uses of the term \"educational facility\" in the City Code; the non-permanent nature of commercial enterprises such as BHT; and the limited frequency and duration of a student's visits to BHT. Id. at pp. 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the same date as the City Attorney's memorandum, September 18, 2017, and at a meeting with extensive public input, the Common Council voted to deny Mr. Eliason's conditional use permit in a 6-4 decision. (Dockets 1 at p. 15 &amp; 1-12 at p. 14); (Exhibit 103).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the Common Council's action, Mr. Eliason met with Fletcher Lacock of the Planning and Development Services Department and Ms. Cushman on September 22, 2017. (Docket 1 at p. 16). They discussed\n   other potential locations for Mr. Eliason's business, but no one at the meeting identified an alternative location in compliance with the City Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Eliason and City officials explored whether he could modify his proposed business so it would not be regulated as a sexually oriented business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; (Docket 1-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Then plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on October 18, 2017. (Docket 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"A district court's decision to issue a preliminary injunction 'depends upon a flexible consideration of (1) the threat of irreparable harm to the moving party; (2) balancing this harm with any injury an injunction would inflict on other interested parties; (3) the probability that the moving party would succeed on the merits; and (4) the effect on the public interest.' \"\n   <em>\n    Richland/Wilkin Joint Powers Auth. v.

In discussing his view on the rationale underlying this ordinance's regulation of sexually oriented businesses, the Councilmember stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   So the reality is, there are always going to be people who choose the wrong path and that has started from the very beginning of time starting with the apple, right?

This question does not involve weighing the moral values of any statements made by members of the public to the City Council or any Councilmember's statements.

Addressing how government entities view schools and businesses, the memorandum noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The state and federal governments do not consider commercial businesses like Karate for Kids to be educational facilities that fall within their regulations and oversight.... For example, state regulations require school attendance for students in primary and secondary school, with limited exceptions.... Any educational component of Karate for Kids' programming is not mandated, and the business could remove its educational components at their own discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. The memorandum also considered BHT's purpose, finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   While the ordinance is a little confusing in the way it mixes the term schools and educational facilities, it would read the ordinance far too broadly to conclude that businesses which are only incidentally educational and which are used primarily for another purpose are \"educational facilities\" that require a buffer zone. If that is the case, then any business which happens to offer a class may claim that it is an \"educational facility\" within the ordinance, and certainly any business that works with children could make the same claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Turning to the use of \"educational facility\" in other portions of the City Code, the memorandum highlighted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The descriptions in the zoning code for residential neighborhoods discuss residential uses as well as \"noncommercial, recreation, religious and\n   <em>\n    educational facilities\n   </em>\n   \" that \"are normally required to provide a balanced and attractive residential area.\"\n   <em>\n    RCMC 17.44.010\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also RCMC 17.10.010, 17.12.010.\n   </em>\n   In those zoning districts, family day care centers, elementary and high schools, and child care centers are permitted and conditional uses. A commercial enterprise such as Karate for Kids is not allowed in these residential zoning districts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). The City Attorney's memorandum went on to explain that \"[t]he types of uses that require the 1000 foot buffer are uses which are largely permanent in nature and which cannot possibly move to another location if an unwanted neighbor moves in.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 3-4. As the court noted above, \u00a7 17.50.186(D) prohibits sexually oriented businesses from operating within 1,000 feet of various facilities such as churches, parks and schools. Unlike those examples, the memorandum asserts, BHT \"could operate within any number of other commercial buildings in the City.\" (Docket 1-10 at p. 4-). The memorandum's final point is that \"[c]hildren and students attend day care facilities and schools for a significant length of time, and day care facilities and schools will likely have children on the site all day for a majority of the year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the City Attorney's view, \"a child may visit a recreational\n   facility like Karate for Kids for as little as an hour a week, and it is unlikely that children are present in the Karate for Kids facility for the lengths of time that schools are occupied by their students.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   When the Planning Commission decided to approve plaintiffs' conditional use permit, it considered whether BHT was an educational facility. (Exhibit 102 at p. 14). One member of the Planning Commission remarked, \"I'm curious as to how the-the little karate academy around the corner relates. Is that a-is that considered a school or is that a business, or how does that work?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Fisher of the Rapid City Community Planning and Development Services Department stated, \"So that would not be what we would consider a school. That is a sports activity and many of those, whether it be a fitness gym or a karate class, are open to individuals of all ages. So it would not fall with that description of what we would look at for a school.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The City Council reached the opposite conclusion, and its reasoning was distinct from the City Attorney's memorandum especially. As set forth above, when deciding BHT constituted an educational facility, members of the City Council primarily focused on whether their decision would be in the best interests of children in the City and their concern for personal moral values.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 44-68. Absent from the reasoning of some City Councilmembers was the variety of grounds the City Attorney provided for its determination. Although some Councilmembers made remarks about the City Attorney's position, they were cursory.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 47 (\"I do want to say our City Attorney is trying to go clearly as best they can by the law and they don't read into the intention and all of that like we will up here.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs' application for a conditional use permit hinged on the definition of \"educational facility\" in \u00a7 17.50.186(D)(1)(b).

As the court set forth above, the dominant concerns of some Councilmembers were children as well as personal moral and religious values.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section I.a. at pp. 13-15;(Exhibit 103 at pp. 44-68). While many of the enumerated facilities in the ordinance are places where children are present for extended periods of time, several of them are not-specifically, vocational schools, junior colleges and universities. \u00a7 17.50.186(D)(1)(b). But because of the broad nature of the definition, Councilmembers found it proper to \"read into the intention\" of the City Code. (Exhibit 103 at p. 47).

Vagueness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The United States Supreme Court explained the rationale for constitutional challenges to vague laws:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. Third, but related, where a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms. Uncertain\n   meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Grayned v.
