The recording was created without Plaintiffs' knowledge, and once they learned about it (which occurred because excerpts from the transcribed conversation were filed in a related civil lawsuit), Plaintiffs requested a copy of the complete audio recording and the entire written transcript from the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\" or \"Defendant\") under the Freedom of Information Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"FOIA\"). In response to the FOIA request, DOJ located the audio recording and the transcript of that recorded conversation, but it withheld these records on the grounds that they were exempt from release under FOIA because producing them would interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation. Plaintiffs have filed the instant lawsuit to challenge the agency's conclusion that the records are exempt from disclosure, and they have asked this Court for an order that requires the release of the transcript and audio recording in their entirety. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before this Court at present are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pls.' Mot.\"), ECF No. 8; Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 10.) DOJ contends that it has properly withheld the entire audio recording and transcript under FOIA Exemption 7(A) because the recording and transcript were created for law enforcement purposes, and because the disclosure of these records as a whole would, among other things, interfere with prospective criminal enforcement proceedings and alert suspects to the ongoing investigation, thereby allowing them to elude detection. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. (\"Def.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 10-2, at 8-10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, and presumably in the alternative, Defendant contends that the withholding was proper under FOIA Exemption 7(D), because the source of the recording was an FBI confidential informant whose identity and information are protected from disclosure under the FOIA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 10-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In their cross-motion, Plaintiffs counter that Defendant previously published excerpts of the transcript of the recording in the context of a civil action, and therefore, a substantial portion of the information at issue is already in the public domain. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. in Supp. of Pls.' Mot. (\"Pls.' Mem.\"), ECF No. 8-1, at 11-13.) According to Plaintiffs, this means that Defendant has waived any reasonable purpose or justification for withholding the disputed records in their entirety under Exemptions 7(A) and 7(D). (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 11-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

However, because the government previously publicly\n   disclosed certain excerpts from the transcript, it has waived the right to withhold those same written excerpts from disclosure in the context of this FOIA action. Consequently, both parties' cross-motions for summary judgment will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , and Defendant must produce those parts of the written transcript that mirror the excerpts the government has previously released.

Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs Pike and Berry are the subject of an ongoing fraud investigation that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") and DOJ are conducting regarding an alleged \"kickback\" scheme that involves Reliance Medical Systems LLC (Plaintiffs' company) and other third parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Stmt. of Material Facts, ECF No. 8-2, \u00b6 2; Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Stmt. of Material Facts, ECF No. 15-1, at 2.) The details of the underlying fraud are not material to the instant action; it suffices to say here that the investigation led federal authorities to file a civil lawsuit against Plaintiffs and other third parties in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California under the False Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 3733 (\"FCA\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Stmt. of Material Facts \u00b6 3; Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Stmt. of Material Facts at 3.) In that lawsuit, which is currently pending, the complaint references and attaches several excerpts from the transcript of an audio recording dated July 26, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Stmt. of Material Facts \u00b6 3; Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Stmt. of Material Facts at 3.) According to DOJ, an undisclosed FBI source who agreed to assist in the investigation made the audio recording under the supervision of law enforcement agents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. of Material Facts, ECF No. 10-1, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 2, 2014, Plaintiffs' counsel filed a FOIA request with DOJ's Civil Division, seeking \"a copy of the recording and any transcript\" on an expedited basis. (FOIA Request, Compl. Ex. 4, ECF No. 1-1, at 37.) DOJ located both records, and subsequently explained that both were being withheld in their entirety pursuant to two FOIA Exemptions: 7(A) and 5. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of James M. Kovakas (\"Kovakas Decl.\"), Ex. A to Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 10-3, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(A), (b)(5). DOJ stated that it was withholding the records under Exemption 7(A) because disclosure would risk interference with ongoing law enforcement proceedings, and that the same withholding was also justified under Exemption 5 because the records requested were inter-agency or intra-agency documents protected under the attorney work-product privilege. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ's Final FOIA Response, Compl. Ex. 6, ECF No. 1-1, at 52-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs appealed DOJ's withholding decision to the agency's Office of Information Policy, which affirmed on the ground that the withholding was permitted under Exemption 7(A). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Stmt. of Material Facts \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Def.'s Stmt. of Material\n   Facts \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Plaintiffs then brought the present lawsuit, which was filed on March 2, 2015, and seeks a court order requiring \"DOJ to produce and disclose the July 26, 2011 recording[.]\" (Compl. at 9.) The complaint alleges that DOJ has invoked Exemption (7)(A) improperly, and that, in any case, the agency has waived its right to claim an exemption from releasing the records because it previously widely published the excerpts from the recording's transcript. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Per this Court's order, the parties subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment with respect to the issue of whether or not the requested records have been properly withheld. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order of Apr. 5, 2015.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DOJ's motion for summary judgment argues that FOIA Exemption 7(A), which exempts from disclosure investigatory records that could be used in an enforcement action, authorizes the withholding in this case because disclosure of the records Plaintiffs seek would risk interference with an ongoing criminal investigation into health care fraud and related enforcement proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 8-10.) The agency also asserts that Exemption 7(D) authorizes the withholding of the audio recording and transcript because the release of these records could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of the FBI's confidential source (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 10-12), and that the government's prior release of certain transcript excerpts demonstrates that all reasonably segregable material has already been disclosed (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (arguing that disclosure of any further information beyond the quotes included in the FCA complaint \"would significantly interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For their part, Plaintiffs argue that the government's prior publication of a substantial amount of the recording's transcribed content in the context of the FCA complaint and in an accompanying press release means that DOJ has waived its right to assert any exemption under the FOIA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 11-13.) Plaintiffs also maintain that, \"[g]iven the breadth of the previous public disclosures[,]\" there is no \"[t]ruthful and [r]easonable [b]asis\" for DOJ to assert that \"disclosure of the remaining portion of the audio recording would interfere with a\n   <em>\n    legitimate\n   </em>\n   government activity\" within the meaning of Exemption 7(A). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (emphasis in original).) And they further insist that the circumstances in this case are \"not of a nature warranting an implied assurance of confidentiality\" for Exemption 7(D) purposes.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties here dispute whether the government has properly withheld the requested audio recording and written transcript-in whole or in part-under an applicable FOIA Exemption. As explained below, this Court agrees with DOJ that the audio recording and its transcript satisfy the requirements of Exemption 7(A), and that, as a result, these records are eligible for withholding in their entirety in response to Plaintiffs' FOIA request. But the Court also agrees with Plaintiffs to a certain extent: it concludes that the government's public disclosure of certain transcript excerpts waived Defendant's right to withhold those same excerpted portions of the transcript in the context of this FOIA case. Notably, the government's waiver extends only to the publicly-available portions of the transcript and does not reach the audio-recorded version of those same transcript excerpts, because no portion of the audio recording has ever been released, and the information an audio recording conveys differs from a written transcript. Thus, DOJ can continue to withhold both the non-publicly released parts of the transcribed conversation and the entire audio recording, but the portions of the written transcript that duplicate the information the government previously released must be produced immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The declarations upon which DOJ's motion rests likewise discuss the extent to which disclosure of the entire recording could interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings, and explain that there is a risk that evidence and witness tampering could occur and that the scope and direction of the investigation would be revealed. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Baum Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-35; Bowdich Decl. \u00b6 6.) In addition, although DOJ's motion invokes another FOIA exemption when it asserts the impropriety of disclosing the source's identity (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mem. at 10-12 (discussing Exemption 7(D) ) ), the government's affiants specifically address the harm and interference that revealing the source's identity would cause to the ongoing criminal investigation and process (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Kovakas Decl. \u00b6 8, 11 (explaining that revealing the source's identity would lead to \"possible harm to, or intimidation of,\" the source and other potential witnesses, which would impede their continued cooperation, \"forever eliminate that source as a future means of obtaining information[,]\" and ultimately \"severely hamper law enforcement efforts to detect and apprehend\" the suspects of their investigation) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    This Court also finds no reason to question or doubt the representations that the government and its affiants have made regarding the potential risks and harm, and the only plausible argument that Plaintiffs make in this regard is their contention that, under the circumstances presented here, the records must not be all that sensitive because the government has previously released substantial portions of them to the public. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Opp'n at 2 (\"[N]ow that 'the cat is out of the bag' about the recording, no legitimate government purpose will be served by DOJ continuing to withhold the recording from the public.\" (emphasis omitted) ).) This contention is unavailing as a matter of pure logic: the mere fact that the government has chosen to release some parts of a protected document-and bear the brunt of the harm that results-does not\n    <em>\n     a fortiori\n    </em>\n    mean that releasing the entire document would not be harmful.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ctr. for Nat'l Sec.

What is more, this assertion also plainly contradicts Congress's clear intent with respect to the operation of the FOIA; that is, the government is unquestionably authorized to withhold portions of records at the same time that it is releasing other parts,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abramson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189508\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/615/#p621\">\n     456 U.S. at 626\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189508\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/615/#p621\">\n     102 S.Ct. 2054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that \"it is permissible for an agency to divide the record into parts that are exempt and parts that are not exempt, based on the kind of information contained in the respective parts\"), and to insist, as Plaintiffs do here, that significant releases somehow bear on the question of the extent to which the redacted parts can properly be withheld is also manifestly inconsistent with the text of the FOIA statute,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) (\"Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In sum, there is no dispute that the recording and its transcript were made for law enforcement purposes, and based on the record evidence that the government has presented, this Court finds that there is a reasonable likelihood that disclosure of the entire recording and transcript would interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation into Plaintiffs' activities and the potential criminal liabilities of third parties in a harmful manner.

As a result, the D.C.

Although the transcript excerpts that have been publicly quoted contain words that are identical to the words spoken in the audio version of those same excerpts, DOJ asserts that the voice inflection in the audio version reveals additional information; specifically, the\n    <em>\n     identity\n    </em>\n    of the individual source who created the recording. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mem. at 12 (claiming that disclosure of the \"source's voice and/or its statements\" would likely \"expos[e] [its] identity\").) This information is entitled to be withheld under Exemption 7(A) for the reasons explained above,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    Part III.A, and no part of the audio version of the recorded conversation has ever been publicly disclosed, which means that the government has not waived its right to continue to withhold the information that the audio recording conveys pursuant to Exemption 7(A).\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Davis v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519352,3499688\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/1276/\">\n     968 F.2d 1276\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that the agency must \"release\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    those portions of the tapes that [the plaintiff] can show, through newspaper accounts or other permanent records, were\n    <em>\n     played in the courtroom\n    </em>\n    \" (second emphasis added) ). Put another way, this Court concludes that the additional, distinct information contained in the audio format of the recorded July 26th conversation does not reside in the public domain, and thus, despite the release of corresponding written transcript excerpts, the entire audio recording remains exempt from disclosure.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    It is clear on the instant record that DOJ has provided sufficiently detailed explanations to justify the withholding of information in the disputed records pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A). In light of the government's affidavits, which are entitled to be afforded substantial weight, it is both logical and plausible that the disclosure of the audio recording and the entire written transcript could interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation and, therefore, may be withheld under FOIA Exemption 7(A).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    However, DOJ has waived its right to withhold the portion of the transcript that it has already placed into the public domain via the FCA complaint and press release. Accordingly, and as set forth in the accompanying order, both parties' motions for summary judgment will be\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED IN PART\n    </strong>\n    and\n    <strong>\n     DENIED IN PART\n    </strong>\n    , and this Court will order DOJ to release in response to Plaintiffs' FOIA request those limited portions of the written transcript that duplicate\n    <em>\n     verbatim\n    </em>\n    the quoted information in the FCA complaint and press release.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-54\">\n     The fact that Plaintiffs already have access to the identical information that must be released (through the FCA complaint itself) is of no moment. DOJ argues that \"[g]iven their possession of the civil FCA Complaint and the corresponding press release, Plaintiffs already have the only information subject to waiver\" (Def.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. (\"Def.'s Opp'n\"), ECF No. 15, at 8), and that may, in fact, be so. But that does not relieve the agency of its obligation under the FOIA to release non-exempt material responsive to Plaintiffs' request. In\n     <em>\n      Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v.
