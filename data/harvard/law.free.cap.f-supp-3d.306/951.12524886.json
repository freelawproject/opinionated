Having considered the parties' arguments, the factual record, and the relevant law, the Court finds that Lowe's motion should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Howard, representing herself,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is suing Lowe's to recover damages arising out of two separate disputes: (1) a broken Whirlpool refrigerator and (2) the denial of a prepaid-account discount. The former dispute began when Howard bought a \"GE Whirlpool\" refrigerator from Lowe's in August 2014. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 25, at 3). According to Howard, Lowe's sold, delivered, and installed a defective fridge; its freezer compartment produced excessive \"ice and frost\" that spoiled the food inside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Howard then called Lowe's on December 5, 2014, to ask them to repair the fridge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). They sent a repairperson to Howard's home on January 5, 2015, but he or she could not fix the unit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). According to Howard, Lowe's employees made twelve separate visits to her house to try to fix the fridge, but the fridge continued to malfunction despite the company's considerable efforts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Howard then filed this action against Lowe's, alleging that the broken fridge caused a variety of personal injuries and property damage: Howard lost money on spoiled food; her replacement cooler leaked water, damaging personal property; an unspecified event involving the fridge caused a shoulder injury that limited her ability to work; her elderly mother fell near the fridge and injured her head ; and that Howard experienced mental anguish related to these injuries and losses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Out of the broken fridge arise a number of causes of action. Howard asserts claims for: (1) statutory and common-law products liability, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 8); (2) violations of seller's warranties contained in the Texas Business and Commerce Code and the common law, such as the implied warranty of merchantability, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7, 9); (3) common-law fraudulent misrepresentation, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8); common-law fraud, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11); (4) breach of contract, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12); (5) negligent inspection, advertising, and repair, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13); (6) false advertising violations of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13); (7) violations of the Sherman Act's prohibition against restraints of trade,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 7, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13); and (8) violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"DTPA\"), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The second dispute concerns Lowe's alleged failure to give Howard a five percent discount on a number of purchases made from a prepaid account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17). Howard says that she entered into a prepayment program in which she would deposit money into a Lowe's account and then receive a five percent discount on purchases made with account funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). According to Howard, Lowe's applied the discount to several purchases but not to a number of others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). She\n   alleges damages stemming not only from being overcharged but also from costs associated with the time that she had to spend arguing with Lowe's employees about the discount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From these facts, Howard asserts claims for (1) common-law conversion, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18); (2) \"illegal banking,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18); and (3) violations of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 7, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20). For relief, Howard asks not only for damages but also for an injunction requiring Lowe's to give her a perpetual five percent discount on all of her Lowe's purchases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lowe's filed a motion for summary judgment seeking judgment on all of Howard's claims, (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 48), and Howard filed a response. (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

State-law claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For all of Howard's state-law claims related to the defective refrigerator, Lowe's asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment under Section 82.003 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code (\" Section 82.003\"). (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 48, at 4-6). Section 82.003 provides that for products-liability claims, \"[a] seller that did not manufacture a product is not liable for harm caused to the claimant by that product unless the claimant proves\" one of seven exceptions. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 82.003(a). The statute defines\n   products liability claims according to the substance of the claim, not the form:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Products liability action\" means any action against a manufacturer or seller for recovery of damages arising out of personal injury, death, or property damage allegedly caused by a defective product whether the action is based in strict tort liability, strict products liability, negligence, misrepresentation, breach of express or implied warranty, or any other theory or combination of theories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 82.001(2). In other words, whether Section 82.003 applies to a particular claim depends not on whether the plaintiff labeled it as a products-liability claim, but rather on whether liability arises out of personal injuries or property damage caused by a defective product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hyundai Motor Co. v. Rodriguez ex rel. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663867\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/995/661/#p664\">\n    995 S.W.2d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664 (Tex. 1999) (\"Liability for personal injuries caused by a product's defective design can be imposed under several legal theories, among them negligence, breach of warranty, and strict products liability.\"). Thus, for example, the Fifth Circuit has applied a different provision of Chapter 82\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to \"claims of fraud, conspiracy, and DTPA violation\" because the \"action ar[ose] out of [the plaintiff's] allegedly wrongful death.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff brought a claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability against a company that sold it defective plastic bags.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795690\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/517/#p521\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795690\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/517/#p521\">\n    at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Acknowledging that a claim for breach of implied warranty \"can be either a contract or tort claim,\" the court looked to the plaintiff's damages: \"When the damages are purely economic, the claim sounds in contract....

Ultimately, because the\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's damages \"were [only] for economic loss relating to the final product,\" the court determined that the plaintiff's breach of implied warranty claim was not a products liability action for the purposes of Section 82.003.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8185383\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/257/701/#p704\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 524-25 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mills v.

Tex. 2008) (holding that the plaintiff's \"claims under the UCC and the DTPA for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability [were] not products liability actions under Texas law\" because the plaintiff alleged \"purely economic damages\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, the Court finds that Section 82.003 applies to Howard's refrigerator-related state-law claims against Lowe's. Howard's damages arise either out of personal injuries or property damage. Howard alleges that the defective unit cost her thousands of dollars in lost food. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 25, at 4). Howard alleges that she was forced to buy a leaky replacement cooler, which damaged her home and furniture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She alleges that the refrigerator dislocated her shoulder three times, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5; Howard Dep., Dkt 59, at 91:25-92:4),\n   and that the unit caused \"permanent disability to [her] elderly parent\" by causing her mother to fall and injure herself. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 25, at 5). The lost food and the dislocated shoulder have allegedly cost Howard \"lost profits in [her] construction project and writing projects ... physical injury and permanent disability to [herself] ... physical pain and suffering, mental anguish, and emotional distress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Even the injuries resulting from Lowe's alleged breach of contract are described in terms of personal injury: Howard says Lowe's breach \"caus[ed] all of [her] and her mother[']s resultant physical injuries, their permanent disabilities, and their pain and suffering.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). Although Howard makes some reference to economic damages, she is far from alleging \"purely economic\" damages.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795690\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/517/#p521\">\n    490 S.W.3d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fundamentally, each of her claims arises out of personal injuries and property damage caused by the defective refrigerator. Although she has different theories of liability-that Lowe's warranted that the fridge was of high quality, inducing her to buy it, or that Lowe's negligently advertised the fridge, inducing her to buy it-she is ultimately alleging that Lowe's sold her a defective product, which injured her and cost her money. Her state-law claims, therefore, \"sound in tort,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795690\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/517/#p521\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and are subject to Section 82.003 even if they are not all characterized as products liability claims.\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11582320\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/187/486/#p491\">\n    187 F.3d at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no dispute that Lowe's is a seller for the purposes of Section 82.003, nor is there any dispute that Lowe's did not manufacture the refrigerator. Accordingly, Lowe's is not liable for harm caused to Howard unless she can prove that one of several exceptions apply. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 82.003(a). Because Howard does in fact argue that Lowe's conduct implicates one or more of the exceptions to Section 82.003, (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 58, at 7-9), the Court will now turn to consider the applicability of those exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     (a) Statutory Exceptions to Section 82.003\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 82.003 contains seven exceptions that subject a nonmanufacturing seller to liability when the seller's conduct caused the plaintiff's harm. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 82.003(a)(1)-(7). Lowe's asserts that none of the exceptions apply. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 48, at 6-9). Howard responds that Sections 82.003(a)(2), (3), (5), and (6) apply. (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 58, at 7-9). For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that none of the exceptions apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 82.003(a)(2) applies when \"the seller altered or modified the product and the claimant's harm resulted from that alteration or modification.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 82.003(a)(2). Howard states that \"any of Lowe's handling [of the product]\n   <em>\n    could have made\n   </em>\n   the malfunctions exist.\" (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 58, at 8) (emphasis added). Howard's conjectural phrasing underscores the fact that she cannot trace the refrigerator's defects to any alteration or modification made by Lowe's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Howard speculates that the refrigerator's malfunction \"could only have been caused\" while the unit was in Lowe's possession or control, (Am. Compl., Dkt. 25, at 5), ignoring the possibility that it was defective when Whirlpool delivered it to Lowe's. Indeed, Lowe's denies that it altered or modified the unit. (English Aff., Dkt. 48-1). Not only does Howard have no evidence that Lowe's altered or modified the unit, she does even allege that it did so.

Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 82.003(a)(5) (emphasis added). Second, applying the exception to generic statements would significantly undermine the statute's purpose of insulating nonmanufacturing sellers from liability. If a seller were to become liable simply for\n   telling a customer that a refrigerator is a new unit that works normally, Section 82.003 could be sidestepped on the basis of even the most routine customer service conversations. Here, Howard alleges that a Lowe's employee told her the fridge \"was new,\" that it \"worked normally for normal performance,\" that it \"worked as new,\" and that it would \"make it a reasonable choice\" for household use. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 25, at 7). These are the same sorts of \"general representations\" that another court in this district has rejected.\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4138015\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/3/579/#p585\">\n    3 F.Supp.3d at 584-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like that court, this Court declines to interpret Section 82.003(a)(5)'s exception so broadly as to cast aside Section 82.003's liability shield on the basis of generic statements about a product. Accordingly, none of the alleged representations made by Lowe's to Howard suffice to create a material factual dispute about whether Section 82.003(a)(5) applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Section 82.003(a)(6) applies when the seller \"actually knew of a defect to the product at the time the seller supplied the product[,] and ... the claimant's harm resulted from the defect.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 82.003(a)(6). Howard's argument is that Lowe's had to know this specific unit was defective because Whirlpool had previously been sued regarding other unspecified defects of different units of the same model, and that Lowe's and Whirlpool are so intertwined that Lowe's must have known about the other defective units. (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 58, at 9-10). Even if Howard had submitted evidence to substantiate this claim, it would be insufficient to establish actual knowledge under Section 82.003(a)(6). If supported, Howard's argument would establish, at most, that Lowe's was aware of a risk that the particular unit sold to Howard might be defective.

The MSBA is a commercial contract between Whirlpool and Lowe's that governs general matters such as liability for goods in shipment, invoicing, and warranties. (Agreement, Dkt. 32-1).

Howard has offered no evidence that the MSBA is anticompetitive, nor has she identified any other agreement that might be an illegal restraint of trade.

Discount Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Howard claims that Lowe's failure to give her a five percent discount on a\n   number of purchases constitutes conversion. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 25, at 16 (\"[O]n [78] occasions ... Lowe's refused to apply [my] cash for the contracted-for 5 [percent] discount.\") ). Howard also claims that Lowe's is liable for conversion because Lowe's \"stole ... all/part of each deposit\" made into her prepaid account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To prove a conversion claim under Texas law, a plaintiff must prove that: \"(1) [s]he legally possessed the property or was entitled to it; (2) the defendant wrongfully exercised dominion and control over the property, excluding the plaintiff; (3) the plaintiff demanded the property's return; and (4) the defendant refused.\"\n   <em>\n    Arthur W.

She identifies no property that she possessed or to which she was legally entitled. Instead, she simply alleges that she paid more for Lowe's products than she should have. Because Howard does not-and cannot-identify property to which she was entitled, she fails to state a claim for conversion regarding the denied discount, and Lowe's is entitled to summary judgment on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With respect to Howard's claims of theft, there is no evidence beyond her bare allegations that Lowe's has stolen her money. For example, Howard states that Lowe's \"stole [her] cash from her $5,000 account with them.\" (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 58, at 14). In her deposition, Howard refers vaguely to \"Lowe's stealing cash from my prepaid cash account,\" (Howard dep., Dkt. 59, at 62:8-9), and to \"the other moneys [Lowe's] stole from me,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 125:1), but does not identify the date that a theft took place or the amount stolen. Howard offers no evidence to support her unspecified allegations.

She has not done so, and Lowe's is therefore entitled to summary judgment on her conversion claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, Howard claims that Lowe's prepaid account constitutes \"illegal banking\", (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18), but cites no law that provides her with a cause of action, and the Court can find none.
