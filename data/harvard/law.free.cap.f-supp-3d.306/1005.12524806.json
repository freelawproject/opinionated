These increased payments are set out in two separate ACA provisions, one for Medicare and another for Medicaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The provision that authorizes increased payments for primary care services under Medicare appears in Section 5501 of the PPACA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395l(x) (the \"Medicare Payment Statute\"). The Medicare Payment Statute authorizes enhanced payments to \"primary care practitioners\" for \"primary care services furnished on or after January 1, 2011, and before January 1, 2016....\" It defines the term \"primary care practitioner\" as a physician (1) \"who has a primary specialty designation of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine\" and (2) \"for whom primary care services accounted for at least 60 percent of the allowed charges\" under Medicare during a prior period of time determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The provision that authorizes increased payments for primary care services under\n   Medicaid appears in Section 1202 of the HCERA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(C) (the \"Medicaid Payment Statute\"). Like the Medicare Payment Statute, the Medicaid Payment Statute authorizes enhanced payments to physicians with certain specified \"primary specialty designation[s]\"-essentially the same designations listed in the Medicare Payment Statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But unlike the Medicare Payment Statute, the Medicaid Payment Statute does not require physicians to meet any billing metric in order to qualify for the enhanced payments. In its entirety, the Medicaid Payment Statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A State plan for medical assistance must-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (13) provide-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (C) payment for primary care services (as defined in subsection (jj) ) furnished in 2013 and 2014 by a physician with a primary specialty designation of family medicine, general internal medicine, or pediatric medicine at a rate not less than 100 percent of the payment rate that applies to such services and physician under part B of subchapter XVIII of this chapter (or, if greater, the payment rate that would be applicable under such part if the conversion factor under section 1395w-4(d) of this title for the year involved were the conversion factor under such section for 2009);\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After Congress passed the ACA, CMS, an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, adopted rules to implement the Medicare Payment Statute and the Medicaid Payment Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   CMS promulgated the final rule implementing the Medicare Payment Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20414.80\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), on November 29, 2010 (the \"Final Medicare Payment Rule\").

Notably, the Final Medicare Payment Rule does not define the term \"primary specialty designation\" nor does it establish any criteria for determining whether a physician has one of the specified \"primary specialty designations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   CMS promulgated the final rule implementing the Medicaid Payment Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.400\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), on November 6, 2012 (the \"Final Medicaid Payment Rule\"). The Final Medicaid Payment Rule authorizes enhanced Medicaid payments to a physician with one of the specified \"primary specialty designation[s]\" listed in the Final\n   Medicaid Payment Statute. But, unlike the Final Medicare Payment Rule, the Final Medicaid Payment Rule narrowly defines the term \"primary specialty designation.\" Under the Final Medicaid Payment Rule, a physician is deemed to have one of the specified \"primary specialty designation[s]\" only if she attests that she:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) Is Board certified with such a specialty or subspecialty [of family medicine, general internal medicine or pediatric medicine or a recognized subspecialty] and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) Has furnished evaluation and management services and vaccine administration services under codes described in paragraph (b) of this section that equal at least 60 percent of the Medicaid codes he or she has billed during the most recently completed CY or, for newly eligible physicians, the prior month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.400\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (For ease of reference, the Court will refer to the billing metric in subsection (2) of the Final Medicaid Payment Rule as the \"60% Billing Code Threshold.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   CMS explained that it included the 60% Billing Code Threshold in the definition of \"primary specialty designation\" in part because Congress included a 60 percent allowed-charge threshold requirement in the Medicare Payment Statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   We developed this [60% Billing Code Threshold] proposal for the use of a supporting history of codes billed to qualify physicians for increased payment after review of the statutory requirements for the Medicare Incentive Payments for Primary Care Services payments authorized by section 5501(a) of the Affordable Care Act [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Medicare Payment Statute] .... That provision specifically requires that primary care services account for at least 60 percent of the allowed charges billed by a practitioner for services to be eligible for increased payment. We propose that the same standard be applied to the Medicaid payments under section 1902(a)(13)(C) of the Act [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Medicaid Payment Statute] although we propose that verification would be based on the number of codes billed for the specified primary care services, rather than charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Admin. R., ECF # 21-2 at Pg. ID 305.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   During the notice and comment period for the Final Medicaid Payment Rule, a number of commentators objected that the 60% Billing Code Threshold was contrary to Congress' intent. These commentators highlighted that Congress included a billing metric in the Medicare Payment Statute but did not include such a provision in the Medicaid Payment Statute. The commentators argued that Congress' omission of a billing metric from the Medicaid Payment Statute under these circumstances demonstrated that Congress intended that the enhanced payments under Medicaid would be available regardless of whether physicians met any billing metric.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   CMS was unmoved by these objections. It responded that \"we often use Medicare program standards in developing policy for the Medicaid program, and we believe that it is appropriate to apply the 60 percent threshold applicable to the Medicare primary care incentive payment to the Medicaid payment as well.\" (Admin. R., ECF # 21-10 at Pg. ID 1077-78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Plaintiffs in this action are physicians who practice primary care medicine in Tennessee. Many of the Plaintiffs serve disadvantaged citizens in rural areas, and all of them participate in the Tennessee Medicaid program. The Tennessee Bureau of TennCare (\"TennCare\") administers the Tennessee Medicaid program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In mid-2013, each Plaintiff attested to TennCare that he or she was eligible for the enhanced payments under the Medicaid Payment Statute and the Final Medicaid Payment Rule. Because none of the Plaintiffs are board certified, they attested that they had the required \"primary specialty designation\" based upon their billing histories. More specifically, they reported that 60 percent of their Medicaid claims for the prior year were for billing codes specified in the Final Medicaid Payment Rule. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A to Decl. of Britain Sexton (the \"Sexton Decl.\"), ECF # 25-1 at Pg. ID 1176-77; Ex. B to Sexton Decl., ECF # 25-2 at Pg. ID 1186-87.) In reliance upon Plaintiffs' attestations, TennCare paid Plaintiffs enhanced Medicaid payments for primary care services during 2013 and 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In 2015, TennCare conducted an audit and determined that the Plaintiffs did not qualify for the increased Medicaid payments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The audit found that Plaintiffs had not satisfied the 60% Billing Code Threshold. Therefore, TennCare concluded that Plaintiffs lacked the \"primary specialty designation\" necessary to make them eligible for the enhanced payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) TennCare then sought to recoup the payments made to the Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On October 31, 2016, the Plaintiffs filed this action against the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF # 1; Am. Compl., ECF # 19.) The Plaintiffs allege that the Final Medicaid Payment Rule is invalid and that they were entitled to the enhanced payments for primary care services that they received. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.400\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims focus on the provision of the Final Medicaid Payment Rule that defines \"primary specialty designation\" by reference to whether the physician satisfied the 60% Billing Code Threshold. They contend that this aspect of the rule is \"contrary to the text, purpose, and legislative history of the Medicaid [Payment Statute], harm[ful] [to] the very physicians whom Congress intended to benefit, and [ ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   arbitrary and capricious.\" (Pls.' Memo in Support of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF # 23 at Pg. ID 1123.) Plaintiffs insist that Congress did not intend that a physician would have to satisfy any billing threshold in order to qualify for enhanced payments for primary care services under the Medicaid Payment Statute. Plaintiffs ask the Court to \"hold unlawful and set aside\" the Final Medicaid Payment Rule on the ground that \"it is contrary to [the Medicaid Payment Statute].\" (Am.

Nothing about the term suggests that it is linked to, or depends upon the satisfaction of, a billing metric.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Notably, CMS itself has used the term in this manner-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to mean a physician's self-labeling of her specialty irrespective of her billing history. As early as 2001, CMS required doctors enrolling in Medicare to \"designate\" their primary \"specialty(s)\" in their applications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Supp. Br., ECF # 41 at Pg. ID 1418-19; 2001 CMS 855I Form, ECF # 42-1 at Pg. ID 1446.) And in 2006, CMS again instructed physicians applying to participate in Medicare to \"[d]esignate [their] primary specialty and all secondary specialty(s) [sic].\" (2006 CMS 855I Form, ECF # 42-2 at Pg. ID 1476.) CMS did not suggest on its forms that a physician's \"primary specialty designation\" was tied to whether the physician satisfied any particular billing metrics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For these reasons, Congress' use of the term \"primary specialty designation\" supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to link a physician's entitlement to enhanced payments to her billing history. As explained below, that conclusion becomes inescapable when \"primary specialty\n   designation\" and the Medicaid Payment Statute are construed in their proper context within the ACA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    a\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Congress' use of the term \"primary specialty designation\" in the Medicare Payment Statute confirms that it did not intend that that same term, as used in the Medicaid Payment Statute, would be linked to billing metrics. As noted above, the Medicare Payment Statute provides that \"primary care practitioners\" are eligible for increased Medicare payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395l(x)(2)(A). The Medicare Payment Statute then defines \"primary care practitioner\" as an individual who satisfies two conditions. First, the individual must be \"a physician...who has a\n   <em>\n    primary specialty designation\n   </em>\n   of family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910603\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/551/#p556\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

Congress would not have done so if the term \"primary specialty designation\" already included a consideration of billing metrics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TRW Inc. v.

Thus, the term \"primary specialty designation\" as used in the Medicare Payment Statute is distinct and independent from a billing threshold or metric.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There is no reason to believe that Congress intended this same term to have a different meaning in the Medicaid Payment Statute.

Under that provision, the payment amount was determined in part by the number of patients \"eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under [Medicaid].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569928,3568315\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/176/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569928,3568315\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/176/\">\n    at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To determine the meaning of \"medical assistance\" as used in that phrase, the D.C.

The Sixth Circuit concluded that the term \"medical assistance,\" as used in the Medicare provision under review, had the same meaning as that identical term in a parallel provision of the Medicaid statute because, among other things, the Medicare provision \"specifically refers to the subchapter [of the Medicaid statute] where the definition of medical assistance is found.\"\n   <em>\n    Owensboro Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351121\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/615/\">\n    832 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   623 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569928,3568315\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/176/\">\n    527 F.3d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (construing term \"medical assistance under a State plan approved under [Medicaid]\" in the Medicare statute to have same meaning as the identical term in parallel provision of the Medicaid statute because, among other things, the relevant provision of Medicare statute \"expressly refers to the Medicaid statute\"). As\n   <em>\n    Owensboro\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Adena\n   </em>\n   make clear, Congress' reference to Medicare in the Medicaid Payment Statute is persuasive evidence that Congress intended the term \"primary specialty designation\" in the Medicaid Payment Statute to have the same meaning as that term in the Medicare Payment Statute. And since that term in the Medicare Payment Statute clearly does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   relate to whether a physician has reached any billing metric, the term as used in the Medicaid Payment Statute also does not relate to a physician's billing history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    b\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Defendants counter that the Medicare Payment Statute and the Medicaid Payment Statute should not be interpreted together because they were enacted separately.

In\n   <em>\n    Abraham Lincoln Memorial Hospital\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs contended that a \"hold harmless\" provision in a Medicaid statute should be interpreted to have the same meaning as a \"reasonable cost\" provision in a Medicare statute because the provisions had the same purpose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629572\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/536/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629572\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/536/\">\n    at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the process that produced the ACA, even if complicated, reinforces the interconnectedness of the PPACA and the HCERA. As the Court explained above, (1) the two acts were passed and signed into law within days of each other and (2) the HCERA was specifically passed to\n   <em>\n    amend\n   </em>\n   the PPACA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   connection between the PPACA and the HCERA supports the application of the\n   <em>\n    Prewett\n   </em>\n   canon here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Second, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   did not suggest that the inartful drafting in the ACA somehow freed federal courts from applying ordinary rules of statutory construction-like the\n   <em>\n    Prewett\n   </em>\n   canon-to that Act. On the contrary, in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court attempted to apply an often-significant canon of statutory construction-the canon against construing statutory language as surplusage-and determined that the canon was not controlling because other tools of statutory construction \"compel[led]\" a conclusion at odds with the one suggested by the canon.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590981\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2480/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2492-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast here, the plain language of the Medicaid Payment Statute, its statutory context, and the canons of construction applicable to the provision all support the same conclusion: Congress did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   intend that a physician's eligibility for enhanced payments under Medicaid be linked to her billing history. Because other tools of statutory construction do not compel-nor even suggest-a conclusion at odds with application of the\n   <em>\n    Prewett\n   </em>\n   canon, the Court may properly apply the canon here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, the Defendants argue that the Court should not apply the\n   <em>\n    Prewett\n   </em>\n   canon because the Medicaid Payment Statute and the Medicare Payment Statute \"are not parallel\" and do not contain the same exact language. (Defs.' Memo in Support of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF # 29-1 at Pg. ID 1259.) Defendants stress that the basis for applying the canon \" 'grows weaker with each difference in the formulation of the provisions under inspection,' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    City of Columbus v.

The similarities between the two provisions-such as their use of the term \"primary specialty designation\" and their same purpose-counterbalance the difference in language identified by Defendants and support application of the canon. And in any event, while the difference in language may cause the interpretive force of the canon be \"weaker\" than it may be where the language of the two provisions is identical,\n   <em>\n    Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255416\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/424/#p435\">\n    536 U.S. at 435-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255416\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/424/#p435\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the difference is not an absolute bar to application of the canon. So, while the\n   <em>\n    Prewett\n   </em>\n   canon may not \"virtually command\" the inference that Congress intended the Medicaid Payment Statute and the Medicare Payment Statute to have different meanings,\n   <em>\n    Prewett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065447\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/454/#p461\">\n    749 F.3d at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the canon nonetheless provides additional support for that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In sum, all of the tools of statutory construction relevant here-analysis of the plain language of the Medicaid Payment Statute, a review of the Medicaid Payment Statute as it relates to the parallel Medicare Payment Statute, and application of the\n   <em>\n    Prewett\n   </em>\n   canon-considered collectively, yield the conclusion that Congress did not intend to link a physician's eligibility for enhanced Medicaid payments for primary care services to her billing history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants resist this conclusion. But in doing so, they do not point to any language in the Medicaid Payment Statute that suggests that Congress\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   intend to link eligibility for the enhanced payments to a physician's billing history. Nor do Defendants explain how applying other rules of statutory construction could support that conclusion. Instead, Defendants argue that the Medicaid Payment Statute \"says absolutely nothing about\" how to determine whether a physician has one of the three specified \"primary specialty designations\" that would qualify her for the enhanced payments. (Defs.' Memo in Support of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF # 29-1 at Pg. ID 1254.) Thus, Defendants assert, \"CMS had to formulate some standard\" for determining whether physicians were eligible for the increased payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 1255.) And they insist that the 60% Billing Code Threshold was a reasonable standard that appropriately accounted for CMS' need to audit attestations by physicians that they had a qualifying \"primary specialty designation.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065447\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/454/#p461\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 1263-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   But Congress\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   say something about whether a physician's eligibility for enhanced Medicaid payments for primary care services should be linked to the physician's billing history. Indeed, as explained above, by using the term \"primary specialty designation\" and by omitting a billing metric from the Medicaid Payment Statute, Congress expressed its clear intent that the enhanced Medicaid payments would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be linked to a physician's billing history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Simply put, the 60% Billing Code Threshold cannot be justified on the ground that Congress' failure to specifically define \"primary specialty designation\" left some room for CMS to interpret that phrase and to establish eligibility standards for enhanced payments under the Medicaid Payment Statute. While Congress did not specifically identify what CMS\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   consider when it determined whether a physician has a qualifying \"primary specialty designation,\" Congress did make clear what CMS could\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   consider in making that determination-a physician's billing history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Moreover, Defendants' contention that CMS had to \"formulate some standard\" for assessing whether a physician has a \"primary specialty designation\" is inconsistent with CMS' own practices. CMS did not formulate any standard for \"primary specialty designation\" in the Final Medicare Payment Rule. CMS' contention that it had to define this same term in the Final Medicaid Payment Rule thus rings hollow. Likewise, Defendants' contention that CMS included the 60% Billing Code Threshold in the definition of \"primary specialty designation\" because it needed to establish a \"uniform, auditable standard[ ] for identifying eligible physicians,\" (Defs.' Memo in Support of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF # 29-1 at Pg. ID 1245), is equally unpersuasive. CMS did not establish a mechanism to audit a physician's self-attested \"primary specialty designation\" in the Final Medicare Payment Rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For all of the reasons explained above, the 60% Billing Code Threshold in the Final Medicaid Payment Rule is contrary to Congress' intent, fails at step one of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , and is invalid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The final question before the Court is: what is the proper remedy that flows from the Court's determination that the 60% Billing Code Threshold in the Final Medicaid Payment Rule is invalid? Stated another way: should the Court void the entire rule, or may it affirm the provision of the rule tying \"primary specialty designation\" to a physician's board certification? The Court determines that it must invalidate the rule in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \"Whether an administrative agency's order or regulation is severable, permitting a court to affirm it in part and reverse it in part, depends on the issuing agency's intent.
