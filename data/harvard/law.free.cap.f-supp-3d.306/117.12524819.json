The District of Columbia then renewed Shume's certificate three times. However, in 2015, Defendants Pearson Education Inc. and NCS Pearson, Inc. (together, \"Pearson\")-which contract to provide testing services for the District of Columbia-informed Shume that her renewal application would be denied, explaining that she did not meet the qualifications for a Nurse Aide Certificate and had to take an examination to renew hers. On November 30, 2015, Shume's certificate expired.

Those claims will be dismissed without prejudice to Shume's ability to request\n   any relief to which she may be entitled at the appropriate time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Breach of Contract (Count I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The elements of a breach of contract claim under District of Columbia law are: \"(1) a valid contract between the parties; (2) an obligation or duty arising out of the contract; (3) a breach of that duty; and (4) damages caused by breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Tsintolas Realty Co. v.

Defendants contest the first element, whether the parties entered into a valid contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pearson Br. at 6-9; D.C. Br. at 5-7. The Court agrees with Defendants that Shume has not plausibly alleged the existence of a binding contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shume argues that the form application she received was an offer to enter into a unilateral contract, which she accepted by completing and submitting the form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 8-12. Specifically, she alleges that the following language constituted an offer: \"Once Pearson ... receives your form and fee, they will renew your certificate and send you a new certificate and wallet card.\" ECF No. 15-3.

The Federal Circuit disagreed, for four reasons. First, it noted that the description of \"the expedite procedure as a 'request' ... belies any obligatory intent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089214\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1324/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089214\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1324/\">\n    at 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, it relied on cases holding that an \"obligation of the government, if it is to be held liable, must be stated in the form of an undertaking, not as a mere prediction or statement of opinion or intention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089214\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1324/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cutler-Hammer, Inc. v.

In contrast, the purported promise in\n   <em>\n    Chattler\n   </em>\n   -that the requests \"\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   be processed in three workdays\"-merely restated the content of the relevant regulations and did not use the language of obligation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1331 (emphasis added). Third, the court determined that acceptance of the offer \"would not necessarily conclude the bargain,\" because the regulations empowered the government to deny the request \"under certain\n   conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Federal Circuit found it implausible that a government contract could be formed from two sentences in an application form, \"a far cry from the comprehensive instruments that typify [federal] government contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For similar reasons, the Court concludes that the language relied on by Shume could not plausibly constitute an offer in this context. A license application is generally understood as a request for government action, not a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re U.S. OPM Data Sec.

Consistent with that understanding, the language at issue here-that Pearson \"will renew your certificate\"-merely described the renewal process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chattler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089214\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1324/\">\n    632 F.3d at 1330-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The application employed the language of prediction (\"will\"), not of obligation (\"shall\"). And as in\n   <em>\n    Chattler\n   </em>\n   , the fact that the application left certain conditions unsaid-here, the requirement that the applicant must be otherwise qualified for a Nurse Aide Certificate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203-1205.10\">\n    D.C.

Compl. \u00b6 38(e). As Defendants point out, \"estoppel\" in this sense is not an independent basis for relief, but merely an equitable means of holding a party to a prior representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ATC Petrol., Inc. v.

Cir. 1988). Therefore, any such \"claim\" must be dismissed insofar as it purports to be an independent cause of action. Moreover, this sort of estoppel is available against the government only where its agents have lied or engaged in other egregious conduct, none of which is alleged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris Commc'ns, Inc. v.

Am. Compl. \u00b6 35. The requirements for mandamus are demanding: \"To show entitlement to mandamus, plaintiffs must demonstrate (1) a clear and indisputable right to relief, (2) that the government agency or official is violating a clear duty to act, and (3) that no adequate alternative remedy exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Even where those threshold jurisdictional requirements are met, whether to grant relief remains in the Court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310049,4086863\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/183/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Shume plainly has not met even the first prong of the jurisdictional test.
