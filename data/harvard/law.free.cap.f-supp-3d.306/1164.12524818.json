FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ticketmaster sells tickets for live entertainment events on behalf of its clients through its website, mobile app, and telephone call centers. (Compl. \u00b6 18.) Demand often exceeds the supply of tickets available through Ticketmaster, which can result in intense competition among consumers to purchase tickets for events the moment they are available for sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) In order to make the ticket-buying process fair and equitable for its consumers, Ticketmaster employs various countermeasures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) For instance, Ticketmaster limits the number of tickets that may be purchased in a single transaction and regulates the speed with which users may refresh purchase requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ticketmaster also utilizes various security measures like CAPTCHA to prevent and discourage the use of automated programs-called \"bots\"-that give an unfair advantage over other consumers in the ticket purchasing process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Users must agree to Ticketmaster's Terms of Use (\"TOU\") before they can view and use Ticketmaster's website and mobile app. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-27;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. A.) The TOU grants users a \"limited, conditional, no-cost, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable license to view [Ticketmaster's] Site and its Content to purchase tickets as permitted by these Terms for non-commercial purposes only if\" the user agrees not to conduct certain activities. (Compl. \u00b6 30.) Those prohibited activities include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Modify, adapt, sub-license, translate, sell, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any portion of the Site ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Use any robot, spider, offline reader, site search/retrieval application or other manual or automatic device, tool, or process to retrieve, index, data mine or in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Content or the Site, including with respect to any CAPTCHA displayed on the Site ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Use any automated software or computer system to search for, reserve, buy or otherwise obtain tickets ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Take any action that imposes or may impose (in [Ticketmaster's] sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Access, reload or refresh transactional event or ticketing pages, or make any other request to transactional servers, more than once during any three-second interval;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any 24-hour period, whether alone or with a group of individuals;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Reproduce, modify, display, publicly perform, distribute or create derivative works of the Site or the Content;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Reproduce or scan tickets in a format or medium different from that provided by the Site;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Decode, decrypt, modify, or reverse engineer any tickets ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Use the Site or the Content in an attempt to, or in conjunction with, any device, program or service designed to circumvent any technological measure that effectively controls access to ... the Site and/or Content ... for any purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The TOU further states that non-compliance with the TOU \"constitutes unauthorized reproduction, display, or creation of unauthorized derivative versions of the Site and Content, and infringes [Ticketmaster's] copyright, trademarks, patents and other rights in the Site and Content.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Ticketmaster has registered copyrights in various aspects of its website and pending applications for copyrights in its mobile apps. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Arts%20%26%20Cult.%20Aff.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2025.01\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Arts%20%26%20Cult.%20Aff.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2025.01\">\n    \u00b6 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Users are also required to agree to a \"Code of Conduct\" in the TOU and abide by purchasing limits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For the past two years, Defendants have been using bots and dummy accounts to navigate Ticketmaster's website and mobile app to purchase large quantities of tickets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-42.) Defendants used colocation facilities with high speed bandwidth, random number and letter generators, and other evasive methods in order to avoid detection by Ticketmaster. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 48, 51-54.) Through the use of bots, Defendants are able to purchase and reserve large amounts of tickets in a manner impossible for a human consumer to match. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 46.) Defendants would then reproduce and resell the tickets on third-party platforms, such as StubHub.com, for profit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49.) Ticketmaster\n   estimates that over the period from January 2015 to September 2016, Defendants made at least 313,528 orders using 9,047 different accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In May 2015, Ticketmaster sent Lombardi, who is affiliated with Prestige, a cease-and-desist letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. E.) Lombardi acknowledged receipt of the letter, but Defendants continued their enterprise. (Compl. \u00b6 57.) Ticketmaster estimates that, for certain shows, Defendants bought between 30-40% of Ticketmaster's available inventory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ticketmaster alleges that Defendants' conduct has deprived them of revenue and revenue opportunities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) Defendants' use of bots have also required Ticketmaster to divert resources from servicing of other consumers and to continually escalate its anti-bot security measures, costing Ticketmaster thousands of dollars in damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A motion to dismiss under either Rule 12(c) or 12(b)(6) is proper where the plaintiff fails to allege a cognizable legal theory or where there is an absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Among those copyrights are Ticketmaster's website ticket purchase pages and its mobile apps. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 28.) Ticketmaster also alleges that, by navigating the pages to purchase tickets, Defendants have viewed and therefore copied the entirety of thousands of pages from the Ticketmaster website and mobile apps.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. 27 (citing\n    <em>\n     Ticketmaster, LLC v. RMG Techs., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203084480\">\n     2007 WL 3084480\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (C.D. Cal. June 25, 2007) ).) Defendants contend that the large discrepancy between the current rate and the 2007 rate demonstrates that the liquidated damages provisions are not reasonably calculated. But the fact that the rate differs is not dispositive-liquidated damages provisions are permitted\n    <em>\n     because\n    </em>\n    damages are difficult to calculate. Furthermore, the fact that the current rate is now 40 times lower than the previous amount suggests that Ticketmaster made an effort to make the provision reasonable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
