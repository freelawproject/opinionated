They also allege that the Board's refusal violated their procedural due process rights by depriving them of their property interest in the concealed carry permits for which they applied. Doc. 67 at 7-15. Plaintiffs further allege that the Board violated the Equal Protection Clause by arbitrarily treating them differently from other Sheriff's Deputies who received IROCC certification. Doc. 54 at \u00b6\u00b6 235-240. Finally, Cook County Plaintiffs allege that the Board and Dart conspired to deprive them of their federal rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 241-254.

Doc. 58 at 5; Doc. 63 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendants' jurisdictional argument is of no moment. Plaintiffs' federal equal protection and procedural due process claims indisputably arise under \u00a7 1331, so even if their LEOSA claim were a state law claim, the court could entertain it under the supplemental jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The LEOSA claim is a federal claim in any event. Plaintiffs allege not that they meet the definition of \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" under Illinois law, but rather that the Board's refusal to certify them as qualified retired law enforcement officers for a concealed carry permit-whether or not correct as a matter of Illinois law-violates LEOSA. Doc. 54 at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. A claim that a defendant violated a plaintiff's federal rights gives rise to federal question jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp. v.

LEOSA Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The gist of Plaintiffs' LEOSA claim is that the Board (Dart can be ignored for present purposes) has adopted a narrower definition of \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" than has LEOSA, thereby depriving Plaintiffs of the \"right to carry concealed firearms\" that LEOSA guarantees them. Doc. 54 at \u00b6\u00b6 70-72. LEOSA defines \"qualified retired law enforcement officer,\" in relevant part, as \"an individual who ... was authorized by law to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of,\n   <em>\n    or the incarceration of any person for\n   </em>\n   , any violation of law....\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926C(c)(2) (emphasis added). The emphasized language includes those individuals, like Plaintiffs, who served in corrections. The definition of \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" under Illinois law is narrower; as noted above, it incorporates Illinois's definition of \"law enforcement officer,\" which in turn means \"any police officer of a governmental agency who is primarily responsible for prevention or detection of crime and the enforcement of a criminal code or traffic or highway laws of any state or any political subdivision.\" 20 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 1720.220. Unlike the federal definition, the Illinois definition does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include officers who worked in a correctional environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   That is precisely the ground on which the Board rested its denial of Plaintiffs' IROCC applications-Plaintiffs worked as Sheriff's Deputies in corrections, not in any of the capacities referenced by the Illinois definition. Plaintiffs allege that the Board's exclusion of them from the IROCC program violated their LEOSA right to a concealed carry permit because, regardless of what Illinois law might say, they are \"qualified retired law enforcement officers\" under LEOSA. And they seek to use \u00a7 1983 as the vehicle to enforce what they believe to be their LEOSA rights.

The question here is whether LEOSA satisfies those three conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   LEOSA states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of the law of any State or any political subdivision thereof, an individual who is a qualified retired law enforcement officer\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   who is carrying the identification required by subsection (d) may carry a concealed firearm that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926C(a) (emphasis added). Thus, LEOSA grants a person concealed carry rights only if that person (1) is a \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" as defined by LEOSA\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) \"is carrying the identification required by subsection (d).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Therein lays the flaw in Plaintiffs' LEOSA claim. LEOSA does not give concealed carry rights to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   individual who satisfies its definition of \"qualified retired law enforcement officer.\" Rather, LEOSA gives such rights to a \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if that individual has \"the identification required by subsection (d).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275620\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/815/#p820\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 926C(a). Subsection (d), in turn, states that \"the identification\" is \"a photographic identification\n   <em>\n    issued by the agency from which the individual separated from service as a law enforcement officer\n   </em>\n   that identifies the person as having been employed as a police officer or law enforcement officer\" and that certifies that the individual recently had the requisite firearms training.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275620\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/815/#p820\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 926C(d) (emphasis added). Under LEOSA, then, if a retired officer does not have an identification issued by the officer's former agency, then the officer has no concealed carry rights under LEOSA, even if she is a \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" under LEOSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This has implications for whether Plaintiffs may enforce under \u00a7 1983 what they believe to be their LEOSA rights. Recall the first\n   <em>\n    Blessing\n   </em>\n   requirement, that \"Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651863\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/329/#p340\">\n    520 U.S. at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651863\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/329/#p340\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As shown above, LEOSA's text defeats that reading, as the statute provides concealed carry rights to any individual \"who is a qualified retired law enforcement officer\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   who is carrying the identification required by subsection (d).\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926C(a) (emphasis added). There is no textual basis for treating \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" as the sole requirement for obtaining LEOSA rights; rather, such an individual also must have a subsection (d) identification. Both criteria are necessary, not sufficient, conditions for coverage under LEOSA, and only individuals who satisfy both may enforce their statutory rights under \u00a7 1983. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    DuBerry\n   </em>\n   , which concerned a challenge to the District of Columbia's concealed carry program, did not have to squarely address\n   <em>\n    Printz\n   </em>\n   because the District is not a State and therefore is not protected from federal encroachment by the Tenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310354,4321589\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1046/\">\n    824 F.3d at 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   One might ask whether the court's holding renders LEOSA a dead letter. Not at all. LEOSA enables retired law enforcement officers who qualify for concealed carry permits in States where they worked to carry their weapons in any State, regardless of whether the officer would be entitled to a permit in that State. The statutory text, particularly given the placement of \"any\" before \"State,\" is clear on this point: Once a \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" obtains \"the identification required by subsection (d)\" from the agency where she used to work, she has satisfied LEOSA's two requirements and, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of the law of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   State or any political subdivision thereof ..., may carry a concealed\n   firearm.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926C(a) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205472604\">\n    2014 WL 5472604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"Rather than affirmatively requiring states to issue concealed carry licenses to retired police officers, LEOSA merely permits retired officers who already possess a concealed-carry permit to bring a concealed firearm across state lines.\"). That right was especially meaningful at the time LEOSA was enacted in 2004, when seventeen States still completely prohibited concealed carry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DuBerry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310354,4321589\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1046/\">\n    824 F.3d at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Conspiracy Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As noted, Cook County Plaintiffs claim that the Board and Dart conspired to deprive them of their federal rights. Doc. 54 at \u00b6\u00b6 241-254. Because Cook County Plaintiffs have no viable LEOSA, due process, or equal protection claim, their conspiracy\n   claim fails as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Plaintiffs' claims are dismissed, and because the flaws in their claims cannot be cured with repleading, the dismissal is with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tribble v.
