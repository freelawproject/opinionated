They bring this action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20500\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   (2012). They allege that DoD, the U.S. Navy, and the Director of the Office of Military Commissions and Convening Authority have failed to investigate adequately environmental hazards, including airborne formaldehyde and other carcinogens, present at Camp Justice, where Plaintiffs are assigned to work and in some cases sleep while at Guantanamo Bay. They further allege that Navy's investigation\n   into these alleged hazards was incomplete and flawed, rendering arbitrary and capricious DoD's conclusions that Plaintiffs can continue safely to live and work at Camp Justice. Plaintiffs ask the Court to require further investigation of the alleged hazard mitigation, as well as alternative living and working facilities until that is done, for which they seek a preliminary injunction until this litigation concludes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because the issuance of a Final Report, which is now public, renders Plaintiffs' complaint of unreasonable delay moot, the Court will dismiss Counts Two and Three. However, because Defendants' orders that Plaintiffs live and work in the allegedly contaminated areas are final actions subject to review under the APA, the Court will deny Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count One. Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction will be denied because Plaintiffs have not adequately demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits or that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is not granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Camp Justice and Potential Environmental Hazards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Camp Justice is a complex at NSGB that was built in 2007 on the site of a former airfield. It serves as the location of the Office of Military Commissions Office of the Convening Authority (OMC).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19 [Dkt. 1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Within Camp Justice is a fenced area called the Expeditionary Legal Complex (ELC) which includes a Secure Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), at which most of the intensive work of the OMC occurs due to the classified nature of the underlying information. The ELC is comprised of several structures: a sheet metal structure (ELC-1) that contains a courtroom and office areas; three trailers (ELC-3, ELC-4, ELC-5) that function as office spaces; and three CONEX shipping containers (ELC-8, ELC-9, ELC-10).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 17, Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Indoor Air Quality Assessment Report [Dkt. 4-19] at 1-4. Camp Justice includes three additional workspaces outside the ELC: Buildings AV-29 and AV-34, which are fixed structures, and AV-32, a former hangar.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20500\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20500\">\n    at 1-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[Dkt. 30] at 18 (testimony of Major Seeger regarding structures of ELC). Plaintiffs also have dedicated office space in AV-34, outside the ELC, but that is a less convenient space, and Plaintiffs use it less frequently than spaces within the ELC, because classified documentation cannot be taken outside the SCIF.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Personnel housing units under OMC's direct control within Camp Justice are primarily located in Containerized Housing Units, also known as CHUs or \"Cuzcos.\" Fifty of the Cuzcos provide housing; they are air-conditioned trailers, each with two single bedrooms and a shared bathroom, comprising 100 beds total. OMC can also house personnel in 360 beds in air-conditioned tents with plywood floors. Of these, 60 beds are in \"improved\" tents with partitions and the other 300 are cots rather\n   than beds. Both the Cuzcos and the tents are located on what used to be an aircraft runway called McCalla Field, made of asphalt. OMC also rents four nearby transient-housing townhomes from the NSGB Commanding Officer, two each for prosecution and defense trial teams (predominately used during trial). Other convenient on-base housing options include 202 beds managed by Navy Gateway Inns &amp; Suites (NGIS), as well rooms at the Navy Lodge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n to Pls.' Appl. for a Prelim. Inj. and Mot. to Dismiss (Mot. to Dismiss) [Dkt. 10] at 8-10 (describing the on-base housing options). While some Plaintiffs have stayed in these facilities during work trips, availability is not guaranteed and demand can sometimes outstrip capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition, OMC can use 53 beds, to the extent they are available, in Building AV-624, a permanent structure on the opposite, or leeward, side of Guantanamo Bay, that is, the physical water inlet for which the Naval Station is named, from the ELC. Transportation to AV-624 is relatively inconvenient, because access is by ferry only and takes approximately 25 minutes. Plaintiffs argue that their ability to work would be severely hindered if they were forced to stay on the leeward side of the bay, in particular because much of their work must be done in or near the SCIF, and ferry service is limited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PI Tr. at 32 (Plaintiffs' counsel arguing that \"[i]t's not the New York Subway.

Although the lead counsel representing detainees who are charged with capital crimes are considered contractors, they are exempt from the requirement that they stay in the Cuzcos or tents, under an exception in the policy that permits members of prosecution and defense trial teams to stay in the four townhouses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Other limited exceptions have been made on a case-by-case basis and \"in an ad hoc manner based upon requests,\" including requests from the Military Commissions Defense Organization for trial team members to stay in other NSGB housing when available.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Members of trial teams who are also enlisted military are not eligible for these exceptions. In practice, Ms. Bormann, Mr. Schwartz, and Mr. Perry have stayed in preferred \"hard housing,\" such as the Navy Lodge, for all or most of their trips to NSGB since 2014; Major Seeger, as an Army officer, is always required to stay in the Cuzcos. PI Tr. at 44-47. To receive a housing assignment, the prospective traveler submits a request to OMC, which then assigns housing based on the request, availability, and other demands. Plaintiffs allege that the Navy \"assigns a lower priority to providing hard housing to military commissions personnel than to other individuals residing at the Naval Station, such as base contractors, visitors, and other temporary personnel.\" Compl. at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the heart of their case, Plaintiffs complain that Camp Justice is contaminated with cancer-causing and otherwise hazardous chemicals and other materials including formaldehyde, benzo(a)pyrene, asbestos, lead-based paint, and mold. During a discovery teleconference on June 23, 2017, Plaintiffs' attorneys indicated that\n   the primary hazard at issue is airborne formaldehyde, which allegedly leaches out of materials in modular units at Camp Justice.

PI, Ex. 16, NMCPHC, Public Health Report for Camp Justice (Aug. 21, 2015) [Dkt. 4-18] at 4. While the Navy did not find any immediate health risks, it did determine that there were \"data gaps,\" particularly related to exposure to carcinogens, which did not render the buildings uninhabitable but did warrant further environmental sampling and analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center (NMCPHC) continued to investigate.

In response, Defendants argue that these remaining stages are only broad categories of requirements that are inherently discretionary. Defendants contend that they have already conducted the analyses they believe to be sufficient, and that the Final Report establishes the adequacy of the remediation that has been implemented. They also argue that no additional \"controls\" need be developed or implemented because no further \"unacceptable risks were found.\" Reply at 4. According to DoD, the results of its investigation and analysis have already been documented in the Final Report, and DoD has supplied additional expert declarations in this litigation to support its determinations that further mitigation is not necessary to protect those who live and work at Camp Justice from an unacceptable risk of environmental harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss, Exs. 1-5 (expert declarations) [Dkts. 10-1-10-5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument does not overcome the fact that the actions sought in their Complaint have been undertaken and, to the extent demanded, completed.

Plaintiffs respond that Defendants failed to raise this defense in their Motion to Dismiss and that the Court should not consider it now. Plaintiffs are correct that the question of agency discretion is an affirmative defense that does not go to the Court's jurisdiction, but they do not cite any authority for the suggestion that Defendants' failure to raise the issue in their Motion to Dismiss precludes the Court from determining whether the claims are reviewable and as to which Plaintiffs have had a full opportunity to object. Indeed, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(1), failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is not a defense that can be waived if a party fails to include it in a responsive pleading or other papers filed with the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Plaintiffs are appointed counsel and DoD employees who are required, by virtue of their appointments, to live and work at times on an operating base. Only Major Seeger is in the military forces. Certainly, the Navy retains discretion to manage NSGB, but DoD does not connect its operational mission to Camp Justice or to Plaintiffs' allegations of serious environmental hazards, which, at this point, the Court assumes are true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants also argue that the challenged actions are \"committed to agency discretion\" by law because there are no judicially manageable standards by which to judge them.

For purposes of determining whether Plaintiffs have challenged \"final agency actions,\" the Court interprets these passages collectively as a challenge to two categories of agency action: (1) DoD's assignment of Plaintiffs to live and work in contaminated areas at Camp Justice during work trips, and (2) DoD's \"determination\" that Camp Justice safe and habitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    i.
