Because Shine's statements during the first interrogation are essentially duplicative of later statements and, as the government acknowledges, are not needed for its case, the court presumes for its analysis that Shine was in custody during that interrogation under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), and that those statements should be suppressed. Nevertheless, relying principally on\n   <em>\n    Missouri v.

Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Shine is charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). He filed a motion to suppress asserting several Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims. After holding an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge entered a recommendation that the motion should be denied in its entirety. Shine filed an objection challenging, among other things, the magistrate judge's conclusions (1) that he was not in custody during the first interrogation and thus not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings,\n   and (2) that\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   does not require the suppression of his statements at the second interrogation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court conducted a completely new evidentiary hearing. As a result, the court is not bound by the magistrate judge's factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II. Factual Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court's factual findings, which are based on video and audio recordings from dashboard and body cameras as well as witness testimony at the evidentiary hearing, are as follows. Officers S.K. Pendley and T.J. Ritchie stopped Shine's truck, based on two alleged turn-signal violations and what the officers believed-apparently reasonably but mistakenly-was an expired tag. Officer Pendley approached the passenger-side window of the truck and asked Shine whether he had a license and proof of registration. As Shine opened the truck's center console to search for registration documents, Pendley saw a digital scale in the console. Officer Ritchie then approached the truck on the driver's side and smelled marijuana from its open windows. Ritchie took over the questioning and asked Shine about the ostensibly expired registration. Pendley then told Ritchie that he had seen a digital scale in the console.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on the smell of marijuana and the digital scale, Ritchie began to suspect that Shine was involved in the distribution of narcotics, so he asked Shine if there was anything on him 'that [he] should know about.' He ordered Shine to exit his truck and place his hands on the windshield. Ritchie then questioned Shine about the digital scale and ordered him to place his arms behind his back. At that point, Ritchie stated, \"Right now, you are not under arrest; you are just being detained, okay?\" He then handcuffed Shine, asked for consent to search Shine's pockets, and ordered him to spread his feet. After searching Shine's pockets, Ritchie again questioned him about the digital scale-specifically whether it was \"drug paraphernalia.\" Ritchie repeated the question, and then ordered Shine to step away from his truck and sit on the hood of the patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ritchie began to search Shine's truck, where he discovered a black handgun underneath the driver's seat. He then stepped back to his patrol car and asked Shine whether he had a weapon's permit. Shine admitted he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At this point, Shine was still sitting handcuffed on the patrol car hood, with the car's windshield to his back; Officer Pendley stood diagonally to his right approximately a few feet away, and Officer Ritchie stood diagonally to his left at a similar distance. Apparently upset by the fact that Shine had not told him about the handgun in his truck, Ritchie raised his voice and lectured Shine about the importance of responding truthfully to his questions. Ritchie then asked Shine whether he is a convicted felon, whether he is involved in gangs, and whether he sells illegal drugs. Shine admitted to being a convicted felon, but denied the other allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ritchie then went back to Shine's vehicle to continue searching, and found a razor blade and white powder residue on the digital scale. After the search, Ritchie walked back to the patrol car to speak with Pendley, and ordered Shine to \"stay right there\" on the hood of the car. Ritchie then returned to the hood of the patrol car and resumed interrogating Shine, this time employing a different tactic: \"It's all about\n   respect. You've shown me respect. I've shown you respect, alright? That's the name of the game, I get that. No matter what you do, it's about respect.\" Ritchie asked Shine where he bought the gun and where he was going, and questioned him repeatedly about the razor blade, scale, and whether he uses and sells drugs. Shine eventually admitted to using, but not selling, cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After a few minutes of such questioning, Ritchie moved Shine from the hood to the inside of the patrol car, and, standing with the door ajar, asked Shine repeatedly over the next minute and a half about where Shine buys drugs. After Shine did not respond, Ritchie stated: \"You've gotta give me something man. This drug paraphernalia, that's another charge. Now if you don't want to talk you don't have to talk, I'm just trying to establish a rapport with you.\" Ritchie added that Shine was \"not under arrest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In sum, in relation to the present charges, Shine admitted that he did not have a permit for the gun in the car and that he was a convicted felon. At no point during the above interactions, which lasted about 13 minutes from Shine's handcuffing to the end of Ritchie's questioning, did Officer Ritchie or Pendley administer\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After formally arresting Shine at the conclusion of the traffic stop, the officers took him to the Montgomery Police Department, where Agent Jeffrey Ioimo of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms provided\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and questioned Shine. During this second interrogation, Shine admitted that he owned the handgun found in his vehicle and that he was a convicted felon. He was later charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   District courts review de novo any part of a magistrate judge's report and recommendation to which a party has properly objected. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3). \"[T]he district judge may accept, reject, or modify the recommended disposition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A district court may serve as a factfinder and overturn a magistrate judge's factual findings when it conducts a new evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cofield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952846\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/1303/\">\n    272 F.3d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2001) (district court required to hold a new evidentiary hearing to overturn findings based on credibility) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Raddatz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188607\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/667/\">\n    447 U.S. 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188607\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/667/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188607\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/667/\">\n    65 L.Ed.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   IV. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At issue are two sets of statements: those Shine made during his non-\n   <em>\n    Mirand\n   </em>\n   ized first interrogation during the traffic stop, and those he made during his\n   <em>\n    Mirand\n   </em>\n   ized second interrogation at the police station. As mentioned above and as relevant to this case, during the first interrogation Shine admitted that he was a convicted felon and that he did not have a permit for the gun found in his truck. In the second interrogation, he admitted that he was a convicted felon and that he owned the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At oral argument, the court asked the parties whether suppressing the first-interrogation statements without suppressing the second-interrogation statements could affect the outcome of the case. The government conceded, and the court agrees, that evidence from the first interrogation is essentially cumulative, and therefore not necessary for the government's case. However, Shine's\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   claim as to the second set of statements may affect the viability of the government's case, and that claim depends upon the existence of a prior, non-\n   <em>\n    Mirand\n   </em>\n   ized\n   custodial statement. Because the court finds that the second set of statements should not be suppressed, it will presume without reaching the issue that Shine was in custody during the first interrogation, for the purpose of its\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   analysis. Nonetheless, in order to provide clarity for future analyses, the court now addresses what it finds to be certain legal errors in the recommendation's analysis of the custody issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Legal Errors in the Recommendation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The magistrate judge's recommendation correctly cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Street\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n    472 F.3d 1298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2006) for determining whether Shine was 'in custody' while handcuffed and questioned during the traffic stop. R&amp;R (doc. no. 55), at 25-26. \"[A] person is in 'custody' for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   purposes only when there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Street\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n    472 F.3d at 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under\n   <em>\n    Street\n   </em>\n   , whether there has been a \"restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest\" is determined by considering the \"totality of the circumstances,\" \"including whether the officers brandished weapons, touched the suspect, or used language or a tone that indicated that compliance with the officers could be compelled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n    at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, the recommendation's application of\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Street\n   </em>\n   test erred in two respects. First, the recommendation grafted onto the\n   <em>\n    Street\n   </em>\n   test-perhaps even substituting as the ultimate inquiry\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -an additional requirement that, in order to be in custody, \"a reasonable person in defendant's position would ... have believed that he or she was utterly at the mercy of the police, away from the protection of any public scrutiny, and had better confess or else.\" R&amp;R (doc. no. 55) at 29 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Second, in addressing the significance of Shine's handcuffing, the recommendation improperly conflated the Fourth Amendment 'arrest' inquiry with the Fifth Amendment issue of whether Shine was 'in custody,' which had the effect of minimizing the handcuffing's importance under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   1.

In analyzing Shine's handcuffing, the recommendation focuses on whether Officer Ritchie, under the Fourth Amendment, had the authority to handcuff Shine for a purpose other than arresting him. After laying out possible bases for Ritchie to believe that Shine posed a danger, the recommendation concludes: \"[T]he court finds that Ritchie\n   had an articulable and reasonable belief that handcuffs were reasonably needed to preserve the status quo and for officer safety. Therefore, Ritchie's use of handcuffs does not give rise to a conclusion that defendant's freedom of action was curtailed to a degree associated with formal arrest.\" R &amp; R (doc. no. 55) at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This analysis improperly conflates the Fourth Amendment issues of whether and for what reasons police had the lawful authority to handcuff Shine with the Fifth Amendment issue of whether Shine was 'in custody.' The Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, as well as its requirement of probable cause to place a suspect under arrest, concerns whether officers have sufficient evidence to justify police actions. As a result, the test for when officers properly use handcuffs to detain a suspect focuses on, among other potential justifications, whether the officer reasonably believed the suspect posed a danger to officer safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gray ex rel.

The officers then brought Elstad to the police station and, about one hour later, advised him of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, at which time Elstad made a written confession.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court held that the Fifth Amendment did not require exclusion of Elstad's post-warning confession, noting that \"[o]nce warned, the suspect is free to exercise his own volition in deciding whether or not to make a statement to authorities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Elstad\n   </em>\n   thus set out the general rule that a properly\n   <em>\n    Mirand\n   </em>\n   ized statement need not be excluded due to the existence of a prior improper, non-\n   <em>\n    Mirand\n   </em>\n   ized statement, because \"[a] subsequent administration of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but unwarned statement ordinarily should suffice to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Later, in\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   , the Court established a narrow exception to this rule, under which a second, post-warning confession should be suppressed as tainted by the earlier pre-warning statement. In that case, police had questioned the suspect extensively at the police station for between 30 to 40 minutes without providing\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings; after she confessed, she was given a 20-minute coffee break; when she returned, the police turned on a tape recorder, provided\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and confronted her with her pre-warning statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 604-05,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion). Confronted with the statements she had already made, she confessed again. The Court found that this \"question-first\" tactic undermined\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   because its \"manifest purpose\" was \"to get a confession the suspect would not make if he understood his rights at the outset\"; \"[u]pon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after making a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the same ground again.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   While the plurality opinion would have applied an objective test to determine whether the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings prior to a second questioning were effective in apprising the suspect of her rights-regardless of the intent of the police officers-Justice Kennedy's concurrence held that suppression is necessary \"only in the infrequent case ..., in which the two-step interrogation technique [is] used in a calculated way to undermine the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring). Even where such a deliberate strategy is employed, however, a post-warning statement could be admissible if the officers took appropriate \"curative steps,\" such as \"a substantial break in time and circumstances\" between the two interrogations, or \"an additional warning that explains the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial statement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because Justice Kennedy's concurrence relied on a narrower ground, his opinion is controlling.\n   <em>\n    Street\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n    472 F.3d at 1313-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, in deciding whether police officers employed a deliberate two-step interrogation strategy, this court must still consider \"the totality of the circumstances including the timing, setting, and completeness of the pre-warning interrogation, the continuity of police personnel and the overlapping content of the pre-and post-warning statements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n    at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   2. Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Shine argues that his statements during interrogation at the police station should be suppressed under the '\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   exception,' because his first, non-\n   <em>\n    Mirand\n   </em>\n   ized questioning during the first investigation undermined the effectiveness of subsequent\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Shine's briefing on this issue relies largely on the fact of the two separate interrogations to suggest that the police employed a deliberate two-step strategy. At oral argument, Shine also emphasized the fact that Officer Pendley apparently telephoned Agent Ioimo prior to arrival at the station house and provided information that he and Officer Ritchie had received from Shine. The government responds that there is no evidence of such a strategy here, and that\n   <em>\n    Elstad\n   </em>\n   controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing held by this court, Officer Ritchie stated that the Montgomery Police Department (MPD) has a policy that police officers on the scene do not decide whether to arrest suspects on a felony charge. Instead, the officers are to gather information and notify a detective or other supervisor, who then decides whether to further detain or arrest the suspect on felony charges. Ritchie further suggested that the fact that he did not provide\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to Shine while gathering information was consistent with that policy-that is, under the policy, officers do not typically administer\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings prior to the decision of supervisors to arrest or further detain a suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court agrees with the recommendation that there is not sufficient evidence that the officers here used a \"two-step interrogation technique ... in a calculated way to undermine the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning,\"\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    542 U.S. at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring), and that the general\n   <em>\n    Elstad\n   </em>\n   rule governs this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Looking at the totality of the circumstances,\n   <em>\n    Street\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n    472 F.3d at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court finds insufficient evidence of a deliberate two-step process. In terms of timing, as much as 90 minutes elapsed between the two interrogations-from the end of the dash-camera footage at 4:41 p.m. to the beginning of Agent Ioimo's interview at 6:10 p.m.-and there is no evidence that Shine was questioned during that gap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The setting of the two interrogations also weighs in the government's favor. The questioning in\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   all took place at the station house, suggesting a certain amount of continuity between the two interactions. Here, the first interrogation occurred at the roadside, while the second interrogation occurred after Shine was taken into the police station. The change in personnel between the first interrogation and the second also weighs in favor of the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The \"completeness of the prewarning interrogation,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, weighs in Shine's favor. During the first interrogation, Ritchie asked Shine repeatedly about the digital scale, the gun, his drug use, whether he sells drugs, and where he obtains drugs. When Ritchie was not satisfied with Shine's answers, he continued to prod and varied his interrogation tactics. Although this questioning was not as complete\n   as Agent Ioimo's, it was extensive. This factor therefore weighs in Shine's favor, although not dispositively so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the \"content of the pre-and post-warning statements\" is particularly unhelpful for Shine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Agent Ioimo testified that he received information from Officers Pendley and Ritchie prior to his interrogation of Shine. During the police station interrogation, Ioimo at times confronts Shine with these facts, such as the presence of a digital scale and razor blade in his truck's console. However, as the recommendation observed, \"it is difficult to imagine a situation in which the detaining officer would share no information with a taskforce officer or other officer who is charged with interviewing a suspect.\" R &amp; R at 38-39. Importantly, the facts the interrogator used were gathered through the officers' observations during the traffic stop and not from any confession elicited from Shine during pre-warning interrogation. The use in a second interrogation of a few facts that were obtained through officer observation-and not through prior interrogation of the defendant-do not tend to show the existence of a deliberate two-step strategy as employed in\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court was troubled to some extent by Officer Ritchie's testimony regarding the MPD's policy of gathering information from potential suspects without providing\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Such preliminary fact gathering and communication with supervisors plays an understandable role in police investigations and in deciding whether to arrest a suspect. However, it raises a potential problem under\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   in circumstances where subjects are in police 'custody' under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   during the initial fact-gathering. That is, when preliminary fact-gathering slides into the realm of custodial interrogation, the MPD policy of withholding\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings in the initial police encounter\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   begin to look like the \"two-step\" or \"question-first\" strategy rejected in\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   . In other words, the policy cannot, consistent with the Fifth Amendment, be used as means to get around, or shield city officers from,\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   's requirements. Regardless as to policy, if a person is\n   <em>\n    in custody\n   </em>\n   , he is entitled to the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings before questioning;\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , not the policy, dictates when the warnings must be given. However, there is simply not enough evidence in this case to demonstrate that this apparent MPD policy was created, or employed, in \"a\n   <em>\n    calculated\n   </em>\n   way to undermine the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 622,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis added). In sum, Shine fails to establish that the officers here employed a deliberate \"question-first\" strategy to undermine the effectiveness of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings during the second interrogation. Even with the court's presumption that Shine was in custody during the first, non-\n   <em>\n    Mirand\n   </em>\n   ized interrogation, the facts as to the second interrogation simply do not meet the requirements of the\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   exception. Shine's post-warning statements to Agent Ioimo will therefore not be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Upon an independent and de novo review of the record in this case and upon consideration of the recommendation of the magistrate judge, it is ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (1) The magistrate judge's recommendation (doc. no. 55) is accepted in part and rejected in part, as set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (2) Defendant Kendall Dewight Shine's supplemented motion to suppress (doc. nos. 36, 32) is granted only as to the period during the traffic stop after defendant Shine was handcuffed and moved to the officers' patrol car, and is denied in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   DONE, this the 5th day of January, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    To the extent that Shine made other objections, the court adopts the recommendation as to those objections and overrules them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The recommendation states that \"[u]ltimately\" Shine did not meet this requirement and \"[a]ccordingly ... was not in custody.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 29.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The 'in custody' standard under\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    is higher than the 'free-to-leave' test used to determine whether an individual has been seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, which requires only that a reasonable person in that individual's position would not feel that they were at liberty to terminate the encounter.\n    <em>\n     Street\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199104\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1298/\">\n     472 F.3d at 1310\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
