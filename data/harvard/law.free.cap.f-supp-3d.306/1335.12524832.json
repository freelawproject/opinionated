BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , have filed a twenty-nine page Complaint against twenty-eight named defendants. Compl. [Doc. 3 at 1-29]. The Complaint contains 179 individually numbered paragraphs and incorporates by reference a forty-four-page \"affidavit of fact\" containing an additional 190 individually numbered paragraphs. Compl.; Aff. of David Andrew Nezbeda dated April 7, 2017 [Doc. 3 at 30-73] (\"Nezbeda Aff.\"). The allegations in the Complaint are disjointed, voluminous, and difficult to follow. Plaintiffs appear to seek redress from a dispute between Mr. Nezbeda (\"Nezbeda\") and his insurance company related to a property damage claim filed in 2014. The initial controversy with the insurance company appears to have devolved into numerous additional disputes with other parties who played various roles in making and assessing the property damage claim, including his own representatives. The ever-burgeoning insurance claim dispute appears eventually to have found its way into a separate, pre-existing custody battle between Nezbeda and his former spouse. The Court will attempt to briefly summarize what it understands to be the factual predicate of Plaintiffs' claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dispute With Liberty Mutual Insurance Corporation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 8, 2014, Nezbeda's home was damaged from water due to frozen pipes. Nezbeda Aff. \u00b6 9. He filed a claim with his insurance company, Liberty Mutual Insurance Corporation (\"LIC\"), which Nezbeda alleges was denied on January 25, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 6, 2014, Nezbeda retained attorney Defendant Clay O'Daniel to represent him with regard to his claim against LIC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. At the suggestion of O'Daniel, Nezbeda hired insurance\n   adjuster Defendant Mark Edward McRorie to represent him in the process of getting an appraisal of the damages to his home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. On October 20, 2014, Nezbeda sent a second formal demand letter to LIC for full payment on his claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LIC appears to have paid Nezbeda at least $103,500.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. However, Nezbeda contends that LIC's representative, Defendant Mark Lively (hired by LIC as their appraiser,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32), and McRorie reached an agreement with regard to the amount of property loss on December 9, 2014, in the amount of $195,000.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Based on this alleged agreement, Nezbeda appears to contend that he is still owed at least $91,500.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The full payment of his property loss claim is not Nezbeda's only grievance against LIC and its representatives. Defendant Jamie Minich is an employee of LIC who is alleged to have come to Nezbeda's property on January 24, 2014, to take photographs and stayed there without Nezbeda's permission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 22. Defendant Reginald Lovelace is an employee of LIC who is alleged to have broken into Nezbeda's property on April 14, 2014, and taken photographs of the interior and exterior of the home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. Nezbeda appears to have filed a police report related to Minich's and Lovelace's entry onto his property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nezbeda also claims that LIC and Lovelace were complicit in computing false and incorrect estimates from October through December 2014 and unlawfully involving themselves in the appraisal process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At some point after Nezbeda received the \"partial payment\" from LIC, O'Daniel notified Nezbeda of the outstanding bill Nezbeda owed for the work O'Daniel performed on Nezbeda's behalf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. At some point thereafter, McRorie called Nezbeda to tell him that McRorie and O'Daniel could get the remainder of Nezbeda's claim from LIC (presumably $91,500.00) if Nezbeda paid the bills McRorie and O'Daniel had submitted to Nezbeda for the work they already performed on Nezbeda's behalf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Subsequently, McRorie and O'Daniel are alleged to have made constant harassing communications and threats to Nezbeda demanding payment for the services they performed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-41, 45, 70.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Custody Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Jennifer Roberson McKweon is Nezbeda's former wife, from whom he was divorced\n   in October of 2011. Compl. \u00b6 11; Nezbeda Aff. \u00b6 4. Nezbeda alleges that McKweon \"stole\" their child and moved to Georgia and that he moved to Georgia so that he could spend more time with the child. Nezbeda Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6. Upon relocating to Georgia on May 7, 2012, Nezbeda filed a petition to modify their child custody arrangement in Cobb County, Georgia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. As a part of the child custody proceeding initiated by Nezbeda, the court issued a temporary order granting Nezbeda visitation rights until a final order could be entered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The temporary order contemplated that a guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   would be appointed for the child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   McKweon hired an attorney, Defendant Leslie Dean O'Neal, to represent her in the child custody proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Nezbeda hired Defendant David Oles to represent him in the custody dispute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 8, 2015, the judge in the custody proceeding, Defendant Robert Dale Leonard, II, appointed Defendant Gillian O'Nan as the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. The same January 8, 2015, order directed Nezbeda to submit to drug testing, including a hair follicle screening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Nezbeda reported to Defendant Airtimes Group, LLC (\"Airtimes\"), for a hair follicle screening on January 20, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. The results, which Nezbeda contends were \"adulterated,\" came back positive for drugs in Nezbeda's system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55. Nezbeda returned to Airtimes soon thereafter to take an additional urine screening, which he contends showed no drugs in his system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Nezbeda had an additional hair follicle test performed at another facility, which indicated that he had no drugs in his system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. Nezbeda alleges that he was periodically required to submit for drug tests that were unnecessary, expensive, and time consuming.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 87, 89, 176.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   O'Neal is alleged to have contacted McRorie (Nezbeda's insurance adjuster from the dispute with LIC), to be a character witness in the custody proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. On or about March 20, 2015, McRorie threatened Nezbeda that he was going to cooperate with O'Neal and use influence McRorie had with Judge Leonard (with whom McRorie was acquainted through a family member) if Nezbeda did not pay for the work McRorie performed on behalf of Nezbeda related to the dispute with LIC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71, 76. Nezbeda alleges that McRorie eventually provided false information to the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   (O'Nan) and appeared at one of his child custody hearings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76, 78, 81-82. Nezbeda contends that he reported McRorie to the police related to an alleged attempt to extort him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96. In a subsequent conversation with the Cobb County Police Department on August 16, 2016, the police department denied that there was ever an investigation into McRorie.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The crux of Nezbeda's allegations relating to the custody dispute appear to be based upon a wide-reaching conspiracy Defendants are alleged to have engaged in to Nezbeda's detriment. For example, Nezbeda alleges that McKweon and her attorneys, including O'Neal, used the court system as a tool to personally attack Nezbeda.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, 41. He contends that McRorie and O'Daniel involved themselves in the custody dispute in an effort to get Nezbeda to pay money that allegedly was owed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33 (\"Defendants Odaniel and McRorie started their scorched earth campaign against Plaintiff and they used their personal ties with Defendant Leonard to the detriment of his custody case.\"). Nezbeda further alleges that Judge Leonard \"allowed and encouraged\" O'Neal and O'Nan \"to constantly and illegally invade [his] privacy by giving unlimited power to consider every single aspect of [his] life through financial records, travel records,\n   [his] wife's divorce from her ex-husband, and even her children's parenting plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. Nezbeda's affidavit is replete with numerous convoluted allegations attempting to show that Defendants McKweon, O'Neal, O'Nan, McRorie, and Leonard conspired against him in the custody proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-89, 91, 100-04, 108, 141, 160, 167, 175-79, 184, 187.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 21, 2015, an order was entered in the custody proceeding revoking Nezbeda's right to overnight visitation with his son.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nezbeda contends that at some point in the proceedings he was permitted to have supervised visits, but on August 27, 2016, he was denied visitation for a lack of having a supervisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145. Nezbeda's Affidavit contains numerous allegations detailing the difficulty he encountered with seeing his son because of the apparent requirement that the visits be supervised.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 168-73, 175, 182-84. At some point Nezbeda went to his son's school, Westside Elementary School, to obtain a copy of his son's school records, but was denied access to any records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152. According to his own allegations, this was corrected by September 14, 2016, when Nezbeda acknowledges that he was permitted to obtain a copy of the records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 19, 2016, Nezbeda filed a motion to disqualify Judge Leonard and \"impeach\" O'Nan as guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   , and a corresponding complaint with the Georgia Judicial Qualifications Committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 137-39.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nezbeda alleges that Judge Leonard, through his staff attorney, Defendant Melissa Brickey,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   threatened to sue Nezbeda unless Nezbeda sealed the motion for disqualification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143. Nezbeda contends that the Judicial Qualifications Committee did a \"sub-par investigation into the abuses [he] complained about.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 190. Nezbeda alleges that O'Nan filed a motion to hold him in contempt for his failure to pay for her services as guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Nezbeda's Incarceration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At some point in the custody proceeding Judge Leonard ordered Nezbeda to sit for a psychological evaluation to be performed by Defendant William Buchanan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95, 112. Nezbeda alleges that because Nezbeda failed to sit for the evaluation, on December 8, 2015, he was \"incarcerated by Defendant Judge Robert D.
