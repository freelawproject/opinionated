The District of Columbia has not suggested that there was any legal justification for this undisputed \"overdetention\"; what is at stake is whether plaintiff has founded his claims for redress on the appropriate legal theories, and whether he has come forward with sufficient evidence to support them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff sued the District of Columbia and two individuals who worked for the\n   Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"): Jeanette Myrick and Jack Jones. He brought claims against all three defendants under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for alleged violations of his Fifth Amendment rights, as well as common law claims alleging false imprisonment and negligence. He also brought a claim alleging negligent supervision and training against the District of Columbia. Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of the counts except the negligence claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. for Partial Summ. J [Dkt. # 73] (\"Defs.' Mot.\"), and plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on all four counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. to Defs.' Mot. &amp; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. on Liability &amp; Entry of a Permanent Inj. [Dkt. ## 75, 77] (\"Pl.'s Cross-Mot.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants moved for summary judgment on the section 1983 claims in Count I on the grounds that: (1) plaintiff has not established the necessary predicate violation of his constitutional rights; (2) the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity; and (3) plaintiff has not satisfied the prerequisites for establishing municipal liability under section 1983, that is, the existence of a policy or practice that caused the constitutional deprivation. The Court concludes that there are genuine disputes of material fact on the questions of whether plaintiff's constitutional rights were violated, and whether the District had a custom or practice concerning its receipt of paperwork that caused plaintiff's overdetention, and those disputes preclude the entry of summary judgment for plaintiff or the District on Count I. However, the individual defendants are both entitled to qualified immunity, so summary judgment on Count I will be granted in their favor, and the other theories advanced by plaintiff for section 1983 liability will not move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court will grant summary judgment on the false imprisonment claim in Count II in favor of plaintiff because no reasonable juror could find that he was lawfully detained. Since plaintiff did not move for summary judgment on his negligence claim in Count III on proper grounds, the Court will deny his motion on that count without prejudice. Finally, the Court will grant the District's motion for summary judgment on the negligent supervision and training claim in Count IV because plaintiff has not come forward with expert testimony to establish the existence of a national standard of care that was breached in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts regarding plaintiff's overdetention are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 On March 15, 2014, the Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") received commitment orders in two different D.C.

Whether that is an accurate assessment or not, it is a far cry from identifying a custom or practice that led to plaintiff's detention. DOC's failure to update its written policy to substitute the name of the currently available technology is not a basis for section 1983 liability. Plaintiff has failed to come forward with evidence that would enable a reasonable juror to conclude that the District had a custom or practice of ignoring the important information contained in the court's database, and therefore, summary judgment for plaintiff is inappropriate on this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

While plaintiff has not come forward with enough undisputed evidence to support the entry of judgment in his favor on this theory as a matter of law, he has pointed to enough to withstand a motion for summary judgment against him.

Why was one order input into TMS but not the other? How did the second order end up in plaintiff's file if TMS only included, and Jones only processed, one? Why was plaintiff transported back to the jail at all? Why does the record include both time stamped and not time stamped versions of the same documents, or versions that are both signed and not signed by a Deputy Marshal? The unsystematic and inconsistent handling of release orders in this case has certainly impeded the parties from ascertaining the facts, and the Court is reluctant to find, on this woefully deficient record, that no juror could conclude that a haphazard process of receiving orders, through a variety of means and in a variety of formats, and at different stages in the proceedings, did not contribute to the fact that some of them were ignored, and that the ball was dropped at least one, and possibly more, steps along the way. So the District's motion for summary judgment will be denied as to this aspect of Count I as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The District's Alleged Practice of not Releasing Misdemeanants From Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that DOC has a practice of not following its policy to release misdemeanants directly from the courthouse, and that a failure to follow this policy resulted in his overdetention. Pl.'s Cross-Mem. at 24. This overlaps somewhat with the paperwork theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In its statement of facts, the District asserted that \"misdemeanor inmates are released directly from D.C.

In response, plaintiff stated that the fact was disputed because he \"was not released directly from the Court.\" Pl.'s Resp. SOF \u00b6 11. That is clearly correct. But plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence in the record that would support his theory that this omission was part of a larger problem, and that DOC has so consistently failed to follow its own policy that it is its custom or practice to do so, and the practice led to the error in his case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Therefore, the Court will deny summary judgment for plaintiff on this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    c.
