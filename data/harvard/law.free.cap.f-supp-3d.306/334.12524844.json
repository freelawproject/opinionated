Ryan claims that he uncovered \"widespread waste, fraud, and negligence within [FEMS]\" while acting as the Department's EMS Oversight Officer, and that shortly after he publicly disclosed what he perceived to be the Department's internal deficiencies, Defendant Kenneth Ellerbe-then Chief of FEMS-removed him from the oversight position and returned him to his previous position of fulltime Firefighter-Paramedic. (Am. Compl., ECF No. 5, \u00b6 3.) Ryan purportedly persisted in reporting instances of wrongdoing within FEMS, after which he was allegedly subjected to \"baseless charges and investigations, threats to his person and his career, and other forms of adverse employment actions[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ryan has filed the instant two-count complaint against Ellerbe and David Miramontes (the former Assistant Chief and Operational Medical Director of FEMS), in their official capacities as Department employees, and also against the District of Columbia (\"the District\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)

With respect to Ryan's federal cause of action, Defendants point out that Ryan is required to demonstrate \"that a municipal 'policy' or 'custom' violated the First Amendment\" (Defs.' Mem. at 21), and they maintain that there is \"no evidence\" that any \"final policy maker\" here \"acted in such a way to create a policy of retaliating against employees for speech[,]\" or that Ellerbe, the District's Fire Chief, \"even ... had the final say with regard to policy\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons explained below, this Court agrees with Defendants that Ryan has failed to demonstrate that Ellerbe was a final policymaker whose actions can be imputed to the District of Columbia, or that the District adopted a custom or practice that led to the alleged constitutional harms, or that the District adopted a policy of inaction or was otherwise deliberately indifferent to the risk that its agents would violate the constitutional rights of Ryan or others. Therefore, this Court finds that Ryan has failed to make the requisite showing of section 1983 municipal liability in support of the First Amendment claim, such that summary judgment must be granted in Defendants' favor with respect to the sole federal claim in the instant complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court further concludes that the equitable factors of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity weigh against the retention of this case through the discretionary exercise of the Court's supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law DCWPA claim. Accordingly, Defendants' motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , and summary judgment will be entered in Defendants' favor with respect to the First Amendment claim (Count II), and the remaining state-law claim (Count I) will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   , leaving Ryan with the option of refiling the DCWPA claim in the appropriate local court, should he so choose.

As to the complaint's sole federal cause of action, Ryan alleges that his disclosures of the Department's purported deficiencies constituted a lawful exercise of his \"First Amendment right to speak on matters of public concern\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 245;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and that \"Defendants violated [his] First Amendment [r]ight[ ]\" of free speech (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 250) by taking \"retaliatory actions against [him] for speaking publicly about [the Department's] mismanagement, fraud, and violations of laws\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 249).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties have completed discovery, and Defendants have now filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to all of Ryan's claims. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot.; Defs.' Mem.) As relevant here, Defendants argue that, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Ryan's disclosures were protected speech, and that his First Amendment rights were violated as a result of the disclosures, the District cannot be held liable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because Ryan failed to prove that a \"municipal 'policy' or 'custom' \" caused those injuries, or that any \"final policy maker\" was involved in the alleged violations. (Defs.' Mem. at 21.) Ryan counters that Ellerbe is a final policymaker, who\n   \"adopted the policy that was the driving force behind the retaliation [Ryan] experienced following the exercise of his First Amendment right to free speech[,]\" \"had knowledge of [Ryan's] disclosures[,]\" and \"knew that a series of disciplinary actions were being taken against [Ryan.]\" (Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Defs.' Revised Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"), ECF No. 33, at 52.) Ryan further argues that, even though Ellerbe \"[had] knowledge of the disciplinary actions repeatedly being taken against [Ryan],\" Ellerbe \"did nothing\" and actually \"condoned the repeated attacks against [Ryan and] fail[ed] to intervene in any way.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Ryan concludes, \"[a] reasonable jury could find that Chief Ellerbe, though he may not have issued the disciplinary actions against [Ryan], was implicit [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] in permitting other Department supervisors to retaliate against [Ryan] following his exercising his First Amendment rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment is now ripe for this Court's review.

That deficiency alone can \"doom[ ] his municipal liability claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Winder v.

But the parties here have passed the pleading stage, and Defendants maintain that \"\n   <em>\n    there is no evidence\n   </em>\n   that the Department head, Fire Chief Ellerbe, acted in such a way to create a policy of retaliating against employees for speech or even that he had the final say with regard to policy.\" (Defs.' Mem. at 21 (emphasis added).) This Court's review of the record confirms this proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Ellerbe Did Not Possess Authority Sufficient To Create Any Final District Policy That Caused Ryan's Alleged Harms\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ryan's most lucid argument for why a policy of the District was the moving force behind the First Amendment violations he alleges-raised for the first time in his opposition brief-is that Ellerbe \"can reasonably be considered as a policymaker by virtue of his utter disregard of the personnel policies in place and his decisions to let management, including Dr. Miramontes, take disciplinary actions that fly in the face of established guidance and have no legitimate basis in order to retaliate against Plaintiff.\" (Pl.'s Opp'n at 53.) Thus, Ryan appears to believe that a municipal employee's alleged actions and decisions can themselves qualify the employee as a \"policymaker\" for municipal liability purposes, but he provides no authority for this contention-which is not surprising, as it is not the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rather, \"whether a particular official has final policymaking authority is a question of state law[,]\" and \"the identification of those officials whose decisions represent the official policy of the local governmental unit\" concerning the alleged unconstitutional action is \"a legal question to be resolved by the trial judge before the\n   case is submitted to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Jett v.

Moreover, it is clear that the \"authority to make municipal policy is the authority to make\n   <em>\n    final\n   </em>\n   policy specific to the tortious conduct[,]\" but \"[i]f an official's discretionary decisions are constrained by policies not of that official's making, then those policies-rather [than] the official's departure from them-are the act of the municipality.\"\n   <em>\n    Byrd v.

Furthermore, when determining whether a municipal employee-even the head of an agency-has final policymaking authority, courts in this District look for \"specific provisions in the D.C. Code\" that \"grant[ ] the director authority to promulgate rules for the administration of his respective department with regard to the [specific] conduct at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173115\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/807/37/#p75\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ryan does not cite any provision of the D.C. Code, or any other evidence, to support his bald assertions that Ellerbe \"created a policy of retaliating against employees for exercising their right to free speech\" and \"had a final say with regard to that policy.\" (Pl.'s Opp'n at 53.) The most likely reason for Ryan's omission of any such evidence is that none exists; indeed, to the contrary, it appears that Ellerbe did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   possess final policymaking authority with regard to the alleged retaliatory acts. Chapter 4 of Title 5 of the D.C. Code (which establishes many of the rules and regulations that govern FEMS) does not delegate to the Fire Chief the kind of broad employment, personnel, and discipline-related policymaking authority that courts have found necessary in order for the head of an agency to qualify as a final policymaker for purposes of municipal liability. In fact, that authority is specifically reserved elsewhere: section 5-402 of the D.C. Code expressly empowers the District's Mayor to \"appoint, assign to such duty or duties as he may prescribe, promote, reduce, fine, suspend, with or without pay, and remove all officers and members of [FEMS], according to [ ] rules and regulations\" that \"the Council of the District of Columbia, in its exclusive jurisdiction and judgment[,]\" establishes.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-402\">\n    D.C.

Council have over personnel-related matters within the D.C. Fire Department.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-402\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-402(a-1)(1) (the Mayor, with the advice and consent of the Council, shall appoint the Fire Chief);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-402\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-405 (the Mayor establishes the workweek and hours for FEMS employees);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-402\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-406 (the Mayor prescribes the rules and regulations by which funds are to be expended for uniforms and other equipment);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-402\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-409.01 (the Mayor is authorized to provide for the transfer between positions of certain FEMS employees). Thus, the D.C. Fire Chief lacks the authority that the D.C.

Ryan has not only failed to identify any portion of the D.C.

To begin with, this Court has reached its conclusion regarding the need to award summary judgment to the District on the federal\n   claim without considering the facts and circumstances underpinning Ryan's DCWPA allegations. Indeed, although this case has had a protracted procedural history in federal court, this Court has developed no familiarity with the issues presented by Ryan's state-law claim, nor has it invested time and resources on that claim, because there is no overlap between the arguments and evidence supporting Ryan's DCWPA claim and the municipal liability issues that his federal claim presents. Judicial economy therefore does not weigh against dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shekoyan v. Sibley Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3440483,8954716\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/409/414/\">\n    409 F.3d 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (affirming the district court's decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction where the litigation had proceeded for four years in the district court prior to the dismissal of the plaintiff's federal claims, and where the district judge had served for 18 years as a D.C. Superior Court judge and was familiar with local District of Columbia law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Considerations of comity also point in favor of allowing Ryan to pursue his claim in state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steinberg v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3934942\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/952/22/#p31\">\n    952 F.Supp.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (D.D.C. 2013) (\"Comity would be served by allowing the D.C. Courts to address these remaining issues, which concern matters of D.C. law and administration.\"). Ryan's state-law claim sounds entirely in an area of law far more familiar to the District of Columbia Superior Court than this one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yancey v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325004\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/991/171/#p181\">\n    991 F.Supp.2d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 181 (D.D.C. 2013) (concluding that \"[t]he factors enumerated in Section 1367(c)... weigh in favor of declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining [common law] claims[,]\" in part because \"the District of Columbia Superior Court would naturally have greater familiarity and interest in the issues that remain, insofar as they require interpretation of the District's own statutory and common law\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ). Furthermore, as other courts have noted, no undue unfairness attaches to a federal court's decision to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a pendent state law claim, and the plaintiff ordinarily will not be prejudiced by the delay, because section 1367(d) of Title 28 of the United States Code\"tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency of the federal case and for at least 30 days thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    Kyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354392\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/380/#p400\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   These and other similar considerations lead this Court to conclude that Ryan's DCWPA claim should be dismissed without prejudice. Ryan may bring that claim, if he so chooses and if it is not otherwise barred, in the appropriate local court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Powers-Bunce v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the reasons explained above, this Court finds there is no evidence \"that a custom or policy of the [District]\" caused the alleged violations of Ryan's constitutional rights,\n   <em>\n    Blue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309922,4083151\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/14/\">\n    811 F.3d at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and therefore, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment with respect to Ryan's First Amendment claim. This Court further finds that equitable considerations weigh against the exercise of this Court's authority to retain supplemental jurisdiction over Ryan's state-law claim. Accordingly, and as set forth in the accompanying Order, Defendants' motion for summary judgment will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to the First Amendment claim (Count II), and\n   the DCWPA claim (Count I) will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Page-number citations to the documents the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the Court's electronic filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    These facts are undisputed, unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Defendants argue that the EMS Oversight Officer position was never formally created or finalized, in part because Ellerbe lacked the authority to create a new position at the Department or to enter into an employment contract with Ryan. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Mem. at 18-19.) Ryan counters that the position\n    <em>\n     was\n    </em>\n    formally created, and he argues that, at the very least, whether or not the position formally existed is a dispute of a material fact. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 34-36.) However, because the resolution of this issue is not material to the conclusion the Court reaches in this Memorandum Opinion, the Court need not resolve this question.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lopez v.
