MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Siqing Wang challenges the manner in which the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services handled her I-526 immigrant visa petition. Her suit names four defendants: the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services; Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; Leon Rodriguez, Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services; and Julia Harrison, Acting Chief of the Immigrant Investor Program. Currently before me is Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and, with respect to some of Plaintiff's arguments, for failure to state a claim. Because the District Court for the District of Columbia has subject matter jurisdiction to review the actions that Plaintiff challenges, the motion to dismiss is DENIED in part. However, because the complaint does not adequately state a claim with regard to the denial of Plaintiff's motion to reopen or reconsider, the motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and Plaintiff's claims concerning that motion are DISMISSED without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint alleges that she is a 23-year-old graduate student who wishes to become a permanent resident of the\n   United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff invested $500,000 in an American business, believing that this investment would make her eligible for permanent residency under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). The $500,000 were proceeds of a loan secured by property that Plaintiff owned jointly with her father. Although she only held a 50% interest in the property, her father gave her his half of the loan proceeds as a gift. Plaintiff took the funds and invested them in an American business in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff then filed an I-526 visa petition. On October 5, 2015, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approved the petition, concluding that she satisfied the requirements for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa. However, the USCIS initiated revocation proceedings less than two months later. On December 3, 2015, it sent her a Notice of Intent to Revoke (NOIR). The NOIR stated that Section 1153(b)(5)'s requirement of a $500,000 investment of capital is a requirement that the investor put $500,000 of her own capital at risk. Because Plaintiff's investment consisted of loan proceeds and she did not own $500,000 worth of the property used to secure the loan, USCIS took the position that she had not invested sufficient capital to satisfy Section 1153(b)(5). Plaintiff responded by repeating her prior representation that her father had gifted her his share of the loan proceeds, so that all the capital she invested was her own. However, the USCIS issued a decision on February 1, 2016, informing her that her visa petition was denied. Importantly, this decision said nothing about a visa revocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, through a new attorney, filed a motion to reopen or reconsider the USCIS's decision (MTR). The MTR argued that the decision should be reopened because the Plaintiff's prior attorney had rendered ineffective assistance in presenting and explaining the underlying loan transactions. The MTR also argued that, properly interpreted, the loan documents showed that Plaintiff's father had gifted her a portion of his interest in the property securing the loan prior to the loan's execution. USCIS denied the MTR, determining, as Plaintiff had originally alleged, that Plaintiff's father \"is a property owner gifting a loan amount corresponding to his property interest.\" Compl. \u00b6 48; Pl.'s Notice of Filing, Ex. 1 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff then filed this suit, challenging both the denial of her visa petition and the denial of her MTR. Plaintiff's complaint named four defendants: USCIS; Jeh Johnson, then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; Leon Rodriguez, the Director of USCIS; and Julia Harrison, the Acting Chief of the Immigrant Investor Program. Defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The complaint in this case seeks review of two USCIS actions-a decision rendered on February 1, 2016 (regarding Plaintiff's visa petition), and a decision rendered on August 3, 2016 (regarding Plaintiff's MTR). The parties dispute whether the first decision should be treated as a revocation or a denial. They agree that the second decision is a denial of Plaintiff's MTR. For the reasons explained below, I conclude that neither action is a revocation. Thus, Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is inapplicable, and jurisdiction is established by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1346.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jurisdiction Over the Denial of Plaintiff's Visa Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties agree that federal courts have jurisdiction to review the denial of a visa petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fogo de Chao (Holdings) Inc. v.

By contrast, the great weight of persuasive authority indicates that federal courts lack jurisdiction to review revocation of a visa petition's approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mohammad v.

Nowhere does either document refer to the decision as a revocation. In other contexts, courts give careful consideration to an agency's characterization of its own conduct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilderness Soc. v. Norton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"932008,3450578\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/584/\">\n    434 F.3d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (listing an agency's characterization of its own action as the first of three factors to consider in determining whether an agency has issued a binding norm or a mere policy statement). Here, that would mean that I should treat the decision as a denial-not a revocation-and take jurisdiction over the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nevertheless, Defendants argue that the USCIS's repeated characterization of its own action as a denial constitutes harmless error and that I should set this characterization aside in order to treat the February 1 decision as a revocation authorized by Section 1155 and shielded from judicial review by Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). According to Defendants, I can treat the decision as a revocation because USCIS meant its action to be a revocation and because Plaintiff enjoyed all the procedural safeguards that apply to revocations. Defendants reason that the USCIS \"did not prejudice Plaintiff and did nothing to affect the final outcome of the administrative proceeding\" through its \"inadvertent use of the term 'denied.' \" Defs.' Reply ISO Mot. Dismiss at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There are at least two independently adequate reasons that the harmless error argument fails to overcome the USCIS's original characterization of its own conduct. The first reason it fails is that Defendants' argument has no basis in harmless error doctrine. Defendants purport to rely on\n   <em>\n    Jicarilla Apache Nation v. United States Department of the Interior\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552392,3703132\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1112/\">\n    613 F.3d 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2010).\n   <em>\n    Jicarilla Apache Nation\n   </em>\n   essentially states that if a plaintiff complains of an agency's error without showing that the error resulted in harm, the court need not correct that error.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552392,3703132\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1112/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552392,3703132\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1112/\">\n    at 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate harm caused by an error is predicated on the plaintiff complaining of that error, and the consequence of a plaintiff's failure to demonstrate harm is that the error will not be corrected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Unlike the harmless error analysis in\n   <em>\n    Jicarilla Apache Nation\n   </em>\n   , the analysis that Defendants propose in this case would predicate the Plaintiff's obligation to demonstrate harm on the agency complaining of its own error and would conclude from Plaintiff's failure to demonstrate harm that the error should be corrected. Rather than requiring Plaintiff to demonstrate that an error of which she complains caused her harm, Defendants would have me require her to demonstrate that she was harmed\n   by a statement that she alleges was correct and that she believes is helpful to her case. Rather than concluding that harmlessness is a reason not to correct an error, Defendants would have me treat harmlessness as a basis for correcting the alleged error by setting aside the plain text of the USCIS's decision in order to effectuate the agency's\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   recharacterization of its intent. Defendants' request has no support in the case law on which it purports to rely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second reason that the harmless error argument fails to overcome the agency's original characterization of its own conduct is that binding precedent prohibits me from accepting after-the-fact rationalizations for agency action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

The Notice of Decision invokes the statutory and regulatory provisions governing denial of visa petitions as the sole basis for the agency's action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-6. Nowhere does the USCIS decision or Notice of Decision invoke the Secretary's discretionary authority to revoke approvals of visa petitions under Section 1155. Because the USCIS cannot invoke that authority after the fact, its February 1 decision must be evaluated on its own terms as a denial subject to judicial review rather than as a revocation shielded from review under Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Defendants argue in a single footnote of their motion to dismiss that Sections 1155 and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) shield the August 3 decision from judicial review by shielding the underlying February 1 decision from judicial review. This argument assumes that the February 1 decision is immune from judicial review. I have already determined to the contrary.

Defendants quote\n    <em>\n     Addison\n    </em>\n    for the propositions that \"[t]he burden to demonstrate prejudicial error is on ... the party challenging the agency action\" and that \"if the agency's mistake did not affect the outcome, it would be senseless to vacate and remand for reconsideration.\" Defs.' Response to Pl.'s Notice at 1 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Addison,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055352\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/244/\">\n     831 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    253 ). According to Defendants, this means that in order to challenge the February 1 decision and justify vacatur and remand, Plaintiff must show that the agency's allegedly inadvertent use of the word \"denied\" was prejudicial and affected the outcome of the agency proceeding, even though Plaintiff has no objection to the agency's word choice.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2. However, Plaintiff need not demonstrate that every error in the February 1 decision was prejudicial and affected the outcome of the case in order to demonstrate that the errors of which she complains provide a sound basis for vacating and remanding. To hold otherwise would be to say that one harmless error in an agency decision is enough to immunize that decision from ever being vacated and remanded, no matter how many other errors a Plaintiff may allege. This, of course, is not the law. Typos do not establish infallibility.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Plaintiff offers two alternative arguments for jurisdiction. First, Plaintiff argues that her complaint raises nondiscretionary predicate legal questions that are subject to judicial review notwithstanding Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Pl.'s Opp. to Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 21-25. Second, Plaintiff argues that a putative revocation that promptly follows an approval is in substance a denial.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 26. In light of my finding that the February 1 decision was a visa denial over which I have jurisdiction, I need not decide these alternative arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Plaintiff seeks to distinguish the cases that originally established these procedural requirements on the ground that they involve a regulation that governs reopening in the. context of BIA removal proceedings and not in the context of the USCIS's evaluation of visa petitions. But this would also distinguish the cases on which Plaintiff relies for the proposition that ineffective assistance of counsel is a basis for reopening. Assuming\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that Plaintiff is right that the requirements for reopening in the context of removal proceedings do not apply here, Plaintiff has not adequately addressed Defendants' challenge to the sufficiency of her complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    There is a related constitutional question whether the right to effective assistance of counsel applies in the context of visa petitions at all. Plaintiff's brief does not directly address the point. Defendants' brief raises it in a footnote that relies almost exclusively on sources that are off point, including two sets of headnotes. Because the question has not been adequately briefed and is not necessary to the resolution of this motion, I decline to reach it here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    During oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel appeared to raise an alternative argument for the first time. He noted that the complaint challenged the USCIS interpretation of the statute, which is a legal question. Tr. of Proceedings, page 29-31.
