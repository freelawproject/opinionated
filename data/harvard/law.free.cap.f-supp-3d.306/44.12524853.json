The term\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   was included in the 1934 Act, but because that term was replaced in 1998 by the distinct term\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   , the latter year is most relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   a. Definitions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In 1998, the word\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   , on its own, could refer to a group as small as a few people (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a church\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   group) or one including most of the world (the international\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   ). That said, several dictionaries define\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   as a body of people who live \"in the same locality\" or in \"one place.\" Chambers Dictionary (1993); Oxford Dictionary of Current English (3d ed. 2001). And one of Black's definitions for\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   is a \"neighborhood, vicinity, or locality.\" Black's Law Dictionary (7th ed. 1999). Geographic proximity aside, the defining characteristic of a community was a common bond.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Chambers Dictionary (1993) (defining\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   as \"a group of people who have common interests, characteristics or culture\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Many 1998-era dictionaries make clear that\n   <em>\n    local\n   </em>\n   meant geographically limited.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1997) (defining\n   <em>\n    local\n   </em>\n   as \"of, relating to, or characteristic of a particular place: not general or widespread\"). Webster's Third provides more precise definitions: \"primarily serving the needs of a particular limited district, often a community or minor political subdivision\" and \"limited in operation to only part of the territory subject to the legislative power (as a town, district, county).\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary (3d ed. 1993);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706988,12579095\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1405/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (defining\n   <em>\n    local\n   </em>\n   as \"a newspaper story or item of interest mainly to readers who live in the town or city where the paper is published\").

Combined Statistical Areas\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Rule automatically qualifies any contiguous portion of a Combined Statistical Area as part of a single local community, as long as the portion's population does not exceed 2.5 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Combined Statistical Area consists of adjacent Core-Based Statistical Areas that, according to the OMB, have substantial employment interchange. 75 Fed. Reg. at 37,248. The Combined Statistical Area that includes Washington D.C., for example, is composed of the entirety of the colored area in this map:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The varying shades of green represent each of the eight Core-Based Statistical Areas that form the Combined Statistical Area. The OMB claims that Combined Statistical Areas \"reflect broader social and economic interactions\" like \"wholesaling, commodity distribution, and weekend recreation activities.\" OMB Bulletin No. 15-01. The record, however, does not provide support for that conclusion. While Chambersburg-Waynesboro, for example, must have an employment interchange of at least 15 with Hagerstown-Martinsburg (its adjacent Core-Based Statistical Area), Chambersburg-Waynesboro does not necessarily have any interchange at all with any of the other Core-Based Statistical Areas. In other words, a Combined Statistical Area might be composed of a series of daisy-chained Core-Based Statistical Areas that are linked to their neighbors but have nothing to do with those at the other end of the chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The NCUA argues that the population cap of 2.5 million people and the contiguity requirement together prevent distant and unconnected areas from being considered a local community. Those limits, however, do not solve the problem. Here's an extreme example:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   According to the Rule, everyone living within the red rectangle, which is contiguous and contains fewer than 2.5 million people, is part of the same local community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 42 (NCUA acknowledging that the Rule defines thin strips like the above as part of a single\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   ). That is true even though residents of Doylesburg, Pennsylvania (at the northern edge of the red rectangle) and residents of Partlow, Virginia (at the southern edge of the red rectangle) live about 200 miles from each other-around a 3.5-hour drive. What is more, unlike some residents from even the perimeter of the D.C. Core-Based Statistical Area, residents of Doylesburg and Partlow do not necessarily share any commuting relationship to D.C. They might not share any commonality whatsoever beyond that they\n   live in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States within a certain radius of D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Doylesburg-Partlow example is extreme, but it is not hypothetical: the Rule\n   <em>\n    defines\n   </em>\n   the red rectangle as belonging to a single local community. If a credit union seeks to serve such an area, the NCUA has no discretion to reject the credit union's application on the ground that the area is not a local community.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,440 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 42. Because any portion of a Combined Statistical Area automatically qualifies, the NCUA can do nothing to prevent a gerrymandering credit union from serving up to 2.5 million people from all ends of a Combined Statistical Area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   A definition that calls Doylesburg, Pennsylvania and Partlow, Virginia residents part of the same local community is not anywhere near the term's standard meaning. As noted, at the time of enactment, numerous states defined the term as constituting a geographic scope no larger than a county. And definitions of the individual words\n   <em>\n    local\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   also suggest that a\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   was understood as a group sharing a common bond and living in a geographically small area such as a county or municipality. Combined Statistical Areas do not necessarily have either of those characteristics: they sometimes stretch across vast regions that include multiple separate urban centers with suburban and rural communities, and residents of peripheral towns may have no common bond at all beyond regional proximity. Any number of less extreme examples make the same point: the Rule-which requires the NCUA to accept a service area based on a Combined Statistical Area as part of a\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   no matter how geographically dispersed and unconnected its 2.5 million or fewer members may be-is unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The NCUA's responses are unpersuasive. First, the NCUA asserts that the term\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   does not \"connote any fixed restrictions\" at all because the statute does not explicitly address the question how broad is too broad. NCUA Br. at 26, Dkt. 19-1. But while\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   is vague, it is not devoid of meaning. Acceptance of the NCUA's argument would allow an agency to rewrite a statute whenever it is given the authority to define a vague term. Second, to suggest that it retains some discretion over areas like the red rectangle, the NCUA invokes a requirement that a credit union applicant must establish that it has the ability to serve its proposed service area. Hr'g Tr. at 36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 88,414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that requirement is an additional one imposed on top of the\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   requirement; it does not factor into the NCUA's definition of\n   <em>\n    local community. See\n   </em>\n   75 Fed. Reg. at 36,261 (\"[A]fter establishing the existence of a [well-defined local community],\" a credit union must \"demonstrate it is able to serve the [well-defined local community].\"). Because the Rule automatically qualifies any area of 2.5 million or fewer people from any Combined Statistical Area as part of a local community-despite its potential geographic breadth and lack of commonality-this definition is manifestly contrary to the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   3. Core-Based Statistical Areas\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Next, the Rule deems any individual portion of any Core-Based Statistical Area (or Metropolitan Division instead when there is one) a local community as long as the portion's population does not exceed 2.5 million.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 88,440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A Core-Based Statistical Area consists of an urban core, its county, and any surrounding counties that are, according to OMB, highly socially and economically integrated with the core.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   75 Fed. Reg. at 37,249 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   U.S. Census Bureau,\n   <em>\n    Geographic Terms and Concepts\n   </em>\n   . The OMB defines social and economic integration with commuting ties: a surrounding county may be part of a Core-Based Statistical Area only if at least 25 percent of its workers commute into the central county or vice versa. 75 Fed. Reg. at 37,250.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Rule eliminates two requirements that prevented certain areas within Core-Based Statistical Areas from being considered part of a single local community. First, while the NCUA interpreted the 2010 rule to define a portion of a Core-Based Statistical Area as part of a local community only if it included the core, the new Rule contains no such requirement, and the NCUA notes in the Rule's preamble that the core requirement is eliminated.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 88,414, 88,440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Rule also eliminates the requirement from the 2010 rule that a Core-Based Statistical Area can form the basis for a local community only if the Core-Based Statistical Area as a whole contains no more than 2.5 million people.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Now, the\n   <em>\n    portion\n   </em>\n   of the Core-Based Statistical Area can contain no more than 2.5 million people, but the Core-Based Statistical Area itself can be any size. According to the NCUA, the 2010 rule inadvertently misstated the appropriate population limit and thus the population-limit increase in the Rule is merely a \"technical remedy\" to correct that mistake.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n    at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,414 ; Hr'g Tr. at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court's review of the Rule's definitional decisions regarding Core-Based Statistical Areas is limited to the absence of a core requirement. The complaint referred to the population-limit increase, Compl. \u00b6 53, but to the extent that the ABA challenges the Rule on that basis, the claim is waived because the issue was not raised during the notice-and-comment rulemaking process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koretoff v. Vilsack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3536408,3661878\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/394/\">\n    707 F.3d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\"A party will normally forfeit an opportunity to challenge an agency rulemaking on a ground that was not first presented to the agency for its initial consideration.\" (quotation marks omitted) );\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 88,414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that no commenter opposed the population-limit increase). It is worth noting, however, that because of the population-limit increase, the Rule now automatically qualifies portions of ten of the largest Core-Based Statistical Areas (those with more than 2.5 million people and with no Metropolitan Division) as belonging to a single\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   . And in conjunction with the elimination of the core requirement, the population-limit increase qualifies even portions drawn exclusively from the perimeter of those large Core-Based Statistical Areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On the absence of a core requirement, the ABA argues that the core is what united the Core-Based Statistical Area to begin with, so a Core-Based Statistical Area without a core cannot belong to a\n   <em>\n    local community. See\n   </em>\n   ABA Br. at 33-34, Dkt. 14-1. This argument is unconvincing. The Act contains nothing to suggest that a service area encompassing only part of a local community is off limits. Removing the core, moreover, actually\n   <em>\n    decreases\n   </em>\n   the geographic size of a service area based on a Core-Based Statistical Area-after all, the area of a circle becomes smaller when a donut hole is carved out. And the absence of the core does not alter the other residents' common bond. If residents of Arlington, Virginia and Bethesda, Maryland are part of the same local community, that is so because of commonalities based on their shared vicinity to Washington, D.C. These commonalities are unaffected by the absence of the D.C. core from a credit union's service map. In other words, Arlington and Bethesda residents share the common bond of residing in suburban D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   regardless of whether D.C. residents are part of their credit union's service area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The absence of the core requirement is nonetheless troubling, however, because it allows for geographically larger\n   <em>\n    local communities\n   </em>\n   . If the core requirement were in place, a credit union seeking to serve the Chicago Core-Based Statistical Area, for example, would not be able to reach past the core itself because the core's population is above the 2.5 million-person limit. But without the core requirement and with the removal of the population limitation for Core-Based Statistical Areas or their Metropolitan Divisions, a credit union can now reach the outer boundaries of the largest Core-Based Statistical Areas or their Metropolitan Divisions, as long as the credit union serves no more than 2.5 million people. For example, the Rule describes residents of Reliance, Virginia (at the western edge of the red area) and residents of Lusby, Maryland (at the southeastern edge of the red area) as part of a single local community even though they live about 140 miles from each other-a drive of more than two hours:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Similarly, the Rule defines Shelby, Texas and Anahuac, Texas as part of a single local community although parts of those towns are 160 miles and more than 2.5 hours from each other; both towns are within the Houston Core-Based Statistical Area and are connected by a contiguous area with a population below 2.5 million. As with Combined Statistical Areas, any such portion of a Core-Based Statistical Area or one of its Metropolitan Divisions automatically qualifies as part of a single local community under the Rule. As a result, the NCUA cannot prevent a gerrymandering credit union from serving the far-flung perimeter of the largest Core-Based Statistical Areas or their Metropolitan Divisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Such a capacious definition of\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   is jarring, to say the least. Although 25 percent of the workers in each constituent county commute to the core, the corollary is that up to 75 percent of\n   each county's workers do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   make that commute and may have no ties to the core (much less to a remote town on the opposite side of the core) beyond regional proximity. Also, unlike distant commuters, people who live in the same city or county-the areas normally associated with the term\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   -often share other communal ties. They are likely to vote in the same mayoral race, frequent the same parks, suffer the same potholes, or enroll their children in a common school district or sports league. Finally, even if it is granted that residents of Reliance and Lusby share community because a quarter of both of their counties work in the same core, they do not necessarily share a\n   <em>\n    local\n   </em>\n   community. It is possible, that is, to leave one's local community to commute to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Nonetheless, the towns in these examples can reasonably be thought to contain at least some traces of the social, economic, and geographic commonalities of a local community. At least 25 percent of the workers in Reliance's and Lusby's counties share the commonality of commuting to the D.C. core. 75 Fed. Reg. at 37,250. As even the ABA acknowledges, that is \"pretty substantial commuting activity.\" Hr'g Tr. at 7. The commuting metric ensures that a service area's constituent counties are all within a feasible commuting radius of the core, which means that the service area shares at least some geographic ties and cannot expand without limit. Also, the OMB uses shared commuting activity as a proxy for extensive social and economic commonalities, an inference that the NCUA has adopted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   75 Fed.

Moreover, the NCUA did consider the policy and concluded-based on its experience reviewing business and marketing plans since 2010-that credit unions were adequately serving low-income areas and would continue to do so without the core requirement, perhaps even \"more effectively.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Adjacent Areas\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Next, the Rule allows a credit union serving a Single Political Jurisdiction, Core-Based Statistical Area, or Combined Statistical Area to add an adjacent area if the credit union can demonstrate that a \"sufficient level of interaction\" exists between the adjacent area and the already-served area such that the proposed service area \"meets the requirements for being a local community.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88,440. The ABA's challenge to this aspect of the Rule fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Unlike the Rule's provisions that automatically qualify certain areas as belonging to a\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   , the adjacent-area provision has no definitional import. Instead it allows credit unions to submit documentation in support of a proposed service area, and the NCUA then decides on a case-by-case basis whether the proposed area belongs to a single local community. It is only after the NCUA evaluates an application that a definitional decision is made. While these individual decisions can be challenged, the ABA's current facial attack loses because individual applications might propose service areas well within a reasonable definition of\n   <em>\n    local community\n   </em>\n   . For example, a credit union serving Bethesda might apply to add neighboring Chevy Chase, and the NCUA's approval of that application would be unlikely to contradict the Act. If a credit union serving a local community does not initially serve the entire community, that is, the Act does not prohibit expansion into a greater portion of the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Neither is the adjacent-area provision arbitrary and capricious. The NCUA considered the relevant factors and articulated an adequate explanation for its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771666,5881894\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/67/\">\n    684 F.3d at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Rule establishes that when evaluating a proposed adjacent area, the NCUA will consider whether the quintessential characteristics of a local community are present, including economic interdependence, related industries, intertwined traffic flows, shared governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, common educational institutions, and shared public services such as common police or fire protection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n    at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,415 &amp; n.33;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2076%2C748\">\n    80 Fed.

But because the statute allows the NCUA to define the term only within the bounds of reason, the interpretive question still requires reference to the standard meaning of\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   as used in the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That meaning was not altered by the grant of definitional authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The parties do not dispute that in 1934 the word\n   <em>\n    rural\n   </em>\n   meant what it means now-the pastoral countryside, as opposed to an urban area.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1934); Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, New Edition (1929). Their dispute is over how large a\n   <em>\n    district\n   </em>\n   can be when\n   <em>\n    rural\n   </em>\n   modifies it, and whether a district can be considered rural if most of the district's residents live in urban areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Dictionaries from around 1934 indicate that some areas described as\n   <em>\n    districts\n   </em>\n   were geographically expansive. They cite as examples the\n   <em>\n    District of Kentucky, District of Alaska\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    District of Maine\n   </em>\n   (as those areas were known when not yet states).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 The Oxford English Dictionary (1933); 2 Dictionary of American English (1940). One dictionary defines\n   <em>\n    district\n   </em>\n   as a \"region or territory whose limits and dimensions are approximately those of a state,\" or alternatively as an \"extensive area, tract, or region having limits only vaguely defined.\" 2 Dictionary of American English (1940). Another dictionary defines\n   <em>\n    district\n   </em>\n   as \"[a]ny portion of territory of undefined extent; region.\" Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (4th ed. 1931). Some definitions provide examples of much smaller districts, but others are quite large.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   But geographically broad definitions of\n   <em>\n    district\n   </em>\n   do not necessarily mean that a\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   could be broad. It would be a mistake to conclude from these broad definitions that a\n   <em>\n    school district\n   </em>\n   , for example, could cover an entire state. And while few 1934-era dictionaries define the\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   term, those that do suggest that rural districts were smaller than a county. Webster's Second provides this definition of\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   : \"In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, a subdivision of an administrative county embracing usually several country parishes.\" Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1934);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Funk &amp; Wagnell's New Standard Dictionary of the English Language (1913) (similar). This definition has limited probative\n   value because it reports non-American usage, but its presence in American dictionaries suggests some degree of American familiarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Relying on the fact that no dictionary definition for American usage of\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   exists, the NCUA argues that in America the phrase meant no more than the sum of its component words. Hr'g Tr. at 30. According to the NCUA, in other words, if an area was both\n   <em>\n    rural\n   </em>\n   and a\n   <em>\n    district\n   </em>\n   , it could fairly be considered a\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   . The Supreme Court has addressed precisely this question-whether a multi-word phrase carries distinct meaning-by \"survey[ing] modern press usage\" with a search of \"computerized newspaper databases-both the New York Times database in Lexis/Nexis, and the US News database in Westlaw.\"\n   <em>\n    Muscarello v.

Those databases contain virtually no record of 1934-era language usage, but a more robust database indicates that the phrase\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   was used with some frequency in the first half of the twentieth century before mostly falling out of usage in the second half.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This suggests that even if\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   does not carry meaning distinct from its individual words today, it did in 1934.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Usage of\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   in 1934-era judicial opinions also suggests that the term carried distinct meaning-and that it referred to areas much smaller than a state.

As noted, the term\n   <em>\n    neighborhood\n   </em>\n   referred to an area smaller than a city.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1. And the term\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   referred to areas under \"the same local laws\" and not to \"large geographical areas\" with \"widely diverse interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    Lukens Steel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1046150\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/107/627/#p631\">\n    107 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   631 ; 2 The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia (1911).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Yet the Rule defines certain areas significantly larger than most states as belonging to a single\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   . Here are three examples, shaded in red, blue, and yellow, of areas that qualify under the Rule:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Associations Amicus Br. at 22-24, 34-41, Dkt. 18. The red area includes most of Nevada along with portions of four adjoining states; the blue area includes Wyoming and portions of six adjoining states; and the yellow area includes portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico. Each area has a population density well under 100 persons per square mile.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1046150\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/107/627/#p631\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Not only are these areas geographically expansive, they also capture numerous urban centers. The yellow area, for example, includes the Amarillo, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area, which has a population of more than 250,000 people. The Rule's rurality requirement originated in a previous iteration of the regulation and is not challenged here, but its low threshold exacerbates the deficiencies of the Rule's population-limit increase. It is the combination of the rurality requirement and the population-limit increase that qualifies Amarillo as part of a rural district. Similarly, because of the population-limit increase, the state of Wyoming now qualifies as belonging to a rural district even though 57 percent of the state's residents live in urban areas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ABA Br. at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As with other challenged provisions of the Rule, the NCUA left itself no escape hatch for fielding\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   applications. As long as a credit union's proposed service area meets the Rule's population and rurality requirements, the Rule automatically characterizes the area as a\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   -no matter its geographic size or the number or size of metropolitan areas falling within its proposed boundaries. And a definition of\n   <em>\n    rural district\n   </em>\n   that includes the expansive areas illustrated above is not even in the ballpark of the term's standard meaning. Because the Rule automatically qualifies areas larger than states as\n   <em>\n    rural districts\n   </em>\n   even though the term commonly referred to areas smaller than a county, the NCUA's definitional decision is unreasonable\n   and manifestly contrary to the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part the ABA's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 14, and the Court grants in part and denies in part the NCUA's cross-motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 19.

The Constitution requires the federal government to protect a state from \"domestic violence\" upon the state's request. U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 4. Scholars agree that this use of\n    <em>\n     domestic violence\n    </em>\n    refers to rioting or insurrection from within a state. Now, however, the term is commonly used to refer to abuse inside the home, as opposed to civil unrest. An inquiry into the reasonableness of a definition for\n    <em>\n     domestic violence\n    </em>\n    as used in the Constitution would require a comparison to the term's original meaning, not its modern meaning.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    For more examples of definitions suggesting a potentially expansive geographic scope, see Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1934) (defining\n    <em>\n     district\n    </em>\n    as \"[a] division of territory; a defined portion of a state, county, country, town, or city, etc., made for administrative, electoral, or other purposes ....\"); American College Dictionary (1949) (\"[A] region or locality.\"); 2 Dictionary of American English (1940) (\"Any one of the various areas, differing greatly in size, regarded as an election or administrative unit ....\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2088%2C412\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citing Illinois and Ohio as examples of the \"extensive area[s]\" regarded as districts for Methodist religious work).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    For examples of definitions suggesting a narrower geographic scope, see 3 The Oxford English Dictionary (1933) (\"In U.S. used in various specific and local senses ....
