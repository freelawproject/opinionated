Defendants move to stay the proceedings on the ground that the EEOC allegedly failed to engage in the informal conciliation process mandated by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5, which is a condition precedent to an EEOC lawsuit. Defendants also move to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing that the Complaint fails to adequately allege that Vicari is a \"qualified individual\" under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court declines to issue a stay but grants the motion to dismiss. Defendants fail to meet their burden as movants of showing that a stay is warranted. This court does, however, dismiss the Complaint because it fails to allege facts tending to show that Vicari is a qualified individual under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Congress left to the EEOC such strategic decisions as whether to make a bare-minimum offer, to lay all its cards on the table, or to respond to each of an employer's counter-offers, however far afield. So too Congress granted the EEOC discretion over the pace and duration of conciliation efforts, the plasticity or firmness of its negotiating positions, and the content of its demands for relief.

At the hearing on the present motion, the EEOC noted that\n   it was relying on direct evidence of disability discrimination. But even in a direct evidence case, an individual claimant must be a qualified individual.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v.

The court has no basis on the present record for determining that this is a \"generally known\" matter. Fed. R. Evid. 201.
