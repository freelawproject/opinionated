A non-jury trial was held on October 23 and October 24, 2017. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Findings of Fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters charters the Union which is governed by the Local 776 Union Bylaws. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P-1 at 1-2). The Union's executive board consists of the following positions: president, vice president, secretary-treasurer, recording secretary, and three trustees. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 7; P-1 at 3-8). Business agents and stewards assist the executive board in the daily governance of the Union and administration of the bylaws. (P-1 at 8). The bylaws provide for election of executive board\n   members and business agents by the membership every three years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). The International Brotherhood of Teamsters supplies local unions with a \"working Manual\" designed to guide each local union in developing its own policies and procedures. (D-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The executive board must meet monthly and the recording secretary takes down the minutes. (Doc. 54 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). A majority vote is required for all executive board decisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). The president casts the deciding vote on any question when a tie occurs. (P-1 at 3; 10/23/17 Trial Tr. 121:7-11). The executive board's monthly meeting minutes are read aloud at general membership meetings but are not subject to general membership approval. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 9). At each executive board meeting, the previous meeting's minutes are reviewed and accepted with corrections as necessary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   P-60). Members have a right of access to information concerning the conduct of the Union's business. (P-1 at 35). The secretary-treasurer is required to provide access to Union records to any member during normal business hours upon request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Union administers and contributes to an employee pension benefit plan subject to ERISA. (Doc. 54 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). The executive board is authorized to set the terms and conditions of union employment including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , unilaterally changing retirement benefits. (P-1 at 16);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eckert v. Chauffeurs, Teamsters &amp; Helpers Local Union 776 Profit Sharing Plan\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-1920,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20959340\">\n    2017 WL 959340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 13, 2017). The Union designates trustees to administer the benefit plan. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 10). The plan is funded solely through employer contributions and investment income, and contributions made to the plan in a particular year are allocated among participants' accounts according to a salary-based formula. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6). Participants may request distribution from the plan upon retirement or separation from covered employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The 2008 Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to 2008, the Union provided retirement benefits to employees through participation in the Joint Council 53 retirement trust. (P-3). On May 5, 2008, the executive board voted to withdraw from the Joint Council 53 retirement plan and establish an alternative plan for Union employees. (P-4 at 1; P-60 at 5/5/08). Hicks served as a Union trustee from January 2008 until his resignation in 2009, and he attended the May 5, 2008 meeting. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 95:17-97:23). Thompson served as a business agent from 2008 through 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:9-13, 36:6-7, 71:19-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After withdrawing from the Joint Council 53 trust, the Union implemented an adoption agreement and summary plan description for a new retirement benefit plan (hereinafter the \"Plan\") on December 20, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P-5; P-6). The Plan was retroactively effective on January 1, 2008. (P-5 at 1; P-6 at 1). An employee became eligible to participate in the Plan after completing one year (1,000 hours) of covered service. (P-5 at 1; P-6 at 2). The executive board waived this one-year-of-service requirement for anyone employed by the Union as of the Plan's January 1, 2008 effective date. (P-5 at 1; P-6 at 2). On March 23, 2009, the executive board approved a Plan restatement which retained the one-year-of-service requirement waiver for employees hired on or before January 1, 2008. (P-9 at 1, 23; P-10 at 5; 10/23/17 Trial Tr. 102:3-12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   P-11). After approving the 2009 restatement, the executive board amended the Plan in November 2009 and twice in 2011. (P-12; P-13; P-14). The executive board meeting minutes make no mention of the 2009 restatement\n   or the Plan amendments in 2009 and 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   P-61;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   10/23/17 Trial Tr. 61:7-63:4, 103:18-105:23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The 2012 Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Union held its regularly scheduled election of executive board members and business agents in October 2011. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 11). The following officials were elected to a three-year term beginning January 1, 2012 and concluding December 31, 2014: President Fred Wilson, Vice President John White (\"White\"), Secretary-Treasurer Mario Garofalo, Recording Secretary Herbert Garber, and Trustees Robert Green (\"Green\"), Joe Thevenin (\"Thevenin\"), and Chad Turns (\"Turns\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; 10/23/17 Trial Tr. 178:14-18; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 57:3-10; Green Dep. 5:6-25; Turns Dep. 5:24-6:8). Upon taking office, the executive board hired Karen Dietz (\"Dietz\") as secretary to the Union president. (P-60 at 1/3/12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 54 \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The new executive board received two main grievances from Union employees about their pension benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , newly elected and appointed Union employees complained that they were losing a year of benefits in the absence of a waiver addressing the one-year-of-service requirement. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 122:2-20, 129:22-130:2; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 8:18-21, 35:23-36:15, 57:16-22, 81:20-82:8, 105:16-106:4).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , some employees feared a degradation of their pension benefits because they were compelled to make investment decisions without professional guidance. (10/24/17 Trial Tr. 6:24-7:6). The executive board charged Garofalo as secretary-treasurer with exploring solutions to these concerns. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 122:20-25; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 8:22-9:4, 57:23-58:13, 80:8-18, 82:9-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the conclusion of his investigation, Garofalo presented two recommendations to the Union executive board. He proposed moving the Union's retirement investments to Merrill Lynch to address employee concerns regarding investment decisions. (10/24/17 Trial Tr. 7:19-8:17, 80:8-81:8). The executive board approved this recommendation and the Union's retirement investments were transferred to Merrill Lynch in June 2012. (P-60 at 6/4/12). Garofalo also recommended establishing an amended or restated pension plan which would mirror the 2009 restatement but include a waiver of the one-year-of-service requirement for anyone employed on or before September 1, 2012. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 129:1-2; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 9:5-16). To achieve this objective, the executive board retained Continental Benefit Group Continental Benefit Group (\"Continental\") as the new third party contract administrator for the Plan. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   10/24/17 Trial Tr. 26:5-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Continental drafted a proposal that reflected a waiver of the one-year-of-service requirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). The summary plan description stated in relevant part: \"[I]f you were an eligible employee as of September 1, 2012, you shall become a participant as of that date for purposes of Employer Discretionary Contributions.\" (P-18 at 2). At the July 2, 2012 executive board meeting, Garofalo provided each board member with a copy of the proposal and supporting documents. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 127:6-129:5; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 9:20-25, 10:19-11:5, 31:14-15;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   P-17; P-18; P-19). The executive board members reviewed the proposed documents, discussed the various amended provisions and the\n   cost to the Union of the one-year-of-service requirement waiver, and voted to approve the 2012 Plan amendment. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 127:14-130:21, 135:4-136:13, 180:4-183:19; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 11:6-18, 14:6-15:14, 53:2-13, 59:3-61:16, 70:1-12, 82:21-85:6, 97:21-24, 99:2-14, 108:20-109:12; Green Dep. 7:5-8:3, 9:24-11:5; Turns Dep. 11:6-17, 8:20-9:14, 21:4-18, 37:25-38:7, 72:3-21; P-15 at 3; P-60 at 7/2/12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The waiver affected members of the executive board who participated in the Plan as well as office personnel. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 65:24-66:21, 186:17-25; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 99:2-11). Executive board members White, Thevenin, Green, and Turns each voted to approve the 2012 Plan amendment but did not personally benefit because they did not participate in the Plan. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 186:9-16; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 15:15-19, 62:23-24; Green Dep. 9:9-23; Turns Dep. 11:16-24). The executive board appointed Garofalo and Turns as Plan trustees, and both signed the adoption agreement on August 17, 2012. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 13; P-17 at 10; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 10:1-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Garber read the July 2, 2012 executive board meeting minutes aloud at the July and August 2012 general membership meetings. (P-61 at 7/8/12, 8/13/12). The minutes included an entry that the motion to \"approve the pension paperwork for Local Union Officers, Business Agents and Office Staff\" carried. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thompson inquired whether the pension company and policies for office staff changed at the September 2012 general membership meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9/9/12). Garofalo responded that the Union \"changed companies, but kept the same terms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hicks was also present at the September 2012 general membership meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thompson and other Union members inquired about the pension plan changes at multiple meetings throughout plaintiffs' 2012 to 2014 tenure on the executive board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10/14/12, 2/10/13, 10/6/13, 7/13/14, 8/10/14). At the February 2013 and August 2014 general membership meetings, Garofalo answered questions about the vesting provisions and qualifications to participate in the Plan as well as the source of funding thereof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2/10/13). Thompson testified that the executive board responded to questions about the vesting provision by saying \"[w]e did the same thing you did,\" referring to the waiver in the original 2008 version of the Plan. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 70:7-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Request for Distribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Union held regularly scheduled elections in October 2014. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 16). Plaintiffs ran for reelection but were divided between two opposing slates of candidates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thompson and Hicks ran on a third slate for president and secretary-treasurer, respectively. (P-61 at 9/14/14; 10/24/17 Trial Tr. 90:4-20). Plaintiffs' two slates lost the election to Thompson's slate. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. P-61 at 1/11/15). Following the election, the general membership voted to prohibit payment of any pension benefits to outgoing officers and business agents until the incoming executive board had \"an opportunity to review all such proposed expenditures and policies and make an appropriate report and recommendation to the [membership].\" (P-61 at 12/14/14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs' Union employment terminated on December 31, 2014; Dietz's last day was January 2, 2015. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 17). Each plaintiff requested a distribution from the Plan in January 2015 after leaving office; Dietz requested her distribution in May 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 18). The new executive board voted to designate Thompson and Hicks as Plan trustees and amend the Plan accordingly in February 2015. (P-60 at 2/2/15; 10/23/17 Trial Tr. 58:5-14). After receiving\n   plaintiffs' requests for distribution, Thompson and Hicks reviewed the 2012 Plan documents and the July 2, 2012 executive board meeting minutes. (10/23/17 Trial Tr. 19:24-20:1, 28:1-16, 30:18-31:7, 90:11-14, 91:25-93:9; Doc. 54 \u00b6 19). Thompson and Hicks sent each plaintiff a letter in February 2015 indicating the Plan would distribute each plaintiff's respective account balance less any contributions and associated earnings attributable to their first year of covered service. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 19; P-31; 10/23/17 Trial Tr. 90:3-10). Each letter explained that benefits for the first year of covered service were denied because the board was \"unable to locate any records of [the Union] indicating that the [ ] modification in employment service requirements for commencement of plan participation was properly approved.\" (P-31; 10/23/17 Trial Tr. 21:12-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs timely appealed the decision denying contributions and associated earnings for their first year of Union employment. (Doc. 54 \u00b6 22). The Plan invited plaintiffs to submit additional information and documentation in support of their appeals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). Plaintiffs subsequently provided Thompson and Hicks with affidavits attesting that the 2012-2014 executive board approved the new Plan amendment and the one-year-of-service requirement waiver in 2012, as well as Garber's handwritten notes from the July 2, 2012 executive board meeting. (P-37; P-38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   P-15; P-45; P-46; P-48; P-50). Plaintiffs filed their instant complaint on October 2, 2015 before defendants issued a determination on plaintiffs' appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 54 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25). Defendants denied plaintiffs' appeal ten days later. (P-39; 10/23/17 Trial Tr. 48:20-49:5, 94:23-95:14). Plaintiffs' individual pension benefit accounts with the Plan contained a combined total of $161,630.94 in principal and investment income as of September 30, 2017. (P-62;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Conclusions of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs aver that the Plan and the Union, as Plan administrator, violated ERISA by failing to pay contributions and associated earnings for plaintiffs' first year of employment service. Plaintiffs further argue that the Union, Thompson, and Hicks breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA. Defendants assert that Garofalo breached his fiduciary duties as Plan trustee under ERISA and that Garber, Garofalo, and Wilson breached their fiduciary duty under LMRDA.

The executive board authorized Garofalo to investigate possible solutions to the gap in pension benefits for newly elected or appointed Union employees. Garofalo ultimately recommended establishing an amended or restated pension plan for Union employees that would substantially mirror the 2009 restatement. To specifically address employee concerns regarding the gap in pension benefits, the proposed Plan amendment included a waiver of the one-year-of-service provision. Modeled on the 2008 version of the Plan, the 2012 iteration specifically waived the requirement for anyone employed on or before September 1, 2012. The court finds credible plaintiffs' testimony that the executive board reviewed the proposal documents, discussed any concerns with the Plan amendment's provisions and costs, and voted to approve the 2012 revisions at the July 2, 2012 executive board meeting pursuant to its authority under the Union bylaws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Union and the Plan, through trustees Thompson and Hicks, did not deny plaintiffs benefits for their first year of service pursuant to a grant of discretionary authority under the Plan.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conkright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581875,12448253\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/506/\">\n    559 U.S. at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581875,12448253\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/506/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Per contra\n   </em>\n   , both Thompson and Hicks testified that they denied these benefits because they believed the 2012 version of the Plan was invalid.

The unelected office staff expressed apprehension about making investment decisions absent professional guidance under the existing Plan iteration. Both elected and appointed Union employees viewed the one-year-of-service requirement as an unnecessary penalty conjoined to acceptance of formal positions within the Union. These issues expressed by Plan participants and beneficiaries motivated Garofalo's investigation of potential solutions. The investigation resulted in recommendations that the Plan: (1) appoint Merrill Lynch as investment advisor, (2) change the Plan's contract administrator to Continental, and (3) adopt the one-year-of-service requirement waiver. We find that Garofalo's recommendations to the executive board were in the best interests of the Plan participants and beneficiaries, and entirely consistent with his fiduciary duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delta Star\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11501318\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/76/617/#p636\">\n    76 F.Supp.2d at 636-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Moreover, Garofalo did not breach his fiduciary duty of loyalty by incidentally benefiting from his vote to approve the 2012 Plan amendment. As a covered employee, he was ineligible under the existing version of the Plan to receive contributions to his pension account because he had less than one year of Union employment. The 2012 waiver of the one-year-of-service requirement enabled Garofalo to receive contributions to his pension account from the Union.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Docs. 45-4, 58). Hence, the court finds that defendants have effectively waived any defense to plaintiffs' argument that their counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty under LMRDA is barred by laches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Angio v.

Even if defendants had not waived their opposition to the laches defense, the court would nevertheless agree with plaintiffs. The executive board approved the Plan amendment on July 2, 2012 and trustees Garofalo and Turns signed the Plan documents on August 17, 2012. Defendants became aware of the 2012 amendment to the Plan during the July 8, 2012 general membership meeting. Defendants filed their LMRDA counterclaim on June 7, 2016, (Doc. 27), long after the analogous two year statute of limitations expired. Vesting provisions were specifically discussed at the February 10, 2013 general membership meeting, yet Thompson and Hicks never requested access to the 2012 Plan documents despite their undisputed right as members to access Union documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20WL%20675461\">\n    1994 WL 675461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.

The court further finds in favor of defendants on plaintiffs' ERISA claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the Union, Thompson, and Hicks. The court will award damages for pension benefits for plaintiffs' first year of covered service as Union employees in the amount of $161,630.94.

The July 2, 2012 executive board meeting minutes clearly state that pension paperwork was approved. The court observes that no binding authority exists that mandates the executive board list each specific plan provision in the executive board meeting minutes in order for the plan to be validly enacted. (\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    P-60 at 5/5/08\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20WL%20675461\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 7/2/12). Defendants point to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' policies and procedures manual but this manual is advisory. (D-8 at 2).
