(\"CSS\") filed a Complaint [ECF No. 1] against Christopher Herrington, Gene Yoho, and Compiled Technologies, LLC (collectively, \"Defendants\"). On September 16, 2016, CSS filed its First Amended Complaint [ECF No. 59] against the Defendants, alleging copyright infringement, breach of contract, violation of the duty of loyalty, tortious interference with business relationships, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation of trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CSS is a company that provides software and related support services to county clerks' offices in West Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr., Jan. 25, 2017, Auburn Direct, 28:1-9.

First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-39. Specifically, CSS alleges that CT's software programs, which were developed by Christopher Herrington, are substantially similar to CSS's copyrighted programs. CSS also alleges that Christopher Herrington breached the Confidentiality Agreement by using confidential information to create, market, and sell software and support services to CSS's customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.

Finally, CSS seeks a declaratory judgment that, under the \"works for hire\" doctrine, CSS is the author of any computer programs developed by Christopher Herrington during his employment with CSS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 23, 2016, CSS filed Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 65], wherein it asserted that it was likely to succeed on the merits of its copyright infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of contract claims. The court conducted a hearing on the Plaintiff's Motion on January 25, February 23, and February 24, 2017. On August 1, 2017, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order [ECF No. 209] denying the Plaintiff's Motion. On August 4, 2017, the court issued an Amended Memorandum Opinion and Order (\"Prelim. Inj. Op.\") [ECF No. 213] that corrected clerical errors in the earlier Opinion. In denying the Plaintiff's Motion, the court found that CSS was not likely to succeed on its claims for copyright infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, or breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 27, 2017, the Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 123] and a Memorandum in Support of the motion [ECF No. 124]. On May 11, 2017, CSS filed a Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 130]. On May 18, 2017, the Defendants filed their Reply [ECF No. 134]. Thus, the Defendants' Motion is ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The back end of CSS-Index is comprised of the following components: CSS Network Communication Interface (VanGUI), CSS-Index Application Server, CSS-Index Persistent Data Repository, CSS Data Bridge (Relativity), and CSS-Index Reporting Data Repository. The front end communicates with the back end using the CSS Network Communication Interface (VanGUI) which runs over TCP sockets.

In the name search algorithm, the use of a \"letters-only\" style search is an idea, not copyrightable expression. Moreover, this type of search algorithm is unoriginal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zeidman Expert Report 32 (\"This method of searching for names by letters only is well known in the field.\"). Therefore, the method of searching data files by removing spaces and punctuation is not copyrightable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Similarly, in the case of the login validation/password change algorithm, the decision to combine the login validation and the password change features into a single entry point or \"action\" is an idea, not copyrightable expression. And again, this combination of features is unoriginal. Mr. McCasker testified at the hearing that \"Windows XP actually has the same kind of user interface.\" Hr'g Tr., Jan. 25, 2017, McCasker Direct, 138:3-4. Mr. Zeidman noted in his report that \"[t]his is evidence that this technique is well-known in the industry.\" Zeidman Expert Report 33.

Nor does Mr. McCasker's report identify any similarities between CSS's and CT's programs that could qualify as protected expression. Therefore, I\n   <strong>\n    FIND\n   </strong>\n   that, with respect to the\n   <em>\n    protected expression\n   </em>\n   contained within CSS's three software programs, CT's programs are not substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

At that stage of the litigation, where the plaintiff was seeking a preliminary injunction against the Defendants, the court was more concerned with whether CSS had produced enough evidence of breach to show that it was likely to succeed on the merits than it was with the legal enforceability of the Agreement. Now, where the Defendants seek summary judgment, CSS is only required to produce more than a mere \"scintilla of evidence\" to defeat the motion.\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p249\">\n     477 U.S. at 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p249\">\n     106 S.Ct. 2505\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, determining the legal enforceability of the Confidentiality Agreement is imperative.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    Subsection (2) of the definition of \"work made for hire\" deals with specially commissioned works, and is not relevant to the facts of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    Although I indicated that there may be some disputes of fact related to the declaratory judgment claim, these facts are immaterial because I have found that CSS is unable to establish an essential element of the work-for-hire test. Regarding that essential element (i.e., whether Christopher Herrington's computer programs were prepared within the scope of his employment), there is no genuine dispute of any material fact.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
