(Docket No. 396). Relying primarily on two Second Circuit decisions decided after this Court's prior Opinion, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing with respect to a subset of the antitrust claims alleged in the SAC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 397 (\"Defts.' Joint Mem.\"), at 1-4). Two Defendants-Nomura Securities and Wells Fargo-move separately to dismiss Plaintiffs' state-law breach-of-contract and unjust-enrichment claims against them. (Docket Nos. 398 &amp; 401). Finally, responding in part to Nomura Securities's motion, Plaintiffs move to amend their complaint to add Nomura Global Financial Products, Inc. (\"NGFP\") as a Defendant. (Docket No. 417 (\"Pls' Mot. to Amend\") ). For the reasons discussed below, Defendants' joint motion to dismiss is DENIED; Nomura Securities's motion is GRANTED; Plaintiffs' motion to amend is also DENIED; and Wells Fargo's motion is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant background is set forth at length in the Court's prior Opinion and Order,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alaska Elec.

To the extent these motions implicate additional facts, laid out below, those facts are taken from the SAC, documents referenced therein, and matters of which the Court can take judicial notice. For purposes of this motion, the SAC's allegations are assumed to be true and are viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs as the non-moving parties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kleinman v.

They allege that Defendants-large banks that dominate the market for interest-rate derivatives and set ISDAfix rates (collectively, the \"Defendant Banks\"), and ICAP Markets LLC (\"ICAP\"), an interdealer broker that served, until January 26, 2014, as the administrator in charge of setting the ISDAfix rates-engaged in a longstanding conspiracy to manipulate ISDAfix rates so as to extract higher profits from interest rate swaps and \"swaptions.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-25). Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the Defendant Banks conspired by (1) agreeing to \"rubberstamp\" the ISDAfix reference rate posted daily by ICAP at 11:02 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 115); (2) manipulating the reference rate itself by flooding the swaps market with interdealer transactions just before 11 a.m. to achieve the desired rate-a process known as \"banging the close\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 158, 160-61); and (3) having ICAP simply set the reference rate at a predetermined level when \"banging the close\" failed to achieve the desired rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 150 n.70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As noted, Defendants previously moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under Section One of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Docket No. 173). To the extent relevant here, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs lacked \"antitrust standing\"-specifically, that they failed to allege \"antitrust injury\" and to demonstrate that they are \"efficient enforcers\" of the antitrust laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-30). The Court rejected those arguments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alaska Elec.

In addition, Nomura and Wells Fargo move to dismiss Plaintiffs' state-law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, alleging that Plaintiffs fail to allege any contract or counterparty relationship with them. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 398, 399 (\"Wells Fargo Mem.\"), 401, 402 (\"Nomura Mem.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Defendant Banks' motions are brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint and requires a court to determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a plausible claim for relief.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Here, Plaintiffs allege that all vanilla swaps-including those entered by non-dealers-were sensitive to the price changes that resulted from the Defendant Banks' alleged \"banging the close.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 231-36). And in support of that allegation, the SAC describes a convergence during 2013 (the end of the alleged conspiracy) of the ISDAfix rate and the overall market swap rate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 195). In response, Defendants claim that Plaintiffs demonstrate \"that ISDAFIX rates during the Class Period\" were in fact \"disjointed from 'market swap rates,' \" thereby proving that interdealer and non-interdealer swaps exist in separate markets (because \"a market cannot diverge from itself\"). (Docket No. 425 (\"Defts.' Joint Reply\"), at 6 (citing SAC \u00b6 195) ). But Plaintiffs do not allege that the swaps market and ISDAfix rates simultaneously diverged from each other, as Defendants imply. Instead, they allege that there was a \"consistent gap\" in rates calculated between the \"market rate leading up to 11:00 a.m.\" and the ISDAfix rate, which was set just before or during the first two minutes of the polling window (11:00 to 11:02 a.m.). (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 145, 161, 195). In a normally \"competitive market,\" swap rates calculated two to five minutes before the polling window should presumably have been consistent with the ISDAfix rate. The fact that the rate calculated at 10:55 a.m. consistently diverged from the ISDAfix rate is arguably evidence, therefore, that the swap rates were manipulated-through \"a series of rapid-fire trades\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158) or by ICAP itself (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150 n.69)-just before or during the first two minutes of the polling window (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Other factual allegations in the SAC help explain why non-interdealer swap prices would be sensitive to changes in interdealer swap prices. First, although Plaintiffs could not \" 'switch' to the interdealer market, which was limited to banks,\" (Defts.' Joint Reply 6), the banks themselves could switch between interdealer and non-interdealer swaps on either the buy or sell side (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 62, 77 n.25; Defts.'

But the \"inextricably intertwined\" doctrine is at issue where a plaintiff seeks to hold a defendant liable for the effects of alleged manipulation in a market other than the one in which the defendant participates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352261\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/151/#p158\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352261\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/151/#p158\">\n    at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the SAC alleges that Defendants participated in\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the market in ISDAfix transactions and the market in vanilla swaps. Accordingly, there is no need for Plaintiffs to resort to the \"inextricably intertwined\" doctrine. Relatedly,\n   <em>\n    Aluminum I\n   </em>\n   -upon which Defendants principally rely in bringing their new motion-does not speak to the question of how to define the relevant market, which is the critical question here. To the contrary, the plaintiffs in that case had \"disavow[ed] participation in any of the markets in which the defendants operate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352261\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/151/#p158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352261\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/151/#p158\">\n    at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs expressly allege that Defendants were price-fixing vanilla swaps and that they participated in the same market when they bought such swaps from Defendants. Whether or not the evidence supports Plaintiffs' claims in this case, those claims, as pleaded, are much more straightforward than the claims were in\n   <em>\n    Aluminum I\n   </em>\n   and easily analyzed under traditional antitrust injury requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gatt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804516\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/68/#p75\">\n    711 F.3d at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants' other arguments likewise fall short. For instance, Defendants suggest that interdealer and non-interdealer swaps do not share a market because vanilla swaps involve \"contract[s] whose terms are dictated by a number of factors\" and are therefore not fungible. (Defts.' Joint Mem. 10). Taken to its logical conclusion, however, that argument would suggest that there is no market for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   kind of vanilla swaps, which is nonsensical. Additionally, the only relevant non-fungible factor distinguishing interdealer from non-interdealer\n   swaps contracts that Defendants identify is the effect of \"counterparty risk\" on their terms.

Here, Plaintiffs' theory of injury-that Defendants' efforts to manipulate the swaps market in order to move the ISDAfix rate in the desired direction resulted in higher payments for Plaintiffs, (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 225-33)-would seem to apply equally to both interdealer and non-interdealer swaps, and Defendants concede that Plaintiffs who traded in interdealer swaps were \"directly affected\" by the alleged conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defts.' Joint Mem. 22). That Plaintiffs are limited to those who transacted directly with the Defendant Banks, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 262), only bolsters a finding of direct injury for non-interdealer swaps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re LIBOR-Based Fin.

Dec. 20, 2016) (finding that \"[o]ne consideration in determining causation is whether plaintiffs transacted with defendants directly,\" in which case defendants secured \"illegal benefit at [the plaintiffs'] expense\" (alteration in original) ). Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs satisfy the first factor. For similar reasons, Plaintiffs satisfy the second factor. When push comes to shove, Defendants provide no rationale for why one who transacted in non-interdealer swaps would be any less motivated to vindicate the public interest than one who transacted in interdealer swaps except for the conclusory statement that the former's injuries are \"more remote.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defts.' Joint Reply 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That leaves only the question of whether damages for non-interdealer swaps would nonetheless be overly speculative or duplicative. Defendants argue that damages would be too speculative because vanilla swaps are \"individually negotiated.\" (Defts.' Joint Mem. 23). Yet Defendants cite no case law holding that individual negotiation of a financial instrument renders damages unduly speculative, and Judge Buchwald recently held otherwise in the\n   <em>\n    LIBOR\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re LIBOR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207378980\">\n    2016 WL 7378980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17-20. Nor do Plaintiffs' claims founder on the question of duplicativeness. Defendants allege that \"vanilla swaps transacted outside the interdealer market substantially overlap with transactions that are the subject of at least two other lawsuits in this district.\" (Defts.' Joint Reply 9). Whether or not that is the case, what matters is whether the\n   <em>\n    injuries\n   </em>\n   alleged in each lawsuit are the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCready\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/#p477\">\n    457 U.S. at 474-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/#p477\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing how concerns about duplicative injuries arise when \"every person along a chain of distribution [claims] damages arising from a single transaction\").

The\n   <em>\n    LIBOR\n   </em>\n   litigation, meanwhile, involves an alleged conspiracy to falsely report inter-bank borrowing costs to the LIBOR administrator, resulting in the suppression of the LIBOR rate, thereby affecting the floating leg of interest rate swaps.\n   <em>\n    In re LIBOR-Based Fin.

Defendants also advert to ongoing government and regulatory investigations and suits, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defts.'

It follows that Plaintiffs who transacted in non-interdealer vanilla swaps plausibly allege antitrust injury and \"efficient enforcer\" status and, thus, have \"antitrust standing\" to pursue their claims, at least for now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    NOMURA SECURITIES' MOTION TO DISMISS AND PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, Nomura Securities moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' state-law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, on the ground that they fail to allege the existence of any contract or counterparty relationship between a named plaintiff and Nomura Securities. (Nomura Mem. 1). In its March 28, 2016 Opinion, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs' contract and unjust enrichment claims against Nomura Securities on just that ground: that \"Plaintiffs fail[ed] to allege any transaction, contract, or relationship between\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   plaintiff and Nomura.\"\n   <em>\n    Alaska Elec.

In the SAC, Plaintiffs attempt to cure that defect, but they identify one-and only one-transaction between any Plaintiff (namely, Portigon AG) and \"Nomura\": a $100,000,000 swaption entered into on June 6, 2011 and settled on October 5, 2012. (SAC \u00b6 223; Nomura Mem. 3; Docket No. 411 (\"Pls' Opp'n to Nomura\"), at 2 n.2). The problem for Plaintiffs is that Nomura\n   <em>\n    Securities\n   </em>\n   -the named Defendant here-was concededly\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a party to that transaction. (Pls' Opp'n to Nomura 1, 2 n.2, 6). Instead, the ISDA Master Agreement associated with the transaction (which is incorporated by reference into the SAC and, thus, may be considered here, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 223, 277-279, 281), reveals that NGFP, an affiliate of Nomura Securities, was party to the transaction. (Docket No. 403 (\"Polovoy Decl.\"), Exs. 1, 2, 3). Nomura Securities may have acted as an agent for NGFP in connection with the transaction, but it was not a party to the transaction or to any contract associated with the transaction.

Instead, they contend that their contract claim is valid because Nomura Securities \"expressed an intent to be bound by the ISDA Master Agreement.\" (Pls' Opp'n to Nomura 1, 2 n.2, 6). But that contention borders on frivolous. It is well established that an agent, such as Nomura Securities, \"will not be personally bound\" by a contract \"unless there is clear and explicit evidence of the agent's intention to substitute ...

Portigon AG has known for approximately\n   <em>\n    twenty-one years\n   </em>\n   that it is party to an ISDA Master Agreement with NGFP, not Nomura Securities. (Docket No. 427 (\"Nomura Reply\"), at 3).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It follows that Plaintiffs were plainly in a position to include claims against NGFP before the deadline to join new parties. Notably, Plaintiffs \"do not even attempt to proffer an explanation-let alone an objectively\n   reasonable one-for why they could not have amended their pleadings to bring\" claims against NGFP before the Court's deadline.\n   <em>\n    Brown Rudnick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20363674\">\n    2015 WL 363674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The closest they come is asserting that \"trade data ha[d] to be analyzed\" before they added Portigon AG as a plaintiff, (Docket No. 370, at 3), and that \"the affiliate issue only arose after\" they did so. (Pls' Mot. to Amend 2). By Plaintiffs' counsel's own admission, however, they spent substantial time before the amendment deadline auditing Portigon AG's trades.

Having failed to demonstrate that they were diligent in their efforts to meet the Court's deadline, Plaintiffs cannot amend their Complaint again to add claims against NGFP.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brown Rudnick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20363674\">\n    2015 WL 363674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (denying leave to amend after the amendment deadline where the plaintiffs had been \"privy to at least some of the evidence underlying the proposed [new claims] for more than three years\" and had \"themselves produced some of the relevant evidence in discovery\");\n   <em>\n    Paradigm BioDevices, Inc. v.

Wells Fargo's arguments are not without force, as Plaintiffs' allegations in the SAC are far from specific, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6 39 (\"Portigon AG and/or EAA transacted in vanilla swaps and/or ISDAfix Transactions directly impacted by Defendants' manipulation of ISDAfix, and transacted with one or more of the following Defendant Banks: Nomura, UBS, HSBC, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and BNP Paribas.\"), and the confirmations for the only two Wells Fargo swaptions identified in the SAC's Appendix allegedly indicate that they were\n   not tied to ISDAfix.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, Appendix A, lines 637, 1543; Wells Fargo Mem. 9). Nevertheless, the Court disagrees with Wells Fargo's assertion that it may consider the confirmations at this stage of the litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wells Fargo Mem. 1, 9 n.6). Plaintiffs do not incorporate the confirmations by reference into the SAC, as they make passing reference to \"confirmations\" only three times and in generalized terms. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 237-38, 280).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Nor is it clear that Plaintiffs relied \"on the terms and effect of [the confirmations] in drafting\" the SAC.\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9473125\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/282/147/#p153\">\n    282 F.3d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And additionally, it is not even \"clear on the record that no dispute exists regarding the authenticity or accuracy of the document[s]\" or \"that there exist no material disputed issues of fact regarding the relevance of the document[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Faulkner v. Beer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723356\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/130/#p134\">\n    463 F.3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134 (2d Cir. 2006). Indeed, Plaintiffs dispute whether at least one of the confirmations demonstrates that the swaptions were physically rather than cash settled. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 409, at 4 n.4). And Wells Fargo itself concedes that the terms of confirmations are not \"always followed\" and that \"parties may deviate from the settlement mechanism called for in a confirmation,\" making clear that the confirmations themselves do not even settle the matter. (Wells Fargo Mem. 9 n.7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 424 (\"Wells Fargo Reply\"), at 4 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On the other hand, to the extent that Plaintiffs other than Portigon AG and EAA seek to bring unjust enrichment or contract claims against Wells Fargo, their claims must be dismissed. As Wells Fargo argues, and Plaintiffs do not really dispute, to sustain a claim of unjust enrichment or breach of contract, a plaintiff must allege at least some relationship with Wells Fargo. (Wells Fargo Mem. 12-13; Wells Fargo Reply, 4 n.2, 8). Portigon AG and EAA are the only named Plaintiffs that have done so with respect to Wells Fargo. And while a claim may be asserted on behalf of a class so long as \"at least one named plaintiff\" asserts \"a claim directly against that defendant,\"\n   <em>\n    NECA-IBEW Health &amp; Welfare Fund v.
