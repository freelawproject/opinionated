Rep. No. 99-560, at 26 (1986) (explaining that the FOIA reflects \"[t]he policy of providing government documents at a price based on the cost of dissemination\"). The FOIA accordingly contains an express provision that permits agencies to charge FOIA requesters only those fees that are reasonably necessary to recoup the funds that the government spends on searching for, duplicating, and reviewing responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(ii). Significantly for present purposes, however, the statute also contains a provision that clarifies that the FOIA's fee-setting prescriptions do not supersede \"a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular types of records.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(vi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties in the instant case are engaged in a pitched battle over whether or not Congress intended the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (\"the MECEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202451\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (\"the Appropriations Act\"), Pub L.

Plaintiff David Yanofsky filed the instant action after he received a bill for $173,775 in connection with a FOIA request that he submitted to the DOC for information about the number of visitors and international flights to the United States. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Issue (\"Consol. SUMF Part II\"), ECF No. 23-1, \u00b6 70.) The DOC maintains that it regularly disseminates such information as part of a subscription-based program that has many institutional clients, and that the agency properly \"collects, retains, and expends user fees pursuant to delegated authority under the [MECEA] as authorized in annual appropriations acts.\" (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 20, \u00b6 5.) Yanofsky's five-count complaint claims that the DOC \"has unlawfully withheld the requested records by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , unlawfully denying [Yanofsky's] request for a fee waiver and informing [him] that he would have to purchase the requested records\" at a price that is \"far in excess of the fees [the DOC] is permitted to charge under the FOIA.\" (Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before this Court at present are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot.; Pl.'s.

The parties address three related issues in these motions: (1) whether the DOC should be permitted to contend that the MECEA and the Appropriations Act displace the FOIA's fee-setting provisions in the instant proceedings, when the agency did not rely on those statutes in the administrative proceedings below; (2) whether the MECEA and the Appropriations Act together supersede the FOIA's fee-setting provisions; and (3) whether those statutes also displace the FOIA's fee-waiver provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons explained below, this Court agrees with the DOC that the agency can argue that the MECEA and the Appropriations Act constitute superseding fee statutes despite not doing so in its administrative proceedings, but given that the MECEA and the Appropriations Act neither identify a \"particular type[ ] of records\" nor \"set [a] level of fees[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vi), this Court does not find this argument persuasive. And\n   <em>\n    Oglesby v. United States Department of the Army\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691017,9053258\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/1172/\">\n    79 F.3d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.

Yanofsky's FOIA Request And The Accompanying Administrative Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Yanofsky Seeks Data Files That The DOC Compiles\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 26, 2016, Yanofsky filed a FOIA request with the DOC, requesting records relating to that agency's I-92 and I-94 Programs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Combined Statement of Material Facts and Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Material Facts (\"Consol. SUMF Part I\"), ECF No. 21-2, \u00b6 8.) The I-92 Program provides \"international air traffic statistics to the government and the travel industry\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2), while the I-94 Program \"provides the official U.S. monthly and annual overseas visitor arrival s to the United States\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). One of the DOC's bureaus-the International Trade Administration (\"the ITA\")-uses the statistics that are collected through the I-92 program to generate a publication called the\n   <em>\n    U.S. International Air Travel Statistics Report\n   </em>\n   , and to create an underlying data file related to that report (\"the I-92 Data File\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Meanwhile, that same bureau uses the information obtained via the I-94 Program to create another record-the\n   <em>\n    Summary of International Travel to the United States\n   </em>\n   -and to generate another data file (\"the I-94 Data File\") that consists of anonymized data about foreign visitors to the United States. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) The DOC then sells these reports and data files to the public. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his FOIA request, Yanofsky sought copies of the I-92 and I-94 Data Files from 2011 through 2015, along with the accompanying technical documentation (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8), and he also requested \"a fee benefit as a representative of the news media pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(ii) and a fee waiver pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(iii)\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Yanofsky supported these requests by explaining that he is a \"journalist for Quartz,\" a digital publication of the Atlantic Monthly Group, and that he intended to use the requested records to gather information of potential interest to the public; specifically, \"information about the operations of the DOC and other government agencies and about travel and tourism in the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Feb. 26, 2016 Request (\"FOIA Request\"), Ex. A to Erdmann Decl., ECF No. 20-1, at 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Consol. SUMF Part II \u00b6 61.) Yanofsky further explained that the requested records would shed light on the operations or activities of the DOC in a manner that was likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of those operations or activities, and that he was not seeking the records primarily for commercial-interest purposes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOIA Request at 9; Consol. SUMF Part II \u00b6\u00b6 63-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Notably, Yanofsky's February 2016 FOIA request was not the first time he had made these arguments or requested these records. Yanofsky had filed a materially identical FOIA request the year before, on March 10, 2015 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Consol. SUMF Part II \u00b6\u00b6 27-30), but the DOC denied this previous request. Initially, the agency insisted that \"ITA does not maintain the [I-94 data] records[,]\" and with respect to the I-92 Data Files, the agency asserted that ITA uses this data to develop\n   reports that are offered for sale, and that \"records which are published and offered for sale are excluded from the definition of subsection\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) records[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33 (internal quotation marks omitted).) Yanofsky filed an administrative appeal, after which the DOC subsequently acknowledged that all of the records Yanofsky requested were \"agency records\" for FOIA purposes, and thus could not be withheld for the reasons previously stated, but the DOC then offered an alternative basis for denying Yanofsky's request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 40-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 42-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Yanofsky filed the FOIA request that is the subject of the instant action in February of 2016, after he unsuccessfully sought to appeal the agency's conclusion that the FOIA's fee-setting requirements had been displaced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Administrative Appeal Of Yanofsky's February 2016 FOIA Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 30, 2016, the DOC sent Yanofsky a letter denying his February 2016 request for the I-92 and I-94 Data Files. The letter explained that all of the \"records are being withheld under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vi), which provides that FOIA fees are superseded by 'fees chargeable under a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular types of records.' \" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ITA's Resp. to Request (\"Denial Letter\"), Ex.

According to the DOC's correspondence, \"where documents otherwise responsive to a FOIA request are maintained for distribution by an agency according to a fee schedule that is assessed pursuant to a 'superseding fee statute,' requesters must obtain the documents from that source and pay the applicable fees designated by the agency under that statute[.]\" (Denial Letter at 18 (citing OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,012-13, 10,017-18).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The DOC's denial letter to Yanofsky also specifically maintained that the relevant superseding fee statute was\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In its denial letter, the DOC explained that Section 1525 qualifies as a FOIA displacement statute under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vi), because it specifically provides for setting the level of fees for particular types of records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Denial Letter at 19.) Consequently, the denial letter further rejected Yanofsky's request\n   for a fee benefit or a fee waiver (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Consol. SUMF Part II \u00b6\u00b6 82-83), and directed him to the DOC's website, where he could \"purchase the I-94 and I-92 [Data Files]\" by paying the fees outlined by the agency (Denial Letter at 19). Those fees totaled $173,775. (Consol. SUMF Part II \u00b6 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 31, 2016, Yanofsky administratively appealed the denial of his FOIA request and his fee waiver request.

First, he argued that a superseding fee statute must require the agency to establish fees for particular documents, and that section 1525 of Title 15 does nothing of the sort. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. Appeal at 25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Consol. SUMF Part II \u00b6 86.) Next, Yanofsky maintained that the \"FOIA's Displacement Provision does not allow an agency to withhold, wholesale, records requested under FOIA[,]\" but instead only authorizes the agency to charge fees pursuant to a superseding statute rather than FOIA. (Admin. Appeal at 26 &amp; n.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Consol. SUMF Part II \u00b6 87.) He further noted that, by its own terms, section 1525 permits an agency to \"charge only the actual duplication costs associated with providing copies\" of existing documents. (Admin. Appeal at 26 &amp; n.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Consol. SUMF Part II \u00b6 87.) Finally, Yanofsky argued that the \"FOIA's Displacement Provision applies only to FOIA's fee\n   <em>\n    setting\n   </em>\n   requirements and does not apply to FOIA's fee\n   <em>\n    waiver\n   </em>\n   requirements.\" (Admin.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In response to Yanofsky's claim that the DOC is charging unlawfully exorbitant fees for access to data that the agency is required to disseminate under the FOIA, the DOC contends that it has the authority to sell the requested information, because the MECEA has displaced the FOIA's fee-setting provisions, as clarified in the Appropriations Act. Yanofsky's first response to the agency's argument is that the DOC is precluded from relying on the combination of the MECEA and the Appropriations Act as a superseding statute because, at the administrative level, the DOC maintained that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   was the fee statute that displaced the FOIA's fee provisions, and this Court's review of the DOC's FOIA determination is limited to\n   the administrative record under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vii). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 17-19.) For the reasons discussed below, this Court has concluded that the FOIA does not prevent this Court from considering the DOC's argument that the MECEA and the Appropriations Act work in tandem to displace the FOIA's fee setting provisions. But the Court also finds that those statutes do not constitute a superseding fee statute that displaces the FOIA's fee-setting provisions, because neither statute \"provid[es] for setting the level of fees[,]\" nor do they do so for \"particular types of records[,]\" as the FOIA requires.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Yanofsky insists that this limitation prevents this Court from considering the DOC's current contentions regarding the displacement power of the MECEA and the Appropriations Act. As Yanofsky reads section 552(a)(4)(A)(vii) of the FOIA, \"both the requester and the agency are limited to the arguments contained in the administrative record\" (Pl.'s. Mot. at 17 (emphasis removed) ), and here, the DOC is admittedly relying on an entirely different statute to justify its fees than it asserted at the administrative level (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201525\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the DOC relied exclusively on the Special Works Statute to deny [Yanofsky's] Request for I-92 and I-94 Data Files at the administrative stage, arguing that it was a superseding fee statute for purposes of FOIA's Displacement Provision\") ). This Court disagrees with Yanofsky's analysis of the implications of section 552(a)(4)(A)(vii) for one very simple reason: while it is certainly true that a court's review \"is limited\" to the facts submitted to the agency, and that \"the agency must stand on whatever reasons for denial it gave in the administrative proceeding[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Coast Fork v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Denial Letter at 18-19.) However, in this Court's view, the DOC's present assertion that the MECEA and the Appropriations Act qualify as the pertinent superseding statute implicates considerations of law that this Court must evaluate by virtue of the DOC's persistent contention that the FOIA's displacement provision applies. It makes little sense for this Court to be stuck analyzing the legal effect of a statutory provision that the DOC has long since abandoned, and while any such analysis is necessarily substantively different than the one conducted during the administrative process, the Court is still evaluating displacement as a matter of law-not a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   reason for the denial of Yanofsky's fee waiver in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vii). Rather, the DOC has merely cited and quoted different \"legal authority\" for its abiding assertion that the FOIA's fee-setting provisions have been superseded with respect to the FOIA request at issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    Rapone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11886872,3709339\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/188/\">\n    131 F.3d at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In other words, when determining the scope of this Court's review authority under section 552(a)(4)(A)(vii) of the FOIA, \"[w]hat matters is that the core of [Defendant's] argument ... remained the same.\"\n   <em>\n    Flyers Rights Educ.

Cir. 2017). So it is here, and as a result, this Court will now conduct a de novo review of the legal arguments that the DOC is currently making in support of its long-standing view that the FOIA's fee-setting provision has been superseded within the meaning of the displacement provision for purposes of Yanofsky's FOIA request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The MECEA And The Appropriations Act Do Not Displace The FOIA's Fee-Setting Provisions Under \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(vi)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The substantive arguments in this case turn on whether the MECEA and the Appropriations Act constitute superseding fee-setting statutes as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vi). Yanofsky contends that these statutes do not constitute superseding\n   fee statutes because they neither identify \"particular types of records\" nor do they \"set[ ] the level of fees\" for these records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 21-26.) For its part, the DOC insists that the MECEA and Appropriations Act together meet both of these displacement requirements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 10-13.) This Court concludes that Yanofsky has the better of this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As explained above, the FOIA's displacement provision provides that nothing in the FOIA's fee-setting scheme \"shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular types of records.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vi). By its plain text, then, the FOIA fee-setting provision is superseded when Congress otherwise (1) \"provid[es] for setting the level of fees[,]\" and (2) does so \"for particular types of records.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The seeming clarity of this displacement principle might help to explain why there is a relative dearth of case law regarding the meaning of these two requirements in practice.

And if so, is the agency entitled to set the fees at whatever level it thinks appropriate?

Similarly,\n   when members of Congress discussed inserting a displacement provision into the FOIA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   132 Cong.

It also demonstrates that a proper superseding fee statute reflects Congress's intent as it relates specifically to the agency's task of setting the level of fees for records. Neither the MECEA nor the Appropriations Act speaks to how the DOC's fees with respect to its I-92 and I-94 data need to be determined, and thus this Court concludes that those statutes do not qualify as laws that supersede the fees provided for in the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In resisting this conclusion, the DOC maintains that \"providing for setting the level of fees\" for the purpose of section 552(a)(4)(A)(vi) does not require that a statute \"identify the fee amount or define a method to determine it.\" (Def.'s Reply at 11.) This Court largely disagrees with the latter part of this contention for the reasons already discussed, but even if that is so, after\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   , there can be no doubt that the statute in question must say\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   to authorize the agency to set fees pertaining to the agency's dissemination of records in\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   manner. The statutes at issue here miss this mark entirely, for they provide only that the DOC may receive \"payment for assessments for services provided as part of these activities[.]\" Appropriations Act \u00a7 9(B),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20Stat.%202287\">\n    129 Stat. 2287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And even if the word \"assessments\"\n   <em>\n    implies\n   </em>\n   that it is the DOC that will determine what fees are owed with respect to the service of providing records to the public (Def.'s Reply at 11-12), nothing in the text of the MECEA or the Appropriations Act tells the agency how to go about calculating those assessments, which means that they cannot plausibly be read to have the character of a superseding fee-setting provision, as the D.C. Circuit has interpreted the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Ultimately, this Court's analysis ends where it began: with the plain language of the FOIA displacement statute, as illuminated by D.C. Circuit precedent. The only statute that supersedes the FOIA's specific fee-setting prescriptions is one that \"specifically provide[s] for setting the level of fees for particular types of records.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(vi). And while the DOC has struggled valiantly to repackage the MECEA and the Appropriations Act as statutes that trump the FOIA's fee-setting provisions in a manner that justifies the $173,775 bill the agency presented to Yanofsky for the records at issue in this case, neither of those statutes actually satisfies this standard. As a result, the DOC must follow the FOIA, and determine the fees that are applicable to Yanofsky's FOIA's request in accordance with the FOIA's fee-setting and fee-waiver provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
