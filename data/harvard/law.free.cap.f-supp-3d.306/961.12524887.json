In the current case, no party alleges that \u00a7 37.11 proscribes, or arguably could proscribe, Plaintiff's intended future conduct. In other words, Plaintiff asks the Court to assume that at least one Defendant will make the future determination that Plaintiff's intended conduct is proscribed by \u00a7 37.11, and requests the Court enjoin that Defendant's potential conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff requests the Court enjoin Defendants \"from initiating investigations or prosecutions of Plaintiff for violation of Tex[as] Penal Code \u00a7 37.11.\" (Doc. 2 at 5). To do so, the Court must assume: (1) at least one Defendant will review the complaint and determine Plaintiff's conduct is proscribed by \u00a7 37.11, and (2) that the Defendant will then initiate an investigation or prosecution of Plaintiff. Considering the need for these assumptions and the discussion above, it is clear Plaintiff lacks an Article III injury in fact. Without an Article III injury, the Court lacks jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (Preliminary Injunction) for want of jurisdiction. (Doc. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Reviewing Plaintiff's Complaint, Plaintiff requests the Court declare \u00a7 37.11 unconstitutional as applied, enjoin Defendants from initiating investigations or prosecutions of Plaintiff under the statute, and grant Plaintiff costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. 1 at 5-6). Plaintiff's Complaint fails to establish an independent injury in fact. Consequently, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Complaint for the reasons articulated above. Fed. R. Civ.
