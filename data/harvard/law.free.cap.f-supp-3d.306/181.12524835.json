BATES, United States District Judge <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"185\" href=\"#p185\" id=\"p185\">*185</a>China's vast censorship of speech on the Internet has been widely reported, as has the Chinese government's detention and imprisonment of many of its citizens for expressing political views online. Plaintiffs are seven Chinese citizens who allege that they were imprisoned in China for online speech, and the wife of another Chinese citizen who was also imprisoned. They allege that as part of a settlement of a 2007 lawsuit brought by imprisoned Chinese activists against Yahoo, the defendants established a charitable trust to provide humanitarian and legal assistance to imprisoned Chinese dissidents. But then defendants allegedly mismanaged and depleted the trust funds and terminated the trust's humanitarian purpose, in violation of their duties under trust and contract law. As explained below, plaintiffs' claims that sound in trust law will be dismissed because they have not plausibly alleged that Yahoo established a charitable trust in 2007 and, even if they had, they lack standing to bring these claims. Plaintiff Ling Yu's contract claims are both insufficiently pled and were released by her when she settled an earlier lawsuit against these defendants. Hence, those claims also fail and the complaint in its entirety will be dismissed.</p><p id=\"p-9\"><em><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-10\">This case arises from another case filed by Chinese political activists against Yahoo more than ten years ago. <em>See</em> Am. Compl. [ECF No. 26] \u00b6 29 [hereinafter \"FAC\"]; <em>Wang v. Yahoo! Inc.</em> No. 07-cv-2151-CW, <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201230526\">2007 WL 1230526</extracted-citation> (N.D. Cal. filed Apr. 18, 2007). The <em>Wang</em> lawsuit was brought by <em>Wang</em> Xiaoning and Shi Tao, two imprisoned Chinese political activists, and Wang's wife, Ling Yu, who is also a plaintiff in this case. The plaintiffs in <em>Wang</em> alleged that Yahoo violated federal and state laws by turning over their Yahoo e-mails to Chinese authorities who used the information to prosecute Wang and Shi for political dissent. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 28-30. Yahoo moved to dismiss the <em>Wang</em> lawsuit in August 2007.</p><p id=\"p-11\">In November 2007 (while the case remained pending), Yahoo's CEO, Jerry Yang, testified before Congress concerning the company's disclosure of information to Chinese authorities. Shortly after the hearing, and facing significant pressure from certain members of Congress, Yahoo agreed to settle the <em>Wang</em> lawsuit. In exchange for the <em>Wang</em> plaintiffs' agreement to dismiss their lawsuit with prejudice, Yahoo agreed to pay $3.2 million to each plaintiff's family, and an additional $17.3 million to the Laogai Research Foundation (\"LRF\") to establish the Yahoo Human Rights Fund (\"YHRF\"). <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 33, 36. Plaintiffs here allege that the YHRF is a charitable trust for which they are beneficiaries. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em> \u00b6 33. The LRF is a non-profit corporation founded by Harry Wu, a former Chinese political prisoner turned political activist. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 24.</p><p id=\"p-12\">Under the terms of the settlement agreement (the \"<em>Wang</em> Settlement\"), the LRF was to use the $17.3 million for three purposes: (1) \"to provide humanitarian and legal assistance primarily to persons in or from ... China who have been imprisoned for expressing their views through Yahoo! or another medium\"; (2) \"to resolve claims primarily by such persons, or persons threatened with prosecution or imprisonment, against the Yahoo! Entities or any <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"186\" href=\"#p186\" id=\"p186\">*186</a>Yahoo! subsidiary or affiliate\"; and (3) \"for payment of [LRF] operating expenses and the [LRF's] educational work conducted in the United States in support of human rights.\" <em>Wang</em> Settlement (Ex. 2 to Yahoo's Mot. to Dismiss) [ECF No. 29-5] at 113; FAC \u00b6 40 n.4. The <em>Wang</em> Settlement further provided that there were \"no express or implied third party beneficiaries\" to the agreement, and that individuals who received funds from the LRF to resolve claims against Yahoo were not third-party beneficiaries. <em>Id.</em> at 113, 119.</p><p id=\"p-13\">In June 2009, the <em>Wang</em> Settlement was amended to create the Yahoo Irrevocable Human Rights Trust 2009 (\"YIHRT\").<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> FAC \u00b6 6 &amp; n.1. As part of the amendment, the LRF transferred $3.55 million to the YIHRT, while the remaining funds were transferred to the newly formed Laogai Human Rights Organization (\"LHRO\"). <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 25, 52-54; <em>see also</em> June 12, 2009 Amendment (Ex. 3 to Yahoo's Mot. to Dismiss) [ECF No. 29-6] at 128. The LHRO was to provide up to $1 million annually to the LRF for its operational expenses, and additional support for LRF's \"humanitarian and legal assistance\" to Chinese activists. <em>See</em> LHRO and YIHRT 2009 Documents (Ex. 1 to Yahoo's Mot. to Dismiss) [ECF No. 29-4] at 8.</p><p id=\"p-14\">Meanwhile, Harry Wu-once a celebrated human rights activist with close ties to members of Congress-came under increased scrutiny for his alleged mismanagement of the LRF and the YHRF, and he was involved in several lawsuits. <em>See</em> FAC \u00b6\u00b6 37-39; <em>see generally</em> Andrew Jacobs, <em>Champion of Human Rights in China Leaves a Tarnished Legacy</em>, <em>N.Y. Times</em>, Aug. 13, 2016 (Ex. 13 to Yahoo's Mot. to Dismiss) [ECF No. 29-16]. One of those lawsuits was filed in 2011 by Ling Yu, who is also a plaintiff in this case. <em>See</em> <em>Yu v. Wu</em>, No. 11-cv-92 (E.D. Va. filed Jan. 28, 2011) [hereinafter \"the 2011 Lawsuit\"].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yu sued Harry Wu, the LRF, the LHRO, and the YHRF for the alleged mismanagement, misuse, and conversion of settlement funds, including the LRF's purchase of real estate in Washington, and defendants' other alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiffs. <em>See</em> DAC \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 48. Yu settled her lawsuit later in 2011. She agreed to dismiss all of her claims with prejudice, <em>see</em> Notice of Dismissal with Prejudice (Ex. B to LRF's Mot. to Dismiss) [ECF No. 27-3] at 1, and granted Wu, the LRF, the LHRO, and the YHRF, and their affiliates, comprehensive releases, <em>see</em> 2011 Lawsuit Release (Ex. 5 to Yahoo's Mot. to Dismiss) [ECF No. 29-8] at 138.</p><p id=\"p-15\">Six years later, Yu filed this lawsuit against Yahoo and two of its executives, the Estate of Harry Wu,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the LRF, the LHRO, the \"Yahoo Human Rights Fund Trust,\" and unknown Doe defendants who are allegedly current and former employees, officers, and directors of the defendants. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 19-27. Yu is joined by seven other plaintiffs-He Depu, Yang Zili, Li Dawei, Wang Jinbo, Ouyang Yi, Xu Yonghai, and Xu Wangping (collectively the \"Beneficiary Plaintiffs\")-who allegedly are all political activists who were imprisoned in China for online dissent. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 10-16. Plaintiffs contend that through the 2007 <em>Wang</em> Settlement Yahoo established a <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"187\" href=\"#p187\" id=\"p187\">*187</a>charitable trust with the \"primary\" purpose of providing humanitarian and legal assistance to Chinese dissidents imprisoned for exercising their freedom of expression online. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 1, 19, 26, 33, 36. The Beneficiary Plaintiffs allege that they are \"beneficiar[ies] of the Trust's humanitarian purpose.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 10-16. They contend that defendants-all of whom are allegedly trustees-improperly depleted the trust's assets and unlawfully terminated the trust's humanitarian purpose. They bring claims for breach and modification of trust, <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 125-131, 135-36, as well as third party and principal-agent liability claims for breach of trust, <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 137-141. Plaintiff Yu brings claims for unjust enrichment, <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 132-34, and for breach of the <em>Wang</em> Settlement, <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 142-45. All of the plaintiffs bring a claim for civil conspiracy. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 146-49. Defendants have all filed motions to dismiss the FAC. <em>See</em> Mot. in Supp. of Defs. LRF Cal. and LRF Va.'s Mot. to Dismiss (\"LRF's Mot. to Dismiss\") [ECF No. 27-1]; Mem. of Law in Supp. of Def. LHRO's Mot. to Dismiss [ECF No. 28-1]; Mem. of Law in Supp. of Defs. Yahoo!

WHETHER THE <em>WANG</em> SETTLEMENT CREATED A CHARITABLE TRUST</strong></p><p id=\"p-21\">An initial issue is whether plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Yahoo established a charitable trust through the <em>Wang</em> Settlement in 2007. Plaintiffs' trust claims-Counts One, Three, Four, and Five-are founded on the proposition that they are beneficiaries of the alleged charitable trust; thus, if there is no trust, these claims must be dismissed. A charitable trust, as opposed to a private trust, is \"designed to accomplish objects that are beneficial to the community.\"</p><p id=\"p-22\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"188\" href=\"#p188\" id=\"p188\">*188</a><em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts</em> \u00a7 28 cmt. a.

To state viable trust claims, plaintiffs must establish that there are: \"[1] a trustee, who holds the trust property and is subject to equitable duties to deal with it for the benefit of another; [2] beneficiar[ies], to whom the trustee owes such duties; ... [3] trust property, which is held by the trustee for the beneficiar[ies] ... [4] [and an] intention [by the settlor] to create a trust, which may be manifested 'by written or spoken language or by conduct.' \" <em>Duggan v. Keto</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7908432\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/554/1126/#p1133\">554 A.2d 1126</extracted-citation>, 1133 (D.C. 1989) (citation omitted).</p><p id=\"p-23\">Plaintiffs contend that \"these elements are easily met,\" and they place great stock in the fact that payments were made \"in trust\" to the LRF. Pls.' Opp'n at 10 (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 36 &amp; n.3, 40). But courts have recognized that there is nothing talismanic about inclusion of the term \"in trust\" in an agreement. <em>See</em> <em>In re Ames Dep't Stores, Inc.</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=144%20Fed.%20Appx.%20900\">144 Fed.Appx. 900</extracted-citation>, 901-02 (2d Cir. 2005) (\"[A]dding the words 'trust' or 'agency' to a contract does not, without more, convert [the agreement] into a trust or agency relationship.\"); <em>Meima v. Broemmel</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933695\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/117/429/#p444\">117 P.3d 429</extracted-citation>, 444-46 (Wyo. 2005) (finding no trust established even though the parties used the words \"in trust\" in the relevant agreement). Plaintiffs also assert that a settlement agreement \"can[ ] result in the creation of a trust-indeed, numerous cases involve just that scenario.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 11. But just because a settlement agreement <em>can</em> create a trust does not mean that it <em>does</em>. Each of the cases cited by plaintiffs for this proposition involved <em>express</em> language in a settlement agreement that created a trust. <em>See</em> <em>Athey v. United States</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324960\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/132/683/#p687\">132 Fed.Cl. 683</extracted-citation>, 687 (Fed. Cl. 2017) (settlement required payments to be made to an administrator who would then \"establish an 'Athey Class Settlement' Trust\"), <em>appeal docketed</em>, 17-2277 (Fed. Cir. filed July 10, 2017); <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig.</em>, No. 99-cv-20593, <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20283163\">2001 WL 283163</extracted-citation>, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 21, 2001) (settlement created \"[trust] fund [that] must be administered by ... seven court appointed trustees\"). Here, such language is absent from the <em>Wang</em> Settlement.</p><p id=\"p-24\">Defendants, in turn, provide several arguments why the <em>Wang</em> Settlement did not create a charitable trust. As an initial matter, the <em>Wang</em> Settlement is a contract and, unlike the 2009 amendment, it does not purport to be a trust document. <em>Compare</em> <em>Wang</em> Settlement <em>with</em> LHRO and YIHRT 2009 Documents. Defendants also contend that plaintiffs have wholly failed to support their conclusory allegations that they are \"charitable beneficiaries\" of the purported trust. The term \"charitable beneficiaries\" is never mentioned in the <em>Wang</em> Settlement; indeed, the agreement expressly disclaims the creation of any third-party beneficiaries. <em>See</em> <em>Wang</em> Settlement at 119 (\"This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit only of, and be enforceable only by, the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns .... There are no express or implied third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.\"). Defendants also assert that plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that Yahoo intended to establish a charitable trust. <em>See</em> Bogert \u00a7 323 (\"The conduct of the alleged settlor of the charitable trust must show an intent to create a trust and not some similar relationship or some other effect.\"); <em>Duggan</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7908432\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/554/1126/#p1133\">554 A.2d at 1136</extracted-citation> (intent must be \"clearly manifested\" by the settlor). Plaintiffs have acknowledged that Yahoo has never publicly or privately referred <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"189\" href=\"#p189\" id=\"p189\">*189</a>to the YHRF as a trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See</em> Pls.' Opp'n at 2. Moreover, Yahoo's intent as stated in the settlement was its \"desire ... to resolve [its] disputes, and all claims, causes of action and controversies\" with plaintiffs in the <em>Wang</em> litigation \"without further expenditure of time and expense on litigation.\" <em>Wang</em> Settlement at 111. That stated intent plainly is not a manifestation of an intent to create a trust. <em>See</em> <em>Morrow v. United States</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4099821\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/723/71/#p77\">723 F.Supp.2d 71</extracted-citation>, 77 (D.D.C. 2010) (\"Where 'more likely explanations' than those alleged by the plaintiff exist, the Court should be wary of finding that the plaintiff's allegations have sufficiently nudged the claims into the realm of plausibility.\" (quoting <em>Iqbal</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">556 U.S. at 681</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">129 S.Ct. 1937</extracted-citation> ).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-25\">Ultimately, plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the <em>Wang</em> settlement created a charitable trust. Hence, all of the claims that sound in trust will be dismissed.</p><p id=\"p-27\">Even assuming that the Beneficiary Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Yahoo created a charitable trust for their benefit, their trust claims would still fail for an independent reason: they have failed to establish that they have standing under principles of trust law.</p><p id=\"p-28\">The general rule with respect to charitable trusts is that \" 'only a public officer, usually the state Attorney General, has standing to bring an action to enforce the terms of the trust.' \" <em>Family Fed'n for World Peace v.

This limitation is based on the \"impossibility of establishing a distinct justiciable interest on the part of a member of a large and constantly shifting benefited class, and the recurring burdens on the trust res and trustee of vexatious litigation that would result from recognition of a cause of action by any and all of a large number of individuals who might benefit incidentally from the trust.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7365877\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/579/608/#p612\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> However, courts have recognized exceptions to the general rule when an individual seeking to enforce the trust has a \"special interest\" in the trust, or is a member of a \"small and distinct\" beneficiary class. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em>; <em>Hooker</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7365877\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/579/608/#p612\">579 A.2d at 614</extracted-citation>. Plaintiffs have not shown that an exception applies here.</p><p id=\"p-29\">To start, the Beneficiary Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that they have the type of \"special interest\" necessary for standing. In <em>Family Federation for World Peace</em>, for example, the court found that a few plaintiffs had the requisite \"special <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"190\" href=\"#p190\" id=\"p190\">*190</a>interest\" based on their exceptionally close connection to the charitable corporation. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766288\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/234/#p244\">129 A.3d at 244</extracted-citation>. The plaintiffs included: two \"ousted former directors\" who were also successor trustees; an entity that was a \"major beneficiary from [the charity] for three decades\"; an entity that was a \"co-settlor\" of the trust; and another entity with \"close interests in [the charity's] operation[s].\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6766288\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/234/#p244\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> at 238 n.2, 244-45, 245 n.19. Plaintiffs have alleged no similarly close connection to the charitable trust here. Rather, they merely allege that they are potential beneficiaries of the trust. <em>See</em> FAC \u00b6\u00b6 10-16. It is well-established that \"the mere fact that a person is a possible beneficiary is not sufficient to entitle him to maintain a suit for the enforcement of a charitable trust.\" <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts</em> \u00a7 391 cmt. c; <em>see</em> <em>Schalkenbach Found. v. Lincoln Found.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1327366\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/208/176/\">208 Ariz. 176</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1327366\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/208/176/\">91 P.3d 1019</extracted-citation>, 1024 (2004) (\"[A] party must show that they have a special interest in the trust, such as being a current beneficiary, and not merely being a potential or prior beneficiary of a large class of potential beneficiaries.\"); Bogert \u00a7 414 (\"As a general rule, no private citizen can sue to enforce a charitable trust merely on the ground that he believes he is within the class to be benefitted by the trust ....\").</p><p id=\"p-30\">The Beneficiary Plaintiffs likewise fail to support the conclusory allegation that they are \"members of a small, sharply defined, and numerically limited class.\" FAC \u00b6 119. Indeed, their own complaint alleges that, as of 2007, \"<em>many</em> Yahoo users [had been] imprisoned [by Chinese authorities] based on evidence provided by Yahoo.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 28 (emphasis added). Yet plaintiffs' proposed class is even broader than the \"many\" Yahoo users imprisoned as of 2007. The proposed class: (1) includes individuals persecuted for expressing their views \"online\" through \"Yahoo <em>or another medium</em>,\" <em>Wang</em> Settlement at 113 (emphasis added); FAC \u00b6 119; (2) is \"primarily,\" but not exclusively, limited to individuals in China, <em>see</em> <em>Wang</em> Settlement at 113; and (3) is not temporally limited at all. Plaintiffs' \"many\" number through 2007 has undoubtedly grown much larger today because China has more than 700 million active Internet users, and is considered one of the world's most active censors of online dissent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-31\">At bottom, the Beneficiary Plaintiffs have failed to identify any case where a court conferred standing on a beneficiary class as large as the one they allege here: the cases they rely on involve smaller and more limited classes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Williams v. Board of Trustees</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11294891\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/589/901/\">589 A.2d 901</extracted-citation> (D.C. 1991), the court held that a class comprised of those who regularly attended and financially contributed to a single church in Washington <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"191\" href=\"#p191\" id=\"p191\">*191</a>was too \"uncertain and limitless\" to confer standing, <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11294891\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/589/901/\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11294891\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/589/901/\"> at 909</extracted-citation>. Plaintiffs proposed class of political dissidents persecuted for using any Internet platform in the world's most populous country is far more limitless and uncertain than the beneficiary class in <em>Williams</em>. Plaintiffs' reliance on <em>Hooker</em> is similarly unhelpful. In that case, the court conferred standing on a beneficiary class that consisted of female, indigent, \"aged\" widowed residents of Georgetown who were in \"good health\" <em>Hooker</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7365877\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/579/608/#p612\">579 A.2d at 615</extracted-citation>. Moreover, the court found that the class was \"limited\" because the \"number of applications from the group of beneficiaries ... ha[d] decreased significantly\" and the home had difficulty finding qualifying individuals. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7365877\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/579/608/#p612\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7365877\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/579/608/#p612\"> at 615-16</extracted-citation>. In other words, in <em>Hooker</em> the potential beneficiaries came from a single neighborhood of a single city with a population that is just a small fraction the size of China's 700 million internet users. And here, unlike in <em>Hooker</em>, it appears that the beneficiary class is expanding rather than shrinking.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-32\">In sum, the Beneficiary Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of showing that they have standing to bring their claims under the principles applicable to charitable trusts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-33\"><strong>III. BREACH OF SETTLEMENT AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT CLAIMS</strong></p><p id=\"p-34\">Plaintiff Yu's claims for unjust enrichment and breach of the settlement agreement-Counts Two and Six-were released by her when she settled the 2011 Lawsuit and, in any event, are insufficiently pled. These independent grounds warrant dismissal of Yu's claims.</p><p id=\"p-35\"><strong>A. Plaintiff Yu Released These Claims</strong></p><p id=\"p-36\">Defendants contend that Yu's claims for unjust enrichment and breach of settlement are precluded by res judicata based on the dismissal with prejudice of the 2011 Lawsuit. <em>See, e.g.</em>, LRF's Mot. to Dismiss at 14-15. It is true that Yu asserts some of the same causes of action in this lawsuit that she previously brought in the 2011 Lawsuit, including for unjust enrichment (Count III in the 2011 Lawsuit; Count II here) and breach of the settlement agreement (Count V in the 2011 <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"192\" href=\"#p192\" id=\"p192\">*192</a>Lawsuit; Count VI here), and that she alleges many of the same facts in this lawsuit that formed the basis of her claims in the 2011 Lawsuit. But Yu expressly disclaims that she is suing for any alleged conduct that occurred prior to October 21, 2011-the date of dismissal of the 2011 Lawsuit. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 133, 145. And Yu has alleged misconduct based on some facts that post-date the 2011 Lawsuit. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 64, 68. \"Res judicata does not preclude claims based on facts not yet in existence at the time of the original action.\" <em>Drake v. FAA</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429029,3698870\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/59/\">291 F.3d 59</extracted-citation>, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2002) ; <em>accord</em> <em>Apotex, Inc. v. FDA</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9169841,3436343\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/210/\">393 F.3d 210</extracted-citation>, 218 (D.C. Cir. 2004) ; <em>see also</em> <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments</em> \u00a7 24 cmt. f (1982) (\"Material operative facts occurring after the decision of an action with respect to the same subject matter may in themselves, or taken in conjunction with the antecedent facts, comprise a transaction which may be made the basis of a second action not precluded by the first.\"). Hence, res judicata does not bar Yu's claims.</p><p id=\"p-37\">But Yu is not completely out of the woods. Defendants' stronger argument is that Yu's claims are barred by the release that she negotiated when she dismissed the 2011 Lawsuit. <em>See, e.g.</em>, LRF's Mot. to Dismiss at 14-24. The 2011 Release-a contract executed by and between Yu, Wu, the LRF, the LHRO, and the YHRT<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> -states that Yu released all claims</p><p id=\"p-38\">of every kind and nature whatsoever in law, equity or otherwise, past, present or future, ascertained or unascertained, whether now known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, and whether or not concealed or hidden, which have existed or may have existed, or which do exist or may exist, without regard to subsequent discovery or the existence of additional or different facts, from the beginning of the world to the date of this Agreement arising out of or related in any manner to all prior dealings between the parties, without limitation, including but not limited to any events or circumstances alleged or which could have been alleged in the Civil Action.</p><p id=\"p-39\">2011 Release at 2. Yu contends that because she has changed the legal theory from the 2011 Lawsuit-i.e., she now alleges breach of the settlement's \"primary humanitarian purpose\"-the 2011 Release does not apply. Pls.' Opp'n at 38. Not so. The broad language of the release belies this argument and prevents Yu from evading the release by merely altering her legal theory or by \"discovering\" additional claims that she could have, but failed to, allege previously.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See</em> 2011 Release at 2. Yu has not sufficiently explained why the violation of the humanitarian purpose theory could not have been alleged in the prior action. Hence, it is barred by the comprehensive 2011 Release.</p><p id=\"p-41\">Even if Yu's claims were not precluded by the 2011 Release, they fail for independent reasons. Yu's breach of settlement claim is insufficient because the <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"193\" href=\"#p193\" id=\"p193\">*193</a>amended complaint fails to identify any specific provisions of the <em>Wang</em> Settlement that defendants allegedly breached. <em>See</em> <em>Kaar v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203068396\">2016 WL 3068396</extracted-citation>, at *1 (N.D. Cal. June 1, 2016) (\"To claim a breach of contract in federal court[,] the complaint must identify the specific provision of the contract allegedly breached by the defendant.\"); <em>Spinelli v. Nat'l Football League</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338543\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/96/81/#p131\">96 F.Supp.3d 81</extracted-citation>, 131 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (\" <em>Twombly</em> <em>-</em> <em>Iqbal</em> standards of federal pleading require a complaint to identify, in non-conclusory fashion, the specific terms of the contract that a defendant has breached.\"); <em>Saha v. George Washington Univ.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876471\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/439/#p443\">577 F.Supp.2d 439</extracted-citation>, 443 (D.D.C. 2008) (plaintiff failed to state a claim because he had \"not identified specific breached provisions\"). Indeed, the amended complaint is completely lacking any reference to a section or provision of the <em>Wang</em> Settlement that defendants supposedly violated. Instead, Yu provides generalized allegations of breach that are untethered to the actual contractual provisions. For example, her allegation that \"[t]he Settlement was breached upon ... the depletion of Trust assets to such an extent that it culminated in the breach of the Settlement,\" FAC \u00b6 144, is conclusory, circular, and fails to identify a settlement provision that was breached. Her claim that a breach occurred because defendants depleted the trust assets and did not use them exclusively (or primarily) \"to provide humanitarian and legal assistance\" to Chinese dissidents, <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876471\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/439/#p443\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876471\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/439/#p443\">,</extracted-citation> ignores that the <em>Wang</em> Settlement expressly permits the YHRF to be spent to \"resolve claims primarily by such persons ...; and ... for payment of [LRF's] operating expenses and the Foundation's education work conducted in the United States in support of human rights.\" <em>Wang</em> Settlement at 113. Similarly missing from the amended complaint is an identification of any contractual provision tied to the alleged breach arising from Yahoo's failure to \"review all of Wu and the LRF's activities.\" FAC \u00b6 144. And the alleged termination of the \"primary\" humanitarian purpose is not a breach that plaintiff has connected to any obligation found in the settlement agreement. <em>See</em> <em>Edmond v. Am. Educ. Servs.</em>, No. 10-cv-0578, <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204269129\">2010 WL 4269129</extracted-citation>, at *2 (D.D.C. Oct. 28, 2010) (\"Without a contractual duty, there can be no breach of contract.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Hence, the breach of settlement claim fails.</p><p id=\"p-42\">Yu's unjust enrichment claim is likewise deficient. That claim is based on the alleged \"enormous financial benefits\" obtained by Wu and LRF as a result of Yu signing the <em>Wang</em> Settlement, and alleges that defendants obtained \"unjust benefits ... as a result of Wu and the LRF's breaches of the Settlement's requirements.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 133-34. Thus, the unjust enrichment claim is based on the terms of the <em>Wang</em> Settlement, and turns on defendants' alleged breaches of those terms. While the existence of an express contract does not always foreclose a claim for unjust enrichment-and courts have sometimes permitted a party to plead this as an alternative theory in certain circumstances, <em>see, e.g.</em>, <em>Shtauber v. Gerson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267730\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/248/#p256\">239 F.Supp.3d 248</extracted-citation>, 256 (D.D.C. 2017) -courts require an allegation that the contract is invalid or unenforceable. <em>See</em> <em>Falconi-Sachs v.

Plaintiffs try to explain away this issue in their surreply by stating, for the first time, that Yahoo created a \"mixed trust\" which canbe administered for both charitable and noncharitable purposes. <em>See</em> Pls.' Surreply [ECF No. 39] at 3. But they have not alleged a \"mixed trust\" in the amended complaint, and they are not permitted to amend their pleading through their briefs. <em>Fares v.
