BATES, United States District Judge\n     China's vast censorship of speech on the Internet has been widely reported, as has the Chinese government's detention and imprisonment of many of its citizens for expressing political views online. Plaintiffs are seven Chinese citizens who allege that they were imprisoned in China for online speech, and the wife of another Chinese citizen who was also imprisoned. They allege that as part of a settlement of a 2007 lawsuit brought by imprisoned Chinese activists against Yahoo, the defendants established a charitable trust to provide humanitarian and legal assistance to imprisoned Chinese dissidents. But then defendants allegedly mismanaged and depleted the trust funds and terminated the trust's humanitarian purpose, in violation of their duties under trust and contract law. As explained below, plaintiffs' claims that sound in trust law will be dismissed because they have not plausibly alleged that Yahoo established a charitable trust in 2007 and, even if they had, they lack standing to bring these claims. Plaintiff Ling Yu's contract claims are both insufficiently pled and were released by her when she settled an earlier lawsuit against these defendants. Hence, those claims also fail and the complaint in its entirety will be dismissed.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     <em>\n      <strong>\n       BACKGROUND\n      </strong>\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     This case arises from another case filed by Chinese political activists against Yahoo more than ten years ago.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Am.

In exchange for the\n     <em>\n      Wang\n     </em>\n     plaintiffs' agreement to dismiss their lawsuit with prejudice, Yahoo agreed to pay $3.2 million to each plaintiff's family, and an additional $17.3 million to the Laogai Research Foundation (\"LRF\") to establish the Yahoo Human Rights Fund (\"YHRF\").\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6\u00b6 33, 36.

As an initial matter, the\n     <em>\n      Wang\n     </em>\n     Settlement is a contract and, unlike the 2009 amendment, it does not purport to be a trust document.\n     <em>\n      Compare\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Wang\n     </em>\n     Settlement\n     <em>\n      with\n     </em>\n     LHRO and YIHRT 2009 Documents. Defendants also contend that plaintiffs have wholly failed to support their conclusory allegations that they are \"charitable beneficiaries\" of the purported trust. The term \"charitable beneficiaries\" is never mentioned in the\n     <em>\n      Wang\n     </em>\n     Settlement; indeed, the agreement expressly disclaims the creation of any third-party beneficiaries.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Wang\n     </em>\n     Settlement at 119 (\"This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit only of, and be enforceable only by, the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns ....

Instead, Yu provides generalized allegations of breach that are untethered to the actual contractual provisions. For example, her allegation that \"[t]he Settlement was breached upon ... the depletion of Trust assets to such an extent that it culminated in the breach of the Settlement,\" FAC \u00b6 144, is conclusory, circular, and fails to identify a settlement provision that was breached. Her claim that a breach occurred because defendants depleted the trust assets and did not use them exclusively (or primarily) \"to provide humanitarian and legal assistance\" to Chinese dissidents,\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876471\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/439/#p443\">\n       id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876471\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/439/#p443\">\n      ,\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ignores that the\n     <em>\n      Wang\n     </em>\n     Settlement expressly permits the YHRF to be spent to \"resolve claims primarily by such persons ...; and ... for payment of [LRF's] operating expenses and the Foundation's education work conducted in the United States in support of human rights.\"\n     <em>\n      Wang\n     </em>\n     Settlement at 113. Similarly missing from the amended complaint is an identification of any contractual provision tied to the alleged breach arising from Yahoo's failure to \"review all of Wu and the LRF's activities.\" FAC \u00b6 144. And the alleged termination of the \"primary\" humanitarian purpose is not a breach that plaintiff has connected to any obligation found in the settlement agreement.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Edmond v.
