Defendants, which include the city's Department of Education (\"DOE\"), two DOE officials, and two fellow school administrators, move to dismiss the claims. For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged state law claims under New York's human rights and civil service laws, has insufficiently alleged a \u00a7 1983 claim, and has abandoned his negligence claim. His Title VI claim is inadequately pled, but the Court will grant him leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations are laid out in a meandering 65-page complaint that asserts there is race discrimination in the placement of children into P.S. 24 in the Bronx.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") [Dkt. 26].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although some of the allegations have the faint whiff of an Oliver Stone-style conspiracy, Plaintiff, who is an Assistant Principal at P.S. 24, has publicly complained that efforts have been and are being made to keep poor and minority children who live in the appropriate district out of P.S. 24, and his advocacy for those children has resulted in his getting crosswise with the school power structure.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6\u00b6 41-57 [18-24]. The primary players in this drama include the now-retired District 10 Superintendent (Defendant Mashel), the local Assemblyman (Jeffrey Dinowitz), the interim and now-permanent Principal of P.S. 24 (Defendant Schwartz), and the head of the school's Parents' Association (Laura Moukas). The Deputy Schools Chancellor (Defendant Rose) has a cameo appearance. Despite the length of the Complaint, when all is said and done, Plaintiff is complaining about three separate incidents of alleged retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The first incident began with a Parents' Association (\"P.A.\") meeting on October 21, 2015. During this meeting, Plaintiff and local Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz exchanged angry words over the loss of the lease of the school's annex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The loss of that space was problematic as it led to overcrowding in the school. Superintendent\n   Mashel was present at the meeting and was aware that Verdi and Dinowitz had argued during the meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 27-32 [14-16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, on the following day, Mashel called P.S. 24's then-Principal Donna Connelly and directed her to reprimand Plaintiff for his conduct at the meeting. Connelly refused, and Mashel said, \"This isn't over.\" Connelly decided to retire shortly thereafter because, according to Plaintiff, she wished to avoid future confrontations with Mashel and other officials. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 33-34 [16]. After Mashel's call to Connelly, Mashel met with Dinowitz and others to discuss how to remove Plaintiff from P.S. 24,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36 [16-17], and, on December 11, 2015, Mashel told the Acting Principal, Andrea Feldman, that she had to find a way to remove Plaintiff if she wanted to remain as Principal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37 [17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The second incident involves P.S. 24's kindergarten registration. At a public meeting in January 2016, Dinowitz questioned the process that would be used to confirm addresses of P.S. 24 kindergarten enrollees. As a result of asserted concerns that out-of-district children would attempt to register-Verdi asserts that there was no real concern about out of district children and that the articulated concern was a cover for bias against minority and low-income students-Mashel, Feldman, and Rose agreed to allow Dinowitz's chief of staff Randi Martos to be present during the enrollment process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 41-44 [18-20]. When enrollment actually occurred, Martos and Laura Moukas, president of the P.A., were present to \"oversee\" kindergarten registration. During the process, they accessed confidential medical and academic records of the prospective enrollees and required parents of minority children to produce three identification documents to register their children, rather than the two that were required of other parents.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52 [22]. Plaintiff wrote to the Schools Chancellor, Defendant Fari\u00f1a, and DOE's Special Commissioner of Investigation regarding his concerns about the kindergarten enrollment process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47 [20-21], \u00b6\u00b6 49-50 [21-22], \u00b6 52 [22]. His complaint to the Special Commissioner of Investigation led to an investigation that validated certain of his allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-92 [34-37].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to the Plaintiff, this second incident led to a meeting between Mashel and Plaintiff. The meeting was initially scheduled for April 6, 2016, but ultimately was held on May 4, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 77 [24]. Plaintiff alleges that the meeting was called to discipline him for his opposition to the discriminatory enrollment scheme, but the memorandum that documents the meeting makes no mention of Plaintiff's opposition.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76 [24], 81-83 [26-28]; Counseling Memorandum, May 23, 2016 [Dkt. 30-4].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the meeting focused on a directive that Mashel had given to Plaintiff to have no contact with Moukas's children, who attend P.S. 24,\n   which the Complaint appears to confirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 77-79 [24-26]. According to the Plaintiff, during this meeting Mashel ordered him to refrain from entering the P.S. 24 annex (the location in which he had encountered the Moukas children). Plaintiff alleges that this directive prevented him from performing his job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80 [26]. It is undisputed that Mashel followed up the meeting by placing a memorandum in Plaintiff's file, confirming that he should have no contact with Moukas's children.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-85 [26-28]; Counseling Memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The third incident involves Feldman's successor, current-Principal Steven Schwartz (allegedly Mashel's prot\u00e9g\u00e9). According to Plaintiff, in early October 2016, Schwartz radically altered Plaintiff's duties and the resources available to him. Plaintiff complains that Schwartz limited Plaintiff's communication with parents, terminated his role as Special Education District Representative, removed his computer access, removed him from the office from which he had previously worked and reassigned him to a book storage room, removed him from the School Leadership Team, and assigned him to monitoring duty of students without adequate assistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 94-101 [37-40]. Plaintiff alleges that these actions were intended to retaliate against him for his complaints about discrimination and his whistleblowing to DOE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102 [40-41].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff purports to assert eight convoluted and confusing causes of action. The Court finds that there are, in fact, only five causes of action alleged: retaliation claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act based on Plaintiff's complaints about discrimination against prospective students; retaliation claims under the New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL); a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of his First Amendment right to voice opposition to discriminatory practices at the school; whistleblower claims pursuant to New York State Civil Service Law \u00a7 75-b(1)(a) ; and claims for negligent training, supervision, and retention of Mashel, Schwartz, and Feldman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 105-190 [42-63].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff alleges that Mashel was determined to discipline and dismiss Plaintiff. Causation is sufficiently alleged as Mashel's efforts began immediately after the October 2015 meeting. Although no discipline or dismissal ever occurred, a jury could find that a superintendent's threats to discipline and remove an outspoken dissenter would dissuade a reasonable employee from objecting to discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The second incident fails to state a claim. While the FAC makes it difficult to ascertain the timing of the scheduling of the Mashel meeting relative to the allegedly inciting events, the undisputed subject matter of the meeting and the contents of the memorandum documenting the meeting undercut Plaintiff's assertion that any reasonable person would interpret it as having any connection to his protected activities. According to the FAC, the meeting focused not on the issues Plaintiff opposed but on his purported violation of a directive that he not interact with the Moukas children. Although Plaintiff argues that Moukas's close relationship to and alliance with Mashel allows the Court to infer a nefarious purpose (and, as noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in note 5, the situation is odd),\n   his assertions read more like a conspiracy theory than a plausible allegation. Although he asserts that during the meeting Mashel forbade him from entering the annex, in effect hindering his ability to do his job, the counseling memorandum that was placed in his file that documented the meeting merely directed him to avoid contact with Moukas's children and said nothing about his authority to enter the annex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counseling Memorandum. The counseling memorandum also explicitly says that it \"is not disciplinary in any manner and cannot be used in any action against an employee except to prove notice if the employee denies notice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Counseling memoranda do not constitute adverse employment actions in retaliation claims under Title VII, which, as noted above, are used as precedent when dealing with similar Title VI claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tepperwien v.

As to this particular counseling memorandum, no reasonable worker would be dissuaded from making a charge of discrimination by a counseling meeting and a resulting memorandum that, explicitly on its face, is not disciplinary, cannot be used against the employee beyond proving notice, and appears to be entirely disconnected from Plaintiff's whistleblowing activities. Although Plaintiff contends that this letter has been made part of his personnel file and \"constitute[s] retributive action,\" FAC \u00b6 83 [27], the Court finds that the meeting and subsequent memorandum do not support a retaliation claim under Title VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In contrast, the Court finds that the third incident does state a claim of retaliation. Plaintiff has alleged that Schwartz radically changed Plaintiff's duties and resources in approximately October 2016. These changes followed the DOE's investigation of the school's kindergarten registration, which Plaintiff's actions initiated, and whose August 29, 2016, report allegedly led to Mashel's retirement and Feldman's transfer. The Court finds that these broad changes to Plaintiff's responsibilities and resources are material to his role and could be viewed as a demotion; a fact finder could easily conclude that demoting an employee who complains about discrimination would dissuade reasonable employees from following suit. Additionally, the Court finds that causation is sufficiently alleged given the relationship alleged between Mashel and Schwartz, and the short time period between the conclusion of the investigation that Plaintiff's reporting spurred and the alterations to his position at P.S. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

It is unsettled, however, whether retaliation claims\n   <em>\n    affecting\n   </em>\n   employment-in\n   which an individual who voices concerns about discrimination against others is retaliated against with respect to his or her employment-should be treated the same as straight retaliation for employment discrimination claims, in which the underlying protected activity is a complaint that the employee was him- or herself discriminated against.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although the Second Circuit has yet to consider this question, a few district courts have.\n   <em>\n    Hickey v.

In contrast, recognizing a retaliation claim based on harms to a claimant's employment where the complained-of discrimination\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   against the intended beneficiaries of the relevant federal funding would vindicate rather than undermine the intent and spirit of \u00a7 2000d-3. Accordingly, this Court finds that the \"primary objective of providing employment\" requirement does not apply when analyzing an employment-based retaliation claim where the victims of the discrimination about which the claimant\n   complained (and for which complaining the claimant suffered retaliation) are the intended beneficiaries of the federal funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This determination, however, does not end the Court's inquiry into the sufficiency of Plaintiff's Title VI claim.

As to Mashel's threats to discipline or fire Plaintiff, because nothing resulted from the threats that might have constituted one of the enumerated types of personnel actions-Plaintiff was neither disciplined nor fired, and is still employed at the school-the Court finds that, pursuant to a plain reading of the provision, Plaintiff has failed to allege adverse action connected to Mashel's threats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   With regard to the meeting with Mashel and the counseling memorandum, the Court again finds that these allegations do not sufficiently state that Plaintiff suffered from an adverse personnel action. There were no repercussions from the meeting aside from the filing of a counseling memorandum, and the counseling memorandum on its face did not affect compensation, appointment, promotion, transfer, assignment, reassignment, or reinstatement. While the memorandum itself arguably constitutes a review of Plaintiff's performance, there are insufficient allegations that it adversely affected evaluation of his performance because it is explicitly not disciplinary and explicitly cannot be used against Plaintiff except to prove that he had been provided notice that he was required to stay away from the Moukas children. Moreover, Plaintiff does not allege that the letter was ever referenced in any performance evaluation thereafter, let alone ever used to his detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The sufficiency of the allegations regarding Plaintiff's altered duties and resources is a closer question. In\n   <em>\n    Fenton v. St. Lawrence County\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs' allegations \"that they were subject to snide or annoying comments, loss of private office space, increased scrutiny by supervisors and minor alterations of job responsibilities [were] insufficient\" to support their Section 75-b claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3838356\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/36/1102/\">\n    36 A.D.3d 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3838356\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/36/1102/\">\n    828 N.Y.S.2d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 650 (3d Dept. 2007). In contrast, the court in\n   <em>\n    Dobson v. Loos\n   </em>\n   found that the plaintiff sufficiently alleged adverse personnel action by asserting that he was relegated to \"virtually nonexistent duties\" while new, senior positions that should have been offered to him were filled by others.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2847784,2823754,548588,548916,2808213\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/277/1013/\">\n    277 A.D.2d 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"548588\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/277/1013/548588/#p221\">\n    716 N.Y.S.2d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (4th Dept. 2000). Reading the allegations of the FAC in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that these allegations sufficiently state an adverse personnel action because the actions Schwartz took adversely affected Plaintiff's assignment at P.S. 24. And for the reasons stated in its analysis of the Title VI and NYCHRL claims, the Court also finds the action to be causally-connected to Plaintiff's complaints to the DOE Special Commissioner of Investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the\n   duty and resource allegations sufficiently state a Section 75-b claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The remaining NYCHRL claims are dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiff's Section 75-b claim regarding Schwartz's conduct survives, but only as against Defendant DOE; the remaining Section 75-b claims are dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiff's Title VI claim is dismissed\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   prejudice; he may replead the claim, but only with respect to Mashel's and Schwartz's retaliation as described above, and naming only DOE as a Defendant.

Defendants contend that Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed with prejudice, as amendment would be futile and will prejudice them. MTD at 23; MTD Reply at 8-9. The Court is not unsympathetic to the Defendants' argument that Plaintiff has had multiple bites of the apple. (Prior to this lawsuit, Plaintiff had filed a prior lawsuit which was also removed to federal court; that case was voluntarily dismissed by Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     See Verdi v. City of New York, et al.\n    </em>\n    , 16-CV-03782 PGG [Dkts. 1, 11, 47].)
