Plaintiff Matthew Herrick (\"Herrick\") is a former Grindr user and the victim of a campaign of malicious catfishing:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   since October 2016, Herrick's former boyfriend has used Grindr to impersonate Herrick by posting fake profiles to Grindr, which describe Herrick as being interested in fetishistic sex, bondage, role playing, and rape fantasies and which encourage potential suitors to go to Herrick's home or workplace for sex. Allegedly hundreds of interested Grindr users have responded to the false profiles and many of them have physically sought out Herrick. This lawsuit is, however, against Grindr, not Herrick's former boyfriend. Herrick alleges 14 causes of action, the gist of which is that Grindr is a defectively designed and manufactured product because it lacks built-in safety features; that Grindr misled Herrick into believing it could interdict impersonating profiles or other unpermitted content; and that Grindr has wrongfully refused to search for and remove the impersonating profiles. Grindr and its two corporate parents, KL Grindr Holdings, Inc. (\"KL Grindr\") and Grindr Holding Company (\"Grindr Holding\" and together with Grindr and KL Grindr, the \"Defendants\"), have moved to dismiss on the grounds that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (the \"CDA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , immunizes Grindr from liability for content created by other users. The Court agrees. The CDA bars Herrick's products liability claims and his claims that Grindr must do more to remove impersonating profiles. Each of these claims depends on holding Grindr responsible for the content created by one of its users. Herrick's misrepresentation-related claims fail on their merits because Herrick has not alleged a misleading or false statement by Grindr or that Grindr's alleged misstatements are the cause of his injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Herrick joined Grindr in approximately May 2011. Am. Compl. (Dkt. 34) \u00b6 46. Grindr works by matching users based on their interests and location. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 31. In order to set up a Grindr profile, a user must enter his email address, accept Grindr's terms of service, and create a profile, including a \"display name, profile photo, and 'about me' section.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 32. Users can customize their profile by selecting from a list of drop-down menus, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , their age, height, weight, body type, and preferred sexual position. Am. Compl. \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The app's user-interface presents each user with a scroll of thumbnails of compatible profiles. Am. Compl. \u00b6 31. Matches are generated by Grindr's algorithmic sorting and filtering software and are based on sexual preferences-as captured by the user's profile-and location. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 53. Grindr accesses a user's location by accessing the latitude and longitude of his mobile device. Am. Compl. \u00b6 24. Once two users match, the app allows them to send direct messages. Am. Compl. \u00b6 31. Users can also generate and share a map of their location, based on the geolocational data collected by the app. Am. Compl. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Herrick \"matched\" with his former boyfriend in June 2015 and deactivated his Grindr account after the relationship became\n   exclusive in November 2015. Am. Compl. \u00b6 48. At some unspecified time, the two parted ways, apparently on bad terms. Beginning in October 2016, Herrick's former boyfriend began impersonating Herrick on Grindr. Am. Compl. \u00b6 49. The impersonating profiles suggest that Herrick is interested in \"serious kink and many fantasy scenes,\" hardcore and unprotected group sex, and \"hosting\"-that is looking for partners to meet him at his location. Am. Compl. \u00b6 50. Herrick alleges that \"approximately 1100\" users responded to the impersonating profiles from October 2016 through the end of March 2017. Am. Compl. \u00b6 49;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-62 (describing interactions with numerous men responding to the impersonating profiles at Herrick's home and work). Grindr's direct messaging feature was used to facilitate the scheme. Users were transmitted maps of Herrick's location, Am. Compl. \u00b6 52, and some of the men were told to expect that Herrick would resist their approach, which they were told was part of a rape-fantasy or role play, Am. Compl. \u00b6 62. Herrick also alleges that Grindr's geolocation functionality directed some of these users to his home and work (even though the app is no longer installed on his phone).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 52. Herrick and others have reported the impersonating accounts to Grindr approximately 100 times, but Grindr has not responded, other than to send an automated, form response. Am. Compl. \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that the design of the Grindr app has enabled this campaign of harassment. More specifically, Herrick alleges that Grindr does not incorporate certain safety features that could prevent impersonating profiles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Herrick alleges that Grindr does not use \"proven and common image recognition or duplicate-detection software,\" which could be used to search for profiles using Herrick's picture. Am. Compl. \u00b6 79;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 84 (Grindr does not use \"PhotoDNA technology\" to identify unauthorized photographs). Grindr does not run keyword searches on direct messages sent through the app. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 80, 83. Grindr does not have the ability to search for IP addresses, MAC addresses, and ICC numbers or block the use of spoofing, proxies, and virtual private networks (VPNs), all of which might prevent new impersonating accounts. Am. Compl. \u00b6 82. And Grindr could use a technique called \"geofencing\" to determine when an impersonating account is associated either with Herrick's address or the address of his former boyfriend. Am. Compl. \u00b6 85.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Herrick, Grindr is on notice of the potential for the app to be misused and nonetheless failed to warn users (including Herrick) of this risk: \"Grindr neither warned users of this location exposure vulnerability, nor that Grindr could be used to direct scores of\n   potentially dangerous individuals to their workplace and home.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 38. Herrick alleges, instead, that Grindr's advertising and terms of service led him to believe that Grindr had effective controls in place to prevent harassment. \"At all relevant times, Grindr represented to users in its advertising and community values page that it protects users from 'behaviors that endanger them.' \" Am. Compl. \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 41 (Grindr's website states that \"[i]n order for everyone to have the best time possible, we have a system of digital and human screening tools to protect our users from actions and behaviors that endanger them and go against what we're about.\"). Grindr's terms of service (the \"Terms of Service\") also require users to agree that they will not engage in a list of prohibited behaviors, including: using Grindr to \" 'stalk,' harass[,] abuse, defame, threaten or defraud other Users\"; \"impersonat[ing] any person or entity\"; or posting \"material which a reasonable person could deem to be objectionable ..., offensive, obscene, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, ..., intentionally misleading, false, or otherwise inappropriate.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 42. The Terms of Service warn that Grindr may delete submissions, ban accounts, or terminate access to the app for violations of these policies. Am. Compl. \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Herrick filed suit in state court on January 27, 2017. Not. of Removal (Dkt. 1) \u00b6 3. The original complaint included causes of action for negligence, deceptive business practices and false advertising, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, failure to warn, and negligent misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Not. of Removal Ex. A. Although the state court entered an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary restraining order against Grindr on January 27, 2017, Am. Compl. \u00b6 75, Grindr removed the case to this Court on February 8, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Not. of Removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court denied Herrick's motion for an extension of the state court's temporary restraining order on February 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Herrick v. Grindr, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-CV-932 (VEC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20744605\">\n    2017 WL 744605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    TRO Op.\n   </em>\n   \"). The Court concluded that each of the claims in the original complaint was either barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act or failed on its merits. To the extent Grindr has a role in creating the impersonating profiles, the Court found that it is through \"neutral assistance\"-functions which are available to all users and not tortious in their own right-rather than in creating the content that has caused Herrick's injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Because Herrick's claims are premised on Grindr's failure to monitor and remove content it did not create, the Court found that Herrick's claims were likely to be barred by the CDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the Court concluded that Herrick's claims for deceptive practices, false advertising, and misrepresentation were unlikely to succeed because the causal nexus between Grindr's representations to Herrick in 2011 and the harassment Herrick suffered in 2016 and 2017 is too attenuated to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Herrick filed an amended complaint on March 31, 2017, doubling down on his theory that Grindr is responsible for the impersonating profiles. The Amended Complaint alleges that Grindr is responsible for the impersonating profiles because it designed an app that is easily manipulated and misused and because it has not taken adequate steps to stop the impersonating profiles. In addition to the claims raised in the original complaint, the Amended Complaint alleges causes of action for products liability (causes of action I, II, and III), and negligent design (cause of action IV). Herrick has also expanded on his theory\n   that Grindr's advertising and terms of service are misleading, pleading new claims for promissory estoppel and fraud (causes of action VIII and IX). Finally, Herrick has added a claim for copyright infringement, based on the use of his photograph in many of the impersonating profiles (cause of action VII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss. Grindr argues that all of Herrick's claims (with the exception of his copyright claim) are barred by the CDA because Herrick's former boyfriend created the impersonating profiles; not Grindr. Grindr argues that the CDA also bars any claim based on its failure to more effectively search for and to remove the impersonating profiles, or to block the former boyfriend from creating new ones, because these claims treat Grindr as responsible for the false content itself. Herrick's misrepresentation-based claims fail, according to Grindr, because he has not identified any statement by Grindr in which it committed to remove impersonating content, and because Grindr's statements in 2011 are too attenuated from Herrick's injury in 2016 and 2017. KL Grindr and Grindr Holdings have joined in the motion to dismiss and also move to dismiss on personal jurisdiction grounds because the Amended Complaint does not allege any suit-related contacts with this forum by either entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 47, 49, and 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must allege sufficient facts, taken as true, to state a plausible claim for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Products Liability and Negligent Design and Failure to Warn\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Grindr argues that Section 230 of the CDA bars Herrick's products liability and negligent design and failure to warn claims. Herrick alleges in these claims that Grindr's \"server-side software,\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 112, is defectively and negligently designed and manufactured because it does not incorporate \"widely used, proven and common software to flag and detect abusive accounts,\" which \"resulted in Grindr selecting and directing an incessant stream [of] men demanding sex from [Herrick],\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 109. Herrick's failure to warn claim-also pleaded as products liability and negligence-is based on Grindr's failure to warn that the app can be used as a tool for harassment and that Grindr has limited ability to stop abuse. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117, 129. The Court agrees with Grindr. To the extent Herrick has identified a defect in Grindr's design or manufacture or a failure to warn, it is inextricably related to Grindr's role in editing or removing offensive content-precisely the role for which Section 230 provides immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 230 provides that \"[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). There are three elements to a claim of immunity under Section 230(c).

The Court finds the First Circuit's reasoning persuasive and applicable to Herrick's design and manufacturing defect and negligent design claims. Like the claims in\n   <em>\n    Backpage.com\n   </em>\n   , Herrick's claims are based on features or missing safety features, such as Grindr's geolocational tools and Grindr's inability to block profiles based on ICC numbers and MAC address or to search for profiles by photograph. As in\n   <em>\n    Backpage.com\n   </em>\n   , these features (or the lack of additional capabilities) are only relevant to Herrick's injury because they bear on Grindr's ability to search for and remove content posted to the app-exactly the sort of \"editorial choices\" that are a function of being a publisher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Herrick's failure to warn claims (causes of action III and V) also require treating Grindr as the \"publisher\" of the impersonating profiles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   A duty to warn claim \"implicitly require[s]\" recourse to the impersonating profiles themselves and the traditional function of a publisher to supervise content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273814\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/140/#p156\">\n    252 F.Supp.3d at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The warning proposed by Herrick is only necessary because Grindr (as publisher) does not police or remove objectionable content. Although it is indirect, liability under such a theory nevertheless depends on Grindr's decision to publish the impersonating profiles without reviewing them first. Alternatively, the Court is persuaded that requiring Grindr to post a warning at the outset or along with each profile is no different than requiring Grindr to edit the third-party content itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

According to Herrick he joined Grindr in 2011 in reliance on the Terms of Service and community values page; some four years later, in 2015, he met his former boyfriend and de-activated his Grindr account; one year later, in 2016, and after they broke up, his former boyfriend began using Grindr to terrorize him. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-49. Thus, although Herrick alleges that Grindr's misstatements caused him to join Grindr, he has not been a Grindr user at any point since 2015, including during the events giving rise to this lawsuit. As the facts of this case illustrate, one does not need to be a Grindr user to be impersonated on Grindr; what happened to Herrick could, unfortunately, have happened to him even if he never saw the Terms of Service and never used Grindr. At best (for Herrick), his decision to join Grindr in 2011 in reliance on the Terms of Service is a \"but-for\" cause of his injuries-had he not joined Grindr, Herrick would never have met his former boyfriend-but the Terms of Service and community values page have no other connection to the harassment directed at Herrick in 2016 and 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Herrick has essentially conceded this point.

To the extent liability is premised on Grindr's own statements, Herrick's misrepresentation claims are directed at Grindr's own content, at least in part. Additionally, these claims do not clearly implicate Grindr's actions as a publisher of user-generated content. The duty allegedly violated is the duty to speak candidly to one's customers-not to edit and remove content. On the other hand, the statements at issue describe Grindr's conduct and policies as a publisher and the ultimate injury in this case remains associated with user-generated content. The statements are false, according to Herrick, because Grindr does not police and remove content.
