Alexander questions the district court\u2019s denial of IFP status and certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-23\">Alexander contends that the district court abused its discretion when it did not reduce his sentence pursuant to retroactive provisions of Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (2011); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The district court understood that Alexander was eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), but it determined that his sentence as it stood was appropriate in light of the applicable sentencing factors and therefore declined to reduce it. Our review reveals no arguable merit to the contention that it was an abuse of discretion to deny Alexander the relief he requested. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717-18 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). Consequently, we may dismiss this frivolous appeal sua sponte. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-24\">Alexander\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
