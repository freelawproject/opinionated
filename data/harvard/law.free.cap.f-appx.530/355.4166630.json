Specifically, he challenges the district court\u2019s reimposition of a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-22\">We review revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). A review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the transcript from the revocation hearing reflects that the district court\u2019s reimposition of the special assessment is contrary to the oral pronouncement and evidence presented at the hearing. Therefore, as the Government concedes, a conflict exists between the oral and written judgments. In such a case, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is modified to strike the reimposition of the $100 special assessment so that the written judgment is in conformance with the oral pronouncement, and we affirm the judgment as so modified. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; <em>see also United States v. Hermoso, </em>484 Fed.Appx. 970, 972-73 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Aqd\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
