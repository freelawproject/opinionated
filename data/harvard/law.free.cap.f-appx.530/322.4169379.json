(CitiMortgage). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">In 2005, the Watsons obtained a home-purchase loan from CitiMortgage, executing a note payable to CitiMortgage and a deed of trust that placed a lien on the property. The Watsons made timely installment payments on the note until 2009 when the Watsons defaulted on the loan, making their last payment in September of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">CitiMortgage sent the Watsons a notice of default on February 3, 2010, giving them thirty days to cure the default or risk acceleration and foreclosure. The Wat-sons did not cure or make any additional payments, but instead of accelerating the loan immediately, CitiMortgage encouraged the Watsons to apply for a loan modification. The Watsons first applied for the federal government\u2019s Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) but were rejected. The Watsons then applied for a non-HAMP modification program. Over the course of the summer and early fall of 2010, the Watsons periodically communicated with CitiMortgage to confirm that their application was still pending and to provide additional documentation as requested. The Watsons contend that throughout this period, representatives of CitiMortgage repeatedly assured them that CitiMortgage would not foreclose so long as the modification application was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-17\">On October 2, 2010, while the Watsons\u2019 loan-modification application was still under review, CitiMortgage accelerated the debt and sent the Watsons notice of a foreclosure sale set for November 2, 2010. A week later, CitiMortgage informed the Watsons via email that them application had been approved and promised that a documentation packet was forthcoming. On October 20, CitiMortgage sent the Watsons another notice of foreclosure sale, this time scheduling the sale for December 7. The Watsons called CitiMortgage on October 25 and 28 and were informed that their application had been approved, but that the final modification was contingent on successful completion of a three-month trial-payment plan, with the first payment due on November 1. Although presented with the option to make the first payment over the phone, the Watsons declined. On November 2, the Watsons received the promised documentation packet confirming that their loan would be modified if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>made the three trial payments due in November, December, and January. The Watsons never attempted to make any payments under the trial plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The Watsons filed this suit in Texas state court on December 1, 2010, and obtained a temporary restraining order that prohibited CitiMortgage from proceeding with the December 7 foreclosure sale. Ci-tiMortgage then removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. On February 3, 2012, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of CitiMortgage and dismissed all of the Watsons\u2019 claims. The Watsons remain in possession of the property, and CitiMortgage has not attempted to set a new foreclosure date.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When applying this standard, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Watsons argue that they presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact on their claims for breach of contract, violation of the Texas Debt Collection Practices Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (TDCPA), and negligent misrepresentation. They further argue that as a result, the%district court erred in denying their request for a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The Watsons allege that CitiMort-gage \u201cbreached the Deed of Trust contract by failing to give Plaintiffs the opportunity to reinstate the loan or cure the default\u201d and that CitiMortgage\u2019s \u201cconduct of deliberately ... delaying and misleading the Plaintiffs to the point of foreclosure ... is a breach of the Deed of Trust contract and Note.\u201d Although the Watsons\u2019 own default (which they do not dispute) would ordinarily bar a breach-of-contract claim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> they argue that CitiMortgage waived its right to foreclose, or in the alternative, that CitiMortgage should be precluded from exercising its right by promissory estoppel. Neither argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The Watsons enumerate thirteen examples of conduct by CitiMortgage that they claim raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether CitiMortgage waived its right to foreclose. The alleged conduct can be roughly grouped into two categories: representations by CitiMortgage that it would not foreclose during modification discussions and specific communications demonstrating that CitiMortgage was reviewing the Watsons\u2019 modification applications. The Watsons also highlight apparently contradictory or confusing communications from CitiMortgage about the status of their application. For example, they point to a September 28, 2010, letter purporting to deny their modification application for lack of requested documents when the allegedly missing documents were in fact delivered on that day, prior to the deadline. Finally, the Wat-sons appear to argue that CitiMortgage waived its right to foreclose because it considered modification instead of \u201cnot movfing] to foreclose diligently.\u201d These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Under Texas law, a party may waive a contractual right by intentionally relinquishing it or by engaging in conduct inconsistent with that right.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A lienholder may waive the right to accelerate or foreclose through inconsistent conduct such as repeatedly accepting late payments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, Texas courts have also made clear that a lienholder does not waive the right to foreclose merely by delaying foreclosure, entering into modification negotiations, or otherwise exercising forbearance without additional conduct inconsistent with the right to foreclose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor does a mortgagor waive its right to foreclose by declining to pursue alternative contractual remedies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We agree with the district court that based on the record, there is no genuine issue of material fact that CitiMortgage did not waive its rights. First and foremost, the deed of trust contains an unambiguous nonwaiver provision, providing that \u201c[a]ny forbearance by [CitiMortgage] in exercising any right or remedy ... shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy,\u201d and that \u201c[exten-si\u00f3n of time for payment or modification ... shall not operate to release the [Wat-sons\u2019] liability.\u201d The Watsons cite an unpublished case of this court, <em>U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Kobernick,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the proposition that a \u201cnonwaiver clause may, in some circumstances, be waived.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, they fail to explain how that general proposition would apply to the circumstances in this case. In any event, the facts in <em>Ko-bemiclc </em>and the Texas case it cited were materially different.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We decline the Watsons\u2019 invitation to treat the nonwaiver clause in this case as a functionless ornament.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Furthermore, even disregarding the nonwaiver clause, none of CitiMort-gage\u2019s conduct appears inconsistent with its rights. Indeed, among the actions al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>legedly \u201cinconsistent\u201d with CitiMortgage\u2019s right to foreclose, the Watsons include the notice of acceleration and two letters setting a foreclosure date. Although it is evident that CitiMortgage repeatedly invited and even encouraged the Watsons to apply for modification and sent several requests for additional documentation, none of its conduct is evidence that Citi-Mortgage intended to waive its contractual rights. To the contrary, CitiMortgage repeatedly warned the Watsons that it retained the right to demand full payment and foreclose. At most, the evidence demonstrates that CitiMortgage delayed foreclosure while attempting to reach an alternative agreement to protect its interests. Such forbearance is not inconsistent with retaining the right to foreclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The Watsons\u2019 estoppel argument, premised on the same factual allegations, is also without merit. The Watsons assert that they \u201cwere induced into remaining in default\u201d by the promise of modification. Yet they point to no evidence that they attempted, contemplated, or were even capable of curing their default. Nor do they explain why, after their loan modification was approved, they remained in default and did not attempt to make any payments under the trial plan. They concede that they were given the details of the plan and offered the opportunity to make a payment but declined. Furthermore, the evidence demonstrates that the trial payments could be made at any time during the relevant month, and the Watsons admit that they never contacted CitiMortgage to tender payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Under Texas law, promissory estoppel requires \u201c(1) a promise, (2) foreseeability of rebanee thereon by the promisor, and (3) substantial reliance by the promisee to his detriment.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The promise cannot be \u201ctoo vague and indefinite,\u201d and \u201c[a] prom-isee\u2019s reliance must be both reasonable and justified.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A plaintiffs recovery under promissory estoppel is limited to reliance damages.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">The Watsons fail to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact on any element of promissory estoppel. First, the Watsons fail to identify the specific or definite promise by CitiMortgage. Although the evidence demonstrates that CitiMortgage exercised forbearance and expressed a willingness to consider modification, the Watsons point to no evidence supporting the assertion that CitiMortgage\u2019s representations were anything more than \u201cindefinite assurance[s] of an ongoing negotiation process.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is axiomatic that without a definite promise there can be no foreseeable reliance. Even if CitiMort-gage\u2019s representations constituted a definite promise, the Watsons fail to articulate how they detrimentally relied on the promise or how such reliance would have been reasonable or justified. Nor do they explain how they were damaged by their alleged reliance. In their First Amended Complaint, the Watsons allege that they \u201chave incurred damages, including mental anguish, filing fees, and reasonable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>necessary attorney fees,\u201d but do not explain how those damages result from their reliance on any promises by CitiMortgage. In sum, the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to promissory es-toppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The Watsons next argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their claims under the TDCPA. Specifically, the Watsons claim that CitiMortgage violated sections 392.301(a)(8), 392.303(a)(2), 392.304(a)(8), and 392.304(a)(19) of the Texas Finance Code. None of these claims has merit. With respect to section 392.301(a)(8), the Watsons make only a passing reference to this section and therefore, due to inadequate briefing, have waived whatever argument they may have had.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Section 392.303(a)(2) prohibits a debt collector from \u201ccollecting or attempting to collect interest or a charge, fee, or expense incidental to the obligation unless the interest or incidental charge, fee, or expense is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the obligation or legally chargeable to the consumer.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Watsons argue that CitiMortgage violated this section by assessing foreclosure costs and attorney\u2019s fees. However, because the deed of trust expressly authorizes Citi-Mortgage to add these fees to the Wat-sons\u2019 debt, section 392.303(a)(2) is inapplicable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Watsons also fail to identify any evidence that CitiMortgage \u201cmisrepre-sentfed] the character, extent, or amount of [the Watsons\u2019] debt\u201d in violation of section 392.304(a)(8).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, the Watsons do not explain how and we find no. evidence that either the scheduling of the December 7 foreclosure sale or the delayed arrival of the loan modification documents constitutes a \u201cfalse representation or deceptive means to collect a debt\u201d in violation of section 392.304(a)(19).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Dismissal of the TDCPA claims was therefore proper.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">If ... Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument ..., then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest.... Lender's actions can include, but are not limited to ... paying reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section [ ] shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Likewise, the Watsons\u2019 negligent misrepresentation claim fails because, \u201cunder Texas law, promises of future action are not actionable as a negligent-misrepresentation tort.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Finally, the Watsons\u2019 request for a declaratory judgment was properly dismissed as it depends on the success of their other claims.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
