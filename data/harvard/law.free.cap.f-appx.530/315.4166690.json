He also appeals the magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of his complaint against Warden James Holman and Dr. Hein Schafer for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Lee\u2019s contention that the magistrate judge should not have granted a summary judgment because he did not receive proper notice of his burden of proof is without merit because Lee provided affidavits and other documents that re-fleeted that he was aware of his right to submit documentary evidence to dispute the facts alleged by the Sheriff. Nor did the magistrate judge abuse his discretion in precluding discovery of Lee\u2019s medication sign-in sheets. Lee did not demonstrate that the logs would have rebutted the evidence that his missed dose of medicine was an act of negligence and that the Sheriff implemented a sufficient policy of providing inmates with their prescribed medication. <em>See Krim v. BancTexas Group, Inc., </em>989 F.2d 1435, 1441 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">In response to Rushing\u2019s summary judgment evidence that Rushing had no knowledge of Lee\u2019s scalp condition until late December 2009 and that Lee was under medical treatment at that time, Lee introduced evidence to show that Sheriff Rushing was aware of his serious scalp condition in November 2009 and that his failure to ensure his receipt of timely medical care and medication showed deliberate indifference to a serious risk of harm. If there were some delays or omissions in Lee\u2019s medical treatment, the evidence showed that the Sheriff had no personal involvement in Lee\u2019s medical care, Lee\u2019s medical complaints were monitored by the jail\u2019s medical personnel, he was under the care of a doctor and was taken to the hospital emergency room, and he also received various forms of medication to treat his scalp condition. Lee has failed to present competent evidence raising a genuine dispute as to a material fact regarding whether Sheriff Rushing intentionally ignored his medical complaints or denied him treatment. <em>See Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007); <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001). Nor did Lee provide competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>evidence raising a genuine issue of fact about the adequacy of the jail\u2019s medical care policy because his complaints were rebutted by the evidence showing that he received competent medical treatment for his scalp condition. Lee failed to present evidence that Sheriff Rushing knowingly enforced a deficient policy that resulted in a violation of his constitutional right to medical care. In the absence of a showing of a constitutional violation, Rushing was entitled to the defense of qualified immunity, and his motion for summary judgment was properly granted. <em>See Brown v. Callahan, </em>623 F.3d 249, 253 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We reject Lee\u2019s assertion that the magistrate judge erred in dismissing the complaint against Warden Holman pri- or to allowing Lee to conduct discovery because Lee failed to allege that Warden Holman was aware of the alleged unsafe barbering practices or that the warden personally participated in his medical care. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 674, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Nor did the magistrate judge err in dismissing Lee\u2019s claim against Dr. Schafer because Lee\u2019s allegations reflect only his disagreement with the treatment chosen by Dr. Schafer and, at worst, a claim of medical malpractice. These allegations failed to give rise to an inference that Dr. Schafer acted with deliberate indifference to Lee\u2019s medical needs. Thus, the magistrate judge did not err in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See id.; Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Finally, the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Lee\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel because Lee has not shown that his case was exceptional, and he presented detailed factual allegations and the applicable law to the court. <em>See Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 126 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
