On appeal, Turner argues, and the government agrees, that the district court plainly erred in counting as a crime of violence Turner\u2019s sexual battery of a minor conviction, under Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(8) (1994). As additional error, Turner argues that the district court should not have counted his prior first-degree burglary conviction as a crime of violence because the residual clause of the career offender guidelines is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Ordinarily, we review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular conviction is a crime of violence under the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 257, 181 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011). However, we \u201cconsider sentence objections raised for the first time on appeal under the plain error doctrine to avoid manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Hansley, </em>54 F.3d 709, 715 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">\u201cFor the Court to correct plain error: (1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>68 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.1995). If the first three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to \u201cnotice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u2018Plain\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018clear\u2019 or, equivalently, \u2018obvious.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). For an error to affect substantial rights, it \u201cmust have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1778.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">Under the career offender guidelines, an offense \u201ccan be a crime of violence if it fits within one of three categories.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number><em>States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 288, 184 L.Ed.2d 169 (2012). The first category covers offenses under the \u201celements clause,\u201d which have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use\u201d of violent physical force against another. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l); <em>see United States v. Harris, </em>608 F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir.2010) (equating \u201cphysical force\u201d with \u201cviolent force,\u201d pursuant to <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 140-41, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010)). The second category covers the offenses listed in the enumerated crimes clause: burglary of a dwelling, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). The third category covers the \u201cresidual clause\u201d crimes that \u201cotherwise involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration added). Because the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) provides a definition for \u201cviolent felony\u201d that is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the definition of a crime of violence under the career offender guidelines, we have indicated that \u201cdecisions about one apply to the other.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1309 n. 16 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">We utilize two different approaches in determining whether a crime falls within the elements clause or the residual clause: the categorical and the modified categorical approaches. <em>Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 975-76. Under the categorical approach to the residual clause, we first focus on whether the offense at issue inherently \u201cposes a serious potential risk of physical injury that is similar in kind and in degree to the risks posed by the enumerated crimes.\u201d <em>United States v. Owens, </em>672 F.3d 966, 968-69 (1 1th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Then, we ask \u201cwhether the conduct at issue in the statute is purposeful, violent and aggressive\u201d or is instead \u201ca more passive crime of inaction.\u201d <em>Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 978 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see id. </em>at 978-79 (holding that the inquiry into whether conduct is \u201cpurposeful, violent and aggressive\u201d is limited to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">We use the modified categorical approach to the residual clause \u201cwhen the law under which a defendant has been convicted contains different statutory phrases \u2014 some of which [qualify as crimes of violence] and some of which do not.\u201d <em>United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1091, 181 L.Ed.2d 976 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). The modified categorical approach permits us to look to the specific facts of a defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1175-76; <em>see also Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 145, 130 S.Ct. at 1273 (further noting that \u201cthe absence of records\u201d often frustrates this inquiry). When applying the modified categorical approach, sentencing courts are \u201cgenerally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>see Pantle, </em>637 F.3d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">The statute and subsection under which Turner was convicted prohibits sexual battery upon any child under the age of 16. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1994). \u201c \u2018Sexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object. ...\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(l)(h) (1994). Section 800.04(3) is a strict liability offense; therefore, consent is irrelevant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>not a defense. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1994); <em>State v. Sorakrai, </em>543 So.2d 294, 295 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989) (\u201cIt is our judgment that conduct violative of section 800.04 carries with it the same concept of \u2018strict liability\u2019 that has traditionally characterized \u2018statutory rape.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In <em>Harris, </em>we held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1996), identical to the version under which Turner was convicted, is not categorically a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>Harris, </em>608 F.3d at 1233. The government has conceded in its brief that a violation of this state law is not a crime of violence under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Turner concedes that, because he never objected to the district court\u2019s guideline calculation, his arguments on appeal should be reviewed for plain error. Because the district court did not articulate a basis for its implicit decision that Turner\u2019s \u00a7 800.04(3) conviction is a crime of violence, we review Turner\u2019s conviction under each of the three aforementioned analysis categories. <em>See Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">We conclude from the record that the district court plainly erred in treating Turner\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 800.04(3) as a crime of violence under the elements clause of the career offender guidelines because violent force is not an element of the offense. Like the statutory rape offense in <em>Owens, </em>a violation of \u00a7 800.04(3) requires physical contact, but it does \u201cnot require, as an element, the use of violent physical force against the victim.\u201d <em>See Owens, </em>672 F.3d. at 970-71. The elements the government must establish are the age of the offender, that sexual intercourse occurred, and that the victim was too young to give legal consent. <em>Compare </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4) (1994) (prohibiting anyone from \u201cengag[ing] in sexual activity\u201d with a person between 12 and 16 years of age), <em>with, e.g., </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.01l(4)(a)-(b) (1994) (criminalizing sexual battery of nonminors that is achieved by physical overpowering or threat of violence). Unlike Florida statute \u00a7 794.011(4)(a)-(b), \u00a7 800.04(3) is violated by mere physical contact, not physical force, and \u201cthe merest touching\u201d or \u201cthe slightest penetration\u201d does not show the kind of physical force required for a crime of violence. <em>See Owens, </em>672 F.3d at 971. Further, the government concedes that a violation of \u00a7 800.04(3) is not a crime of violence under the elements clause. Accordingly, it was plain error to treat Turner\u2019s Florida conviction under \u00a7 800.04(3) as a crime of violence under the elements clause of the career offender guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Because Turner\u2019s offense is not an enumerated crime of violence, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2), his conviction may only support a career offender enhancement if it fits within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause, under either the categorical or the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Under the categorical approach to the residual clause, we conclude that to treat Turner\u2019s Florida conviction under \u00a7 800.04(3) as a crime of violence was also plainly erroneous. <em>See Harris, </em>608 F.3d at 1233. Although a violation of \u00a7 800.04(3) \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d the statute \u201ccovers a wide array of conduct\u201d and not all such conduct qualifies as a crime of violence. <em>See id. </em>at 1229, 1232 (explaining that \u00a7 800.04(3) \u201ccriminal-iz[es] conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all\u201d). Accordingly, \u201ca violation of Florida statute \u00a7 800.04(3) generally\u2014 without further specifics \u2014 is not a crime of violence\u201d under the residual clause of the career offender guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>As for the modified categorical approach to the residual clause, the government concedes that it \u201cpresented no evidence at sentencing regarding the facts of Turner\u2019s conviction\u201d to show that Turner\u2019s offense qualified as a crime of violence. Without the government\u2019s introduction of <em>Shepard-</em>approved documents, it was plain error to conclude that Turner\u2019s Florida conviction under \u00a7 800.04(3) was a crime of violence under the residual clause. <em>United States v. Dunlap, </em>279 F.3d 965, 967 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cthe lack of evidentiary foundation for the application of [a guideline enhancement] is error; [and] it is plain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Although the district court plainly erred in treating Turner\u2019s Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) conviction as a crime of violence, we will not vacate his sentence unless the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. Here, without the career offender enhancement, Turner\u2019s guideline range would be reduced by four offense levels. Turner\u2019s imposed sentence of 110 months is at the low end of the incorrect guideline range, and there is a reasonable probability that the district court would have sentenced him differently if the correct offense level had been used. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 835 (11th Cir.2006) (vacating and remanding sentence because district court plainly erred in using a total offense level of 32 instead of 31). Accordingly, we conclude that the plain error affected Turner\u2019s substantial rights, and, and for that reason, we must vacate his sentence and remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Turner asserts, for the first time on appeal and to preserve the argument pending a potential Supreme Court decision, that the residual clause in the career offender guidelines is unconstitutionally vague. Accordingly, Turner argues, his first-degree burglary conviction should not be treated as a crime of violence. This argument is unavailing. The Supreme Court has held that the violent felony residual clause in the ACCA \u201cstates an intelligible principle and provides guidance that allows a person to conform his or her conduct to the law.\u201d <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2277, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has subsequently determined that <em>Sykes </em>\u201cappears to foreclose a conclusion, ... that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 978 n. 3. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in treating Turner\u2019s Florida burglary conviction as a crime of violence under the career offender guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, we vacate Turner\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
