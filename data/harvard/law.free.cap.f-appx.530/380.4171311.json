He argues that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not supported by empirical data. As Alvarez concedes, this argument that is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Alvarez also argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the illegal reentry guideline double counted his prior conviction for continuous sexual abuse of a minor by using it to calculate the criminal history score and by using it to increase the base offense level. Alvarez also argues that the guidelines range was too harsh for a nonviolent crime that was merely an international trespass. In addition, he contends that the guidelines range failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics. Specifically, Alvarez asserted that he had lived in the United States since he was three years old; his mother, siblings, and children lived in the United States legally; and his motive for returning was to be with his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The district court considered Alvarez\u2019s request for leniency, but it ultimately determined that a 46-month sentence was appropriate. Alvarez\u2019s arguments regarding his personal history and circumstances are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, we have previously rejected the argument that the double counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal history necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. Un<em>ited States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Additionally, we have rejected the argument that a guidelines sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because illegal reentry is a mere trespass offense. <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in imposing Alvarez\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
