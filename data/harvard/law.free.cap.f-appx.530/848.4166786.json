Mr. Trammell contends that the district court should have reduced his 120-month sentence because it was incorrect when it was imposed, as the government failed to give him notice at his original sentencing that he was subject to an enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. He also argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction under both Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA). Having considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Mr. Trammell pled guilty in 2008 to one count' of knowingly possessing five grams or more of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). Because he had a prior felony drug conviction, he was subject to an increased penalty under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. At his plea hearing, the district court asked Mr. Trammell if he understood the \u00a7 851 enhancement filed by the government because of his earlier drug crime. The court also asked Mr. Trammell if he understood that he could receive, among other penalties, \u201cnot less than ten years imprisonment.\u201d After both questions, Mr. Trammell acknowledged that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">At sentencing, the district court determined that Mr. Trammell\u2019s base offense level was 26 and that he was due a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, making his total offense level 23. The court also determined that, because of the \u00a7 851 enhancement, Mr. Trammell\u2019s statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months became his advisory guidelines range. The court then sentenced Mr. Trammell to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, specifically noting that it had imposed the statutory mandatory minimum sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">In 2011, Mr. Trammell filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750. The district court denied the motion because Amendment 750 did not lower Mr. Trammell\u2019s advisory guidelines range, and Mr. Trammell appealed that denial to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">Mr. Trammell\u2019s first argument on appeal \u2014 that his sentence was incorrect as imposed because he was not given notice of the \u00a7 851 enhancement \u2014 is both refuted by the record and outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Indeed, the record reflects that the government electronically filed an information alerting Mr. Trammell to the \u00a7 851 enhancement more than four weeks before his plea hearing. During the plea hearing, Mr. Trammell acknowledged that he understood the enhancement. And, after the district court specifically explained that his possible maximum penalty included imprisonment of not less than ten years or more than life, Mr. Trammell once again indicated that he understood. Put simply, the record does not support Mr. Trammell\u2019s contention that he received no notice of the \u00a7 851 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">But, even if Mr. Trammell were correct that the government failed to notify him of the \u00a7 851 enhancement and that he therefore should not have been subject to a 120-month statutory mandatory minimum, he would not be due the relief he seeks. We have recognized that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings and do not allow district courts to revisit rulings made at the original sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). An alleged flaw, like the one Mr. Trammell argues exists here, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>such a ruling does not permit a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Mr. Trammell also argues that the district court was authorized to consider his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 750 lowered his advisory guidelines range. But, as the district court noted when it denied relief, Mr. Trammell was subject (and sentenced) to a 120-month statutory mandatory minimum. We have held that a sentencing court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, even when an amendment would lower a defendant\u2019s otherwise-applicable advisory guidelines range, when the defendant was sentenced based on a statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010). Because Mr. Trammell was sentenced based on a statutory mandatory minimum, the district court had no authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Mr. Trammel\u2019s final argument is that he is eligible for a sentence reduction under the FSA, which reduced the statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums for crack cocaine offenses in \u00a7 841(b) and eliminated the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for \u00a7 841(a) crack cocaine offenses involving fewer than 28 grams. While the FSA would apply to Mr. Trammell if he were being sentenced today (because he was held responsible for 21.2 grams), we recently reiterated that the Act does not apply to defendants who were sentenced before it took effect in 2010. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013). Because Mr. Trammel was sentenced in 2008, the FSA does not entitle him to a sentence reduction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">The district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Tram-mell\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-10\">. Mr. Trammell\u2019s total offense level of 23 and criminal history category of III produced an advisory range of 57 to 71 months under the 2008 guidelines. Because his statutory mandatory minimum (after the \u00a7 851 enhancement) was 120 months, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), that figure became his advisory guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Although the court did not lay out these calculations step-by-step at the sentencing hearing, it did explain them when it denied Mr. Tram-mell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
