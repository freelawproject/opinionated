After pleading guilty in 2004 to distributing crack cocaine, Webster was sentenced as a career offender to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Webster argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335-36, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub. L. No. 111-220,124 Stat. 2372 (2010), and Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions concerning the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). The FSA, which became effective on August 3, 2010, \u201clowered the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). The FSA, however, is not a guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission, and cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>The FSA does not apply retroactively to sentences imposed prior to its enactment date. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78 (rejecting argument that, under <em>Dorsey, </em>the FSA\u2019s lower mandatory m\u00ednimums applied to defendants sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment). Amendment 750 revised the crack cocaine quantity tables to conform to the FSA. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750. It was made retroactive by Amendment 759, effective November 1, 2011. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">A reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where the applicable amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>because of the operation of another guideline.\u201d Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). This includes situations in which the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range is calculated through the application of the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1328. <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). Therefore, a defendant who was convicted of a crack cocaine offense but sentenced as a career offender remains ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">Here, the district court sentenced Webster for his crack cocaine offense as a career offender. Webster was sentenced in 2005, long before the FSA\u2019s 2010 enactment date. His argument that he is entitled to the lower mandatory m\u00ednimums based on <em>Dorsey </em>is foreclosed. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Likewise, Webster\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a \u00a7 3582 reduction, despite his status as a career offender, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Lawson. </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Accordingly, a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-9\">. Although Webster also challenges his career offender status, that determination was made at the original sentencing. Because a \u00a7 3582 proceeding is not a de novo resentencing, we do not have jurisdiction to revisit it. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
