Before that, he had been employed as a metal fabricator and auto mechanic. Six years after his accident, Holland filed for disability insurance and supplemental security income, alleging a disability onset date of March 1, 2004. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied Holland\u2019s claim, the Appeals Council denied review, and Holland filed his complaint in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">Rather than respond to Holland\u2019s complaint, the Commissioner requested a remand under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) for further development of the administrative record. On remand, the Appeals Council instructed the ALJ to: (1) give Holland another hearing; (2) supplement the record with additional evidence; and (3) consider Holland\u2019s Residual Functional Capacity. Following the second hearing, the ALJ determined that although Holland suffered from \u201csevere impairments,\u201d he had no impairment or combination of impairments \u201csevere enough to meet or equal\u201d an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404. Further, the ALJ determined that while Holland\u2019s impairments prevented him from doing \u201cpast relevant work,\u201d he remained employable as a \u201ctagger,\u201d \u201ccutter,\u201d or \u201cracker.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the ALJ concluded that Holland was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act (SSA).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">After the Commissioner completed the reassessment of Holland\u2019s claim, the district court reopened Holland\u2019s case. A magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the Commissioner\u2019s denial of Holland\u2019s claim be affirmed. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, and entered an order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-19\">In appeals from the denial of social security benefits, \u201c[o]ur review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to an inquiry into whether there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the Commissioner, and whether the correct legal standards were applied.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s decision on whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hale v. Bowen, </em>831 F.2d 1007, 1011 (11th Cir.1987). \u201cIt is more than a scintilla, but less than a pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>ponderanee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Like the district court, \u201c[w]e may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 </em>F.3d 1232, 1240 n. 8 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Under the SSA, a person is disabled if he is unable \u201cto do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1505(a). If disabled, a claimant is eligible for payment of disability insurance and supplemental security income. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(a)(1), 1382(a)(1); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.315(a)(3), 416.202(a)(3).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-6\">The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step, sequential evaluation process used to determine whether a claimant is disabled: (1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) whether the impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments; (4) based on a residual functional capacity ... assessment, whether the claimant can perform any of his or her past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) whether there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform given the claimant\u2019s [residual functional capacity], age, education, and work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-7\"><em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011); <em>see also Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). \u201cThe burden is primarily on the claimant to prove that he is disabled, and therefore entitled to receive Social Security disability benefits.\u201d <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Holland raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that the ALJ erred at step three of the analysis by failing to consider the \u201ccombined effects of all of [his] impairments,\u201d which include limited strength and mobility, asthma, and mental disorders. Next, Holland claims that the ALJ failed to account for his \u201cclosed head injury,\u201d his \u201chemiparesis,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his \u201cdepression\u201d when determining his Residual Functional Capacity. Finally, Holland asserts that the ALJ erred at step five by posing a deficient hypothetical question to the VE regarding his current employment prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">We are not persuaded by any of Holland\u2019s arguments. First, contrary to Holland\u2019s claim, in determining that Holland lacked an impairment that met or equaled a listed impairment, the ALJ expressly considered Holland\u2019s \u201ccombined impairments,\u201d with \u201cparticular consideration [given] to [his] physical impairments [and] ... mental disorders.\u201d The ALJ further considered \u201call symptoms and the extent to which these symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence.\u201d The ALJ went on to make \u201cspecific and well-articulated findings as to the effect of the combination of impairments and to decide whether the combined impairments cause[d] [Holland] to be disabled.\u201d <em>See Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996, 1001 (11th Cir.1987) (quotation marks omitted). In short, the ALJ applied the correct legal standard in concluding that Holland\u2019s impairments did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>equal a listed impairment, and the ALJ\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1224-25 (holding that the following statement by an ALJ evidenced consideration of the combined effect of a claimant\u2019s impairments: \u201cthe medical evidence establishes that Wilson had several injuries which constitute a \u2018severe impairment\u2019, but that he did not have an impairment or combination of impairments listed in, or medically equal to one listed in [the SSA]\u201d) (alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Nor are we convinced that substantial evidence failed to support the ALJ\u2019s Residual Functional Capacity assessment. In arriving at the conclusion that Holland retained the ability to \u201cperform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b),\u201d the ALJ discussed Holland\u2019s medical records extensively, comparing the evaluations of at least fourteen medical professionals spanning more than eleven years. These reports detailed Holland\u2019s head injury and its effect on his physical strength, mobility and motor skills, and extensively discussed his depressive episodes. The ALJ acknowledged some inconsistencies between Holland\u2019s various evaluations, but also pointed out that evaluations tending to corroborate Holland\u2019s claim to complete disability were \u201crudimentary, vague, ... incongruent with the record,\u201d and based on \u201cbrief\u2019 treatment histories, whereas evaluations supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination that Holland could still \u201cperform light work\u201d were corroborated and consistent over time. Thus substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Holland can still \u201cperform light work\u201d within the meaning of the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Finally, Holland suggests that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the VE regarding other jobs he can perform given his impairments was deficient because it \u201cfail[ed] to comprehensively describe[] [his] impairments in terms of the effect on [his] ability, to maintain employment.\u201d Again, Holland\u2019s claim is contradicted by the record. The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the VE expressly stated Holland\u2019s physical limitations \u2014 including that he should: (1) \u201conly lift and carry 10 pounds frequently, 20 occasionally, stand 6 hours, sit 6 hours\u201d; (2) \u201cavoid frequently descending stairs, ... pushing and pulling motions with his lower extremities, [and] hazards in the work place\u201d; and (3) avoid conditions that may aggravate his asthma \u2014 as well as his \u201cpsychological\u201d limitations \u2014 including an ability to only \u201cunderstand!], and carry[] out simple job instructions,\u201d not \u201ccomplex or detailed tasks.\u201d On this record, the ALJ\u2019s question adequately comprised all of Holland\u2019s impairments supported by the evidence. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]he ALJ [is] not required to include findings in the hypothetical that the ALJ ha[s] properly rejected as unsupported.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">In sum, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Holland was not disabled is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards. The Commissioner\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-13\">. The ALJ\u2019s assessment of Holland\u2019s present employability was informed by the testimony of a Vocational Expert (VE), who responded to a hypothetical question regarding whether and what jobs remain available to a person with Holland's disabilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-8\">. \"Hemiparesis\u201d is weakness on one side of the body.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
