Harris appeals the dismissal as time barred of his \u00a7 1983 action against Officer Anthony Tillman, arguing that his failure to effect timely service of process was due to \u201cinadvertence and delays due to no fault of [his own].\u201d The Magistrate Judge, who prepared a report and recommendation on Officer Tillman\u2019s motion to dismiss, agreed and recommended that the motion be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">The district court, however, rejected this recommendation, finding that Harris failed to supply either the correct address or name for defendant Tillman, causing the excessive delay in serving him and further causing the statute of limitations to expire before service had been effected. The court further held that Harris\u2019 subsequent \u201camendment\u201d of his complaint to provide the defendant\u2019s correct name did not \u201crelate back\u201d to the filing of his complaint because Tillman had no way of knowing he was being sued within the relevant time period. Accordingly, the district court granted Tillman\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that plaintiffs complaint was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">We have reviewed the record and considered the chain of events that led to the dismissal of Harris\u2019 complaint. On balance, we conclude that the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal should be affirmed. Accordingly, the judgment is.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
