On appeal, Draper argues that the district court erred by not granting her motion for judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence to establish that she possessed the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds,\u201d considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences in the government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Friske, </em>640 F.3d 1288, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2011). A verdict cannot be overturned \u201cif any reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291. However, if the government relies on circumstantial evidence, reasonable inferences \u2014 not mere speculation \u2014 must support the conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">Possession can be shown through either actual or constructive possession. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011). Constructive possession requires both (1) that the defendant knew about the firearm\u2019s presence and (2) that she had the ability and intent to later exercise dominion and control over that firearm. <em>Id. </em>The second requirement may be satisfied if the defendant intended to exercise the dominion and control through another person. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">A defendant\u2019s \u201cknowing participation in a joint criminal venture in which a particular firearm is intended to play a central part permits the jury to reasonably conclude that the defendant constructively possessed that gun.\u201d <em>Perez, </em>661 F.3d at 576-77; <em>see also United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that because the defendant was a passenger in the ear that held the guns, knew about the guns in the car, and played a leadership role in the armed robbery that the guns were used for, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that he had possession of the guns).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">Draper\u2019s brother testified that she asked him if he wanted to buy a gun and arranged for a time for him to meet her to look at it. Draper arrived at the meeting place in a car with the gun and two companions. She was then arrested. The po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>lice ran the identification number of the gun and discovered that it was stolen. Draper was indicted in state court for receiving two stolen guns. She pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property, and that plea was admitted into evidence in this case. Because Draper contacted her brother to arrange the sale, arrived at the designated place with the rifle in the car, and admitted to receiving stolen guns, the jury could reasonably find that Draper constructively possessed the rifle in a joint criminal venture to dispose of the stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
