Santana contends the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, based upon the drug quantity calculations in the PSI, Amendment 750 to the Guidelines would yield a lower Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion. Although a district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the modification must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provide that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907-08 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining retroactive guidelines amendment did not apply factually in defendant\u2019s case because sentence imposed was unaffected by amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to reduce offense levels in cases involving cocaine base. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750. Santana\u2019s applicable Guidelines range is not affected by Amendment 750. Santana\u2019s base offense level remains the same because the district court expressly found him accountable for 150 kilograms of cocaine, rather than cocaine base, at the sentencing hearing, as recorded in its Statement of Reasons. That finding, without more, supported his applicable base offense level of 38 and Guidelines range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Under the circumstances, Amendment 750 is not factually applicable to Santana\u2019s case as it pertains to cocaine base, not cocaine. The district court did not err in denying Santana\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. <em>See Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 907-08.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the sentencing guidelines and the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b899-8\">. Santana\u2019s arguments concerning the breakdown of the drug quantities in the PSI do not change this result because the district court stated at sentencing and later in its statement of reasons that, based on witness testimony, it was holding Santana responsible for at least 150 kilograms of cocaine, in addition to more than 8 kilograms of cocaine base. To the extent Santana is arguing the district court erred in its original determination of drug quantity, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider that claim in the context of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
