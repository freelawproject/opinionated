He contends that the sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), partly because the Sentencing Guidelines for illegal reentry are not empirically based and partly because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the district court gave inadequate consideration to his personal circumstances and motive for reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Because the guidelines range was properly calculated, Luna-Morales\u2019s sentence at the bottom of that range is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Luna-Morales essentially asks us to substitute his assessment of the relevant sentencing factors for the district court\u2019s well-reasoned assessment, which is contrary to the deferential review dictated by <em>Gall </em>and <em>Rita. </em>Luna-Morales concedes that his challenge to Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 as lacking an empirical basis is foreclosed by our precedent; he presents this issue only to preserve it for possible further review. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
