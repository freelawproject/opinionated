He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, because it violates the \u201cparsimony principle\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-22\">We review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008), which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). Applying \u201cdeferential\u201d review, we must determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [court] accorded to a given factor ... as long \u00e1s the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). In other words, we will not reweigh the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and will not remand for resentenc-ing unless the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by imposing a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"AoR\">The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). While we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect that sentence to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">For starters, we are unpersuaded by Browning\u2019s argument that the district court violated the \u201cparsimony clause\u201d by sentencing him to a greater sentence than necessary. Indeed, we have criticized the use of the phrase \u201cparsimony principle\u201d when referencing the \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d sentencing requirement of \u00a7 3553(a) because the phrase \u201ctends to slant the discussion toward shorter sentences by emphasizing only\u201d the need to avoid sentences that are too long. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">Moreover, Browning has not shown that his sentence of 10 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 26 months\u2019 supervised release, is substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Browning\u2019s serious criminal record and his problems following rules. The court further said that Browning had not tried to comply with the terms of his supervised release and had caused a great deal of trouble to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>people who were trying to help him. The court also recognized that Browning required additional educational and corrective treatment, and thus, it ordered him to participate in a cognitive skills program upon his release from prison. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision to impose a within guidelines sentence of 10 months\u2019 imprisonment was substantively reasonable, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect th\u00e9 seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-18\">. Browning argues only that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, and thus, he has abandoned any arguments as to procedural unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that a party abandons an issue on appeal if not raised plainly and prominently).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
