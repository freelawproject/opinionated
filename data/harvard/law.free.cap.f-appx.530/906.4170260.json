Hall argues that the district court plainly erred by sentencing him to a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years based on a finding by the court, not the jury, that Hall brandished a firearm during a robbery, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). We conclude, based on the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), that the district court plainly erred in sentencing Hall, but the error did not affect his substantial rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">The record establishes, without dispute, that Hall brandished a firearm during a robbery. At trial, three employees present during the robbery of a Radio Shack in Miami, Florida, identified Hall as the robber and testified that he displayed a firearm and racked it in their presence before instructing them to open the cash register and go to the back of the store. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>the trial, the jury also watched a surveillance video, admitted without objection, that depicted a robber, identified by an employee as Hall, pulling out a firearm and racking it in the store. The probation officer alleged in his presentence investigation report that, during the robbery, Hall removed a black semi-automatic pistol, \u2022racked the slide back and told one of the employees to open the cash register. The report recommended a sentencing guideline range for Hall\u2019s firearm offense of seven years of imprisonment, which is the statutory minimum for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). Hall offered no factual or legal objections to the presentence investigation report. The district court adopted the factual findings and guideline calculations in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Hall argues that, in the light of the recent decision in <em>Alleyne, </em>the district court erred by not submitting the question whether he brandished the firearm to the jury. When a defendant fails to object to allegations of fact in a presentence investigation report, the defendant admits those facts for purposes of sentencing, and \u201c[a] sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact may be based on undisputed statements in the [report].\u201d <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006). And when a defendant fails to object to a finding by the district court at sentencing, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). To establish plain error, a defendant must show (1) an error (2) that is plain and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If all three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[ o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The Court later clarified that facts guiding judicial discretion below a statutory maximum sentence need not be submitted to a jury. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 565, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2418, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). But in <em>Alleyne, </em>the Court overruled its decision in <em>Harris </em>and held that \u201cfacts that increase mandatory minimum sentences must be submitted to the jury.\u201d 570 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 2163 (concluding that a jury must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant brandished a firearm during a crime of violence). Notably, in <em>Alleyne, </em>the defendant objected to the recommendation in the presentence investigation report of a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years and argued that the jury had not found that he had brandished a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Based on the decision in <em>Alleyne, </em>the district court committed plain error by not submitting to the jury the question whether Hall brandished a firearm during the robbery, but the error does not require reversal because Hall\u2019s substantial rights were unaffected. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. Three witnesses at trial identified Hall as the robber, and they testified that he displayed a firearm and racked it in their presence. The jury also viewed a surveillance video from the night of the robbery, which depicted Hall pulling out a firearm and racking it in the store. And Hall made no factual or legal objections to the presentence investigation report, which stated that he removed a black semi-automatic pistol and racked the slide back in the store and recommended a sentence of seven years of imprisonment as the statutory mandatory minimum, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). In contrast with the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>fendant in <em>Alleyne, </em>Hall conceded at sentencing that he had brandished a firearm during the robbery. We affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
