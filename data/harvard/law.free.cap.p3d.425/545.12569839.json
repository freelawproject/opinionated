Brush murdered his former girlfriend, Lisa Bonney. The court imposed the exceptional sentence in part under RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h)(i), based on a finding that Brush had committed an aggravated domestic violence offense as part of an ongoing pattern of psychological abuse of Bonney manifested by multiple incidents over a prolonged period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that (1) the domestic violence/ongoing pattern of psychological abuse aggravator is not unconstitutionally overbroad; (2) under\n   <em>\n    State v.

In April 2008, Bonney moved into Brush's house in Oregon along with her daughter, Elizabeth Bonney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a fight, Brush excluded them from the house and prevented them from returning by changing the locks on the doors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Domestic Violence Incident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Brush and Bonney continued to have contact and later lived together in Long Beach, Washington. On July 25, 2009, an altercation at their house resulted in Brush smashing a wine bottle against the counter, throwing electronics and personal possessions belonging to Bonney out of the house, and using a hammer to dent the hood and roof of Bonney's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 When law enforcement responded, Brush alleged that Bonney had assaulted him by scratching him. The officers determined that Bonney was the primary aggressor, arrested her, and took her to jail. The following day, Brush withdrew his statement and stated that the assault had never occurred. Brush later admitted that his allegations against Bonney were untrue. After that night, Bonney and Elizabeth moved into a different house in Long Beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Brush's Stalking of Bonney\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Over the next month, on several occasions Brush appeared to be following Bonney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Two incidents occurred when Bonney was with a friend, Dan Driscoll. On August 12, while Bonney was getting food with Driscoll, she saw a pickup truck drive by. Driscoll later testified that after Bonney saw the truck she became terrified. Bonney and Driscoll then went to the beach, where Driscoll saw the truck again. Bonney told him that the truck belonged to Brush. She said that she wanted to leave because she did not feel safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 On August 16, Bonney and Driscoll went to a local festival where Bonney again saw Brush's truck. She became scared, causing her and Driscoll to leave for Driscoll's parents' house. While Bonney and Driscoll were at the house, Bonney left to talk to Brush. After she returned, Brush came to the house and knocked on the door. Bonney told Driscoll to be quiet and not to answer, and she said that she did not want any contact with Brush.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 Bonney left immediately afterwards and called Elizabeth. She told Elizabeth that Brush was stalking her and asked Elizabeth to meet her at their house. Elizabeth testified that Bonney sounded scared on the phone and that she was crying. Bonney and Elizabeth went to a friend's house while they tried to figure out what to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 Later that night, Bonney and Elizabeth thought it would be safe to go to the beach, a few blocks away. Before leaving the apartment, Elizabeth looked to see if Brush's truck was nearby-she testified that several times before he had been watching them from around the corner. Elizabeth testified that as they walked along the edge of the road, she heard a truck and saw the lights of the truck behind them. As Elizabeth heard the truck accelerating, she turned around and saw that the truck was not stopping. She thought either that they would be hit by the truck or that there would be some other altercation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 Bonney and Elizabeth ran to a nearby parking lot and hid. As the truck drove past, Elizabeth saw that Brush was inside. Bonney and Elizabeth were both shaken up and crying. Bonney was so scared that she began throwing up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 When Bonney and Elizabeth returned to their house, there were voice messages on their phone in which Brush stated, \"If you don't answer I'm sure that your work would love to see naked pictures posted on the front door. Like I'm sure these people would love to see it if you're not going to talk to me.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) (Nov. 15, 2016) at 219. He also threatened to turn her in for improperly collecting unemployment and for committing tax fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Brush made a second assault complaint against Bonney with the police. Again, the complaint was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Another of Bonney's friends, Steven Berglund, later testified about two more incidents in which Brush appeared to be following Bonney. On August 31, Berglund was helping Bonney move a bed to her new house when he saw Brush sitting in his truck two blocks away. Brush left when Berglund saw him, but returned to the same area a little while later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 On September 4, Berglund and a friend were talking with Bonney in a parking lot when Brush drove by very slowly and looked at them. Berglund testified that when he pointed Brush out to Bonney, she seemed frightened and fearful that Brush was there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Bonney's Death\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 On September 11, Brush and Bonney had been discussing various financial issues by text message and they agreed to meet in person. Bonney suggested meeting at a park. When they met, Brush and Bonney began to argue. As the argument escalated, Brush got a shotgun from his nearby truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 Brush used the shotgun to shoot Bonney four times at a short distance, killing her. The last shot, to Bonney's head, was at a distance of three or four feet. Three law enforcement officers were walking nearby and witnessed the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Conviction and Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 A jury found Brush guilty of first degree murder. The jury also found a number of aggravating factors under RCW 9.94A.535(3) for purposes of sentencing, including that the crime was an aggravated\n   domestic violence offense. The trial court's jury instruction defined \"aggravated domestic violence offense\" to include an offense that involved domestic violence and was part of an ongoing pattern of psychological abuse over a prolonged period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 Brush's standard range sentence was between 240 and 320 months, plus a 60 month firearm enhancement. However, the trial court imposed a 1,000 month exceptional sentence with the 60 month firearm enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 Brush appealed his sentence, arguing that the jury instruction on the domestic violence/ ongoing pattern of psychological abuse aggravator, RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h), provided an improper definition of \"prolonged period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court admitted testimony regarding Brush's stalking of Bonney and their interactions, as described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 The trial court entered written findings of fact and conclusions of law, including the following conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   3. This offense was an aggravated domestic violence offense that was part of an ongoing pattern of psychological or physical abuse manifested by multiple incidents over a prolonged period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   4. It is further evident that Brush's conduct and acts, including physical damage to Lisa's property and the harm caused, including the conduct which was not reported, which included\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   repeatedly stalking Lisa, demonstrated a pattern of psychological abuse warranting a finding that this was an aggravated domestic violence offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 244. The court concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was an aggravated domestic violence offense under RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23 The trial court attached a similar statement to its judgment and sentence. The court found that Brush's offense involved domestic violence and the offense was part of an ongoing pattern of psychological abuse manifested by multiple incidents over a prolonged period of time and that Brush's conduct manifested deliberate cruelty. Based on its findings and the jury's prior finding, the court again imposed a 1,000 month exceptional sentence plus an additional 60 month firearm enhancement. The court did not state that it would have imposed the same sentence if only one of the aggravators had been present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 Brush appeals his exceptional sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A.

If the trier of fact finds one of these factors, the trial court is allowed but not required to impose an exceptional sentence. RCW 9.94A.535 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 69 Brush also argues that because the post-\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   amendments to RCW 9.94A.535 and the enactment of RCW 9.94A.537 now place substantive limits on the trial court's ability to impose an exceptional sentence, he has a protected liberty interest in a standard range sentence subject to the vagueness doctrine. Brush is correct that after\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   , any fact supporting an aggravated sentence under RCW 9.94A.535(3) must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    542 U.S. at 301-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   and the SRA amendments did not impact the trial court's sentencing authority once an aggravating factor is properly found.

The statute does not address what sentence the trial court must impose. Instead, RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h)(i) simply provides that when the jury determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the psychological abuse aggravating factor applied, the trial court can impose an exceptional sentence within the statutory maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 71 Because RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h)(i) did not fix the sentence for Brush's conviction and did not specify that a particular sentence had to be imposed, the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Baldwin\n   </em>\n   of the vagueness challenge to the former version of RCW 9.94A.535(3)(d) applies equally to Brush's vagueness challenge to RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h)(i).
