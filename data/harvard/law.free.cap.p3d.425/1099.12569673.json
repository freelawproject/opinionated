Plaintiff American Furniture Warehouse Co. (AFW) appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Town of Gilbert. AFW argues that the required payment was an unconstitutional taking and, alternatively, that AFW was denied a required appeals hearing. Although the required payment was not unconstitutional, because AFW has a right to a statutory exaction appeals hearing, summary judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 AFW operates regional furniture distribution facilities, each typically consisting of a building that includes a showroom (which is open to the public and is used for retail sales), a warehouse and a mezzanine (including an office and shops to assemble and repair furniture). AFW decided to develop such a facility in Gilbert, with a building covering nearly 15 acres of a 40-acre parcel of land that AFW purchased in early 2013. The 630,290 square-foot building includes a 177,092 square-foot retail showroom (about 28 percent of the building), a 397,800 square-foot warehouse and 50-door loading dock (more than 63 percent), a 49,798 square-foot mezzanine (nearly 8 percent) and a 5,600 square-foot maintenance area (less than 1 percent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 To obtain development permits, AFW was required to pay Gilbert various fees, including a traffic signal System Development Fee (SDF). In 2009, the town adopted the traffic signal SDF in Gilbert Ordinance 2226, based on projected traffic patterns and \"growth-related costs allocated to traffic signals.\" The traffic signal SDF imposes on new commercial structures different per square foot rates using \"Retail,\" \"Office,\" \"Industrial\" or \"Other Nonresidential\" categories. The per square foot rates differ significantly:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-14\">Category Rate Retail $1.593 per square foot Office $0.570 per square foot Industrial $0.405 per square foot Other \"To be determined by the Town Engineer. The Nonresidential Town Engineer will estimate trip generation and determine the traffic [signal SDF] based on the most closely aligned category of either: retail, office or industrial. The [SDF] then is assessed\" using Retail, Office or Industrial rates.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   These categories are not defined in Ordinance 2226, which also does not include provisions addressing multiple or mixed uses on a property. For multiple or mixed uses, Gilbert identifies one category for the entire project based on \"the main purpose of the building.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Gilbert classified AFW's building as Retail. Applying the $1.593 per-square-foot Retail rate to the entire 630,290 square-foot building, Gilbert required AFW to pay more than $1 million as a traffic signal SDF. Paying under protest, AFW timely challenged the requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 AFW argued the building is Industrial (yielding a lower traffic signal SDF), because that category more closely described AFW's development. AFW also argued that applying the Retail rate was not reasonably related to costs the development would impose on Gilbert. AFW also requested a statutory exaction appeals hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (A.R.S.) \u00a7 9-500.12(A)(1) (2018)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (affording property owners an administrative appeal from \"a dedication or exaction as a condition of granting approval for the use, improvement or development of real property,\" unless the dedication or exaction is \"required in a legislative act by the governing body of a city or town that does not give discretion\" in determining \"the nature or extent of the dedication or exaction\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Gilbert denied AFW's protest, stating land use (not trip counts, as AFW argued) determines the traffic signal SDF category; \"the main purpose of the building is to sell furniture and ship furniture to customers,\" meaning the Retail category applied and, as a result, the Other Nonresidential category did not. Concluding that Ordinance 2226 is a legislative act, meaning AFW had no right to appeal, Gilbert also denied AFW's request for a statutory exaction administrative appeals hearing. In July 2013, AFW timely filed this case in superior court. AFW's claims were resolved in two rounds of summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 The first round addressed AFW's original complaint. AFW sought to recover the traffic signal SDF paid under protest, alleging the fee was an unconstitutional exaction or taking (Counts 1, 3 and 6). AFW also challenged Gilbert's denial of its request for a statutory exaction administrative appeals hearing (Counts 2 and 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After briefing and argument on competing summary judgment motions, the court ruled in favor of Gilbert and against AFW on Counts 1, 3 and 6, stating the traffic signal SDF \"is a legislative act that carries a presumption of validity.\" Finding the appeal hearing claims (Counts 2 and 4) should have been filed as a special action, the court allowed AFW to amend its complaint to seek special action review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 AFW filed an amended pleading and the parties filed the second round of competing summary judgment motions, which addressed those amended Counts seeking special action review. After briefing and argument, the court ruled in favor of Gilbert and against AFW. The court found Gilbert's denial of AFW's \"protest is supported by competent evidence and [the] plain language application of the Town Code\" and \"that the denial is not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.\" Entry of final judgment followed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 54(c), and this court has jurisdiction over AFW's timely appeal pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 Summary judgment is proper when the moving party \"shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Ariz.

AFW Did Not Waive Its Claims Resolved By The First Summary Judgment Ruling.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 Gilbert argues AFW waived its right to challenge on appeal claims that were resolved in the first summary judgment ruling (Counts 1, 3 and 6) because AFW's amended complaint did not reassert those claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In essence, Gilbert is arguing that AFW was required to do a pointless act (reassert claims that the superior court had already resolved against AFW by summary judgment) and that the failure to do so results in a waiver of AFW's right to challenge the court's ruling on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 The authority Gilbert cites stands for the proposition that an amended complaint supersedes the pleading it amends because \"a plaintiff may not pursue two complaints in the same action.\"\n   <em>\n    Mohave Concrete and Materials, Inc. v.

But the fact that only one complaint is operative at any given time does not mean, as Gilbert asserts, that an amended pleading causes a prior pleading to disappear. This is particularly true where dispositive rulings on the merits resolved claims in the prior complaint. Although scant, Arizona case law runs counter to Gilbert's argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Second, it noted\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   involved a requirement that the landowner \"cede a part of her property to the city, a particularly invasive form of land regulation,\" while Scottsdale's water resources development fee involved payment of \"a fee, a considerably more benign form of regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806832\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/479/#p486\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 23 Applying\n   <em>\n    City of Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   , the traffic signal SDF was established by an ordinance applicable to all development based upon a fee schedule that AFW does not challenge.

It is not the product of Gilbert's \"\n   <em>\n    adjudicative\n   </em>\n   decision to impose a condition tailored to the particular circumstances of an individual case\" that would risk \"regulatory leveraging\" and does not involve AFW transferring a portion of the property to Gilbert.

Moreover, to the extent AFW asks that the\n   <em>\n    City of Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   analysis be altered, such a request is properly addressed to the Arizona Supreme Court. AFW has not shown that the\n   <em>\n    Nollan\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   analysis applies here, meaning the superior court properly concluded that the traffic signal SDF is a generally applicable legislative act not subject to scrutiny under that analysis.

AFW Has A Statutory Right To An Exaction Administrative Appeals Hearing.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 29 AFW argues that it should have been granted a statutory exaction appeals hearing to challenge the application of the traffic signal SDF to its development. By statute,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   a property owner may appeal the following actions relating to the owner's property by a city or town, or an administrative agency or official of a city or town, in the manner prescribed by this section:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   1. The requirement by a city or town of a dedication or exaction as a condition of granting approval for the use, improvement or development of real property. This section does not apply to a dedication or exaction required in a legislative act by the governing body of a city or town\n   <em>\n    that does not give discretion to the administrative agency or official to determine the nature or extent of the dedication or exaction\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 9-500.12(A)(1) (emphasis added). Gilbert denied\n   AFW's request for such a hearing, and the superior court denied AFW's request for special action relief to compel such a hearing. That court found Gilbert's denial of AFW's protest was \"supported by competent evidence and a plain language application\" of Ordinance 2226 and the denial was \"not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 30 Special action relief may be sought for the failure \"to perform a duty required by law as to which [a party] has no discretion,\" or from an \"arbitrary and capricious\" decision.

In this case, AFW had a right to an administrative appeal of Gilbert's requirement that it pay the traffic signal SDF unless that provision \"does not give discretion to the administrative agency or official to determine the nature or extent of the dedication or exaction.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 9-500.12(A)(1). Gilbert argues it had no discretion under the traffic signal SDF, while AFW argues it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 31 As stated above, under the traffic signal SDF, the per square foot rate differs significantly based on whether the structure is categorized Retail, Office, Industrial or Other Nonresidential. Gilbert Code 10-3.1(a)(5) (May 21, 2013). Gilbert determines the fee based on information provided in the permit application. The traffic signal SDF, however, does not define the categories or provide guidance in determining which category to use or how mixed-use developments should be categorized. As a result, in this case, application of the traffic signal SDF necessarily involves discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 32 Gilbert exercised its discretion when it concluded AFW's development should be categorized Retail based on the \"main purpose of the building,\" as opposed to the majority use of the building. Gilbert adopted the International Building Code (IBC), which AFW used in its permit application. While AFW's permit application was for a 630,000 square-foot facility, it listed the following IBC occupancy codes: 178,000 square feet of mercantile (showroom), 46,000 square feet of factory (mezzanine for manufacturing and office space) and 407,000 square feet of storage (warehouse). Even though most of the building is a warehouse, Gilbert decided \"the main purpose of the building is to sell furniture and ship furniture to customers.\" Gilbert then decided that the development would be categorized as Retail in its entirety and applied the Retail rate to the entire facility. That determination imposed a traffic signal SDF of approximately $1,000,000, which is substantially more than would have been imposed if Gilbert had determined the fee based on the specific uses for portions of the building or use of an Office or Industrial category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 33 Given its mixed use, Gilbert could have decided the development was Other Nonresidential. Although that phrase is not defined, Gilbert stated the phrase is \"neither retail, office or industrial\" and \"might be a school, a church, or a hospital.\" Because a mixed-use property is not entirely Retail, Office or Industrial, and could be considered Other Nonresidential, Gilbert's determination that mixed-use properties are not Other Nonresidential involved the exercise of discretion. And if it had done so, the traffic signal SDF imposed could have been significantly less than what Gilbert required AFW to pay based on the Retail category determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 34 As a final example, Gilbert had discretion when it categorized AFW's building as\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   retail. Gilbert argues it is not authorized to categorize \"a retail development or structure at anything other than the retail rate or to apply different rates to various sections within a single structure.\" But just as Ordinance 2226 does not expressly authorize a mixed category, it does not prohibit Gilbert from assessing the traffic signal SDF based on proportional use. Proportional use would be consistent with the purpose of the traffic signal SDF: to cover costs associated with expansion of the traffic signal network\n   required to serve new development. Gilbert Code 10-3.1(a)(5). Such a purpose could be achieved by proportioning the fee imposed by category based on stated use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 35 On this record, Gilbert could have selected the category (and the resulting rate) based on a majority use, used the Other Nonresidential category or proportioned the category based on stated use of the various parts of the building. That Gilbert did not do so does not, as Gilbert suggests, mean it lacked discretion to do so. Because Gilbert had discretion in determining the appropriate category and resulting fee under the traffic signal SDF, AFW had a statutory right to an exaction administrative appeals hearing to challenge its determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 9-500.12(A)(1). Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment rejecting AFW's request for special action relief to compel such a hearing pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 9-500.12 is vacated and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 36 Cities and towns frequently require payment of fees as a condition for the issuance of building permits. Whether those fees are to be analyzed using a \"rough proportionality\" test, and if so how, appears less than certain under relevant precedent. For decades, United States Supreme Court Justices have noted the continuing need for clarification in that analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This opinion continues down that uncertain path and, in doing so, perhaps affords courts asked to consider this opinion an opportunity to further clarify the law, particularly following\n   <em>\n    Koontz\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 37 For now, however, and for the reasons set forth above, summary judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. More specifically, the superior court properly found the traffic signal SDF was a generally applicable legislative act and properly granted Gilbert summary judgment on counts 1, 3 and 6 of AFW's original complaint. The grant of summary judgment for Gilbert on counts 2 and 4 of AFW's amended complaint is vacated and this matter is remanded for an administrative appeals hearing to challenge the exaction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 9-500.12(A)(1). Given the relief granted, the court determines that for purposes of an award of attorneys' fees, neither Gilbert nor AFW is the successful or prevailing party on appeal. AFW is, however, awarded its taxable costs contingent upon its compliance with Arizona Rule of Civil Appellate Procedure 21.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Absent material revisions after the relevant dates, statutes and rules cited refer to the current version unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    AFW also alleged a proposition violation (Count 5), which was dismissed by agreement of the parties and is not at issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Gilbert also states AFW could have \"sought entry of\" a partial final judgment \"to preserve and appeal these claims.\" Although that statement is true,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Ariz.
