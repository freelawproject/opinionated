He timely appealed, but this court later dismissed that appeal pursuant to Varela's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Varela sought post-conviction relief, arguing in his petition that he had received ineffective assistance of trial counsel in that counsel had not investigated the scene of the offense or called \"a key witness\" and appellate counsel had \"dropped the ball on Direct Appeal.\" The trial court summarily denied relief, finding that Varela's claims were precluded, untimely, or \"lack[ed] sufficient basis in law and fact to warrant further proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 On review Varela argues his claims were not precluded or untimely, and the trial court erred in summarily denying relief.

He asserted counsel had filed a motion to dismiss his appeal without his consent and failed to communicate with him about the Rule 32 proceeding after the appeal was dismissed. On the record before us, counsel moved to dismiss the appeal in July 2015. A letter from Varela to counsel in September 2015 suggests Varela believed the appeal was still pending. Varela also included with his petition letters counsel had written to him, and in one dated in September 2015, counsel stated, \"I came to the conclusion that there were no appealable issues in your case. Thus, the appeal portion was dismissed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The United States Supreme Court has \"long held that a lawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Roe v.

Furthermore, \"the decision to appeal rests with the defendant,\" and thus, although failure to consult with one's client will not always be deemed deficient, \"counsel has a constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant would want to appeal ... or (2) that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 479-80,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p477\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, Arizona's constitution guarantees the right to appeal, and that right may only be waived \"if the waiver is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In view of the procedural posture of the case, the trial court must determine whether counsel consulted with Varela before dismissing the appeal.
