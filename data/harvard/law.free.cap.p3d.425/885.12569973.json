Robbins and Harlene E. Robbins appeal from an order granting the motion for summary judgment by Mason County Title Insurance Company (MCTI)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and denying the Robbinses' cross-motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Robbinses assert that the terms of their title insurance policy obligated MCTI to defend against a claim by the Squaxin Island Tribe (Tribe) that the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Treaty) gave it the right to take shellfish on the Robbinses' tidelands. The Robbinses also argue that because MCTI unreasonably breached its duty to defend, the company acted in bad faith as a matter of law and should be estopped from denying coverage. The Robbinses also request us to award them attorney fees and costs incurred both in the superior court and in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 MCTI asserts that the Robbinses' policy did not afford coverage and that it was under no duty to defend. MCTI also claims there was nothing to defend against, since the underlying issues between the Robbinses and the Tribe were already determined by litigation concerning the scope of tribal shellfish rights. MCTI further argues that the general exception\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for \"public or private easements not disclosed by the public records\" applies to the Robbinses' claim. Finally,\n   MCTI argues it pled several affirmative defenses that the superior court has yet to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 We hold that MCTI owed a duty to defend under the policy, its failure to do so constituted bad faith, and MCTI is estopped from denying coverage. We remand to the superior court to consider the merits of MCTI's affirmative defenses. Because those defenses remain to be decided, any decision on attorney fees and costs is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Accordingly, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 In 1978, the Robbinses purchased two tracts of land, which included tidelands formerly owned by the state of Washington. The Robbinses also purchased a policy of title insurance from MCTI dated June 12, 1978, which provides that MCTI would insure the Robbinses \"against loss or damage sustained by reason of: ... [a]ny defect in, or lien or encumbrance on, said title existing at the date [t]hereof.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 228-32. More specifically, the policy states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. The Company shall have the right to, and will, at its own expense, defend the insured with respect to all demands and legal proceedings founded upon a claim of title, encumbrance or defect which existed or is claimed to have existed prior to the date hereof and is not set forth or excepted herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CP at 232. The policy contains several general exceptions, including \"public or private easements not disclosed by the public records.\" CP at 231. The policy defines \"public records\" as \"records which, under the recording laws, impart constructive notice with respect to said real estate.\" CP at 232.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 After purchasing the property, the Robbinses entered into contracts with a number of commercial shellfish harvesters. One of the harvesters notified the Tribe of his intent to harvest shellfish on the Robbinses' property. The Tribe sent the harvester a letter requesting more information, disagreeing with the harvester's opinion that the Robbinses' clam bed was not natural, and referring to its rights under the Shellfish Implementation Plan, adopted to implement\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On July 26, the Tribe sent the Robbinses a certified letter outlining its plan to harvest shellfish on their tidelands in accordance with\n   <em>\n    United States v. Washington\n   </em>\n   and the Shellfish Implementation Plan. The Tribe based this claim on its rights under the Treaty and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Washington\n   </em>\n   to take 50 percent of the harvestable shellfish biomass within its usual and accustomed grounds and stations. On August 9, MCTI sent the Robbinses a letter that declined any duty to defend the Tribe's claim on the Robbinses behalf; the letter advised, among other things, that there was no coverage under their policy for the Tribe's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The Robbinses filed a complaint against MCTI for damages caused by its claimed improper refusal to defend and requesting that MCTI be estopped from denying coverage. MCTI filed its answer and affirmative defenses, which included the statute of limitations, laches, waiver, failure to mitigate damages, failure to submit proof of loss, failure to state a claim, failure to state a cause of action, election of alternative remedies, and a claim that plaintiffs have suffered no damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 MCTI filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that because the Robbinses' policy did not afford coverage for the Tribe's asserted Treaty right, there was no duty to defend. MCTI's motion for summary judgment did not argue any of the affirmative defenses set forth in its answer, but only addressed coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Robbinses then filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment. The Robbinses argued that their policy afforded coverage, no general exceptions applied, and MCTI had a duty to defend against the Tribe's claim to harvest shellfish on their tidelands. The Robbinses' cross-motion for\n   partial summary judgment did not request summary judgment on any of MCTI's affirmative defenses. In its response to the Robbinses' cross-motion for partial summary judgment MCTI argued, among other matters, that its motion for summary judgment only sought to determine the issue of coverage, its affirmative defenses are to some degree based in fact, and it had not had the opportunity to conduct discovery, in particular on the defenses of statute of limitations, laches, waiver, and mitigation of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The superior court granted MCTI's motion for summary judgment and denied the Robbinses' motion for partial summary judgment. As part of its order, the superior court dismissed all of the Robbinses' claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 The Robbinses appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I.

MCTI argues that where there is no coverage, there is no duty to defend and that the Robbinses' policy did not afford coverage. We agree with the Robbinses that MCTI had a duty to defend\n   because the policy conceivably covers the allegations in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 Their policy states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1.

There is no dispute that the Robbinses are the named \"insured\" under the policy. We note also that the record contains no evidence the Tribe commenced any \"legal proceedings\" against the Robbinses and that this fact is likewise undisputed. Thus, our initial inquiry involves whether the Tribe's assertion of its right to harvest shellfish constituted a \"demand\" \"founded upon a claim of title, encumbrance or defect which existed or is claimed to have existed prior to\" June 12, 1978, the date the Robbinses' policy issued.

The Tribe clearly asserted its legal rights under\n   <em>\n    United States v. State of Washington\n   </em>\n   in its notification and plan to harvest shellfish on the Robbinses' tidelands. Therefore, the Tribe made a \"demand\" as contemplated by the plain meaning of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 \"Title\" is commonly defined as, \"[l]egal evidence of a person's ownership rights in property; an instrument (such as a deed) that constitutes such evidence.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1712 (10th ed. 2014). The Tribe has not founded its demand on a claim of title to the Robbinses' property, as it is commonly understood. Nor does it claim to have possession or custody of the shellfish on the Robbinses' property, or an instrument, such as a deed, giving it ownership of the tidelands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 Our Supreme Court has defined an \"encumbrance\" as \"a burden upon land depreciative of its value, such as a lien, easement, or servitude, which, though adverse to the interest of the landowner, does not conflict with his conveyance of the land in fee.\"\n   <em>\n    Hebb v.

A right to 'hawk, hunt, fish, and fowl' may thus exist as a profit, for this gives the right to take creatures living on the soil which, when killed, are capable of being owned. But a right to take water from a spring or a pump, or the right to water cattle at a pond, may be an easement but cannot be a profit; for the water, when taken, was not owned by anyone nor was it part of the soil.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1404 (10th ed. 2014) (quoting ROBERT E.

MCTI claims a profit \u00e0 prendre is a form of easement and although there may be distinctions among various forms of easements, that does not mean they are not still easements. MCTI cites a definition contained in the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Property\n   </em>\n   to argue that \" '[a] profit a prendre\n   <em>\n    is an easement\n   </em>\n   that confers the right to enter and remove timber, mineral, oil, gas, game, or other substance from the land in possession of another.' \" Br. of Resp't at 17-18 (emphasis added) (quoting RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF PROPERTY (SERVITUDES) \u00a7 1.2 (2000) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 34 The Tribe's treaty \"right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations,\" which includes the right to take shellfish, inescapably entails the right to come onto the Robbinses tidelands and harvest shellfish from the seabed. This right is akin to a profit \u00e0 prendre, although the right of access by itself is more like an easement. As stated, an easement and a profit \u00e0 prendre are distinctly different categories of servitudes, nuanced and definable.

Pollard Group., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217442\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/152/828/#p840\">\n    152 Wash.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840-42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20P.3d%20791\">\n    100 P.3d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), for the proposition that MCTI had the burden of setting forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 44 In its answer, MCTI pled several affirmative defenses. The Robbinses' cross-motion for partial summary judgment did not seek summary judgment on any of MCTI's affirmative defenses. In its response to the Robbinses' cross-motion, however, MCTI argued, among other matters, that its affirmative defenses are to some degree based in fact and it had not had the opportunity to conduct discovery, in particular, on the defenses of statute of limitations, laches, waiver, and mitigation of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 45 The Robbinses' cross-motion for summary judgment asserted that that their policy afforded coverage, no general exceptions applied, and MCTI had a duty to defend. Their cross-motion did not request summary judgment on any of MCTI's affirmative defenses. Nevertheless, MCTI responded in part by noting its affirmative defenses and stating that it had not had the opportunity to conduct needed discovery on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 46 CR 56(e), set out above, by its terms requires a party opposing summary judgment to set forth specific facts showing there is an issue for trial in opposition to the motion that was made. Where, as here, the\n   plaintiff does not request summary judgment on a number of affirmative defenses, CR 56(e) does not require the defendant to show an issue of fact concerning them. Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Labriola\n   </em>\n   does not require the party opposing a summary judgment motion to set forth facts about an issue that was not raised by the motion. In that case, the party opposing summary judgment failed to bring forth sufficient facts to substantiate its counterclaims, which the trial court in fact had dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Labriola,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217442\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/152/828/#p840\">\n    152 Wash.2d at 840-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20P.3d%20791\">\n    100 P.3d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Robbinses, in contrast, did not even request summary judgment on MCTI's affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 47 For these reasons, MCTI's affirmative defenses are yet to be decided. We remand for the superior court to consider them, subject to the other holdings in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   IV. ATTORNEY FEES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 48 The Robbinses request attorney fees and costs incurred both in the superior court and on appeal. They base these requests on RCW 48.30.015(3), part of the Insurance Fair Conduct Act, and on\n   <em>\n    Olympic Steamship Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    v. Centennial Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1373946\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/117/37/#p51\">\n    117 Wash.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51-53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=811%20P.2d%20673\">\n    811 P.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Because the merits of MCTI's affirmative defenses are not yet decided, any decision on attorney fees and costs is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 49 We reverse the superior court's order granting MCTI's motion for summary judgment and denying the Robbinses' cross-motion for partial summary judgment. We hold that MCTI owed a duty to defend under the policy, its failure to do so constituted bad faith, and MCTI is estopped from denying coverage. We decline to rule on the request for attorney fees and costs, and we remand to the superior court to consider the merits of MCTI's affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Worswick, P.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Sutton, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    MCTI, at the time this action arose, was known as Retitle Insurance Company.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Stat.%201132\">\n     10 Stat. 1132\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1854%20WL%209477\">\n     1854 WL 9477\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    We refer to the policy exclusions as \"exceptions\" because that is the terminology used in the contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    \"servitude\" in\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    1577 (10th ed. 2014):\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    1.
