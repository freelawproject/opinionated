We have jurisdiction of this automatic appeal pursuant to article 6, section 5(3), of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4031. We affirm Sanders' convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On August 31, 2009, Sanders called 911 to report that his girlfriend's child, three-year-old Schala Vera, was not breathing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A police officer went to the home, and Sanders directed him to an upstairs bathroom, where he found Schala lying on the floor. Schala's mother, Susan Witbracht, was kneeling over her, crying and begging Schala to breathe. The officer observed that Schala's skin was \"very light blue in color,\" her mouth was open, and her eyes were \"rolled back in her head.\" He also noticed that she was \"heavily\" bruised, particularly between her waist and her knees and from her shoulders to her elbows. The officer performed CPR on Schala until paramedics arrived and transported her to the hospital. The doctors could not revive Schala and she was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Chandler Police Detective Chris Keipert spoke with Sanders at the hospital. Sanders told Detective Keipert that he went to Walgreens to buy cigarettes and left Schala at home with Susan. When he returned to the house to retrieve his wallet, he checked on Schala, who was in the bathroom using the toilet, and \"she was fine.\" He went back to Walgreens and was gone \"[f]ive to ten minutes.\" When he returned home the second time, he checked on Schala again and she wasn't breathing. Sanders could not explain why Schala stopped breathing, claiming there had been no problems other than \"the little girl won't eat her dinner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 When Detective Keipert asked Sanders about Schala's bruises, Sanders admitted they were \"from when she got a spanking.\" He said the spanking occurred around 9:00 p.m. the night before and that both he and Susan had spanked Schala with a \"cloth-like belt.\" He claimed that was the last time she had been spanked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Later that night, and continuing the following day, Detective Ivan Kaminsky interviewed Sanders at the Chandler Police Department. Initially, Sanders essentially repeated the story he had told Detective Keipert. Sanders added, however, that he and Susan had been punishing Schala by spanking her with a belt. He estimated that they would spank Schala \"four or five\" times \"once or twice a week\" with either a leather belt or a military belt. He said the discipline began \"a couple weeks after\" Schala returned to Arizona in late May or early June 2009 after living in Iowa with Susan's relatives for several months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 As the interview continued, Sanders' story changed. Sanders admitted that Schala was hit with a belt on the day of her death. He claimed that Susan struck Schala with a leather belt \"maybe three or four\" times for \"not listening.\" He also stated that Schala's bruises on both her legs had been there since the Saturday before her death because both he and Susan struck her with a belt that day. Sanders maintained, however, that \"[t]he only thing we use is a belt.\" He also denied hitting Schala with the buckle, because that was the part he held when he was hitting her. Sanders stated that he put tape around the buckle to protect his hand. During a search of the residence, police found a black belt with tape around the buckle on the bathroom counter. Sanders identified the belt as the one he used to strike Schala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 When Detective Kaminsky asked Sanders whose fault it was that Schala was beaten to death, Sanders stated that he would \"take full blame\" because he's the male and he's \"more physical.\" Sanders also admitted that he \"accidentally\" hit Schala in the head with the bathroom door when he came home from Walgreens to get his wallet. He stated that he beat Schala shortly before he left for Walgreens because \"she just didn't listen at all\" and \"just kept going.\" Sanders explained that Schala was supposed to be putting her underwear back on after using the toilet, \"but she just sat there\" on the bathroom floor. Because she was not listening to him, Sanders started hitting her legs with the belt. She tried to stand up but fell, and he continued to hit her. She then leaned forward with her face between her knees and he struck her on the back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 An autopsy was performed by Maricopa County Medical Examiner Kevin Horn, M.D. Dr. Horn found multiple abrasions on Schala's head and face. The autopsy revealed a subdural hemorrhage under her scalp that was, according to Dr. Horn, caused by \"more than just an everyday force.\" Dr. Horn opined that the injury was similar to injuries caused by a fall from a significant height, a blow to the head, or a motor vehicle accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 There were additional bruises and abrasions on Schala's torso and above and around her genitalia. Dr. Horn also found abrasions near Schala's left armpit, arms, back, buttocks, and thighs that he identified as \"pattern injuries\" consistent with a belt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 The most extensive bruising was to Schala's arms and legs. Dr. Horn noted \"diffuse contusion\" to those areas, meaning the bruises overlapped and \"cover[ed] the entire surface.\" He also noted \"very severe swelling of all four of her extremities.\" In both Schala's arms and legs, Dr. Horn diagnosed rhabdomyolysis, which he explained \"is a long way of saying that the muscle has died and fallen apart.\" He also diagnosed compartment syndrome, which occurs when the muscle swells so much that it cuts off its own blood supply. Dr. Horn testified that compartment syndrome is typically seen in \"victims of crushing trauma, like motor vehicle accidents, people that have been pinned in a wreckage\" and in \"earthquake areas where people have been crushed in buildings.\" Dr. Horn opined that it was not possible for a belt alone to have caused these injuries; rather, \"[s]ignificant crushing force\" must have caused the injuries to Schala's arms and legs. In his opinion, these injuries showed that Schala must have been squeezed, kicked, punched, and/or thrown against a surface or object in addition to being struck with a belt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 Dr. Horn took tissue samples from Schala's arms and legs and performed an iron stain test to try to determine the age of her bruises. On one section from her right leg he found \"very rare microphages and very rare staining for iron\" amongst \"a sea of red blood cells,\" indicating \"fresh injury possibly over an older injury.\" Because her legs were so extensively bruised he noted the newer bruises could be masking older bruises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 Ultimately, Schala's cause of death was determined to be \"multiple blunt force injuries.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 Both Sanders and Susan were charged with first degree murder and four counts of child abuse (Susan's case was later severed from Sanders' case). The trial court later granted the State's motion to dismiss two counts of child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 At trial, the jury found Sanders guilty of first degree murder and two counts of child abuse. In the aggravation phase, the jury found three aggravating factors: (1) Sanders was previously convicted of a serious offense (child abuse),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-751(F)(2) ; (2) the offense was committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-751(F)(6) ; and (3) Sanders murdered a child under fifteen years of age,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-751(F)(9).

In such cases, the inference that the defendant posed a danger to society was far stronger than in Sanders' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 22 Sanders claims, however, that there was evidence, extrinsic to Schala's murder,\n   showing his propensity for violence. Specifically, Sanders points to evidence that (1) he was investigated for rape while he was in the Marine Corps, and (2) he was involved in a \"choking\" incident with Susan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 23 The rape investigation was referenced during the testimony of Dr. Smith, a mitigation expert who testified about Sanders' PTSD. Dr. Smith testified that his evaluation and diagnosis of Sanders were based largely on Sanders' self-reporting. At one point during his examination, defense counsel asked Dr. Smith whether Sanders had advised him that \"while he was in California he was charged with an offense\" and \"those charges were dropped.\" Dr. Smith testified that Sanders had reported this incident but did not disclose the nature of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 24 The State attempted to impeach Dr. Smith's PTSD diagnosis. To do so, the prosecutor asked a series of questions about Sanders' purported lack of full disclosure during his examination. In line with this questioning, at one point the prosecutor asked Dr. Smith if Sanders had disclosed that his prior criminal investigation was for rape. Dr. Smith stated that Sanders had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 25 The prosecutor's question to Dr. Smith did not elicit information or itself suggest that Sanders was in fact a rapist or had a propensity for violence. We recognize that the prosecutor should have been more careful about this question's potentially prejudicial impact. However, this isolated question was the only reference to the rape investigation, and the prosecutor never argued or discussed it in her closing argument. This fleeting episode did not create a specter of future dangerousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 26 The \"choking incident\" was introduced by defense counsel during her direct examination of Susan's cousin, Bianca Smallwood. Defense counsel presented this testimony as part of Sanders' mitigation evidence. Specifically, in questioning Bianca, defense counsel sought to establish the stressful domestic circumstances that led to Schala's murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. In this context, defense counsel asked Bianca about an incident where Susan threw Sanders' expensive remote-control helicopter across the room, and Sanders reacted by \"grabb[ing] her by the throat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 27 Bianca testified that this was the only time she saw Sanders exhibit any violence toward Susan. Additionally, the prosecutor sought to establish that the incident never occurred. On cross-examination the State sought to show when Bianca claimed this incident occurred, Sanders could not afford an expensive remote-control helicopter. The State also presented testimony from Detective Kaminsky that (1) no report was made to the police about this incident, and (2) there were no police reports regarding\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   other domestic violence incidents occurring between Sanders and Susan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 28 The State never argued that the helicopter incident showed that Sanders was a violent or dangerous person. Indeed, the State argued that the incident, if it occurred, was an anomaly in Sanders' relationship with Susan, and that everything between them appeared to be \"fine.\" The sole reference the State made to the incident stressed this fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, [Sanders and Susan] both expressed a desire to see each other. This was not a relationship the defendant was in because Susan had forced him to be into it. He wanted to be into it. He had a desire to marry her. The only thing standing in his way was a lack of money. He described his relationship with Susan as good. It was a little rocky because they had financial concerns at that time. It's also important, and I bring up the point of Bianca Smallwood because the defense brought her up in their first close. And what she said is that when they were together, they appeared fine, with the exception of this whole choking incident, with what she describes as really a mutual combat issue, that Susan had provoked the defendant, and he reacted. And she talks about how the defendant cared for Schala.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 29 Sanders also argues that the State placed his future dangerousness at issue by emphasizing the brutality of the murder. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 30 The prosecutor never suggested that based on the brutality of the murder, Sanders posed a danger to society. Rather, in\n   describing the murder and Sanders' conduct as \"horrific,\" \"cold,\" \"ruthless,\" \"callous,\" and \"mean,\" the prosecutor argued for retribution, focusing the jury's attention on the \"moral outrage\" and \"affront to humanity\" of Sanders' conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gregg v.

In her closing argument the prosecutor emphasized that Sanders deserved the death penalty as punishment for beating Schala to death:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Now, in closing, I would like to talk to you about what you're being asked to do here today. In society, we often want to believe there has to be something mentally wrong with someone who could commit such an act of violence against such an innocent person, a little child. Wouldn't we want to believe that a person must have had a horrible childhood to cause them to commit such a terrible act? That there must have been some event in that person's life that led them to brutalize a human being. But, ladies and gentlemen, as Dr. Seward alluded to,\n   <em>\n    sometimes people just do bad things\n   </em>\n   . And that's what the evidence in this case has shown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    This defendant is a normal, intelligent person\n   </em>\n   . He had a normal upbringing.

All it would have required is that he stopped. When he saw those bruises forming on her body, that he stopped. And he chose not to. And\n   <em>\n    for that\n   </em>\n   , ladies and gentlemen, he does deserve the ultimate punishment, the death penalty.

The age of the patient, uh, is something that unquestionably will stick with you.\" Nurse Jack responded to the prosecutor's question by stating that she had \"seen a lot of horrible things\" as a trauma nurse, but she had \"never\n   seen anything like this.\" She also testified that she kept \"a picture of Schala\" at her house \"because it was something I will never forget.\" Finally, Dr. Horn responded by stating that \"[t]his is one of the-one of the worst child homicide cases I've ever dealt with in terms of the number, extent of injuries.

The court denied the motion and ruled that the State could continue asking its witnesses if they had an independent recollection of the case. However, the court ordered the State to instruct its future witnesses not to use the words \"worst case\" in explaining why they had an independent recollection. Additionally, at Sanders' request, the court gave the following curative instruction to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   You have heard some witnesses refer to this case as the worst case of child abuse they have seen.

He also claims the charge was duplicitous because it created the risk of a non-unanimous jury verdict.

Sanders disclosed the investigation to Detective Kaminsky, and a mitigation witness also disclosed the investigation to the State. In addition, Detective Kaminsky contacted a Naval Criminal Investigative Service special agent to confirm that Sanders was in fact investigated for rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Arguing with mitigation witness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 102 Sanders also claims that the State committed prosecutorial misconduct by \"open[ly] arguing\" with a mitigation witness during cross-examination. The record shows that the witness was irritated by what he perceived to be the prosecutor's disrespect for his military service. Thus, the witness refused to answer the prosecutor's questions about his military service. Based on our review of the record, we conclude the prosecutor did not engage in any misconduct with this witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Cumulative Misconduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6 103 Sanders has failed to show that any misconduct \"permeate[d] the entire atmosphere of the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , 193 Ariz. at 79 \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747613\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/72/\">\n    969 P.2d at 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.
