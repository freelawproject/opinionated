The purpose of judicial estoppel is to protect the integrity of the judicial process, not to benefit a party. Hishm Chonah was injured at sea while working for Coastal Villages Pollock, LLC and C/P Northern Hawk, LLC (Coastal Villages). After Chonah filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition without listing his maritime claim, Coastal Villages asserted that his claim was barred by judicial estoppel. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion concluding that judicial estoppel does not bar Chonah's claim, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Hishm Chonah moved to the United States from Sudan in 2001, when he was approximately 27 years old. Chonah held a degree in accounting from a Sudanese university, and when he came to the United States he initially hoped to enter that field. But he needed to study English and send money to his family in Sudan, so he started working in the fishing industry instead. In 2002, Chonah began working on fish processing ships in Alaska for Coastal Villages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 In January 2013, Chonah was injured at sea while working as a crewmember on the vessel Northern Hawk. The Jones Act provides seamen injured in the course of employment the right to sue employers for personal injury.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Over the next three years, Chonah underwent four surgeries on his neck and back. During this time, Coastal Villages paid maintenance to Chonah under the Jones Act, initially at $25\n   per day and then $45 per day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chonah was unable to meet his living expenses on this income and he fell into debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In December 2013, after Chonah's bank account was frozen, he sought advice from Brad Puffpaff, an attorney who had been practicing for less than a year. Puffpaff recommended that Chonah declare bankruptcy. Chonah said he didn't understand what that meant, and Puffpaff explained \"you won't owe any money and you would get a new start.\" Chonah told Puffpaff about his accident, surgeries, and the maintenance payments from Coastal Villages. Chonah explained that he couldn't return to fishing because he had spacers put into his neck and it would be too dangerous. He said that when his surgeries were completed he expected Coastal Villages would stop paying maintenance and offer payment for lost time and loss of future wages, but he didn't think he needed a lawyer to help with this because \"my employer was treating me OK\" and \"using a lawyer would slow everything down.\" However, Chonah expressed concern that Coastal Villages might offer too little. Puffpaff told Chonah he didn't do that kind of legal work, but could provide a recommendation if Chonah decided he needed an attorney in the future. Puffpaff then gave Chonah a form to take home and fill out in preparation for the bankruptcy filing. But Chonah's English was not good enough to understand the questions, so Chonah returned to Puffpaff's office and Puffpaff completed the form for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 On February 18, 2014, Chonah met with Anissa Olson and Becky Buchan of Polaris Group LTD, an insurance claims adjusting firm retained by Coastal Villages. Tatyanna Drakulovic of Coastal Villages was also present at the meeting. Olson was aware that Chonah was going through a period of financial hardship. She offered Chonah $1,500 as an advance on a future settlement, but Chonah refused it. According to Olson, Chonah said he didn't take the offer because he planned to file for bankruptcy and he needed to make sure his account showed no income for a year. According to Chonah, he didn't accept the advance because he didn't want to sign for something he wasn't sure about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 On April 21, 2014, Puffpaff filed Chonah's Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. In the petition, Puffpaff inaccurately characterized Chonah's maintenance payments under the Jones Act as \"L&amp;l Workman's Compensation.\" The bankruptcy petition did not disclose Chonah's potential Jones Act claim against Coastal Villages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 On May 27, 2014, Puffpaff accompanied Chonah to the Chapter 7 meeting of creditors. In response to questions from the bankruptcy trustee, Chonah verbally affirmed that his bankruptcy documents listed all of his assets, debts, and creditors, that there were no errors or omissions, and that he did not have a personal injury claim against anyone. Puffpaff did not correct Chonah's responses. The bankruptcy trustee reported that there was \"no property available for distribution from the estate over and above that exempted by law.\" On July 30, 2014, Chonah was granted a Chapter 7 discharge from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 Coastal Villages learned of Chonah's bankruptcy discharge and summoned him to another meeting. On September 28, 2015, Chonah met again with Olson, Buchan, and Drakulovic. They offered Chonah $40,000 to\n   settle his claim, and encouraged him to contact his bankruptcy attorney immediately. Chonah refused the settlement offer and contacted a maritime attorney. Chonah then spoke with Puffpaff, who told him it would be possible to reopen the bankruptcy case. Chonah subsequently retained a new bankruptcy attorney to address the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 On January 4, 2016, the bankruptcy trustee moved to reopen Chonah's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case based on \"information concerning the existence of additional assets requiring further administration.\" On January 13, 2016, Chonah filed his Jones Act claim against Coastal Villages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 On April 18, 2016, Chonah filed a notice and motion to convert his bankruptcy from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13. Chonah expressly asked the bankruptcy court not to grant the motion \"without an express finding that his failure to list the maritime claim was inadvertent, because he is concerned that the defendant in the King County maritime claim action may assert judicial estoppel.\" Chonah's new bankruptcy attorney argued that Puffpaff was an inexperienced lawyer who prejudiced Chonah by filing under Chapter 7. He explained that under Chapter 7, the interim trustee's first duty was to collect and reduce the property of the estate as expeditiously as possible to pay Chonah's debts, potentially ignoring Chonah's interest in the outcome of the litigation and leaving Chonah vulnerable to losing his interim maintenance payments. In contrast, he explained, under Chapter 13, the Jones Act claim remained a part of the bankruptcy estate, leaving Chonah time to manage the claim against Coastal Villages to ensure a recovery that would protect his interests as well as the creditors, protect his maintenance income during the pendency of the claim, and then allow the trustee to pay the full $44,000 debt once the claim was resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 On May 25, 2016, the bankruptcy court granted Chonah's unopposed motion, including an express finding \"that the Debtor did not intentionally conceal his maritime claim in his original filing.\" Chonah then submitted an amended Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, which stated that he had an employment injury claim for \"loss of maritime wages, including future wages\" in the amount of $800,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 On September 29, 2016, Coastal Villages filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to bar Chonah's suit on the ground that judicial estoppel precluded the action. At oral argument, the trial court asked whether Chonah's debts had been discharged in Chapter 7 or remained alive under Chapter 13. Counsel for Chonah explained that even though Chonah had initially received a general discharge of debts under Chapter 7, the creditors' claims remained alive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   [T]he reason the case was reopened was so the bankruptcy trustee could administer the estate for the benefit of the creditors. So if there's a judgment in this case, if Your Honor doesn't rule and the case doesn't stop, and there's eventually a judgment or a settlement, that money is going to go to the standing trustee, the Chapter 13 trustee, for disbursement. And the creditors are going to get paid - assuming the sum is more than $80,000, they are going to get paid 100 cents on the dollar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 On November 11, 2016, the trial court denied Coastal Villages' motion for summary judgment, reasoning as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In the present case, this court cannot say that it would be inequitable to allow the plaintiff's case to proceed. Doing so does not serve to confer upon him any unfair advantage nor to impose any unfair detriment upon the defendant. Looking at what has gone before and focusing on the interest of the court in protecting the integrity of the judicial process, it must be observed that language and cultural barriers, quirks of maritime and bankruptcy law, and questionable legal advice all combine to ameliorate the plaintiff's actions to a degree that shifts the equities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 On December 27, Coastal Villages filed a motion for discretionary review with this court. Chonah did not oppose the motion. In April 7, 2017, the court commissioner granted the motion for discretionary review. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 Coastal Villages argues that the trial court erred in declining to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel to bar Chonah's lawsuit.

Coastal Villages argues that the first factor is met because Chonah failed to disclose his Jones Act claim in his initial Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, received a discharge of his debts, and is now pursuing his previously undisclosed claim against Coastal Villages. However, upon realizing the potential consequences of Puffpaff's error in failing to disclose the claim, Chonah immediately moved to convert his bankruptcy from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13. He then submitted an amended Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing that disclosed his Jones Act claim against Coastal Villages. Therefore, at the time Coastal Villages moved for summary judgment, the bankruptcy court was fully apprised of Chonah's Jones Act claim. This is the same position Chonah advanced at the trial court. There is no inconsistent position. The first factor is not present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 The second factor is whether judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled. Coastal Villages asserts that this factor is satisfied because Chonah failed to disclose his potential Jones Act claim and the bankruptcy court accepted that position and discharged his debts. But this argument ignores that Chonah's bankruptcy case was reopened, thereby creating an opportunity for Chonah's creditors to recover in full. We reject Coastal Villages' bid to turn the judicial integrity doctrine into a game of tag where a position, once advanced, can never be retracted. The bankruptcy court, acting pursuant to its own authority, reopened Chonah's case and addressed the problem caused by Puffpaff's error in the original filing. The second factor is not present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23 The third factor is whether the assertion of the inconsistent position would create an unfair advantage for the asserting party or an unfair detriment to the opposing party. Coastal Villages argues that this factor is met because Chonah failed to list his Jones Act claim and then gained an unfair advantage by receiving a complete discharge of his debts, notwithstanding the subsequent reopening of his bankruptcy case. But the trial court's ruling allowing Chonah's claim to go forward makes a settlement or judgment available to pay his creditors in bankruptcy court. In contrast, Coastal Villages' position would deny relief to those creditors and allow Coastal Villages to avoid payment. Such a result would bestow a valuable benefit to Coastal Villages while doing nothing to advance the integrity of the judicial process. \"Judicial estoppel does not exist to create a windfall for the proponent party.\"\n   <em>\n    Gosney v.

Chonah, a Sudanese immigrant who was not a native English speaker, openly discussed his accident, surgeries, and maintenance payments with Puffpaff. It appears that Puffpaff misunderstood the nature of Chonah's maritime claim and mistakenly believed he did not need to report it. Upon discovering the judicial estoppel issue, Chonah immediately took action to change his bankruptcy from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13, thereby reopening the case and providing an opportunity for his creditors to be paid in full.

We agree that a court may properly apply judicial estoppel where it is equitable to do so, even where the debtor belatedly attempts to remedy the original omission.

Cunningham\n   argued that he lacked manipulative intent because his attorney failed to timely amend the bankruptcy schedules.
