We hold that courts must consider the totality of the circumstances existing at the time of the severance determination, including the child's adoptability and the parent's rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Alma S. (\"Mother\") was involved in a relationship with Esdras R. (\"Father\"). I.R. is the biological child of Mother and Father, and J.R. is Mother's biological child but not Father's. J.R.'s father abused Mother during their previous relationship. Father also routinely abused Mother and both children. Father, in May 2015, severely beat two-month-old I.R. while Mother was at work. When Mother returned, she failed to take I.R. to the hospital even though Father was absent for several hours. Without Father's knowledge, I.R. was finally taken to the hospital the next day by Mother's sister and cousin. Hospital staff determined that I.R. had a healing rib fracture, a right tibia fracture, a possible left femur fracture (ultimately ruled out), and multiple bruises. The staff also observed bruises on two-year-old J.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Department of Child Safety (\"DCS\") subsequently removed both children from Mother's home, and the children were determined to be dependent. Over the next eighteen months, DCS provided Mother and Father with an array of services, including a parent aide, drug testing, and a psychological evaluation. Mother's drug testing was discontinued after she passed consecutive tests. However, the psychologist who conducted Mother's evaluation diagnosed her with mood and personality disorders, and multiple substance abuse disorders in self-reported remission. He noted Mother's \"poor judgment\" in choosing abusive romantic partners and entrusting her children to someone \"significantly unfit\" to care for them. He concluded that Mother was unable to protect herself or the children from abuse, that she lacked insight into the dangers posed by abusive\n   partners, that \"[m]aintaining a relationship, even when destructive, becomes more important than the safety of [her] children,\" and that her future parenting prospects were \"poor at best.\" Mother's DCS case manager agreed, concluding that Mother was unable to protect the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In December 2015, DCS moved to terminate Mother's parental rights to both children on the ground that she was unable to protect them from abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-533(B)(2). Following a two-day evidentiary hearing in November 2016, the juvenile court severed Mother's parental rights. It inferred that Mother was aware that Father caused I.R.'s injuries and did not report them or seek medical care. It also noted that although Mother claimed to have ended her relationship with Father, he had stated otherwise to his therapist. The court then determined that severance was in the best interests of the children because their current out-of-home placements were meeting their needs, the children were in an adoptive placement, and both children would be \"considered adoptable if the current placement was not able to complete the adoption for any reason.\" Mother appealed, challenging only the juvenile court's best-interests finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The court of appeals vacated the juvenile court's order, holding that \"the record supporting the court's best-interests determination is insubstantial.\"\n   <em>\n    Alma S. v.

According to the court of appeals, when parent-aide services demonstrate \"a parent's ability to parent the children,\" the parent and children have a bond, and the parent's living situation is \"safe and stable,\" \"the children's adoptability, household stability, and the ability of their current placements to meet their needs are subordinate to the fundamental rights of the parent in determining best interests, unless severance removes a detriment caused by the parental relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.

If a statutory ground were not synonymous with unfitness, a contested severance based on such ground would be constitutionally infirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Eight of the eleven statutory grounds in \u00a7 8-533(B) are proxies for parental unfitness because they demonstrate a parent's inability \"to properly parent his/her child.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberto F.,\n   </em>\n   at 54 \u00b6 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064017\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/45/\">\n    301 P.3d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They address the most serious instances of parental abuse, neglect, or incapacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-533(B)(1) (abandonment of the child); \u00a7 8-533(B)(2) (neglect or willful abuse of the child); \u00a7 8-533(B)(3) (parent not capable of \"discharg[ing] parental responsibilities\" due to mental illness or chronic substance abuse); \u00a7 8-533(B)(4) (parent convicted of a felony that is demonstrative of unfitness); \u00a7 8-533(B)(8) (failure of a parent to \"remedy the circumstances that cause [a] child to be in an out-of-home placement\"); \u00a7 8-533(B)(9) (identity and location of parent is unknown despite three months of \"diligent efforts\" to find parent); \u00a7 8-533(B)(10) (parental rights to another child terminated within the preceding two years and the parent is \"currently unable to discharge parental responsibilities due to the same cause\"); \u00a7 8-533(B)(11) (failure of a parent to discharge parental responsibilities after child removed for second time within 18 months to out-of-home placement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Section 8-533(B) also lists three other grounds for termination that are facially procedural and thus potentially not indicative of unfitness. These grounds address situations in which a parent has voluntarily relinquished her parental rights or waived her right to contest severance, and hence a finding of parental unfitness is not required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-533(B)(5) (a \"potential father fail[s] to file a paternity action\" after receiving notice under A.R.S. \u00a7 8-106(G) ); \u00a7 8-533(B)(6) (a \"putative father fail[s] to file a notice of claim of paternity as prescribed in \u00a7 8-106.01\"); \u00a7 8-533(B)(7) (\"[T]he parents have relinquished their rights to a child to an agency or have consented to the adoption.\").

This bifurcated process does not appear on the face of the statute, which instead directs that \"in considering any of the ... grounds\" for termination, \"the court shall also consider the best interests of the child.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kent K. v.

As my colleague, then-Judge Gould, aptly described it in\n   <em>\n    Roberto F. v. Arizona Department of Economic Security\n   </em>\n   , \"In any severance proceeding, the material issue facing the court is whether a parent has the ability to properly parent his/her child; it is irrelevant whether a child has a stronger attachment to their foster parents, whether foster parents are more 'nurturing,' or whether foster parents might be more capable or better parents than a natural parent.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064017\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/45/\">\n    232 Ariz. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54 \u00b6 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064017\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/45/\">\n    301 P.3d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 (App. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 32 However, the Court today holds that all that must be proven by clear and convincing evidence is that the parent engaged in one of the statutory grounds for termination, which by itself \"constitute[s] a finding of parental fitness.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b611. The Court acknowledges that \"the parent's rehabilitation\" should be part of the \"totality of the circumstances\" that a court must consider in a termination proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b61. However, it errs significantly by failing to accord proper weight to that central consideration, reducing it from an essential element in proving unfitness to merely considering it as one part of the child's best-interests determination, where it is subordinate to other priorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 33 That holding is at odds with\n   <em>\n    Santosky\n   </em>\n   , in which the statutory scheme before the Court required the state in the parental unfitness stage to prove, among other things, \"the intensity of its agency's efforts to reunite the family.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p769\">\n    455 U.S. at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p769\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Proof of the state's efforts,\n   <em>\n    combined\n   </em>\n   with proof of the parent's failings, both by clear and convincing evidence, \"not only makes termination of parental rights possible; it entails a judicial determination that the parents are unfit to raise their own children.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p769\">\n    at 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p769\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, the Court rules that proof of the statutory ground, standing alone, proves unfitness, without a finding either that the state has made diligent efforts to reunify the family or that the parent has failed to remediate the problem.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b69, 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b610 (statutory grounds are \"proxies for parental unfitness\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 34 Relegating parental rehabilitation to the best-interests inquiry bodes serious ramifications that eviscerate the parent's fundamental rights. The statutory grounds may reflect a moment in time, or unique circumstances, that justify removal of the child from the home but may not reflect permanent or even ongoing unfitness. The unfitness determination cannot properly be made without\n   considering the state's reunification efforts and the parent's success in regaining or attaining parenting skills.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    A.M. v. A.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1035 \u00b6 29 (Colo. 2013) (\"Before terminating the parent-child relationship, the trial court must consider and eliminate less drastic alternatives, ... and the parents must be given the opportunity to rehabilitate through participation in a treatment plan....\" (citations omitted) ). Once the case moves to the dispositional stage, the parent's rights are, at best, only one factor among many; for as the Court observes, in the best-interests inquiry, the child's \"stability and security\" are the \"primary concern.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 35 Additionally, consideration of parental rehabilitation during the dispositional stage reduces significantly the state's burden, from clear and convincing evidence to preponderance of the evidence. Here, Mother's relationship with her children was permanently severed despite the fact that she received extensive rehabilitation services, and that DCS and the guardian ad litem agreed that Mother maintained a bond with her children and possessed adequate parenting skills. Although such considerations are important in determining a child's best interests, they are also central in making the predicate determination that the parent is unfit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 36 Indeed, as the Court observes, once unfitness is determined, the best-interests standard is satisfied upon a showing that the child will benefit from severance or will be harmed if severance is denied.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b613. Considering rehabilitation in that context, rather than as an essential element in proving unfitness, strips the parent's rights of their fundamental nature because the interests of the parent and child are presumed to diverge and the child's interests are paramount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 37 The Court goes on to declare that \"what courts must not do, and what the court of appeals did here, ... is subordinate the interests of the child to those of the parent once a determination of unfitness has been made.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b615. But that is not what the court of appeals said or did. Rather, the court of appeals stated that \"[i]f a parent's ability to parent the children has been established by parent-aide services, there is a bond between the children and parent, and the parent has attained a safe and stable living situation, then the children's adoptability, household stability, and the ability of their current placements to meet their needs are subordinate to the fundamental rights of the parent in determining best interests, unless severance removes a detriment caused by the parental relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Alma S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20Ariz.%20152\">\n    244 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   162 \u00b6 38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567676\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/925/#p928\">\n    418 P.3d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the juvenile court considered the state's rehabilitation efforts and determined that the children remain at risk if reunited with Mother, and because we review that decision only for abuse of discretion, I join my colleagues in affirming the termination. However, the framework for terminating parental rights articulated by the Court here does not provide the \"fundamentally fair procedures\" that the Constitution requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 39 For many if not most people who are fortunate enough to be parents, the loss of their children is far graver than any possible loss of liberty. It may very well be that the vast majority of parents against whom DCS files termination proceedings deserve ultimately to lose their children. But the framework set forth by the Court today and in other recent decisions allows for the very real possibility that parents who have rehabilitated themselves, who have followed our cumbersome rules to the best of their ability, who have retained a strong familial bond, and who have manifested the ability to parent, will nonetheless lose their children irrevocably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   That is not only constitutionally impermissible but intolerable in a free society.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
