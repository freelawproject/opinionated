She had three children-Robert, Kelly and Cindy Wheeler. Patricia's last will and testament, dated June 3, 2011, was admitted to probate on July 29, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the will, Robert was appointed as the personal representative and Patricia's estate was to be distributed as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1.

Britain, share and share alike and in equal shares.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The will also included an\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   or no-contest clause which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    ARTICLE SEVENTH\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Should any person named herein challenge this Will or contest any provision hereof, to each such person pursuing such challenge or contest I bequeath the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) in lieu of any bequest or devise otherwise provided for such person; provided however, that any proceeding or action [in] the nature of a declaratory action, or for any accounting or for removal of my personal representative for cause shall not for these purposes be deemed to be a challenge or contest of my Will.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The first codicil to Patricia's last will and testament, dated June 24, 2013, was filed in the district court on August 26, 2016. The first codicil changed the estate distribution as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I give, devise, and bequeath all of the Flying A Ranch, Inc. Stock which I own at the time of my death to be divided equally one half to my son, Robert Oscar Britain, and one half to my daughter, Kelly L. Britain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 6] On October 12, 2016, Personal Representative Robert filed a motion for approval of a revised notice of probate, stating that Kelly had produced the first codicil that was filed with the court. He requested the court enter an order approving a revised notice of probate which reiterated the original notice of probate, \"except that it is to describe the document entitled First Codicil to Last Will and Testament of Patricia A. Britain ... and providing notice that any action to set aside the Will or First Codicil ... is to be filed in the Court within three months from the date of the first publication of the Revised Notice.\" The court entered an order approving the revised notice of probate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 7] On December 19, 2016, Cindy filed a petition to set aside the first codicil on the grounds Patricia was incompetent to execute the codicil and Kelly had exerted undue influence upon her. Kelly filed a motion to intervene to \"answer, move to dismiss and/or defend against\" Cindy's petition to set aside the codicil. Personal Representative Robert also responded to Cindy's petition. He generally agreed with Cindy's assertions that Patricia was not competent to execute the codicil and that Kelly was the \"primary member of our family attending to\" Patricia's care at the time the codicil was signed. He also asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   25. I understand that my duty as Personal Representative is to administer the Estate according to Patricia Ann Britain's instructions, the law, and the directives of this Court. Uncertainty as to Patricia's instructions exists by virtue of the Petition of Cindy Wheeler, questions as to Patricia's competency to make a codicil in June 2013, and the Motion and proposed Answer of Kelly Britain. Until the challenge to the First Codicil to Decedent's Will is resolved, aspects of my administration cannot occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   26. The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, W.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-37-101 et seq., empowers the Court to determine the validity of the\n   First Codicil, subject to determinations of factual issues as in other civil actions ( W.S. \u00a7 1-37-111 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   27. The possibility of a declaratory action was contemplated by Patricia Ann Britain, as expressed in Article Seventh of her Last Will and Testament of June 3, 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    WHEREFORE,\n   </strong>\n   as Personal Representative, I ask that the Court determine the validity of the First Codicil to Decedent's Will, subject to determinations of factual issues as in other civil actions, pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, and to grant the Estate such other and further relief as is warranted under the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 8] The district court granted Kelly's motion to intervene, and she filed a motion to dismiss Cindy's petition to set aside the codicil. Kelly claimed that Cindy did not have standing to challenge the codicil because she was not a \"person interested\" under the will contest statute-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-6-301\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2-6-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017). That statute provides that \"any person interested may, within the time designated in the notice provided for in W.S. 2-6-122 or 2-7-201, contest the will or the validity of the will.\" Section 2-6-301. (The definition of \"will\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-1-301\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2-1-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(xxxiv) (LexisNexis 2017) \"includes a codicil.\") Kelly claimed that Cindy was not interested because the codicil did not change her share of Patricia's estate, i.e., she was entitled to $5,000 under the original will and the codicil did not affect that devise. The district court agreed that Cindy could not challenge the codicil and granted Kelly's motion to dismiss Cindy's petition to set aside the codicil. No party appealed the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Kelly also filed a motion to dismiss Personal Representative Robert's declaratory judgment claim. She argued, in part, that a declaratory judgment action is not an appropriate means of challenging the validity of the will codicil on the grounds Patricia was incompetent or was subject to Kelly's undue influence. The district court held a hearing on Kelly's motion to dismiss and granted it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Personal Representative Robert filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Kelly claimed that Personal Representative Robert's declaratory judgment claim should be dismissed under W.R.C.P. 12(b)(1) and/or (b)(6). Rule 12 states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    How to Present Defenses\n   </em>\n   .-Every defense to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading if one is required.

To allow a will challenge under the UDJA any time prior to final distribution of the estate, as advocated by Personal Representative Robert, would add a procedure to the probate code that was not adopted by the legislature and would undermine the legislative goal of promoting the orderly and timely settlement of estates.

The contestants challenged the probate of the 1990 will on several grounds, including undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity, and applied for probate of the 1983 will.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997190\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/907/51/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997190\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/907/51/\">\n     at 54\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The contestants \"also sought a declaratory judgment in the district court as part of the will contest proceedings that the 1987 will and codicils were invalid and without legal effect because appellants refused to make an alternate application for probate of the 1987 will and codicils when requested to do so.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997190\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/907/51/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The district court held a jury trial and the jury concluded the \"1987 and 1990 wills and codicils were executed when decedent lacked testamentary capacity and that the 1990 will and codicils were procured by undue influence.\" The district court then admitted the 1983 will to probate.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997190\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/907/51/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    On appeal, the appellants argued that the declaratory action involving the 1987 will was improper because that will had not been admitted to probate. The court of appeals held that, under the unique facts of that case, the combined will contest and declaratory action was proper. It specifically noted: \"\u00cdn the case before us, all known wills were before the court, and the validity of all of the wills had been placed in issue in a will contest.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997190\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/907/51/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997190\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/907/51/\">\n     at 55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Harkins\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ,\n    </em>\n    therefore, did not allow a declaratory judgment action in lieu of a will contest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
