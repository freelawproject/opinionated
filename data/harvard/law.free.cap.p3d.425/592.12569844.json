For eleven or twelve years, Malone and A.S. were in a romantic relationship. The relationship was tumultuous and involved frequent altercations. On the evening of June 11, 2013, A.S. and her sister, E.S., drove to Malone's house to return some perfume Malone had given to A.S. Two of Malone and A.S.'s children were in the backseat. While driving there, A.S. spoke to Malone on the phone and E.S. heard her sister say, \"So you're going to keep threatening me ... well, whatever. I'm still leaving.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 When they arrived at Malone's house, he approached the car and took the perfume. Malone then asked A.S. to stay so that his mother could see the children and asked her to exit the car. A.S. declined and began to drive away. Malone got into his car and followed her. He eventually passed her and positioned his car to block her from leaving the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 A.S. called Malone's mother, who suggested A.S. return to the house. She did so and Malone, still in pursuit, pulled his car up behind her. Malone's mother handed E.S. a bag and told her \"go, now, go.\" When A.S. started to drive away, Malone's mother positioned herself in the middle of the road and attempted to stop Malone from following her. Malone, however, drove around his mother, overtook A.S. and again blocked her vehicle. He exited his car, confronted the victim, then reached into his car for a gun and began shooting into A.S.'s car. After firing several shots, Malone returned to his car and drove away. Two bullets struck A.S., killing her. Malone also shot and injured E.S. The entire episode lasted approximately five to six minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 After a trial wherein Malone conceded that he had committed the homicide but maintained that he did not premeditate or deliberate the killing of his ex-girlfriend, he was convicted as described above and sentenced to natural life in prison, followed by consecutive prison sentences totaling 13.5 years. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-4031 and 13-4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Evidence of Impulsivity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 At trial, Malone presented evidence that he had a character trait for impulsivity to rebut the state's claim that the murder was premeditated. Malone's mother testified that he had poor coping skills and an inability to handle \"stress and ... emotional tension.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   She testified about several events in Malone's life that demonstrated, in her opinion, \"extreme\" impulsive behavior. Malone also presented a clinical neuropsychologist to provide expert testimony regarding his character trait for impulsivity. The expert testified he had observed Malone and administered psychological exams, and concluded Malone \"clearly does have a character trait for impulsivity.\" The trial court, however, precluded the expert from providing any testimony about impulsivity \"based on findings of brain damage or brain injury,\" stating that such testimony would \"be encompassed by mental incapacity/diminished capacity/mental defect.\" Malone now asserts the trial court improperly precluded this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Arizona law does not recognize a defense of diminished capacity.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Read together,\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   establish that while a defendant is precluded from maintaining that he\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   reflect upon his actions (or has a lesser capacity to do so), he may introduce evidence demonstrating an ingrained character trait that rendered it less likely he acted with reflection and deliberation. And, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Leteve\n   </em>\n   , our supreme court has more recently reaffirmed its holding that expert testimony, including that based on testing, is admissible to support a defendant's claim that he possessed a character trait of impulsivity.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329566\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/516/\">\n    237 Ariz. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329566\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/516/\">\n    354 P.3d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Here, Malone did not proffer the expert testimony regarding brain damage to prove that he was incapable of reflecting. Rather, the results of those tests were offered\n   to demonstrate a brain condition that rendered it less likely that he may have done so. Accordingly, under\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   and in accord with our supreme court's clarification of that case in\n   <em>\n    Mott,\n   </em>\n   we conclude the evidence was admissible to the extent offered to corroborate the defendant's claims that he had a character trait of impulsivity. The evidence would not have been admissible to support a claim that Malone was \"incapable\" of reflecting on, or premeditating, the homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 We recognize that our supreme court's opinions on the admissibility of impulsivity evidence are nuanced. Those cases have not squarely encountered the admissibility of evidence that may be fairly characterized as both admissible evidence of a character trait for impulsivity and inadmissible evidence of a mental defect. But in\n   <em>\n    Christensen,\n   </em>\n   our supreme court did provide a workable standard for distinguishing admissible from inadmissible evidence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1600769\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/129/32/#p35\">\n    129 Ariz. at 34-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1600769\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/129/32/#p35\">\n    628 P.2d at 582-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That standard, which itself allows evidence for one purpose (to show that a defendant had an ingrained tendency to act a certain way) but not another (to show that a defendant was incapable of premeditating an offense), aptly and logically resolves the problem here.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1600769\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/129/32/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Although our dissenting colleague maintains our purpose-based analysis contradicts our supreme court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Leteve\n   </em>\n   , that case reaffirmed that the results of an expert's tests were admissible under\n   <em>\n    Christensen.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leteve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329566\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/516/\">\n    237 Ariz. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329566\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/516/\">\n    354 P.3d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, in its dicta distinguishing between types of evidence relating to behavioral tendencies, its reasoning does not purport to address how it would treat evidence that could be characterized as both admissible and inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Our fidelity to the\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   standard also conforms with our customary criteria in assessing the admissibility of evidence. It is a long-standing rule that \"[e]vidence may be clearly inadmissible for one purpose yet the same evidence may be proper and admissible for some other legitimate purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Leigh v. Swartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5193850\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/74/108/#p114\">\n    74 Ariz. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5193850\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/74/108/#p114\">\n    245 P.2d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1952). And, our courts have long depended on this logic in assessing the admissibility of other crimes, wrongs, or acts evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Evid. 404(b) (such evidence inadmissible to show criminal propensity but admissible for other purposes), and out-of-court statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Evid. 801 (c)(2) (out-of-court statement not hearsay unless offered for \"the truth of the matter asserted\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 For this reason, trial courts have effective and familiar tools to ensure evidence is considered exclusively for the proper purpose. Indeed, when admitting evidence in this situation, a trial court\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   give a limiting instruction if one is timely requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.

The court may also direct counsel in advance of trial to confine their examinations and arguments to avoid encouraging the improper use of such evidence. Finally, in cases where the probative value of any such evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of improper use, a trial court may properly exclude the evidence altogether pursuant to Rule 403, Ariz.

On cross-examination, the state did not refute the expert's conclusions that Malone had a character trait for impulsivity or the validity of his assessments, and instead focused on the difference between reflexive actions and impulsive actions. In closing argument, the state highlighted all of the evidence that suggested Malone had acted with premeditation, but it did not claim Malone was not an impulsive person. Because the evidence of brain damage was mostly cumulative, and\n   because the conclusion that Malone was impulsive was not challenged, we conclude any error in excluding this evidence was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Hypothetical Questions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 23 In a related issue, Malone claims the trial court erroneously limited his ability to ask hypothetical questions of his expert witness.

It is undisputed that Malone sought to introduce it to prove his character trait for impulsivity. It is undisputed that Malone offered his character trait for impulsivity to negate premeditation. It is further undisputed that premeditation is a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of the crime of first-degree murder of which Malone was charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1105(A)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is therefore undisputed that Malone sought to introduce evidence of his mental defect or disorder to negate the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of a crime. Under\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   , such evidence is simply inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 39 Our supreme court recognized that the legislature, not the courts, sets the standard for criminal responsibility:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   this court considered and rejected the defense of diminished capacity ... the legislature is responsible for promulgating the criminal law and that it \"has not recognized a disease or defect of mind in which volition does not exist ... as a defense to a prosecution for [a crime.]\" ... [T]his Court does not have the authority to adopt the diminished capacity defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Because the legislature has not provided for a diminished capacity defense, we have since consistently refused to allow psychiatric testimony to negate specific intent. Instead, the legislature has provided the\n   <em>\n    M'Naghten\n   </em>\n   test \"as the sole standard for criminal responsibility.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/#p540\">\n    187 Ariz. at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/#p540\">\n    931 P.2d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). The court then recited the\n   <em>\n    M'Naghten\n   </em>\n   test as then stated in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-502(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . And, because the legislature had clearly adopted that test for\n   determining criminal responsibility to the exclusion of others, such as the diminished capacity defense, the court stated, \"Consequently, Arizona does not allow evidence of a defendant's mental disorder short of insanity either as an affirmative defense or to negate the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Today's opinion, however, defies\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   by stating that evidence of Malone's brain defect or disorder should have been admitted to negate the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of premeditation required for the crime of first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 40 This opinion not only defies the clear proscriptions in\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   , it ignores the supreme court's clear distinctions between permissible evidence to show a character trait for impulsivity and impermissible evidence for such a purpose laid out just three years ago in\n   <em>\n    State v. Leteve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329566\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/516/\">\n    237 Ariz. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329566\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/516/\">\n    354 P.3d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The court, after restating the holding in\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   barring the affirmative defense of diminished capacity, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   We have, however, allowed a defendant to offer \"evidence about his behavioral tendencies\" to show \"that he possessed a character trait of acting reflexively in response to stress.\" Such evidence has been termed \"observation evidence\" by the United States Supreme Court. That Court distinguished \"observation evidence\" from \"mental-disease evidence,\" which is \"opinion testimony that [the defendant] suffered from a mental disease with features described by the witness,\" and \"capacity evidence\" which concerns a defendant's \"capacity to form\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   ,\" both of which are prohibited by Arizona law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21 (internal citation omitted). Here, evidence of Malone's \"significant permanent and diffuse brain damage\" is physical evidence of a brain defect or disorder, it is not observation evidence. Such evidence is that of a physiological anomaly, not evidence of a behavioral tendency. Whether or not such brain damage is commonly found in people suffering from a character trait for impulsivity, the evidence itself is fundamentally either \"mental disease evidence\" or \"capacity evidence,\" each of which, as the supreme court repeats for us, is prohibited by Arizona law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 41 If the reasoning of this opinion in this regard evades supreme court review or survives it, as a practical matter, there will be little left of\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   and not much left of\n   <em>\n    M'Naghten\n   </em>\n   . Every defendant who could not successfully meet the\n   <em>\n    M'Naghten\n   </em>\n   standard to evade criminal responsibility will now offer evidence of any brain defect or disorder as \"consistent\" with or to bolster some otherwise admissible character trait evidence. Under the majority's reasoning it will be a denial of the defendant's right \"to put on a complete defense\" and error\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to admit such evidence. The opinion here does not help Malone given the lack of a showing of prejudice. However, if future juries can now consider brain defect evidence for the improper purpose of negating\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of premeditation for first-degree murder, what will stop them from considering it for guilt itself? After all, the defendant can't help himself, he has brain damage. Unless the reasoning of the opinion is checked, the danger identified in\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   will be realized: future juries will be compelled to \"release[ ] upon society many dangerous criminals who obviously should be placed under confinement.\"\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/#p540\">\n    187 Ariz. at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/#p540\">\n    931 P.2d at 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schantz\n   </em>\n   , 98 Ariz. at 213,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"610295\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/98/200/\">\n    403 P.2d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 42 For the foregoing reasons, I cannot join with the majority in deeming the evidence of Malone's brain defect admissible to negate premeditation.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The statute has since been amended but in a manner immaterial to this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
