For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 On December 20, 2013, Kopacz, then 80 years old, went to the emergency room at Banner Health, complaining of chest heaviness and shortness of breath.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The next day, Dr. Raj Savajiyani examined her and told her she needed a cardiac catheterization, which he performed on December 23 by accessing her right femoral artery and vein through an incision in her right groin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The hospital discharged Kopacz on December 25. A day later, a nurse examined Kopacz at her home and discovered that subcutaneous bleeding and swelling had developed around the incision site. The area was soft and not tender to the touch, but the nurse told Kopacz and her daughter to watch the area and call if the symptoms worsened. The next morning, December 27, the same nurse examined Kopacz at her home and found she was in severe pain in her hip and groin; the area around the incision had become hard and painful to the touch, with severe subcutaneous bleeding and swelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 An ambulance took Kopacz back to Banner, where a scan showed a large hematoma in her groin, thigh and buttock area and indicated a possible pseudoaneurysm in her femoral artery. A surgeon recommended surgery, but before the surgery could commence, Kopacz began suffering additional complications, including cardiogenic shock and atrial fibrillation, and she was admitted to intensive care. She underwent emergency surgery early the next morning to relieve the complications from the hematoma that had developed after the catheterization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Kopacz remained hospitalized until January 8, 2014, when she was released to a rehabilitation center. She continued to receive extensive wound care there until January 20, when she was readmitted to Banner with severe sepsis and hypotension. She was discharged from the hospital on February 1, but continued to have significant pain, and returned to the hospital once again for five days in late February when she experienced pressure in her chest. Her medical condition finally stabilized between March and July 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 On January 21, 2016, Kopacz and her spouse filed suit against Banner and Savajiyani and his spouse, alleging medical malpractice arising out of her medical treatment on December 21 and 23, 2013. The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the two-year statute of limitations applicable to Kopacz's claim under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 12-542(1) (2018) had expired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her response and at oral argument on the motion, Kopacz argued defendants breached the applicable standard of care by failing to obtain her informed consent for the cardiac catheterization. The superior court granted the motion, finding that \"the claim accrued no later than December 28, 2013,\" and therefore was time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Kopacz timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution, and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) (2018) and -2101(A)(1) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the grant of a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tierra Ranchos Homeowners Ass'n v.

She plainly knew within four days that she had suffered injury as a result of the catheterization. The morning of December 27, she reported \"uncontrolled pain\" in her right hip and groin, where doctors had cut into her femoral artery to perform the catheterization. She was rushed by ambulance back to the hospital, where she described her symptoms, and medical personnel there reported she was awake, alert and oriented. The next morning, she underwent surgery to repair the aneurysm and evacuate the hematoma in her hip and groin. If no one told Kopacz ahead of\n   time that the cardiac catheterization might cause a hematoma and aneurysm in her hip and groin, she knew no later than when they appeared, four days after the catheterization, that she might have a claim based on lack of informed consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Kopacz further argues, however, that \"her serious medical condition ... prevented her from understanding what was happening to her and what caused it.\" In an affidavit submitted in response to the summary judgment motion, she declared she \"was very ill and [had] very little recall of what was going on\" while in the hospital, and \"could not consider the possible cause of [her] medical problems\" during that time. She further averred that after she was released to the rehabilitation facility on January 8, her \"medical condition and medication made it difficult to understand what was happening to [her], and [she] could not consider the possible cause of [her] medical problems.\" She therefore contends she should not be charged with notice of her claim until on or after March 7, 2014, when she was finally able to \"contemplate the possibility something had been done wrong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 Under Arizona law, a statute of limitations is tolled if a would-be plaintiff is of \"unsound mind\" when the cause of action accrues.

Her affidavit, and a similar one by her daughter, merely stated in conclusory fashion that for weeks after the procedure, Kopacz was too ill to consider bringing a malpractice claim. And, as recounted above, the only \"hard evidence\" of Kopacz's mental state shows that when she returned to the hospital four days after the catheterization, she was alert, oriented and aware of the injury that had developed at the site of the procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 Without evidence sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 12-502, Kopacz proposes that the common-law discovery rule may toll limitations when a plaintiff cannot prove an \"unsound mind\" but asserts she was simply unable to think about whether she might have a claim. But\n   Kopacz cites no legal authorities, and we have found none supporting that proposition. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   , our supreme court explained that the two legal rules work independently of each other and serve different purposes. In that case, the court first applied the discovery rule to determine when the claim accrued, then considered whether the plaintiff's mental state tolled the claim under \u00a7 12-502 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   While the purpose of the discovery rule and the tolling provisions for unsound mind are essentially similar, their applications are critically distinct. The discovery rule contains an informational component requiring that the factfinder determine when the plaintiff knew or should have known the facts that constitute a cause of action. Tolling for unsound mind, on the other hand, requires that the factfinder determine whether the plaintiff had the mental capacity to bring a claim based on those facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493237\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/191/313/#p323\">\n    191 Ariz. at 326, \u00b6 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493237\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/191/313/#p323\">\n    955 P.2d at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 Applying that reasoning here, as stated, Kopacz surely knew or should have known by December 27, 2013, of facts constituting her cause of action.

In that motion, she cited Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) and objected that the minute entry setting out the ruling \"does not reflect the [c]ourt's stated grounds for its ruling from the [b]ench.\" On appeal, Kopacz asserts the superior court failed to address the accrual date of a claim based on lack of informed consent after that issue arose at oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 By rule, \"[t]he court should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion.\" Ariz.

Even if we were to interpret the word \"should\" in Rule 56(a) as imposing a requirement-a proposition for which Kopacz offers no authority-the court's statement in the minute entry would have satisfied it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 We affirm the judgment in favor of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    We view the evidence in the light most favorable to Kopacz, drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ochser v.
