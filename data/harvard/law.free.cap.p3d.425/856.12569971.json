When a defendant is charged with an alternative means crime, our constitution requires that the jury make an express, unanimous finding as to which alternative means forms the basis of a conviction, unless the State presents sufficient evidence in support of each alternative means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Jose Barboza-Cortes claims that the rule governing alternative means crimes was violated in his case and that, as a result, his convictions for second degree unlawful possession of a firearm and second degree identity theft must be reversed. Mr. Barboza-Cortes's contentions result in a split outcome by a split panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 A majority of the panel disagrees with Mr. Barboza-Cortes's argument with respect to second degree unlawful possession of a firearm. Although the firearm statute prohibits owning, possessing or controlling a firearm, these three descriptors are not alternate ways of violating the same statute. They are instead (as indicated by the name of the crime) manners of proving the singular criminal act of unlawful possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 When it comes to the identity theft conviction, a separate majority of the panel agrees with Mr. Barboza-Cortes's analysis. Washington's identity theft statute prohibits illegal activity involving either a \"means of identification\" or \"financial information.\" These two concepts do not overlap and, therefore, constitute alternative means. Because one of Mr. Barboza-Cortes's identity theft convictions was not supported by evidence of both a means of identification and financial information, and because the court's instructions did not require express jury unanimity, that conviction must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 On January 16, 2015, Juliana Garcia's backpack went missing from her car while it was parked overnight at her residence. The backpack contained money Ms. Garcia had collected for a school fundraiser, including several checks. Ms. Garcia reported the stolen backpack to police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Eleven days later, Mr. Barboza-Cortes used an automatic teller machine (ATM) to deposit four checks into his bank account. Video from the ATM showed Mr. Barboza-Cortes making the deposit. Three of the deposited checks were ones that had been taken from Ms. Garcia's backpack. The stolen checks were not endorsed, but two of the checks had altered payee information. The fourth deposited check identified Dava Construction as the payor and Francisco Villa as the payee. Although Dava Construction is a real company, the financial information listed on the Dava Construction check was fictitious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 After locating Mr. Barboza-Cortes's banking information and home address, law enforcement obtained a search warrant for Mr. Barboza-Cortes's residence. The warrant was dated February 5, 2015, and executed that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    \u00b6 8 Mr. Barboza-Cortes was the sole occupant of his residence and was present at the time of the search. During the course of the search, officers twice obtained amended warrants after first finding methamphetamine and then a firearm. The firearm was a Stevens model pump-action shotgun. It was hidden between two bedroom mattresses. The gun was not fingerprinted and, other than a test fire, no further information was obtained about the weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    \u00b6 9 Mr. Barboza-Cortes was charged with various crimes as a result of the theft investigation and search warrant execution. A jury ultimately convicted Mr. Barboza-Cortes of possession of methamphetamine, unlawful possession of a firearm, three counts of third degree possession of stolen property, and four counts of identity theft. The stolen property counts pertained to the three stolen checks that had been deposited by Mr. Barboza-Cortes on January 27, 2015. The four identity theft counts pertained to each of the four checks deposited on January 27, including the three checks stolen from Ms. Garcia's backpack and the fictitious Dava Construction check.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    \u00b6 10 At sentencing, the court imposed 43 months' imprisonment, 12 months' community custody, and several legal financial obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    \u00b6 11 Mr. Barboza-Cortes appeals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    <em>\n     Alternative means crimes and lack of jury unanimity\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    \u00b6 12 Mr. Barboza-Cortes contends his firearm conviction and one of the four identity theft convictions were imposed in violation of his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict. WASH. CONST. art I, \u00a7 21. His argument rests on the claim that unlawful possession of a firearm and identity theft are both alternative means crimes, and that the trial court's instructions left open the possibility of an improper, nonunanimous jury verdict. Mr. Barboza-Cortes's constitutional claims are ones that may be raised for the first time on appeal.

We disagree with his arguments with respect to second degree unlawful possession of a firearm. However, we agree that one of Mr. Barboza-Cortes's convictions for second degree identity theft must be reversed under an alternative means analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <em>\n     Unlawful possession of a firearm\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \u00b6 16 Under RCW 9.41.040(2)(a), a person \"is guilty of the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree, if ... the person owns, has in his or her possession, or has in his or her control any firearm\" after suffering one of several forms of disenfranchisement outlined by statute. The trial court instructed the jury pursuant to the foregoing terms of the statute and the jury convicted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    \u00b6 17 On appeal, Mr. Barboza-Cortes claims RCW 9.41.040(2)(a) encompasses three distinctive means of committing the same crime.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    He focuses on the use of the word \"or\" and argues the legislature contemplated that an individual can be convicted under the statute by one of the distinct acts of owning, possessing, or controlling a firearm. Because Mr. Barboza-Cortes was the sole occupant of the residence where the firearm was found, the State plainly presented sufficient evidence of possession and control.\n    <em>\n     State v. Chakos\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1086710\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/74/154/#p157\">\n     74 Wash.2d 154\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 157-58,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20P.2d%20815\">\n     443 P.2d 815\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1968). However, Mr. Barboza-Cortes argues the record lacked any evidence of ownership. Because the jury was not provided a unanimity instruction, Mr. Barboza-Cortes claims some of the jurors might have voted to convict him for a charge that lacked sufficient facts. Accordingly, Mr. Barboza-Cortes contends his conviction must be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    \u00b6 18 We disagree with Mr. Barboza-Cortes's analysis. The word \"or\" is not, by itself, a strong indicator of an alternative means crime.\n    <em>\n     State v.

Instead, we look at the other statutory language, as well as context. Here, the legislature preceded the three-verb phrase noted by Mr. Barboza-Cortes with the statement that it was designating \"the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree.\" RCW 9.41.040(2)(a). Then the legislature listed three methods in which unlawful possession can occur: ownership, possession, or control. Ownership and control are part of the dictionary definition of possession.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    In addition, the concept of control is a method of proving constructive possession.\n    <em>\n     State v.

The trial court's identity theft instructions were consistent with this language.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \u00b6 21 Mr. Barboza-Cortes contends the use of the disjunctive nouns \"means of identification or financial information\" within the identity theft statute establishes two alternative means of committing the crime. In addition, Mr. Barboza-Cortes claims that because the State was unable to prove that he obtained, possessed, used, or transferred any \"financial information\" of Dava Construction (as opposed to Dava Construction's \"means of identification\") his conviction pertaining to the Dava Construction check must be overturned.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Mr. Barboza-Cortes does not challenge the fact that his other identity theft convictions were based on checks that bore both a means of identification and financial information.

By excluding information or items \"describing finances or credit\" from the definition of a \"means of identification,\" the legislature indicated its intent to outline two separate manners of committing identity theft.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Butler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451654\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/194/525/\">\n     194 Wash.

While the definitions of \"means of identification\" and \"financial information\" both list social security numbers, tax identification numbers, and driver's license numbers as qualifying types of information, this is not an indication of overlap. Social security numbers, tax identification numbers, and driver's license numbers can be used by financial institutions to identify specific accounts. In such circumstances, the numbers are used for \"account access or transaction initiation\" and therefore qualify as financial information. RCW 9.35.005(1). But outside the financial context, the definitional statute makes clear that the numbers constitute means of identification.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \u00b6 25 We recognize that definitional statutes do not create alternative means crimes.\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3593119\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/159/778/#p785\">\n     159 Wash.2d at 785\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20P.3d%20873\">\n     154 P.3d 873\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     State v.

But here, the alternative means for identity theft are not hidden away in a definitional statute. Instead, the two means are listed as part of the substantive offense. The definitional statute merely\n    serves to articulate the distinct nature of the two terms listed in the substantive crime.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    \u00b6 26 Based on the wording of substantive text chosen by the legislature, one commits the crime of identity theft either by obtaining/possessing/using/transferring financial information or by obtaining/possessing/using/transferring a means of identification. It is possible, if not common, for one to commit both acts at the same time, such as what occurs when a defendant fraudulently passes a check bearing another person's name (means of identification) and account number (financial information).

However, the check did not bear any accurate financial information. Given these circumstances, the State only submitted sufficient evidence as to one of the two alternative means of the crime charged.

Although this is an interesting question, I think the\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n    approach compels the same answer that\n    <em>\n     Butler\n    </em>\n    gave.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    \u00b6 46 The focus of\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n    was on the practical meaning of the verbs before it and the acknowledgement that the behaviors listed \"overlapped\" (in the language of the majority) in the practical sense that it was difficult, if not impossible, to commit the act in one manner without violating other statutory prohibitions. Understandably,\n    <em>\n     Butler\n    </em>\n    reached the same result when construing the verbs at issue in this statute. While the majority distinguishes this case by focusing, as Mr. Barboza-Cortes argues, on the two objects of the verbs (financial information and personal identification) being discrete, I think that is the wrong focus. The criminal law prohibits\n    <em>\n     actions\n    </em>\n    that are contrary to the good of society. The statute's verbs are its action words, just as they are for any sentence constructed using English or any of the romance languages. Those are the words that define the actions that the legislature seeks to prohibit. They are the proper focus of an alternative means analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    \u00b6 47 The same result occurred in\n    <em>\n     Peterson\n    </em>\n    . At issue there was only a single verb phrase (failure to register), and at least three different ways of failing to register. Nonetheless, the court found that those three ways of violating the registration requirement were all the same conduct because there was only a single prohibited action-failing to register.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007877\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/168/763/#p770\">\n     168 Wash.2d at 770\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=230%20P.3d%20588\">\n     230 P.3d 588\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The focus was on the verb rather than on the objects of the verb.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    I think the same thing should happen here. The essence of this offense is wrongly exploiting the personal information of another, whether it be financial information or personal identity information, by one of the methods listed in the statute. Although both financial and personal identity information are protected, the statute does not make mere knowledge of another person's information a crime. It is the\n    <em>\n     misuse\n    </em>\n    of that information that is actionable. Together, the personal identification and financial information language broadly protects an individual's most sensitive and valuable information. The protection of that sensitive information is the true object of the statute. In many instances, the financial information and identity information will overlap-the checks at issue in the other counts of identity theft in this case contained both types of information. There frequently will be an overlap in proof.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    \u00b6 48 As a practical matter, the unanimity problem is seldom genuinely at issue in circumstances like this. The behavior at issue in count 12 involved a single check allegedly passed by the defendant. The question for the jury was whether or not he passed the check, not whether the check involved personal identity information as opposed to financial information. The nature of personal information is unlikely to be at issue in a trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    \u00b6 49 By focusing on the objects instead of the verbs, I believe the majority has reversed the alternative means analysis. As\n    <em>\n     Butler\n    </em>\n    recognized, identity theft is not an alternative means statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    \u00b6 50 This conclusion also is consistent with the unit of prosecution for identity theft. Construing the various methods of committing identity theft, our court declared that the unit of prosecution for identity theft is each identification or information of a victim that is used, transferred, obtained or possessed, not each action taken against the victim.\n    <em>\n     State v. Leyda\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3004252\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/157/335/#p345\">\n     157 Wash.2d 335\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 345,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=138%20P.3d%20610\">\n     138 P.3d 610\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2006). Once the action is taken against the victim, repeated uses (or transfers, etc.) are part of the same continuing course of conduct.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 342-350,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=138%20P.3d%20610\">\n     138 P.3d 610\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This unit of prosecution strongly confirms my view that it is the verbs that are at issue when construing criminal behavior, not the objects of those actions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    \u00b6 51 For the noted reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority's construction of the identity theft statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <em>\n     Jury Unanimity Was Assured by the Prosecutor's Election\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    \u00b6 52 Moreover, if this was in fact an alternative means case, then an additional problem presents itself. Here, the prosecutor elected the means by which the jury should reach its verdict. He expressly told the jury that this was an identification case and that there was no evidence of financial records since that information was known to be false. In the like circumstances involving multiple acts cases, the prosecutor's election of the evidence on which he is relying serves to guarantee jury unanimity. I do not see the alternative means cases as being any different. If election of acts suffices to ensure unanimity, election of means should do the same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    \u00b6 53 In \"multiple acts\" cases where more different criminal actions were proven than were alleged, the constitution requires that the jury either be instructed on the need to agree on the specific act proved or the State must elect the specific act it is relying on in order to ensure that a unanimous verdict was returned. This type of error requires a new trial unless shown to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n    <em>\n     State v.

Law enforcement took the shotgun but never tested it for fingerprints. The officers never saw Jose Barboza-Cortes holding the shotgun and never knew who brought the shotgun into the residence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    SOME PROCEDURE\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    \u00b6 63 During trial, the State presented no testimony that Jose Barboza-Cortes owned the firearm found in his residence. Thereafter defense counsel proposed a jury instruction, for the second degree unlawful possession of a firearm charge, which read that, in order to convict Barboza-Cortes of the charge, the jury must find the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n    (1) That on or about the second day of February, 2015, the defendant knowingly had a firearm in his possession or control;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n    (2) That the defendant had previously been convicted of a felony; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n    (3) That the possession or control of the firearm occurred in the State of Washington.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Clerk's Papers (CP) at 195-96. The trial court declined to deliver Jose Barboza-Cortes' proposed instruction and instead instructed the jury that, in order to convict Barboza-Cortes of second degree unlawful possession of a firearm, the jury must find the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    (1) That on or about the 5th day of February, 2015, the defendant knowingly\n    <em>\n     owned,\n    </em>\n    possessed or had in his control a firearm;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    (2) That prior to\n    <em>\n     owning\n    </em>\n    , possessing, or having the firearm under his control, the defendant had been convicted of a felony; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    (3) That the acts occurred in the State of Washington.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    CP at 207, 225 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    \u00b6 64 In closing argument, the State argued that the only evidence presented showed that Jose Barboza-Cortes possessed no financial information about Dava Construction.

He seeks reversal of his conviction for this crime. To address whether the trial court should have given a unanimity instruction, I must first determine if unlawful possession of a firearm is an alternative means crime. I later address whether evidence sufficed to convict Jose Barboza-Cortes on each of the alternative means of committing unlawful possession of a firearm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    \u00b6 67 The trial court instructed the jury that Jose Barboza-Cortes committed the crime, if \"on or about the 5th day of February, 2015, the defendant knowingly\n    <em>\n     owned\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     possessed or\n    </em>\n    had in his\n    <em>\n     control\n    </em>\n    a firearm.\" CP at 207 (emphasis added). The trial court did not instruct the jury it must be unanimous in its verdict as to whether Barboza-Cortes owned the firearm, possessed the firearm, or controlled the firearm. Barboza-Cortes contends that he was entitled to a unanimity jury instruction on the charge of second degree unlawful possession of a firearm because of the alternate means of committing the crime. The State answers that the trial court did not err when failing to render a unanimity instruction for unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree because RCW 9.41.040(2)(a) does not create alternate means to commit the crime.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    \u00b6 68 The alternative means determination relates to the constitutionally protected right of jury unanimity required under article I, section 21 of the Washington Constitution.\n    <em>\n     State v.

In\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n    , the state Supreme Court addressed whether RCW 9A.82.050, the trafficking in stolen property statute, creates an alternative means crime. The court held the crime to encompass two alternative methods rather than the eight methods declared by this court. RCW 9A.82.050(1) reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n    [a] person\n    <em>\n     who knowingly initiates, organizes, plans, finances, directs, manages, or supervises\n    </em>\n    the theft of property for sale to others,\n    <em>\n     or who knowingly\n    </em>\n    traffics in stolen property, is guilty of trafficking in stolen property in the first degree.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Division One of the Court of Appeals held that RCW 9A.82.050(1) describes eight alternative means: knowingly (1) initiating, (2) organizing, (3) planning, (4) financing, (5) directing, (6) managing, or (7) supervising the theft of property for sale to others, or (8) knowingly trafficking in stolen property. The Supreme Court disagreed and adopted the approach taken by Division Two in\n    <em>\n     State v. Lindsey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319527\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/177/233/#p241\">\n     177 Wash.

Analyzing the statute as a whole, RCW 9A.82.050(1) describes only two alternative means of trafficking in stolen property. The placement and repetition of the word \"knowingly\" suggests that the legislature intended two means. The first \"knowingly\" relates to all seven terms in the first part of the statute as a group. Similarly, the phrase \"the theft of property for sale to others\" relates to the entire group. Treating these terms as a group indicates that they represent\n    multiple facets of a single means of committing the crime. If the statute described eight means, there would be no need to use the word \"knowingly\" again.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    \u00b6 76 The Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     State v. Owens\n    </em>\n    also reasoned that the first group of seven terms relates to different aspects of a single category of criminal conduct, facilitating or participating in the theft of property so that the purloined materials can be sold. As a result, the seven verbs acted as definitions of \"facilitating\" or \"participating.\" Trafficking in stolen property involves a second, separate category, of transferring possession of property known to be stolen, defined separately in the definitional section of the statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    \u00b6 77 In\n    <em>\n     State v.

The court concluded that RCW 9.35.020 is not an alternative means statute. The statute declares:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n    (1) No person may knowingly obtain, possess, use, or transfer a means of identification or financial information of another person, living or dead, with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any crime.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n    (3) A person is guilty of identity theft in the second degree when he or she violates subsection (1) of this section under circumstances not amounting to identity theft in the first degree. ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Butler\n    </em>\n    court compared the four verbs used to describe identity theft to the seven verbs in\n    <em>\n     State v. Owens\n    </em>\n    , holding:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n    [t]he verbs here are not distinct means by which to commit identity theft, but rather are multiple facets of a single means. For instance, following the analysis in\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n    , it would be hard to imagine the crime of identity theft being committed by a single act of \"using\" a check that did not also involve \"obtaining\" and \"possessing\" the check. Likewise, one could not \"transfer\" financial information without also \"obtaining\" and \"possessing\" that information.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    <em>\n     State v.

The court rejected the argument that the four verbs differed because not all of the terms interconnected. Karon Butler underscored that one could \"obtain\" financial information without \"using\" or \"transferring\" the information. The court answered that the same argument existed regarding the terms in\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n    . A person might \"finance\" or \"initiate\" a theft without \"managing\" or \"supervising\" the crime. The\n    <em>\n     Butler\n    </em>\n    court reasoned that every verb need not correspond with every other verb in order to be considered a single means. The court concluded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n    [b]ecause no single action in the statute could be completed without simultaneously completing at least one other action, the various acts are too similar to constitute distinct alternative means.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    <em>\n     State v.

One might conclude then that, on review before an appellate court, the State must provide overwhelming evidence or proof beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt for each alternative means so that we do not face a compromise of jury unanimity. No decision forwards such a proposition. Second, one might reason that, if the State provides overwhelming evidence of guilt on one of the alternative means, harmless error saves the verdict from reversal. After all, a unanimous jury could convict the accused of the crime if the evidence supports only one alternative means beyond a reasonable doubt. No decision supports this proposition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    \u00b6 85 I agree that the State provided sufficient evidence that Jose Barboza-Cortes possessed and controlled the Stevens model shotgun. I conclude, however, that the State provided insufficient or insubstantial evidence of ownership of the shotgun. Some of the reasons previously listed for why second degree unlawful possession of a firearm constitutes an alternative means crime supports a conclusion that the State provided insufficient evidence to convict of ownership of the shotgun. Possession and control comprise different concepts from ownership.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    \u00b6 86 The State contends that substantial circumstantial evidence supports a finding that Jose Barboza-Cortes owned the embedded shotgun. The State emphasizes that Barboza-Cortes must have owned all possessions in his basement apartment, particularly any personal property between mattresses. But common experience does not link possession with ownership. The law also declares that possession is not ownership.\n    <em>\n     Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v.

Nevertheless, even if Barboza-Cortes inserted the gun between the mattresses, it does not follow that he owned the firearm. He could have hidden the firearm for a friend. The State underscores that Jose Barboza-Cortes conceded that he owned the methamphetamine found in the apartment.

In Jose Barboza-Cortes' prosecution, the State presented no testimony concerning the registration of the firearm, the purchaser of the shotgun, who had the right to control the gun, who placed the gun between the mattresses, how long the firearm had been present in the mattresses, who handled the gun, or who used the gun. The State never even argued to the jury that Jose Barboza-Cortes owned the shotgun.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    \u00b6 89 I would vacate Jose Barboza-Cortes' conviction of unlawful possession of a firearm and remand for a new trial on the charge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    SECOND DEGREE IDENTITY THEFT\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    \u00b6 90 I agree with the lead author's analysis with regard to second degree identity theft being an alternative means crime when distinguishing between financial information and means of identification.

Similarly a statute that defines terms separately is more likely to create an alternative means crime. The separate definitions define distinct acts or, in our appeal, distinct subject matters to which a criminal act adheres. Some cases hold that definitional statutes do not create additional alternative means for a crime.\n    <em>\n     State v. Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3593119\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/159/778/#p785\">\n     159 Wash.2d 778\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 785,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20P.3d%20873\">\n     154 P.3d 873\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007) ;\n    <em>\n     State v.

Nevertheless, in each case the statute gave definition to one word not separate definitions for distinct words or phrases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    \u00b6 92 The State argues that, since it presented no evidence of Jose Barboza-Cortes' use of Dava Construction's financial information, the jury must have based its verdict only on the alternative means of obtaining, possessing, or using the construction company's means of identification. The State even\n    conceded during oral argument that no evidence supported the taking of financial information of Dava Construction. Therefore, the State asks us to uphold the jury verdict. The State cites no case supporting its argument. The State does not contend the jury was bound by its concession. The State's contention would probably nullify the requirement of jury unanimity in an alternative means crime, since the State can always argue, in prosecutions when it failed to provide insufficient evidence of one of the alternate methods, that the jury must have based its decision on the means on which it presented substantial evidence.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-169\">\n     \"Possession\" is defined as \"[1 a] : the act or condition of having in or taking into one's\n     <strong>\n      control\n     </strong>\n     ...
