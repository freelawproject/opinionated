Faced with conflicting decisions, we today clarify what that showing entails. A defendant must demonstrate that the error goes to the foundation of the defendant's case, takes away a right essential to the defense, or is of such magnitude that it denied the defendant a fair trial. To warrant reversal, the defendant must then show prejudice. But if the trial is found to have been unfair, prejudice is automatically established, and no further showing is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Here, the admission and pervasive use of drug-courier profile evidence during the defendant's trial on drug-related charges constituted fundamental error and prejudiced his ability to receive a fair trial. We therefore reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Detectives in multi-agency task forces suspected Erick Escalante of selling methamphetamine in the Verde Valley area. After receiving several tips and surveilling Escalante,\n   detectives obtained a search warrant and placed a GPS tracking device on his truck. On the evening of January 21, 2015, detectives saw that Escalante's truck was in Phoenix and suspected he might be picking up methamphetamine to sell. Anticipating the truck's return to Escalante's home outside Cottonwood, a detective called the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office and asked that deputies attempt to conduct a civil traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Two deputies in patrol cars identified the truck near Cottonwood and followed as it exited Highway 260 at Prairie Lane and eventually turned onto Cliff View Drive, a two-lane residential road. The truck veered as if to make a U-turn and stopped perpendicular to the roadway. The deputies blocked the road with their cars and activated their lights to make a civil traffic stop. As a deputy approached the truck, Escalante shifted into reverse and started to back up. The deputy told him to stop, but Escalante shifted into drive saying he intended to \"pull to the side of the road.\" The deputy pulled his gun and repeated his instruction to stop and turn off the truck. Escalante seemed agitated but eventually complied. Later, at a police station, Escalante told officers he had traveled from Camp Verde.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The deputies searched the truck and found a semi-automatic handgun, several knives, and a machete. They also discovered a digital scale, dryer sheets, coffee beans, a flip cellphone with limited data and no provider subscription (a \"throw phone\"), and $200 (another $150 was found in Escalante's wallet). A K-9 officer came to the scene, and his dog \"alerted\" on the truck, but no drugs were found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Within a few hours after Escalante's arrest and removal of the truck, a deputy returned to the scene. He found a sandwich-size plastic baggie containing a white crystalized substance in the middle of Prairie Lane near Highway 260. The bag appeared to have been run over, and some of the contents had spilled onto the roadway. A criminologist later determined that the bag contained 47.8 grams of methamphetamine (about one-tenth of a pound) and that the digital scale found in Escante's truck contained methamphetamine residue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The State charged Escalante with four drug-related offenses: count one: sale or transport of a dangerous drug (methamphetamine); count two: possession or use of drug paraphernalia (the digital scale); count three: tampering with physical evidence (throwing the bag of methamphetamine out the truck window); and count five: possessing a deadly weapon while committing a felony (transportation of a dangerous drug for sale). He was also charged with four counts of misconduct involving weapons for possessing the handgun, the machete, and two knives as a convicted felon (counts four, six, seven, and eight). The trial court severed the four drug-related counts from the remaining counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Before trial, the State moved in limine to introduce evidence that Escalante had engaged in behaviors \"indicative of and consistent with drug trafficking,\" such as driving in a manner designed to avoid police scrutiny (\"heat runs\"), using surveillance cameras at home, and traveling to areas of \"known drug activity.\" Escalante's counsel did not object. At an evidentiary hearing on this and other motions, he stated only that \"I think they're going to be allowed to testify as to in their training and experience what they believe that information means.\" The trial court ruled that the evidence was admissible as either intrinsic to the charged crimes or as \"other act\" evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Evid. 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 At the trial on the drug-related charges, multiple law enforcement officers testified, without objection, about their specialized drug interdiction training and described common drug-trafficking methods and drug-courier habits that were consistent with Escalante's behaviors. Officers also testified about what they were told by third parties concerning Escalante's suspected illegal drug activities. The jury found Escalante guilty on all counts. He waived his right to a jury trial on the remaining weapons charges, and the trial court found him guilty on those counts. The court sentenced Escalante to multiple, concurrent prison terms, the longest of which is fourteen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Escalante appealed the drug-related convictions and sentences, and the court of\n   appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because Escalante did not object to this evidence, we will not reverse unless the court committed error that was both fundamental and prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The testimony was only relevant to demonstrate that Escalante's behaviors were consistent with drug trafficking.

Here, for example, a qualified officer could have explained that dryer sheets and coffee beans, like the ones found in Escalante's truck, can be used to mask the smell of illegal drugs from police dogs. But officers could not permissibly testify that possession of dryer sheets and coffee beans, together with other behaviors, was \"consistent with drug trafficking\" because doing so served only to invite the jury to find that Escalante, too, was a drug-trafficker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The pivotal factual issue in the case was whether Escalante had possessed the methamphetamine found on Prairie Lane with an intent to sell it (count one). (Proof of counts three and five also depended on resolution of that issue.) The evidence tying Escalante to the baggie of methamphetamine was circumstantial and not overwhelming. Methamphetamine residue was present on the scale found inside Escalante's truck. Two incoming text messages on the \"throw phone\" suggested Escalante was selling something (\"Hey, bro. Give me a call. Need to place an order.\" and \"If you've got any, let me know.\"). In the months before the arrest, multiple people made short-term visits to Escalante's apartment. Escalante lied about traveling from Phoenix when he was stopped. But the baggie was found in the middle of the road hours after Escalante's arrest, casting doubt on whether he had discarded the drug. Notably, jurors posed several questions about the drug's discovery and origins: \"Do you think it is unusual that the white substance in the road was not spotted by all the law enforcement who went up and down the road that night of the arrest? Explain conditions that might have made this possible that it wasn't seen\"; \"Was the baggie from the road tested for fingerprints? Would it have been possible to find fingerprints on the bag?\" Fingerprint analysis was not done, and DNA testing \"revealed nothing\" to indicate that Escalante had possessed the baggie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 Evidence that Escalante fit the profile of a drug trafficker greatly increased the likelihood the jury would find that he possessed the drug with the intent to sell it before discarding it to prevent detection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755468\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/228/411/\">\n    228 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   417 \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755468\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/228/411/\">\n    267 P.3d 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That Escalante's behaviors fit the drug-courier profile laid out by law enforcement officers trained in illegal drug interdiction greatly enhanced the likelihood that jurors would conclude that Escalante had possessed the methamphetamine with the intention of selling it.

A person commits that crime if he knowingly possessed drug paraphernalia with the intent to use it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3415(A). \"Drug paraphernalia\" includes a digital scale if used to weigh illegal drugs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310295\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/254/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-3415(F)(2)(e).
