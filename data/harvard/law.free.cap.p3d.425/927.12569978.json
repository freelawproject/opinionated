I-522, which did not pass, would have required all packaged food products to identify ingredients containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 GMA created a segregated account funded by contributions from some of its member companies to address GMO labeling issues, including opposing I-522. GMA made expenditures of approximately $11 million from the account to oppose I-522. However, GMA did not register as a political committee with the Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) and did not comply with reporting and disclosure requirements for political committees. Specifically, GMA failed to disclose the companies contributing to the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The trial court ruled on summary judgment that GMA became a \"political committee\" as defined in former RCW 42.17A.005(37)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   when it created the account. The court also ruled that GMA violated various FCPA reporting and disclosure requirements for political committees and violated RCW 42.17A.435 by concealing the source of the contributions it made to oppose I-522. After a bench trial on penalties, the trial court imposed a civil penalty of $6 million for the FCPA violations and trebled that amount as punitive damages under RCW 42.17A.765(5) based on a finding that GMA's violation of the law was intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 We hold that (1) the trial court did not err in ruling on summary judgment that GMA became a political committee as defined in RCW 42.17A.005(37) because there was no genuine issue of material fact that GMA had an expectation of receiving contributions in opposition to I-522; (2) the FCPA's reporting and disclosure requirements do not violate the First Amendment as applied to GMA because they are substantially related to an\n   important government interest in providing information to voters; (3) neither the definition of \"political committee\" nor RCW 42.17.435, the statute prohibiting concealment of a contribution source, are unconstitutionally vague as applied to GMA; and (4) the trial court did not err at trial in excluding evidence of GMA's communications and cooperation with the PDC. However, we hold that the trial court erred in ruling that GMA did not need to subjectively intend to violate the law in order to be subject to treble damages under RCW 42.17A.765(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the State, reverse the trial court's imposition of treble damages against GMA, and remand for further proceedings for the trial court to determine whether GMA is subject to treble damages under the proper legal standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 GMA is a nationwide trade association that represents hundreds of food, beverage, and consumer product companies. GMA is governed by a board of directors, comprised primarily of corporate officers from GMA member companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 GMA is interested in promoting reasonable and national food labeling requirements. GMA became involved in the debate over whether food labels should identify ingredients derived from GMOs. On behalf of its members, GMA opposed state and local GMO-labeling efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 In 2012, GMA actively opposed a ballot proposition in California, Proposition 37. The ballot proposition would have required producers of packaged food products to label products containing GMOs. Because of GMA's opposition to Proposition 37, some of its member companies received negative public attention, including boycotts and threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 Later in 2012, GMA learned about a similar proposed ballot initiative in Washington, I-522. GMA intended to oppose I-522 and any other state-level food labeling mandates. I-522 was submitted to the legislature with public signatures on January 3, 2013. GMA conducted polling in Washington to determine if a campaign to oppose I-522 would be successful. And GMA staff began planning for an aggressive campaign in Washington, assuming that polling would support such a plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 At a January 2013 board meeting, GMA staff and board members discussed a plan to oppose GMO labeling initiatives, including I-522, while avoiding state financial disclosure filing requirements. The board preferred that GMA, rather than individual member companies, be identified as the source of political contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 GMA staff briefed the board on a proposed plan to provide financial support for GMO-related activities through an account held by GMA, which staff called the Defense of Brands (DOB) account. The goal was to have a strategic account that provided funding for projects to accomplish the objective of not allowing mandatory GMO labeling. Opposing state ballot measures was one of several projects the DOB account would fund. Other projects included federal advocacy, consumer research, and state advocacy. Under the plan, GMA would invoice member companies for special contributions, which GMA would place in the DOB account and then spend on campaigns under its own name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Although GMA intended to oppose ballot measures in any state, at the time the possibility of creating the DOB account was discussed the only potential ballot initiative GMA planned to oppose was I-522. GMA's proposed budget for opposing GMO labeling initiatives in 2013 allocated $10 million to defeating I-522. The board understood that a significant portion of the funds collected for the DOB account would be used to oppose I-522.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 The board approved the plan and created the DOB account on February 28,\n   2013. Although I-522 had not yet officially qualified for the ballot, GMA sent its first invoice for the DOB account to member companies on March 15. The invoice was accompanied by an update on the status of the campaign to oppose I-522.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 A total of 34 GMA member companies ultimately contributed to the DOB account. The three companies contributing significantly more money than the others were PepsiCo, Inc., Nestle USA, Inc., and The Coca Cola Company. Some members declined to participate in funding the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 GMA made its first contribution to the \"No on 522\" campaign from the DOB account on May 8. GMA did not make the decision to provide significant financial support to oppose I-522 until then. GMA subsequently sent additional invoices to the DOB account contributors. GMA provided member companies with regular updates on the campaign to oppose I-522, and GMA members were informed when their contributions were transferred from the DOB account to the \"No on 522\" campaign. GMA ultimately contributed over $11 million from the DOB account to the \"No on 522\" campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 GMA did not register with the PDC as a political committee when it established the DOB account. GMA did not register as a political committee or file any required political committee reports until it received a violation notice from the PDC in October 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Litigation and Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 The State sued GMA for failing to register as a political committee, failing to report financial contributions, and concealing the true source of contributions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State and GMA filed cross motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment regarding the requirement that GMA register as a political committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court concluded that \"GMA solicited and received political contributions from its members[,] which ... it then used to oppose ... [I-522]. ... As a receiver of contributions, GMA qualified as a political committee under RCW 42.17A.005(37).\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 3339. The trial court ruled that from February 28, 2013 to the present, GMA had committed multiple violations of the FCPA. The trial court also ruled that the campaign finance laws at issue were not unconstitutionally vague as applied to GMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19 The court reserved for trial the \"sole issue of whether GMA intentionally violated the law and if so, whether the judgment in this case should be trebled as punitive damages as allowed under RCW 42.17A.765(5).\" CP at 3340.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Trial on Penalties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 Before trial, the State filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of conversations between GMA and the PDC regarding registering as a political committee. The State argued that such evidence was not relevant to the issue of whether GMA intended to violate the FCPA. The trial court granted the State's motion and stated in its oral ruling, \"Anything that occurred after [February 28, 2013] does not apply to what GMA's intent was in proposing, creating, and implementing the [DOB] account.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) (Mar. 25, 2016) at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 GMA also filed a pretrial motion regarding the meaning of \"intentional\" in the context of RCW 42.17A.765(5). GMA argued that the State had to prove that GMA subjectively intended to violate the law rather than merely intend to act in a way that happened to violate the law. The trial court ruled that proving an intentional violation under RCW 42.17A.765 required looking at \"whether the person acted with the purpose of accomplishing\n   an illegal act under RCW 42.17A.\" CP at 3684. The court ruled that \"intentional\" was not limited to a subjective intent to violate the law; i.e., where the person subjectively knew his or her actions were illegal and acted anyway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 The trial court held a bench trial on the issue of penalties and whether GMA intentionally violated the FCPA. The court heard testimony from Pamela Bailey, GMA President and CEO; Louis Finkel, former executive vice president of governmental affairs at GMA; Karin Moore, GMA's general counsel; three outside attorneys of GMA;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   an expert witness called by GMA; and Tony Perkins of the PDC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23 The trial court issued extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court found that (1) GMA's plan was to identify only GMA as the source of GMO-related spending, providing anonymity for contributing members and shielding them from public scrutiny and state filing requirements; (2) one of the specific purposes of the DOB account was to eliminate the need to publicly disclose GMA members' contributions under state campaign finance disclosure laws; and (3) GMA approved the DOB account without asking its attorneys whether the account was legal under Washington law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24 Further, the court made findings of fact that it was not credible that GMA executives (1) did not intend to violate Washington campaign finance laws, (2) believed that shielding its members as the true source of contributions to the DOB account was legal, and (3) believed that they did not have to disclose the funds in the DOB account during the I-522 campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 25 The trial court concluded that GMA intentionally violated the FCPA. The trial court imposed a $6 million civil penalty for GMA's multiple FCPA violations. The court then trebled the penalty \"as punitive damages for GMA's intentional violations of state law.\" CP at 4072. The court entered a judgment against GMA for $18 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 26 GMA appeals the trial court's orders granting the State's motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether GMA was required to register and report as a political committee and entering a final judgment for a civil penalty against GMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A.

Public Policy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 29 RCW 42.17A.001 sets forth the declaration of policy of the FCPA. The public policy of the state includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (1) That\n   <em>\n    political campaign\n   </em>\n   and lobbying\n   <em>\n    contributions and expenditures be fully disclosed to the public\n   </em>\n   and that secrecy is to be avoided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (5) That public confidence in government at all levels is essential and must be promoted by all possible means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (10) That the\n   <em>\n    public's right to know of the financing of political campaigns\n   </em>\n   and lobbying and the financial affairs of elected\n   officials and candidates far outweighs any right that these matters remain secret and private.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (11) That, mindful of the right of individuals to privacy and the desirability of the efficient administration of government, full access to information concerning the conduct of government on every level must be assured as a fundamental and necessary precondition to the sound governance of a free society.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (Emphasis added.) In addition, RCW 42.17A.001 states that \"[t]he provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote complete disclosure of all information respecting the financing of political campaigns and lobbying.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2. Political Committee\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 30 The FCPA includes reporting and disclosure requirements for political committees to report to the PDC all contributions received and expenditures made. RCW 42.17A.235(1). Under former RCW 42.17A.005(37), a \"political committee\" means \"any person ... having the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, any candidate or any ballot proposition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 31 A political committee must file a statement of organization with the PDC \"within two weeks after organization or within two weeks after the committee first has the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures in any election campaign, whichever is earlier.\" RCW 42.17A.205(1). The statement of organization must provide detailed information about the political committee, including identifying a treasurer and the depository of funds. RCW 42.17A.205(2). The political committee also must file reports with the PDC at various intervals that contain certain specified information. RCW 42.17A.235, .240. This information includes the name of each person contributing funds to the committee and the amount of the contribution. RCW 42.17A.235(3) ; RCW 42.17A.240(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 32 The FCPA also prohibits concealing the source of contributions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   No contribution shall be made and no expenditure shall be incurred, directly or indirectly, in a fictitious name, anonymously, or by one person through an agent, relative, or other person in such a manner as to conceal the identity of the source of the contribution or in any other manner so as to effect concealment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   RCW 42.17A.435.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   3.

A person who fails to report a contribution or expenditure as required may be subject to a civil penalty equivalent to the amount not reported. RCW 42.17A.750(1)(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 34 In an action brought to enforce the FCPA, the court may award to the State the costs of investigation and trial, including reasonable attorney fees.

GMA acknowledges that no court has adopted this second requirement for the contributions prong. But GMA relies on the following statement in\n   <em>\n    Utter\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Clearly ... an entity can meet the definition of a \"political committee\" under either the \"receiving contributions\" or \"making expenditures\" portion of the statutory definition,\n   <em>\n    plus whatever \"purpose\" test might also be added on to that statutory definition\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075884\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/182/398/#p406\">\n    182 Wash.2d at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20P.3d%20953\">\n    341 P.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). GMA claims that this passage essentially states that a primary purpose test should apply to both prongs of the definition of political committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 48 However, the language of former RCW 42.17A.005(37) contains no primary purpose requirement for the contributions prong. And courts have not imposed one, even though they have had the opportunity. Immediately after the statement GMA quotes, the court in\n   <em>\n    Utter\n   </em>\n   proceeded to discuss the contributions prong without any suggestion that a primary purpose requirement applied to that prong.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 416-19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20P.3d%20953\">\n    341 P.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And this court in\n   <em>\n    EFF\n   </em>\n   also discussed a primary purpose requirement for the expenditures prong, and then addressed the contributions prong without mentioning a primary purpose requirement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1071880\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/111/586/#p598\">\n    111 Wash.

If an organization receives contributions and places them in a segregated fund to support or oppose a Washington initiative, that activity is subject to the FCPA regardless of whether advocating for or against the initiative is a primary purpose of the organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 50 Because neither the Supreme Court nor this court have extended a primary purpose requirement to the contributions prong, we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   3. Contributions Prong Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 51 The trial court ruled that GMA became a political committee only under the contributions prong of former RCW 42.17A.005(37). And the State does not argue on appeal that the expenditures prong applies for purposes of upholding the trial court's summary judgment order. Therefore, we need only address the contributions prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 52 GMA does not dispute that several elements of the\n   <em>\n    EFF\n   </em>\n   analysis were satisfied here. As of the February 28, 2013 board meeting, GMA members were asked to make special payments and GMA expected to receive those payments. Those payments were to be segregated into a separate account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   And the members knew that the payments would be placed into a segregated account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 53 The only material fact that GMA challenges is whether, when the DOB account was established, GMA had an expectation of receiving contributions \"in opposition to ... any ballot proposition.\" Former RCW 42.17A.005(37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 54 GMA makes three arguments regarding the trial court's summary judgment order. First, it argues that GMA's and its members' expectations in creating the DOB account involved questions regarding their mental state, which should not be resolved on summary judgment. However, like any other issue, a party's mental state can be resolved on summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact on the issue. GMA cites no authority to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 55 Second, GMA argues that reasonable minds could differ as to whether GMA established the DOB account to fund opposition to I-522. GMA points to evidence that (1) it first conceived of the account in August 2012, before it knew of I-522; and (2) the February 28, 2013 board minutes describe five strategic objectives of the account, only one of which was to oppose state efforts to impose mandatory labels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 56 There is no question that the summary judgment evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to GMA, showed that the DOB account was conceived and approved to fund multiple projects. However, there also was undisputed evidence that GMA had an expectation that the fund would be used to oppose I-522 if that initiative was placed on the ballot. The board minutes GMA cites also stated, \"[I]f the referendum in Washington were to pass, it could make success on other fronts very unlikely to succeed. As a consequence, Washington was critical to the success of the overall objective.\" CP at 1909. Further, the proposed budget for the DOB account showed spending of $10 million in 2013 (from total contributions of $16.25 million) on the Washington ballot measure campaign.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other evidence made it clear that GMA expected that member contributions to the DOB account would be used in significant part to fund opposition to I-522. For example, GMA included an update on I-522 opposition efforts with its DOB account invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 57 Third, GMA argues that when the DOB account was created, GMA had made no final decision about spending the funds in Washington. GMA points to evidence that (1) GMA was waiting for polling results to decide whether to spend money in Washington; and (2) GMA did not decide to contribute to the \"No on I-522\" campaign until after I-522 qualified for the ballot in April 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 58 Again, there is no question that the summary judgment evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to GMA, showed that GMA was not completely certain on February 28, 2013 that the DOB account would be used to fund opposition to I-522. But former RCW 42.17A.005(37) does not require certainty. If an organization has the\n   <em>\n    expectation\n   </em>\n   of receiving contributions in opposition to a ballot proposition, it becomes a political committee. Former RCW 42.17A.005(37). There was undisputed evidence that GMA expected that I-522 would be placed on the ballot, that GMA expected to receive contributions from certain member companies to the DOB account, and that GMA expected to spend a significant amount of money from the DOB account opposing I-522.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 59 Further, there was absolute certainty that GMA expected to receive contributions in opposition to I-522 by at least May 8, 2013, when GMA made its first contribution to \"No on I-522.\" After that point, GMA still invoiced its members to fund the DOB account. But GMA did not register as a political committee at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 60 We hold that because there is no genuine issue of material fact that GMA expected to receive contributions - and did in fact receive contributions - to oppose I-522, it qualified as a political committee under former RCW 42.17A.005(37). Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the State on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   C. FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGE TO FCPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 61 GMA argues that as applied in this case, the FCPA violated its First Amendment right to engage in political speech. GMA claims that under the exacting scrutiny standard, the FCPA requirements that are applicable here are not substantially related to the State's interest in providing voters with information about the persons opposing ballot initiatives. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   1.

Misleading of Voters\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 71 GMA argues that disclosing names of the contributors to the DOB account as required in RCW 42.17A.235(3) is not substantially related to the State's interest because no voters would be misled by nondisclosure. GMA claims that the name \"Grocery Manufacturers Association\" gave notice to voters that grocery manufacturers were funding the opposition to I-522 and therefore was sufficient to satisfy the State's interest in identifying the source of political contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 72 However, even though GMA's name may not be misleading, informing voters that GMA was opposing I-522 was not the same as informing voters which specific companies were funding the efforts to defeat I-522. Disclosing that a nationwide association of \"grocery manufacturers\" is opposing the initiative is not particularly informative because \"grocery manufacturers\" is such a broad category. GMA acknowledged that any company selling anything in a supermarket was either a GMA member or eligible to be a member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 73 Knowing the names of the companies actually funding GMA's efforts - and particularly the types of products those companies sell - would be valuable to voters. For example, the three companies contributing significantly more money than the others were PepsiCo, Inc., Nestle USA, Inc., and The Coca Cola Company. Voters may have been able to discern from this information that beverage manufacturers were particularly concerned about GMO labeling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 74 In addition, it was important for voters to know which GMA members were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   opposing I-522. GMA was not making contributions from payments by all GMA members. Only a relatively small group of companies - only 34 companies were listed in GMA's initial disclosure - were funding the\n   opposition effort, and some members declined to participate. Identifying the I-522 opponent as GMA did not provide that information and could have mislead voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   c. No Primary Purpose to Influence Elections\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 75 GMA argues that applying the FCPA disclosure and reporting requirements to nationwide, general-purpose trade organizations like GMA that do not have a primary purpose of influencing elections is over inclusive. GMA claims that the rule stated in\n   <em>\n    EFF\n   </em>\n   requiring an organization to register as a political committee when it creates a fund segregated for political purposes should be applied only to traditional, in-state political action committees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 76 As discussed above, Washington courts have not applied a primary purpose requirement to the contributions prong of the definition of political committee.\n   <em>\n    Utter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075884\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/182/398/#p406\">\n    182 Wash.2d at 416-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20P.3d%20953\">\n    341 P.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    EFF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1071880\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/111/586/#p598\">\n    111 Wash.

GMA is not arguing in this context that we adopt a primary purpose requirement. Its argument is that in the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of a primary purpose requirement, the FCPA regulations burden organizations like GMA more than they further the State's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 77 GMA's argument may be valid in some contexts, but not under the facts in this case. The undisputed evidence here was that GMA budgeted $10 million of the $16.5 million it planned to obtain from its members for the DOB account to oppose I-522 in Washington. At least regarding the DOB account, one of GMA's primary purposes was to influence the Washington election on I-522. In this context, there is a substantial relationship between the FCPA disclosure and reporting requirements and the State's interests in providing voters with information about persons opposing ballot initiatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   d. Burden on Associational Rights\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 78 GMA argues that the burden on its associational rights outweighs the State's interest because GMA members faced threats and boycotts if they were identified as contributors to the I-522 opposition. GMA claims that they have a right to member anonymity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 79 The United States Supreme Court has acknowledged that disclosure requirements may fail exacting scrutiny as applied to a specific group if the group can show \" 'a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure ... will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.' \"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

First, GMA takes the position that \"expectation\" in former RCW 42.17A.005(37) appears to require an organization to know with near certainty that contributions it receives will be used to influence a Washington election. GMA argues that a reasonable interpretation of former RCW 42.17A.005(37) is that contributions must be specifically earmarked for use in a Washington election for an organization to become a political committee. GMA claims that Washington cases support this interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 95 GMA points out that the trial court's interpretation in this case was that an organization becomes a political committee if contributions it received\n   <em>\n    may be\n   </em>\n   used in a Washington election. GMA claims that the court applied the FCPA requirements even though the use of the DOB account funds to oppose I-522 was only one of several possible options, and was not a certainty. GMA argues that the tension between the near-certainty standard and a possibility standard makes \"expectation\" vague.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 96 But GMA's argument is not valid under the facts in this case. The undisputed evidence here was that GMA solicited contributions from its members for the DOB account with knowledge that some of the funds in the account probably would be used to oppose I-522 in Washington. GMA's expectation was much closer to near certainty than to mere possibility, and that expectation became a certainty when GMA began contributing to the \"No on I-522\" campaign in May 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 97 Second, GMA argues that in the absence of a primary purpose test for nationwide, multi-purpose organizations, the term \"expectation\" in former RCW 42.17A.005(37) is vague. GMA claims that such an organization would not have fair notice that its conduct in receiving contributions that may be used in a Washington election would require reporting and disclosure in Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 98 But this case does not involve a situation in which an organization collected money from its members for general purposes and only later decided to spend that money in a Washington election. One of GMA's stated goals was to oppose I-522, a Washington initiative. And GMA expected to receive contributions from its members to use for that specific purpose. As a result, GMA had fair notice that FCPA regulations would apply to its activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6 99 We hold that the term \"expectation\" in former RCW 42.17A.005(37) is not vague as applied to GMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   3. \"Concealment\" and \"Source\" in RCW 42.17A.435\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6 100 RCW 42.17A.435 states: \"No contribution shall be made and no expenditure shall be incurred, directly or indirectly, in a fictitious name, anonymously, or by one person through an agent, relative, or other person in such a manner as to conceal the identity of the source of the contribution or in any other manner so as to effect concealment.\" GMA argues that this statute is impermissibly vague because it is unclear whether (1) \"concealment\" requires some independent act in addition to failing to register as a political committee, and (2) \"source\" of contributions refers to GMA or to the GMA members who funded the DOB account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6 101 The only case that addresses RCW 42.17A.435 is\n   <em>\n    Permanent Offense\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5585905\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/136/277/#p284\">\n    136 Wash.

GMA is making a legal argument regarding the proper interpretation of RCW 42.17A.435.

Trial Court Ruling\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6 117 Before trial, the trial court issued a ruling on the meaning of \"intentional\" under RCW 42.17A.765(5). The court stated that whether a violation is intentional depends upon whether a person intends to engage in the conduct that resulted in a violation of the law, and not on whether the person knew that the conduct constituted a violation of the law. The court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   2. To determine whether a violation is intentional under RCW 42.17A.765, Washington law requires the Court to look at\n   <em>\n    whether the person acted with the purpose of accomplishing an illegal act\n   </em>\n   under RCW 42.17A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   3. \"Intentional\" for purposes of RCW 42.17A.765\n   <em>\n    is not limited to instances where the person acted with subjective intent to violate the law\n   </em>\n   . In other words, it is not limited to only those instances where the person subjectively knew their actions were illegal and acted anyway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   CP at 3684 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   3. Meaning of \"Intentional\" under RCW 42.17A.765(5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   \u00b6 118 GMA argues that the trial court erred in concluding in its pretrial ruling that whether GMA subjectively intended to violate the FCPA is irrelevant under RCW 42.17A.765(5). GMA claims that the syntax of the statutory language - if \"the violation is found to have been intentional,\" RCW 42.17A.765(5) - shows that \"the person must have intended to violate the law at the precise moment that the person acted.\" Br. of Appellant at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   \u00b6 119 The State argues that \"intentional\" in RCW 42.17A.765(5) requires that the person act with a purpose of accomplishing an\n   act that is illegal, but it does not require a person to know that the act was illegal. The State relies on the concept that a person legally intends the consequences that are certain or substantially certain to result from an act.\n   <em>\n    Bradley v. Am. Smelting &amp; Refining Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1201345\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/104/677/#p683\">\n    104 Wash.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 683,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=709%20P.2d%20782\">\n    709 P.2d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \u00b6 120 Both parties rely on RCW 9A.08.010(1), which defines intent in the context of criminal statutes: \"A person acts with intent or intentionally when he or she acts with the objective or purpose to accomplish a result which constitutes a crime.\" GMA argues that the \"result\" that GMA needed to intend was a violation of the law, not an act later held to be a violation. The State argues that under this statute, there is no requirement that the actor have knowledge that his or her conduct is illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   \u00b6 121 We agree with GMA. The plain language of RCW 42.17A.765(5) states that the\n   <em>\n    violation\n   </em>\n   must be intentional, not that the conduct giving rise to the violation must be intentional. This language makes it clear that a party must have knowledge that it was violating the law to be subject to treble damages. The fact that GMA deliberately engaged in conduct that the trial court\n   <em>\n    later\n   </em>\n   determined was a violation of the FCPA does not mean that GMA intended to violate the FCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   \u00b6 122 Further, the legislature could have used different language in RCW 42.17A.765(5) that would have focused on a party's intent to engage in certain conduct rather than intent to violate the law. For example, the legislature could have allowed for treble damages if a party intentionally\n   <em>\n    failed to register\n   </em>\n   as a political committee. Under such language, GMA would be subject to treble damages because it clearly intended not to register. Whether GMA knew that failing to register was a violation of the law would be immaterial. But the legislature did not use that language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   \u00b6 123 We hold that the trial court erred in ruling that GMA did not need to subjectively intend to violate the law in order to be subject to treble damages under RCW 42.17A.765(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the trial court's conclusion that GMA intended to violate the law was based on this erroneous ruling, that conclusion cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   G. ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   \u00b6 124 GMA requests an award of attorney fees and costs on appeal under RAP 18.1, which allows a party to recover attorney fees on appeal if allowed under the applicable law. GMA argues that it is entitled to attorney fees under both\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and RCW 42.17A.765(5).

Although GMA prevailed on one issue, it did not prevail on any of the other issues. Because GMA is not the substantially prevailing party in this appeal, we decline to award attorney fees to GMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   \u00b6 126 We affirm the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the State, reverse the trial court's imposition of treble damages against GMA, and remand for further proceedings for the trial court to determine whether GMA is subject to treble damages under the proper legal standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   WORSWICK, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   LEE, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    The legislature amended RCW 42.17A.005 in 2018, and recodified .005(37) as .005(40).
