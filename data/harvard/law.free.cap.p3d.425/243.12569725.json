We affirm the superior court's ruling and hold that: (1) Encanto was a \"manager\" within the meaning of Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 33-1551 because Encanto administered and directed the maintenance of the area in question pursuant to an agreement with the City; (2) Normandin was a recreational user under \u00a7 33-1551(C)(5) because no part of the fee she paid to Encanto was paid to enter the area of the park where the injury occurred; and (3) the statute is constitutional as applied to Encanto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 1991, the City and Encanto's predecessor executed an agreement to establish a children's amusement park within Encanto Park (\"Park\") in \"an area ... known as Picnic Island\" (\"Concession Premises\"). In the agreement, the City licensed certain exclusive rights to construct, maintain, and operate children's rides in a fenced-in area of the Concession Premises (\"Enchanted Island\"), which also allowed Encanto's predecessor to use the remainder of the Concession Premises (\"Agreement\"). Encanto's owner, Kraig Lyon, testified that for 25 years he personally maintained the Concession Premises, including an area neighboring Enchanted Island where pi\u00f1ata games were often played (\"pi\u00f1ata area\"). Normandin acknowledges that Encanto regularly patrolled, maintained, inspected, prepared, and groomed the pi\u00f1ata area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Normandin paid $287 to Encanto for her one-year-old daughter's birthday party (\"Pete's Package\") to be held at the Enchanted Island. Pete's Package included \"thirty all day ride wristbands ..., ten tables ... [,] a private shaded area (by trees only) for 4 hours, [a special appearance by] Pete the Parrot, [and a] T-Shirt for the Birthday Boy/Girl.\" Pete's Package explicitly excluded a pi\u00f1ata, and provided no part of Normandin's payment for the package would have been refunded had Normandin decided not to bring her own pi\u00f1ata or declined to participate in a pi\u00f1ata activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Encanto allows its customers to bring a pi\u00f1ata and play the game during their birthday celebrations. However, Encanto requires that any pi\u00f1ata be broken outside of the fenced-in area of Enchanted Island. Encanto recommends customers use the pi\u00f1ata area near the birthday party venue, but outside of Enchanted Island. Normandin fell in the pi\u00f1ata area while assisting her daughter in breaking a pi\u00f1ata. Normandin broke her right ankle and injured her right arm. She alleged she fell because she stepped into a sprinkler-head divot or depression covered by grass in the pi\u00f1ata area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In her complaint, Normandin pled a single count of premises liability, a simple negligence claim, against the City and Encanto. Encanto and the City moved for summary judgment based on the immunity provided by A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1551(A). The motion was granted, and Normandin timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Normandin argues the superior court erred by granting summary judgment because: (1) Encanto was not an entity protected by \u00a7 33-1551(A), whether as an \"owner, ... lessee, ... manager or occupant\" of the premises; (2) Normandin either paid more than a nominal fee to Encanto, which excluded her from being a recreational user of the Park under \u00a7 33-1551, or the nominality of the fee paid is a question of fact to be resolved by a jury; (3) for private persons and private corporations, \u00a7 33-1551 violates the Anti-Abrogation Clause, Article 18, Section 6, of the Arizona Constitution ; (4) the statute violates the Equal Privileges-and-Immunities Clause, Article 2, Section 13, of the Arizona Constitution ; and (5) the statute is an unconstitutional special law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Summary judgment is proper if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Ariz.

Neither party disputes that the City owns the Park or that the statute provides immunity to the City if Normandin was a recreational user. Finally, neither party disputes Normandin was engaged in a recreational activity (hanging and breaking the pi\u00f1ata) when the injury occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1551(A), (C)(5) (protected activity includes exercising or \"other outdoor recreational pursuits\").

Encanto claims that it was a \"manager\" of the Concession Premises under the statute because the Agreement required it to maintain not only the Enchanted Island, but also the picnic and pi\u00f1ata areas. Normandin argues that Encanto waived its right to claim manager status; and no evidence in the record demonstrates the City hired, retained, or appointed Encanto to manage the pi\u00f1ata area, and, therefore, Encanto's work was,\n   thus, \"voluntary, self-interested acts of preparing the pi\u00f1ata premises for the benefit of its paying customers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 Although Encanto did not specifically argue manager status below, the superior court considered the issue of whether Encanto was an entity protected under \u00a7 33-1551 when ruling on the motion, and expressly found Encanto fell within the statute's immunity. Contrary to Normandin's argument, the issue has not been waived.
