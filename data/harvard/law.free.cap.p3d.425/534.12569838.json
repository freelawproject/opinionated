When officers arrived at the scene, they connected the gunfire to apartment four of the complex, which had been occupied by brothers Arturo and Juan Gallegos. Juan Gallegos's deceased body was outside the apartment. He had sustained multiple gunshot wounds. Arturo Gallegos was discovered inside a bedroom to apartment\n   four with a single, fatal gunshot wound to the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The evidence indicated Arturo Gallegos had been shot while sitting inside his room, on top of his bed. There did not appear to have been a precipitating struggle or any sort of theft or ransacking of his room or apartment. Gunpowder stippling left on Arturo Gallegos's face indicated he had been shot at close range. A bloodstained hat and glove were located on the bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 A further review of the scene suggested Juan Gallegos was shot and killed after Arturo Gallegos. Although Arturo Gallegos had been shot only once, his bedroom contained three shell casings. The door from Arturo Gallegos's bedroom into the apartment hallway was marked with two bullet holes. Door fibers surrounding the holes indicated the bullets had traveled from inside the bedroom into the hallway. No bullet fragments or markings were found in the hallway. Instead, the hallway wall was smeared with blood, which was later identified as belonging to Juan Gallegos. On the floor of the hallway were a pair of flip flops that had been discarded in an irregular fashion. Next to the flip flops was another blood stain from Juan Gallegos. Juan Gallegos's body was found outside the main door, in front of apartment three. He was barefoot and had suffered 11 gunshot wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Officers theorized that Juan Gallegos was initially shot while attempting to open the door to his brother's bedroom after hearing the gunshot that killed Arturo Gallegos. Once Juan Gallegos was shot through the door, he tried to escape down the apartment hallway, losing his flip flops along the way. Juan Gallegos was able to escape from the apartment, only to be shot and killed outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 As part of the investigation, officers talked to residents of the Broadway Square Apartments. No one saw the shooting or an apparent assailant. However, one of the residents reported hearing something near the fence behind the apartment complex around the time of the shootings. A K-9 handler investigated the area and picked up a track that went south from the complex for about two blocks to an address on East Valleyway Avenue in Spokane Valley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Once at the East Valleyway address, officers were approached by a man named Carlton Hritsco. Mr. Hritsco asked if the officers were looking for a \" 'Mexican guy.' \" 3 Report of Proceedings (RP) (Oct. 6, 2016) at 476. Mr. Hritsco explained that he had been outside of his house and smoking a cigarette when he heard someone approach. The individual told Mr. Hritsco his name was \"Demon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 514. The individual made Mr. Hritsco nervous, so Mr. Hritsco texted a friend, asking the friend to come over. The text went through at 9:41 p.m. Mr. Hritsco told law enforcement he felt certain he would be able to recognize the individual who had identified himself as Demon. A sheriff's deputy showed Mr. Hritsco photographs of five individuals from the Spokane area who were known to use the moniker Demon. The photographs were pulled up, one-by-one, on the computer screen inside the deputy's vehicle. Although one of the five photographs depicted Christopher Ramirez, Mr. Hritsco was not able to make a positive identification. Mr. Hritsco did say that Demon had been using his cell phone during their interaction. He also added that Demon was looking for a ride and had asked for directions to the bus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The morning after the murders, law enforcement contacted Arturo Gallegos's daughter, Rosemary Valerio, and her husband, Angel Valerio. Mr. Valerio identified Mr. Ramirez as someone who had problems with Arturo and Juan Gallegos.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Ramirez is Rosemary Valerio's cousin and the nephew of Arturo and Juan Gallegos. Mr. Valerio disclosed that on July 15, 2014, Mr. Ramirez had sent a text message to his uncles, Arturo and Juan, along with several others, that read, \" 'Tio.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   We all die. Rest in peace. Fuck you all if that's how it is.' \" 2 RP (Oct. 6, 2016) at 376. Mr. Ramirez had also previously\n   acknowledged pulling out a knife on Arturo Gallegos. Mr. Valerio disclosed that Mr. Ramirez went by the nickname Demon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Mr. Ramirez was arrested on November 2, 2014. Officers obtained a sample of Mr. Ramirez's DNA\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it was discovered Mr. Ramirez was the major contributor to DNA found on the interior portions of the bloodstained hat and glove found on Arturo Gallegos's bed. The blood was determined to have come from Arturo Gallegos. A search of Arturo Gallegos's cell phone revealed Mr. Ramirez had made plans to meet up with Arturo Gallegos on the evening of the murders. Telephone records also indicated Mr. Ramirez had placed a call at 9:59 p.m. on November 1 to the Spokane Transit Authority's bus schedule hotline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 After Mr. Ramirez's arrest, a sheriff's detective used Mr. Ramirez's booking photo to prepare a new photomontage to present to Mr. Hritsco. The montage contained six photos. Each photo was shown to Mr. Hritsco, one at a time. Mr. Hritsco again was unable to make an identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 No firearm was ever recovered in connection with the murders of Arturo and Juan Gallegos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   PRETRIAL PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Mr. Ramirez was charged with two counts of premeditated first degree murder for the deaths of Arturo and Juan Gallegos, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. Mr. Ramirez's case was delayed for several months to allow for competency evaluations. After he was deemed competent, Mr. Ramirez's trial was scheduled to start on October 3, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Approximately two weeks before trial, Mr. Ramirez's attorneys filed a motion to exclude Mr. Hritsco's testimony regarding the conversation he had with the man named Demon. The motion claimed the State lacked sufficient evidence to connect Mr. Ramirez with the man who spoke to Mr. Hritsco. Defense counsel argued that, given the lack of connection, Demon's statements were not statements of a party opponent, but inadmissible hearsay. The defense argued that testimony regarding Demon's statements would be irrelevant, in violation of ER 401, and more prejudicial than probative in violation of ER 403. The defense also claimed that introducing statements by an unknown, out-of-court witness would violate Mr. Ramirez's constitutional right of confrontation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   No other constitutional objections were raised regarding Mr. Hritsco's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 The defense also filed a motion to exclude a report and testimony from FBI\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Special Agent Jennifer Banks. The State had proffered Special Agent Banks as an expert witness on historical cell site analysis. According to the report prepared by Special Agent Banks, records obtained from Mr. Ramirez's cell phone provider placed him near the Broadway Square Apartments 10 minutes before the first 911 call was placed on November 1, 2014. The defense argued that Special Agent Banks's testimony should be struck based on late disclosure and because it failed to meet both the\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   standard for admissibility and the criteria for expert testimony under ER 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 Three days before trial, the State informed Mr. Ramirez's attorneys that it had received additional information from Mr. Hritsco. During an interview on September 30, 2016, Mr. Hritsco disclosed that he had seen photographs of Mr. Ramirez in the media. Based on those photos, Mr. Hritsco said he was absolutely sure Mr. Ramirez was the individual he had talked to the night of the murders. Mr. Hritsco claimed the hair in the photos shown to him by law enforcement had prevented him from previously making a positive identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 The parties argued the pending pretrial motions on the morning set for trial. The defense continued to claim Mr. Hritsco's testimony should be excluded because the individual named Demon who talked to Mr. Hritsco was an unknown hearsay declarant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Apparently recognizing that the recent information obtained from Mr. Hritsco undercut this argument, the defense argued the most recent statement should \"not be considered for purposes\" of the pretrial motions hearing because the statement \"wasn't submitted timely.\" 1 RP (Oct. 3, 2016) at 57. No constitutional concerns were raised regarding Mr. Hritsco's testimony. Nor did the defense question Mr. Hritsco's reliability. However, the defense noted that if Mr. Hritsco's most recent information had been disclosed at an earlier date, the defense would have \"looked into an expert witness who could have testified about cross-racial identification as well as generally the ability of people to recall things better or worse over time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 65. Although the State indicated it would not object to a continuance, Mr. Ramirez's attorneys specifically refused to ask for more time. After taking the matter under advisement, the trial court ruled Mr. Hritsco's testimony admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 Prior to jury selection, the trial court also held a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine the admissibility of Special Agent Banks's testimony. Special Agent Banks testified that she is part of the FBI's Cellular Analysis Survey Team (CAST). CAST members receive training in engineering and in deciphering cell phone records. Special Agent Banks described two components to her work. First, she interprets historic call detail records from cellular telephone providers in order to discern the location of cell towers activated by a particular voice call or text message. Second, Special Agent Banks performs field tests of geographic areas to determine the strength of various cell towers. The field test involves driving through a location with a scanning device. The FBI's scanning device uploads cellular frequencies in a given area to a computer program, which plots signal strengths on an area map. Agent Banks testified that CAST agents had testified in approximately 400 courts throughout the country and that the CAST methodology is more widely accepted in the law enforcement community than any other cellular location method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 Defense counsel argued that Special Agent Banks's testimony should be struck because her expert report was untimely and because the FBI's mapping software had not been validated. The State made clear that it would not object to a continuance if Mr. Ramirez wanted more time to evaluate Agent Banks's report. However, Mr. Ramirez insisted on moving forward with trial as scheduled. The trial court ultimately permitted the State to go forward with Agent Banks's testimony, finding that the substance of the testimony was not novel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   TRIAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 The State's trial evidence was consistent with the above factual summary. During cross-examination of the State's witnesses, the defense elicited information indicating the Broadway Square Apartments was a hub for illegal activity. Over the State's objections, the defense also procured testimony that drug paraphernalia was found in the Gallegoses' apartment and that both brothers had methamphetamine in their systems at the time of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 Mr. Hritsco testified at trial and identified Mr. Ramirez as the man who identified himself as Demon the night of the murders. No objection was made to Mr. Hritsco's in-court identification. The defense's examination of Mr. Hritsco was brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Hritsco was not asked about his media exposure, the pretrial identification procedures used by law enforcement, or the reliability of his in-court identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21 Testimony regarding the general nature of pretrial attempts to obtain identifications from Mr. Hritsco was elicited from law enforcement. The direct testimony and cross-examination was brief. No questions were raised regarding whether the law enforcement procedures comported with standard policies or whether the procedures raised concerns regarding eyewitness reliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 During her testimony, Special Agent Banks explained how her CAST analysis applied to Mr. Ramirez's case. According to Special Agent Banks, Mr. Ramirez's call detail records included not only a code for each\n   cell site antenna activated by Mr. Ramirez's phone calls and texts, but also the 120-degree angle that the antenna had been pointed at the time of connection. By plotting the call detail data onto a map, Special Agent Banks determined Mr. Ramirez's cell phone was in the area of the Broadway Square Apartments at 9:24 p.m. on November 1, 2014. This was approximately 10 minutes before the first 911 calls. The call records also indicated the phone had moved south of the Broadway Square Apartments by the time of Demon's interaction with Mr. Hritsco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23 In addition to interpreting the call detail records, Special Agent Banks explained the field test she performed in connection to Mr. Ramirez's case. To perform the test, Special Agent Banks drove through Spokane Valley, collecting cell tower frequencies with an FBI scanner. The FBI's scanning software was then able to generate a map, showing the coverage strength area for each of the cell towers activated by Mr. Ramirez's cell phone. The maps developed from the drive-through process largely corroborated the information indicated from the maps developed solely from the call detail records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 24 The defense called one witness during its case in chief. The witness was a resident of the Broadway Square Apartments. The witness stated he knew an individual named Maceo Williams, but he did not know Mr. Ramirez. Mr. Williams was one of the five individuals with the alias \"Demon\" whose photographs had been shown to Mr. Hritsco on the night of the murders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 25 The jury found Mr. Ramirez guilty as charged. At sentencing, the State argued the sentences for the two murders with firearm enhancements were required to run consecutively under the serious violent offense provision of RCW 9.94A.589(1)(b). The trial court agreed it was \"required\" to impose consecutive sentences, 7 RP (Oct. 28, 2016) at 1231, and sentenced Mr. Ramirez to 608 months for count one and 380 months for count two, for a total of 988 months, with the unlawful possession of a firearm count running concurrently to the first two counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 26 Mr. Ramirez appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Errors associated with pretrial rulings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    1. Eyewitness identification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27 In his arguments on appeal, Mr. Ramirez claims Mr. Hritsco's identification testimony should have been excluded from trial. Unlike the basis for exclusion raised at trial, Mr. Ramirez now argues that Mr. Hritsco's identification testimony was patently unreliable. As such, Mr. Ramirez claims it should have been excluded under ER 403 and the federal and state constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    a. ER 403\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 Under ER 403, a trial court may exclude relevant evidence if the prejudicial effect substantially outweighs the probative value. During the trial court proceedings, Mr. Ramirez's attorney argued Mr. Hritsco's testimony was more prejudicial than probative because the State lacked evidence linking Mr. Ramirez to the individual who identified himself as Demon to Mr. Hritsco on November 1, 2014. Defense counsel never argued that Mr. Hritsco's testimony was more prejudicial than probative because his identification of Mr. Ramirez was unreliable. In fact, counsel specifically asked the trial court to disregard Mr. Hritsco's ability to identify Mr. Ramirez in assessing the admissibility of his testimony. Because ER 403 is not a constitutional rule, defense counsel's failure to preserve an objection to the reliability of Mr. Hritsco's testimony precludes appellate review.

Amicus from the Innocence Project add that the pretrial identification procedures were also improper because they were not administered in a double-blind fashion, i.e., the officer conducting the pretrial identification procedure was aware of the identity of the suspect or suspects. In support of their claims regarding suggestiveness, Mr. Ramirez and amicus point to empirical studies on memory and factors that can decrease reliability of eyewitness testimony. Amicus also refers to policies promulgated by the Washington Association of Sheriffs &amp; Police Chiefs and the International Association of Chiefs of Police that recommend avoiding multiple identification procedures and nonblind administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 33 The trial court was never privy to the empirical studies or law enforcement policies proffered by Mr. Ramirez and amicus.

There was evidence of two prior threats, including not only the July 15 text but also the incident where Mr. Ramirez pulled a knife out on Arturo Gallegos. Call and text record evidence indicated Mr. Ramirez deliberately planned to go see Arturo Gallegos on the day of the murders. In addition, evidence from Arturo Gallegos's bedroom indicates Mr. Ramirez deliberately deployed a kill shot against Arturo Gallegos, without a precipitating fight or struggle. While much of the State's evidence might have been subject to interpretation, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there was evidence Mr. Ramirez had long harbored a plan to kill his uncle and that he deliberately executed that plan on November 1, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 55 As to Juan Gallegos, the State's evidence of premeditation was even stronger. Not only was there the threatening July 15 text message sent from Mr. Ramirez to both his uncles, but the evidence from the scene indicated Mr. Ramirez deliberately engaged in a plan to continue shooting Juan Gallegos until his uncle died. As previously noted, evidence from the scene suggested Mr. Ramirez twice shot Juan Gallegos through a closed door. As Juan Gallegos tried to escape down the hallway, Mr. Ramirez opened the door and continued shooting. The assault then continued through the apartment and out to the exterior portion of the apartment building. The evidence made it apparent that Mr. Ramirez kept up his lethal pursuit until Juan Gallegos died. This was more than a momentary incident. The manner of shooting was sufficient to indicate premeditated intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    b. Unlawful possession of a firearm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 56 Mr. Ramirez contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm because no firearm was ever recovered. We are unpersuaded. The State presented irrefutable evidence that the Gallegos brothers died from gunshot wounds. Mr. Ramirez was the person linked to both men's deaths. This link was sufficient to establish that Mr. Ramirez must have possessed a firearm. The fact that the firearm was never recovered does not undercut the sufficiency of the State's proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Although Ms. Valerio's testimony was hearsay and should have been excluded, this evidentiary error was harmless. Ms. Valerio's testimony was cumulative of other uncontested evidence that Mr. Ramirez used the nickname Demon. Such evidence included Angel Valerio's testimony, the testimony that Mr. Ramirez was in a law enforcement database of individuals named Demon, as well as the note in Arturo Gallegos's bedroom that contained the words \" 'nephew' \" and \" 'Demon.' \" 4 RP (Oct. 7, 2016) at 687.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Because no objection was made to the prosecutor's comments at trial, Mr. Ramirez must establish that the prosecutor's comments were so flagrant and ill intentioned that they caused an enduring prejudice that could not be neutralized by a curative instruction.\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.

Although the trial court sustained multiple objections to the defense questioning, some questions were answered and the trial court permitted the introduction of evidence that the Gallegos brothers had methamphetamine in their systems at the time of death.

Accordingly, even if there had been a problem with notice or the State's manner of proof, there was no impact on the outcome of Mr. Ramirez's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    2. Concurrent sentences\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 68 Mr. Ramirez argues that because the trial court failed to recognize it had discretion to impose a mitigated concurrent sentence under RCW 9.94A.535 and instead believed it was required to impose consecutive sentences under RCW 9.94A.589(1)(b), this matter should be remanded for resentencing to allow the court to consider a mitigated concurrent sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 69 Mr. Ramirez is correct that, despite statutory language to the contrary, a sentencing judge has discretion to run multiple sentences for serious violent offenses concurrently as an exceptional sentence.\n   <em>\n    In re Pers. Restraint of Mulholland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3801738\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/161/322/#p329\">\n    161 Wash.2d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 329-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20P.3d%20677\">\n    166 P.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). However, Mr. Ramirez has not shown he was prejudiced by any mistaken belief that concurrent sentences were unavailable. While the trial judge recognized the significance of imposing a sentence on Mr. Ramirez and allowed Mr. Ramirez to allocute on the issue of leniency, the court never expressed any misgivings about imposing consecutive sentences or Mr. Ramirez's overall sentence length. To the contrary, the court imposed high end sentences for each of the two murder counts, something it would not have done had it thought consecutive sentences excessive. Because the record does not contain any possible indication that the trial court would have imposed concurrent sentences had it been alerted of the ability to do so, resentencing is unwarranted.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 334,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20P.3d%20677\">\n    166 P.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

While it is true that some of the trial testimony differed from what was outlined in opening statement, Mr. Ramirez has not shown that the prosecutor knowingly misrepresented the evidence. Instead, it simply appears that the witnesses testified differently than anticipated. This did not amount to misconduct. In fact, it provided Mr. Ramirez fodder for attacking the State's case in closing argument. The prosecutor's opening statement does not provide grounds for reversing Mr. Ramirez's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 71 The judgment and sentence is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   End of Unpublished Text\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Siddoway, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Fearing, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The following facts are taken from the trial testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Mr. Valerio also indicated that a jealous husband could have been responsible for the murders, since Arturo Gallegos had numerous romantic encounters with \"tweaker girls.\" 2 RP (Oct. 6, 2016) at 394-96.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    \"Tio\" is Spanish for \"uncle.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Deoxyribonucleic acid.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    U.S. Const. amend.

As recognized by the trial court, there was sufficient evidence apart from Mr. Hritsco's identification to connect Mr. Ramirez with Demon. Thus, the statements would have still been admissible as admissions by a party opponent. In addition much, if not all, of the statements made by Demon to Mr. Hritsco were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Thus, they would not have been subject to exclusion as hearsay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
