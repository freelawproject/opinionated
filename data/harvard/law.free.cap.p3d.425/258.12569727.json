Cotter and Michael Podhorez married in 1993. In 2013, after spending twenty-five years in the banking industry, Cotter began suffering from a condition that rendered her unable to work. With Podhorez's assistance, Cotter obtained social security disability benefits that allow her to work part time. In 2016, Cotter and Podhorez each filed separate bankruptcy cases, and around that time, Podhorez moved out of the marital home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In June 2016, Cotter petitioned for dissolution of the marriage, seeking spousal maintenance and attorney fees. While the dissolution was pending, Podhorez suffered an acute mental health problem, such that he did not work during the four months before trial and began collecting short-term-disability benefits himself. Indeed, at the time of trial, he had not received a prognosis for when he might be able to resume working.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In August 2017, the trial court dissolved the marriage and distributed all property, but denied Cotter's requests for spousal maintenance and attorney fees. Concerning maintenance, the court found Cotter \"ha[d] not established a statutory basis for entitlement to an award.\" With respect to fees, the court found there was \"no substantial disparity of financial resources,\" the parties did not \"act unreasonably,\" and no other circumstances warranted such relief. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Although the parties do not raise the issue, we have an independent duty to examine our own jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

R. Fam. Law P. 84. Pursuant to her motion before this court, we suspended the appeal and revested jurisdiction in the trial court so it could rule on her motion.

Earlier versions of \u00a7 25-319(A) required the trial court to find two circumstances before determining a spouse eligible for a maintenance award: both that he or she lacked sufficient property and that another condition rendered him or her unable to be self-sufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1976 Ariz.

Further, even assuming arguendo that, at the dissolution of their marriage, Cotter possessed \"far more liquid assets than the average American,\" this fact has no bearing on whether those assets are sufficient to render her ineligible for a maintenance award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 Here, the trial court recited \u00a7 25-319(A)(1)-(4) and determined that Cotter \"ha[d] not established a statutory basis for entitlement to an award of spousal maintenance.\" The court, however, did not make specific findings about the value of Cotter's property, the cost of her reasonable needs, or the term for which that property could be expected to provide for those needs before she exhausted it.
