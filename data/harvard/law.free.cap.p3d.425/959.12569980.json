Lowe's customers made retail purchases using Lowe's credit cards issued by GE Capital Financial Inc. and Monogram Credit Bank of Georgia (collectively the Bank). The Bank paid Lowe's in full for the cardholders' purchases within one to two days of each transaction. Some cardholders defaulted on their credit card payments to the Bank, and Lowe's profit-share amount under agreements with the Bank was reduced by the amount in which cardholders had defaulted, up to a specified cap. Lowe's argues that as a matter of law under the undisputed facts, it is entitled to a state retail sales tax and corresponding retailing business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax refund on the reductions to its profit-sharing income based on its guaranty of defaulted accounts under the profit-sharing agreements. And it argues that the superior court violated its due process and equal protection rights. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Between April 1, 2001 and December 31, 2009, the relevant tax assessment period, Lowe's sold merchandise at its retail stores. Many customers paid for products using \"private label credit cards\" (PLCC) that could be\n   used only at Lowe's stores. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 68. A PLCC is a customized credit card that may be used only at a particular retailer's outlets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The PLCCs were issued under agreements between Lowe's and the Bank. The agreements provided (1) the terms under which the Bank extended credit to Lowe's customers and furnished cash payment to Lowe's for items purchased under the PLCC accounts, (2) the terms governing ownership and management of PLCC accounts, and (3) the terms by which Lowe's and the Bank jointly marketed the PLCCs to Lowe's customers and shared profits and losses resulting from the PLCC accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. PAYMENT FOR PLCC PURCHASES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Under the PLCC agreements, the Bank would extend credit to qualified Lowe's customers for purchases at Lowe's stores. The cardholder could then purchase goods from Lowe's stores using the line of credit provided by the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 When a cardholder made a purchase using a PLCC, the Bank forwarded full payment for the purchase and all corresponding taxes to Lowe's within one to two days. Lowe's promptly remitted to the DOR all Washington sales and B&amp;O taxes on the PLCC transactions. Lowe's accounted for PLCC transactions as \"cash and cash equivalents,\" the same term used for customers' payments with cash, check, or other credit cards. CP at 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF PLCC ACCOUNTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Under the PLCC agreements, the Bank was the \"sole and exclusive owner\" and manager of all PLCC accounts and outstanding receivables. CP at 136. As such, credit sales generated through Lowe's PLCCs were not reflected in Lowe's accounts receivable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 In addition, the Bank had the \"sole right to establish the finance charge rates\" and \"all other terms and conditions\" related to the credit accounts. CP at 136. Lowe's had \"no right, title or interest\" in the credit accounts and transaction-related documentation. CP at 136. The Bank had the exclusive right to receive cardholder payments. And the Bank was \"entitled to receive all payments made by or on behalf of Cardholders on Accounts. ... Retailers acknowledge and agree that they have no right, title or interest in or to ... any payments made by or on behalf of Cardholders on Accounts or any proceeds with respect to the accounts.\" CP at 136. All marketing and promotional materials given to customers had to \"clearly disclose that Bank is the owner and creditor on all Accounts.\" CP at 134. All PLCC services were to be \"performed and controlled directly\" by the Bank. CP at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   III. JOINT MARKETING AND PROFIT AND LOSS SHARING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Lowe's and the Bank jointly marketed and promoted PLCCs. As an incentive to Lowe's to promote the use of the PLCCs, the Bank and Lowe's agreed to share profits and losses associated with the accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 Under the agreements' terms, Lowe's was entitled to additional profits generated by the PLCC portfolio once the Bank reached its target rate of return. Lowe's and the Bank settled the profit-sharing obligations on a monthly basis after balancing the revenues generated by finance charges, fees, debt insurance premiums, and other services against program expenses, including net write-offs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 In exchange for the benefits Lowe's received from the PLCC agreements, including sharing profits and \"giving its customers increased access and incentives to purchase additional merchandise,\" Lowe's agreed to \"pay to the Bank[ ] any amounts that the Cardholders failed to pay on their PLCC accounts, up to\" a specified cap.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   CP at 453-54. The defaulted accounts Lowe's guaranteed under the profit-sharing agreements included the purchase prices and retail sales taxes for Lowe's products that cardholders had failed to repay the Bank. To satisfy Lowe's obligation under the profit-sharing\n   agreements' guarantee provision, the Bank reduced Lowe's monthly share of profit distributions up to a specified percentage of anticipated average net receivables on the PLCC accounts. The Bank was responsible for losses on defaulted accounts exceeding the cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 The agreements stated that Lowe's \"and not Bank shall have the right to claim any available sales tax deductions related to Net Write-Offs borne by\" Lowe's. CP at 454, 523, 613, 696, 782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 When a customer defaulted on its PLCC account, the Bank, not Lowe's, possessed the accounts receivable and had authority to write off the uncollectible debt on its books and records. CP at 113 (\"[The Bank] has the receivables and liabilities, along with anything else on their books, and Lowe's does not have a receivable or liability on its books and records at all.\"); CP at 945 (\"[The Bank] owns the receivable and [Lowe's] do[es] not make an entry when an account is uncollectible.\"). Although Lowe's books and records reflected Lowe's profit-sharing reductions, Lowe's books and records did not reflect any accounts receivable on the PLCC accounts nor unpaid debt obligations owed to Lowe's by cardholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   IV. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Throughout the relevant assessment period, Lowe's filed federal corporate income tax returns. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20166\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Lowe's deducted its profit-sharing reductions as \"Bad Debts\" on line 15 of the tax returns. CP at 846. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited these returns and proposed no adjustments to Lowe's bad debt deductions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Lowe's also claimed a Washington retail sales tax credit under RCW 82.08.037\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and retailing B&amp;O tax deduction under RCW 82.04.4284\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for Lowe's profit-sharing reductions. The DOR audited Lowe's and determined that Lowe's had improperly claimed bad debt sales tax credits and B&amp;O tax deductions on the defaulted PLCC accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 After these audits, the DOR assessed retail sales taxes and retailing B&amp;O taxes against Lowe's. Lowe's paid in full both assessments. Lowe's filed an appeal under RCW 82.32.180 seeking a retail sales tax and retailing B&amp;O tax refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The superior court ruled that under\n   <em>\n    Home Depot USA, Inc. v. Department of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the DOR properly denied Lowe's tax refund. Consequently, the superior court granted the DOR's summary judgment motion and denied Lowe's summary judgment motion.

RCW 82.08.010(1). The buyer has the primary obligation to pay the sales tax, but the seller has the duty to remit sales tax even if no tax is collected at the time of sale.

The relevant portion of the declaration provides only that Lowe's recorded the amounts of its profit-sharing reductions to compensate the Bank for losses on PLCC accounts and \"reflected in its books and records the net bad debts on PLCC accounts that were determined to be\n   <em>\n    uncollectible by the Banks\n   </em>\n   .\" CP at 455 (emphasis added). These statements are consistent with those offered by the DOR and show that the Bank, not Lowe's, had uncollectible debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 67 Lowe's books and records reflected\n   <em>\n    payments Lowe's made to the Bank\n   </em>\n   that were federally deductible bad debts as a guaranty payment. But Lowe's books and records\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   reflect any bad debt on a retail sales owed by customers to Lowe's because no such debt existed. As such, Lowe's did not satisfy the write-off requirement under former WAC 458-20-196(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 68 Lowe's does not qualify for the tax refund under RCW 82.08.037 because its\n   profit-sharing bad debt did not result from \"sales taxes previously paid,\" its bad debt was not \"directly attributable\" to a retail sale as required under\n   <em>\n    Home Depot\n   </em>\n   , and it did not write off the debt on its books and records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   151 Wash.

Lowe's asserts that the DOR arbitrarily imposed an \"ownership requirement\" that does not exist in the bad debt tax statutes and thus treated Lowe's differently from other retailers within its class who remitted sales tax that they cannot collect from the buyer.

Accordingly, I dissent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   A. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 82 Lowe's had agreements with GE Capital Financial Inc. and Monogram Credit Bank of Georgia (collectively the Banks) to issue Lowe's credit cards. The Banks entered into credit agreements with customers, who used the credit cards to make purchases at Lowe's stores. The Banks paid Lowe's for the amount of the purchases, including any sales tax and related B&amp;O tax. The Banks then collected the amounts of the purchases from the customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 83 Some of the customers defaulted on their credit card obligations, resulting in bad debts for the Banks. The bad debts included the amounts of sales taxes and B&amp;O taxes the Banks had paid to Lowe's. Under its agreements with the Banks, Lowe's acted as the guarantor of those bad debts up to a capped amount. In other words, Lowe's had a contractual obligation to pay the Banks the amount of the Banks' bad debt losses, which included sales taxes and B&amp;O taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 84 Lowe's claimed sales tax credits and B&amp;O tax deductions for the payments it made as the guarantor of the Banks' bad debts. Lowe's also deducted those losses on its federal income tax returns. The Department of Revenue disallowed all credits and deductions relating to the payments Lowe's made as the guarantor of the Banks' bad debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   B. CREDIT/DEDUCTION FOR GUARANTOR'S PAYMENT OF BAD DEBTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 85 RCW 82.08.037(1) states, \"A seller is entitled to a credit or a refund for sales taxes previously paid on bad debts, as that term is used in 26 U.S.C.

Sec. 166... on which tax was previously paid.\" Former WAC 458-20-196(1)(c) clarifies that \"Washington credits, refunds, and deductions for bad debts are based on\n   <em>\n    federal standards for worthlessness\n   </em>\n   under section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 86\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20166\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) states, \"There shall be allowed as a deduction any debt which becomes worthless within the taxable year.\" The federal standards of worthlessness are set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.166\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6 87 The controlling federal regulation here is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.166-9\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.166-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which applies to taxpayers who enter into an agreement to act as a guarantor of a debt obligation.

But the court's holding is inapplicable here because Lowe's did not merely suffer some economic loss relating to the Banks' bad debts. Unlike Home Depot, Lowe's was the\n   <em>\n    guarantor\n   </em>\n   of the Banks' bad debt losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 95 The analysis and holding in\n   <em>\n    Home Depot\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable here because Home Depot did not guarantee GECC's bad debts. Lowe's did guarantee the Banks' bad debts, and those guarantee payments are the \"bad debts\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.166-9\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.166-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) allowing for a sales tax credit under RCW 82.08.037(1) and a B&amp;O tax deduction under RCW 82.04.4284(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 96 Third, the majority contends that Lowe's cannot claim a sales tax credit or a B&amp;O tax deduction because it did not write off the bad debt as uncollectable on its books. The majority believes that writing off the bad debt as uncollectable on a taxpayer's books is a requirement for the sales tax credit and B&amp;O tax refund under WAC 458-20-196.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 97 The majority misreads WAC 458-20-196, which does not contain any such requirement. Former WAC 458-20-196(2)(a) states the general rule that sellers are entitled to a sales tax credit for taxes previously paid on bad debts under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20166\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That subsection then states, \"Taxpayers may claim the credit or refund for the tax reporting period in which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the taxpayer's books.\" Former WAC 458-20-196(2)(a). This provision simply states\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   a taxpayer can claim a\n   credit or refund; it does not somehow create a new requirement for claiming the credit or refund. Neither RCW 82.08.037,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20166\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), nor related regulations contain such a requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6 98 In any event, WAC 458-20-196 clearly does not address the situation where the taxpayer's bad debt is a payment made as the guarantor of another person's debt obligation. A guarantor would not necessarily write off the other person's bad debt as uncollectible on its books. However, Lowe's presented evidence that its books and records did reflect the guarantee payments it had made, which should be sufficient to determine\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   Lowe's could claim the credit/deduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   C. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6 99 Lowe's made payments to the Banks as the guarantor of the Banks' bad debts relating to the Lowe's credit cards, and those payments included amounts for sales taxes and B&amp;O taxes. Under federal law, those guarantee payments constituted bad debts. And under RCW 82.08.037(1) and RCW 82.04.4284(1), Lowe's was entitled to a sales tax credit and a B&amp;O tax deduction for those bad debts.
