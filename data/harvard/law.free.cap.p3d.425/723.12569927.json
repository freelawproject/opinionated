That treaty subjected the Navajo Nation and its people to the sovereignty and rule of the United States and recognized the existence and legitimacy of a territory to be dedicated to the Navajo Nation. At the time, the federal government aspired to change the existing Navajo pastoral culture into one of more traditional Eastern-style farming and moved the Navajo Nation onto a reservation at Bosque Redondo, in what eventually became Eastern New Mexico. Following the Civil War, the federal government realized its agricultural goals for the Navajo Nation would involve a long and expensive process for which Bosque Redondo was ill-suited. A second treaty with the Navajo Nation in 1868 returned them to a portion of their ancestral territory as their \"permanent home.\"\n   <em>\n    See Treaty With the Navaho\n   </em>\n   art. 13, June 1, 1868,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Stat.%20667\">\n    15 Stat. 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 671 (Treaty of 1868).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {2} The Colorado River drains the Colorado Plateau through the Grand Canyon. The San Juan River is the tributary of the Colorado River upon which the Four Corners region\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   relies for surface water and is the largest river in New Mexico. The aboriginal lands of the Navajo Nation originally included the entire San Juan Basin.\n   <em>\n    Navajo Tribe of Indians v. United States of America\n   </em>\n   , 23 Ind. Cl. Comm. 244, 251 (1970). The San Juan still runs through a considerable portion of the Navajo Nation and is a water source much coveted in this arid portion of the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {3} In light of the Navajo Nation's potential claim for the majority of water in the San\n   Juan River Basin, the State of New Mexico initiated a general stream adjudication to determine the water rights of the major claimants. The United States asserted claims as trustee for the Navajo Nation, and the Navajo Nation intervened on its own behalf. Following years of litigation, the State entered into settlement negotiations with the Navajo Nation and the United States. The State proposed a blueprint for a settlement and held public meetings in Farmington and Bloomfield seeking input from the non-Indian water users. In response to substantial public input, the State revised its settlement proposals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {4} In 2005, following more than a decade of negotiation, the Navajo Nation, the United States, and the State of New Mexico (collectively, Settling Parties) reached an agreement (the Settlement Agreement) settling the Navajo Nation's claims to water in the San Juan River Basin (the Basin). Federal legislation to approve and implement the Settlement Agreement was enacted by Congress in 2009 under the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act, Pub. L. No. 111-11, \u00a7 10301,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Stat.%20991\">\n    123 Stat. 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (Settlement Act), and signed by the President. The New Mexico Legislature then appropriated $50 million to pay New Mexico's cost of the Settlement Agreement and authorized the New Mexico State Engineer to bring a lawsuit seeking judicial approval regarding the State's share of the water, pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 72-1-12 (2005).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State of New Mexico, Office of the State Engineer, 2017 Indian Water Rights Settlement Fund Report, 3-4 (2017),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.nmlegis.gov/handouts/IAC% 20112717% 20Item% 206% 20Office% 20of% 20the% 20State% 20Engineer% 202017% 20Indian% 20Water% 20Rights% 20Settlement% 20Fund% 20Report.pdf;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation, Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project: Cost Share Agreement Between the United States and the State of New Mexico, 11 (2011),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   http://www.ose.state.nm.us/Legal/settlements/NNWRS/Navajo%1fSettlement/NGWSP-OriginalCost%1fShare%1fAgreement.pdf. In the subsequent suit the settling parties asked the San Juan County District Court to approve the water rights previously allocated in congressional legislation for the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project (NIIP), Fruitland-Cambridge Irrigation Project, Hogback-Cudei Irrigation Project, Navajo Gallup Water Supply Project (NGWSP), Animas-La Plata Project (ALP), San Juan River municipal and industrial uses, reserved groundwater, and rights based on stock, irrigation, and recreational uses as of January 1, 2011. Others with an interest in the Settlement Agreement were invited into this\n   <em>\n    inter se\n   </em>\n   proceeding through widely distributed radio announcements, newspaper notices, and over 19,000 first-class letters to those water rights holders who had title of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {5} At the initiation of the proceedings, the district court imposed an unusually stringent evidentiary burden on the Settling Parties to prove the Settlement Agreement was fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the public interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After giving all other water rights claimants in the Basin notice and opportunity to participate and to conduct discovery and file dispositive motions in accordance with Rule 1-071.2 NMRA, the district court entered its order granting the settlement motion for entry of partial final decrees describing the water rights of the Navajo Nation. The court then entered the partial final judgment and decree of the water rights of the Navajo Nation and the supplemental partial final judgment and decree of the water rights of the Navajo Nation (Proposed Decrees). The non-settling parties objected to several terms of the Settlement Agreement and to the inter se procedures adopted by the district court. After full briefing and argument, the district court rejected the objections and issued its order approving the\n   Settlement Agreement and Proposed Decrees (the Settlement Order).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Settlement Order, the district court concluded that the Settlement Agreement was fair, adequate, reasonable, and consistent with the public interest as well as all applicable laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {6} Appellants herein, the San Juan Acequias, are non-settling parties to the underlying proceedings that preceded the Settlement Agreement. Despite having virtually all issues in common with other non-settling parties, each has consistently refused to consolidate their appeals, failed to comply with filing deadlines, and neglected to follow rules of procedure or standard practice. Therefore, it will be necessary to address their claims in separate opinions. The San Juan Acequias challenge more than fifty aspects of the district court's conclusions. However, since this Court finds essentially all of these are based on faulty factual and/or legal premises, we will dispose of them categorically rather than attempt to answer each challenge separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {7} \" 'It is the policy of the law and of the State of New Mexico to favor settlement agreements.' \"\n   <em>\n    Am.

New Mexico Statutes Refute Appellants' Claim That the Settlement Required the Express Approval of the New Mexico Legislature and Any Such Claim Should Have Been Raised by Writ\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {8} Appellants maintain that the Settlement is void under New Mexico law without the express prior approval of the New Mexico Legislature. Initially it must be noted Appellants' brief in chief fails to include any indication of how this issue (and indeed most others) was presented to the district court. This violation of Rule 12-318(A)(4) NMRA makes this Court's job much more difficult.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Gomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"322282\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/122/777/\">\n    1997-NMSC-006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"322282\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/122/777/\">\n    122 N.M. 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"322282\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/122/777/\">\n    932 P.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"an appellate court will consider only such questions as were raised in the lower court\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, Appellants argue inter alia that the Settlement violates the New Mexico Constitution's separation of powers. This is based on the premise that Governor Richardson lacked the power to sign the Settlement without prior legislative approval. They further contend that through the Settlement, Governor Richardson attempted to infringe the plenary jurisdiction of the New Mexico Courts under Article VI of the New Mexico Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {10} This contention, like Appellants' entire appeal, is based on a failure to understand the nature of the relationship between Indian nations and the United States government as well as the structure of federalism. It is compounded by a misconception of New Mexico water law procedure and the role of the New Mexico State Engineer. We explain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {11} First, water is a commodity that can move in interstate commerce, and\n   does so as the San Juan River crosses several state boundaries. Thus, it is ultimately subject to the control of the federal, not the state, government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oneida Indian Nation v.

If Defendants are arguing the New Mexico Constitution controls the Settlement since Congress approved the Constitution in 1911, this is also incorrect. The Settlement Agreement was approved by Congress in 2009 and was intended by Congress to allocate Navajo water and is thus much more specific than the New Mexico Constitution, which makes no mention of the water allocated to the Navajo Reservation in 1868.

However, as will become clear, it does not require immediate \"beneficial use\" as the only measure of Indian water rights. Professor Tarlock succinctly outlines the properly applicable legal principle for the allocation of reservation water:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Indian water rights are proprietary rights. Reserved water rights ... have a priority date, the date of the creation of the reservation, but they are not dependent on the application of water to beneficial use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Tarlock,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 9:38.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {18} Appellants attempt to bolster their interpretation of \"beneficial use\" as requiring immediate use by relying on inapplicable federal statutes such as the Reclamation Act of 1902,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20372\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). They are correct that if this were indeed a Reclamation Act case, the Secretary of the Interior would be required to follow the state law interpretation of \"beneficial use.\" However, they present no evidence or sound legal argument that the Reclamation Act applies here. Arriving more than forty years after the establishment of the Navajo Reservation, the 1902 Reclamation Act is clearly not the source of the federal government's authority to create the Navajo Reservation or reserve water rights to it and therefore does not constrain the use of reservation water.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colville Confederated Tribes\n   </em>\n   , 752 F.2d at 405.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {19} Appellants are also off base in attempting to graft language from the New Mexico Supreme Court regarding the Pueblo Water Rights doctrine onto the\n   <em>\n    Winters\n   </em>\n   doctrine.

That Compact specifically acknowledges that its purpose is \"to establish the relative importance of different beneficial uses of water.\" Moreover, that Compact expressly contemplated future uses beyond those existing in 1922.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA 1978, \u00a7 72-15-5 (art. I) (1923).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus Compact water was not seen as frozen in time and can clearly be used at various times for various uses.

VII); NMSA 1978, \u00a7 72-15-26 (art. XIX) (1949).

Initially it ignores the fact that the settling parties were following the order of the district court and the requirements of Rule 1-071.2(C). Secondly it appears at least part of the problem arose from the failure of Appellants' counsel to supply the current names of all members of the various ditch associations that were available to Appellants.

The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Limiting the Time for Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {38} The district court established an orderly and appropriate discovery process, which included an electronic repository for access to discovery documents and regional records repositories for inspection of the older archived government records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Technical reports supporting the United States' and Navajo Nation's Statement of Claims and supporting documents were filed on January 30, 2012. Initial discovery began with the district court's February 3, 2012 order lifting the stay of discovery. Discovery was available to the non-settling parties beginning on April 2, 2012, when the settling parties made their initial disclosures. The parties were able to review documents, make discovery requests, and conduct depositions of the Settling Parties' witnesses at any time after February 3, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {39} Under the court's scheduling order entered on August 7, 2012, discovery was originally set to close on February 1, 2013. On November 6, 2012, at the request of Appellants and others, the district court entered an order extending discovery. At the request of Appellants and the other non-settling parties, the district court granted another extension of time for discovery until March 31, 2013. Discovery was thus available to Appellants for more than a year during which they sought no further discovery extensions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Again, virtually all these arguments are based on Appellants' inability to comprehend the proper goals and procedure for an inter se water hearing. As we have reiterated, in such a proceeding, issues regarding settlement of other claims and necessity of a pipeline were not required to be addressed at the outset of litigation or alongside superior claims. Appellants' \"equitable\" arguments regarding global warming, lack of adequate water, the Engineer's\n   failure to fairly allocate, shrinking Navajo population, endangered species, exclusion of other reserved federal water uses, and the failure to include Appellants in the inter se negotiations between the three governments also all miscomprehend the scope and legal effect of the congressional approvals in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {41} Due to the intemperate nature of some of Appellants' language however, this Court cannot fail to address one of their arguments. Appellants claim that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [t]he court abolished the requirement of a hydrographic survey, which is required by statute. [Sections] 72-4-13 through -17.\n   <em>\n    The court substituted a fake hydrographic survey\n   </em>\n   prepared by the United States and the Navajo Nation without any fieldwork....

Appellants' counsel states it appears violations of the prohibition against ex parte communication have \"contributed to many instances in this and other cases where the basic rights of water owners have been sacrificed to accommodate the interests of the OSE.\" Appellants' counsel further posits the question, \"Did the OSE engage in ex parte contacts to convince the judge that it would be too expensive for the three governments to search readily available public records?\" Even more outrageously, without establishing any basis for the accusation of ex parte contact, Appellants' counsel goes on to smear the district judge by stating, \"[t]he judge never made any disclosures, and never explained why not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {44} Truth is not a matter of convenience. \"Lawyers are officers of the court and are always under an obligation to be truthful\" with the judicial forum.\n   <em>\n    In re Stein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784105\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/462/\">\n    2008-NMSC-013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784105\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/462/\">\n    143 N.M. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784105\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/462/\">\n    177 P.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
