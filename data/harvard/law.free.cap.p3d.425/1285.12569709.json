Franklin moved to strike the surcharge, arguing that the City of Missoula did not have the statutory authority to include it in her sentence. The Municipal Court denied the motion, and the Fourth Judicial District Court affirmed the Municipal Court's order. We reverse and remand with instructions to strike the illegal portion of the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In September 2015, Franklin appeared in Missoula Municipal Court and entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of Disorderly Conduct, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA. The Municipal Court deferred imposition of sentence for a period of twelve months, charged Franklin a fine of $100, charged Franklin the cost of prosecution in the amount of $50, and charged Franklin various additional surcharges totaling $110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Included in the $110 fee were the following charges: (1) a fifteen-dollar surcharge under \u00a7 46-18-236(1)(a), MCA, to pay for the salary of the city attorney and deputies; (2) a fifty-dollar surcharge under \u00a7 46-18-236(1)(c), MCA, to pay for a victim and witness advocate program; (3) a ten-dollar surcharge under \u00a7 3-1-317(1)(a), MCA, to pay for court information technology; (4) a ten-dollar surcharge under \u00a7 3-1-318(1), MCA, to pay for the Montana Law Enforcement Academy; and (5) a twenty-five-dollar surcharge under Missoula Resolution 7784 to fund the City Attorney's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Missoula Resolution 7784 was adopted because the Missoula City Council established that the current statutory surcharges did not adequately fund the office of the City Attorney. The Missoula City Council believed that individuals who commit criminal or traffic violations should contribute an amount to the City Attorney's Office greater than \u00a7 46-18-236(1)(a), MCA provides. The additional surcharge is assessed as part of the disposition of all citations and complaints, whether under state law or city ordinance, for which there was a conviction or a plea of guilty entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Franklin filed a motion to strike the twenty-five-dollar surcharge, arguing that it was not authorized by statute as a criminal sentence surcharge or cost; thus, the Municipal Court had no authority to include it in a criminal sentence. The Municipal Court denied the motion to strike, concluding that the surcharge was a non-punitive administrative fee and not a sentence. The Fourth Judicial District Court affirmed the Municipal Court's decision, holding that self-governing\n   municipalities have authority to impose special assessments related to the cost of a special benefit provided by the municipality, and that the surcharge was imposed to support the City Attorney's Office's \"efforts to increase the safety of the community.\" Franklin appeals, arguing that the Municipal Court has no statutory authority to impose a local surcharge as part of sentencing for a state law violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 A sentencing court's authority in criminal cases \"is defined and constrained by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Neither Title 46, chapter 18, MCA, nor Title 3, chapter 1, MCA, however, authorizes a sentencing court to impose additional surcharges to fund the city attorney's office.

Here, when adding the twenty-five-dollar surcharge pursuant to the local resolution, the Municipal Court's written sentencing order included a surcharge that imposed a greater burden on Franklin than what Montana statutes allow for an offense made criminal by state law. We conclude that the Municipal Court exceeded its statutory authority by imposing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 When the illegal portion of the sentence does not affect the entire sentence, the remedy typically is remand with instructions to strike the offending portion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stephenson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 34 (applying this reasoning to a suspended sentence). Because the illegal portion of Franklin's sentence, the twenty-five-dollar surcharge, is only a small portion of all the surcharges imposed, striking the local resolution surcharge does not affect the entire sentence.
