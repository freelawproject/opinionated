Because Ruffino had access to Lokosky's email address, phone number, and social media accounts, we hold under Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 4.1(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(1) that service by publication without first attempting to communicate with Lokosky by any of those channels did not constitute \"reasonably diligent efforts\" to obtain her address; therefore, publication was not the \"best means practicable\" to provide notice of the lawsuit. We affirm the superior court's order setting aside the default judgment against Lokosky as void for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In December 2015, Ruffino filed a complaint against Lokosky alleging false advertising and unfair competition, defamation, false light invasion of privacy, and tortious interference, all arising from a series of online posts authored by Lokosky. Lokosky's posts were on a website she owned and operated, as well as on other social media platforms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 After filing the complaint, Ruffino attempted to serve Lokosky. Ruffino's process server conducted a \"skip trace,\" which showed three possible addresses in Scottsdale for Lokosky: one on Hartford, one on Mountain Spring, and one on Greyhawk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The process server first visited the Hartford address, which was where Lokosky lived at the time. Lokosky's mother told the process server that Lokosky did not live there. Next, the process server visited the Mountain Spring address, where the occupant stated she rented the home and Lokosky did not live there. Finally, the process server made six separate attempts at service at the Greyhawk address, but no one answered the door and the home appeared unoccupied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Ruffino then moved for an order authorizing alternative service, seeking permission to serve Lokosky by posting the complaint on the doors of the Mountain Spring and Hartford addresses and mailing a copy of the summons to those addresses. Alternatively, the motion requested leave to serve by publication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The superior court denied Ruffino's motion, noting that the process server had made only one service attempt at each of the addresses Ruffino was seeking to serve by posting and mailing, and that the attempts were made during the holiday season. Notwithstanding the denial of the motion, after only one more unsuccessful visit to the Hartford address, Ruffino served Lokosky by publication in the Gila Bend Sun. Ruffino did not mail a copy of the summons and complaint to any of the possible addresses. When Lokosky failed to appear, the superior court entered a default judgment against Lokosky awarding Ruffino $264,062.50 in damages and injunctive relief. Ruffino later had the default judgment amended to allow him to secure control of Lokosky's website. Lokosky became\n   aware of the default judgment when control of her website was transferred. She then immediately appeared and moved for a temporary restraining order to allow her to regain control of the website.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, she moved to set aside or vacate the default judgment pursuant to Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure 55(c) and 60(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The superior court sought additional briefing on whether to vacate the default judgment. The court authorized limited discovery, and scheduled an evidentiary hearing. During the evidentiary hearing, the superior court made oral findings of fact as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) the process server did not identify herself to Lokosky's mother when she attempted service at the Hartford address;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) the process server left no documentation at the Hartford address regarding the suit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) Lokosky was not evading service;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (4) Ruffino could have communicated with Lokosky about service through several online channels;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (5) Ruffino did not use any of those channels to let Lokosky know of the suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the hearing, the court granted Lokosky's motion and vacated the judgment based on insufficient service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7 Ruffino timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 12-2101(A)(2).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sullivan &amp; Brugnatelli Advert.

Under the facts presented, Ruffino knew it was more likely than not that Lokosky lived at the Hartford address. In fact, the process server testified at the evidentiary hearing that she believed Lokosky lived at the Hartford address.

Indeed, the lawsuit was based on Lokosky's internet conduct, and Ruffino had previously communicated with Lokosky through these platforms. Still, Ruffino made no attempt via those channels to verify which of Lokosky's suspected addresses was correct. A reasonably diligent effort by Ruffino would have included reaching out to Lokosky via telephone, email, or even social media to verify her correct address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15 Further, and notwithstanding Ruffino's argument to the contrary, the superior court did not abuse its discretion by finding Ruffino had failed to prove Lokosky was evading service. Ruffino's process server only attempted service twice at the Hartford address. The first time, the process server left no documentation with Lokosky's mother and did not identify herself as a process server. The second time, no one answered the door.

Here, however, Ruffino did not move for leave to serve Lokosky by electronic means,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 5(c)(2)(D), and, on appeal, he makes no argument that service by publication was in fact the best means to reach Lokosky.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Ruffino did not mail a copy of the summons and complaint to the Hartford address on the date of publication,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 4.1(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(3), which is further evidence he did not make a serious effort to apprise Lokosky of the suit before seeking and obtaining a default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 18 Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, we are not persuaded that Ruffino made reasonably diligent efforts to confirm Lokosky's address, that Lokosky was attempting to avoid service, or that service by publication in the Gila Bend Sun was the best means practicable under the circumstances to notify Lokosky of the lawsuit. Our holding does not require a party serving by publication to search out every channel possible to communicate with the other party before serving by publication. However, when more practicable channels of communication are available, we hold a serving party should first use those channels to attempt to confirm the other party's address, or move for alternative service, before service by publication can be considered the best means practicable under the rule. Accordingly, we affirm the superior court order vacating the default judgment as void for lack of service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Attorney's Fees and Costs.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 19 Lokosky requests attorney's fees and costs on appeal pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-349.
