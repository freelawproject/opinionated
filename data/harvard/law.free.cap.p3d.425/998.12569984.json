In 2017, Mr. Tuttle filed a declaratory judgment action against the Laramie County Clerk, asking that the NFTL be declared invalid and that the clerk be ordered to remove the NFTL from Mr. Tuttle's property record. The district court dismissed the complaint as barred by the statute of limitations and for failure to state a cognizable claim. We agree that the complaint failed to state a cognizable claim and affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Mr. Tuttle, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , presents two issues on appeal.

In 2007, the IRS filed an NFTL against Mr. Tuttle's Laramie County property. The IRS did not thereafter file a tax lien against the property, but the presence of the NFTL itself interfered with Mr. Tuttle's ability to refinance. On numerous occasions over the ten years following the recording of the NFTL, Mr. Tuttle asked the county clerk, then Debra Lathrop, to remove it from his property record. Ms. Lathrop refused to do so and informed Mr. Tuttle that the NFTL could not be removed without a court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] On April 12, 2017, Mr. Tuttle filed a declaratory judgment complaint against Debra Lee, Ms. Lathrop's successor. The complaint did not allege that Ms. Lee violated the law or any procedural requirement by recording the NFTL. It instead alleged, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   15. The Plaintiff talked to Ms. Lathrop many times since 2007 about having the NFTL stricken from the record because it is incorrect and it contains false information that harms the Plaintiff's credit rating.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   21. The NFTL was placed of record by mistake. The NFTL constitutes a slander of the Plaintiff's title as no federal tax lien has ever been filed and no action has ever been taken by the IRS to enforce any tax lien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b65] By way of relief, Mr. Tuttle asked the district court to declare the NFTL to be of no effect, and to order the county clerk to remove the NFTL from his property record. On May 4, 2017, Ms. Lee responded to the complaint with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b66] On July 6, 2017, the district court held a hearing on Ms. Lee's motion to dismiss. During that hearing, the court raised a question concerning the four-year statute of limitations applicable to declaratory judgment actions and directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing. After receiving the supplemental briefing, the court entered an order granting Ms. Lee's motion to dismiss. The court found the complaint was barred by the four-year statute of limitations, and it further concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Even if Plaintiff's declaratory judgment action is not barred by the statute of limitations, it is still not cognizable. Plaintiff seeks to have the Laramie County Clerk\n   remove the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Under Wyoming Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-6-201 through 29-6-208, the Laramie County Clerk has a non-discretionary duty to file notice of federal tax liens in the county records. In addition, Wyoming Statutes \u00a7 18-[3]-40[2](a)(xii) mandates that a county clerk file a notice of a lien \"[in] favor of the United States.\" \"Where a statute uses the mandatory language 'shall,' a court must obey the statute as a court has no right to make the law contrary to what is prescribed by the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    In re LePage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127745\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/18/1177/\">\n    2001 WY 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127745\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/18/1177/\">\n    18 P.3d 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1180 (Wyo. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.

Based on the allegations of the complaint, which is all this Court considers in reviewing a W.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal, we are therefore unable to find a cognizable claim against Ms. Lee. She had a mandatory obligation to file the NFTL, and nothing in her general Title 18 authority or her authority under the Lien Registration Act permitted her to independently question the underlying validity of the NFTL, to independently remove it from the property record, or to independently record a document declaring it invalid. There being no basis in law for Mr. Tuttle's claim against Ms. Lee and his requested relief, the district court properly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.

A clerk has no authority or discretion to consider the underlying basis for the lien or notice, or to declare the invalidity of a federal tax lien, which is the relief Mr. Tuttle sought in his complaint against the Laramie County Clerk. The district court therefore properly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cognizable claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Because we hold that Mr. Tuttle's complaint failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted, we need not address the question of whether Mr. Tuttle's complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Whether Mr. Tuttle has any recourse against the IRS, either through an administrative process or litigation against it in a proper court, is not before us, and we refrain from comment on that possibility.
