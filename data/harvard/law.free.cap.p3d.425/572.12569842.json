In May 2013, TJI hired Mr. James as its Chief Development Officer, and Mr. Eby as its Vice President of Operations, at the behest of Jeff Linville, TJI's recently hired President and CEO (collectively referred to as the Linville Team). At the time they were hired, Mr. James and Mr. Eby executed nearly identical employment agreements requiring both to \"devote all of [their] time, attention, knowledge and skills solely to the business and interest of Employer.\" Employment Agreements, Section V. The employment agreements permit termination for cause without advance notice \"[i]n the event of any violation by Employee of any of the terms of this Agreement. ...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Employment Agreements, Section XII (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b64] In mid-2016, Mr. Linville informed TJI's compensation committee of his wife's desire to become a Beef Jerky Outlet (BJO) franchisee as her \"hobby\" and that he, Mr. James, and Mr. Eby would be investors in her business. The compensation committee informed TJI's general counsel of the Linville Team's plan to invest in the BJO franchise. Around this time, TJI's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) became concerned about a trip the Linville Team took to Tennessee. TJI's general counsel and CFO investigated the matters and discovered the Linville Team's participation in the BJO venture included more than investing capital as represented by Mr. Linville. They discovered the following information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b65] Mr. James and Mr. Eby participated in a conference call to learn about the BJO franchise and viewed a BJO webinar from TJI's corporate offices in Cheyenne, Wyoming in the spring of 2016. On April 25, 2016, Mr. Linville created and registered a Colorado entity, Last Bite Jerky, LLC, for their BJO venture and listed the Linville Team as its sole members. In May of 2016, the Linville Team drafted a business plan to present to BJO and to aid in obtaining financing. The business plan stated Mr. Linville, Mr. James, and Mr. Eby were the company's sole \"partners\" and provided the following \"ownership responsibilities\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Each member of our management team will share in all decisions, however, we will use our expertise in the following manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Shawn Eby will have the responsibilities of all operational decisions, including hiring, training, inside sales building, cleanliness, and inventory management. Dan James will be responsible for all real estate decisions, market viability and lease negotiations. He will also oversee the buildout process. Jeff Linville will handle some administrative costs and marketing of the business. Also, Sharon Linville is a C.P.A. and will handle the administrative side (taxes, accounting, payroll, etc.).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The business plan also stated the company's goal of owning two franchises by the end of 2016 and progressively acquiring more for a total of fifteen by the end of 2021. Mr. Linville saved the business plan on TJI's internal network. The Linville Team also executed a comprehensive operating agreement for Last Bite Jerky, LLC, stating Mr. James, Mr. Eby, and Mr. Linville would manage the business as members. Mr. Linville provided the operating agreement to BJO. On June 13, 2016, Mr. James sought financing to fund the new business venture, and, in July 2016, loan applications were circulated using the Linville Team's TJI email accounts. The Linville Team also visited BJO headquarters and met with BJO executives while on a trip to Tennessee for TJI business purposes. They also scouted for potential BJO locations in Colorado and Wyoming. TJI's general counsel and CFO reported these findings to TJI's board of directors. The board terminated Mr. James' and Mr. Eby's employment for cause on August 12, 2016, effective immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b66] Mr. James and Mr. Eby filed a lawsuit against TJI asserting breach of the employment agreements and seeking damages in excess of $1,000,000 each.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   TJI moved for summary judgment. On October 30, 2017, the district court granted the motion, finding the employment agreements unambiguously precluded Mr. James and Mr. Eby from forming a new company and seeking other franchise opportunities while still employed as senior executives at TJI. The district court determined the undisputed facts detailing Mr. James' and Mr. Eby's involvement in forming a new company and pursuing other franchise opportunities were sufficient to support their termination even though they never invested any money in Last Bite Jerky, LLC, and the BJO venture never materialized. Mr. James and Mr. Eby timely filed a notice of appeal on November 29, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b67] We review an order granting summary judgment de novo, giving no deference to the district court's determinations.\n   <em>\n    Lindsey v.

Employment Agreements, Section V. The employment agreements also contain a written modification clause stating: \"This Agreement shall be modified only by a written agreement, duly executed by both parties.\" Employment Agreements, Section XVII. Assuming Mr. Linville orally authorized Mr. James' and Mr. Eby's participation in the BJO project, such authorization was contrary to these express contract terms. As with the disclaimers in\n   <em>\n    Loghry\n   </em>\n   , by including the written modification clause in Mr. James' and Mr. Eby's employment agreements, TJI did not induce any reasonable expectations of other employment exceptions and did not give Mr. James and Mr. Eby any reason to rely on any oral representations of Mr. Linville to the contrary. Accordingly, any reliance on Mr. Linville's oral authorization for Mr. James and Mr. Eby to participate in the BJO venture was unreasonable as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavez v.

The district court properly refused to consider parol evidence to interpret the unambiguous agreements. Mr. James and Mr. Eby failed to demonstrate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact requiring a\n   trial. Instead, the undisputed facts show Mr. James and Mr. Eby breached the employment agreements by forming a new company while still employed as senior executives at TJI and pursing a franchise opportunity unrelated to TJI. Mr. James' and Mr. Eby's reliance on any oral authorization by Mr. Linville to participate in the BJO venture was unreasonable as a matter of law. Consequently, TJI properly terminated Mr. James' and Mr. Eby's employment for cause. For these reasons, we affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    TJI offers alternative grounds for upholding summary judgment and, alternatively, requests we limit available damages on remand.

Thereafter, Mr. James and Mr. Eby amended the complaint to omit references to Mr. Linville. The district court treated their cause of action against TJI as a breach of contract and not wrongful termination, as pled in the amended complaint. Mr. James and Mr. Eby did not contest the district court's characterization of their claim. Mr. James and Mr. Eby also sued TJI's general counsel and CFO for defamation but did not appeal the order granting summary judgment to defendants on that claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Prior to filing the notice of appeal, Mr. James and Mr. Eby moved the court to vacate its order granting summary judgment pursuant to W.R.C.P. 59(a)(1)(F). The district court summarily denied the motion on December 21, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    This rule was amended in 2017, and the cited language now appears at W.R.C.P. 56(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In addition, Mr. James and Mr. Eby assert the employment agreements are ambiguous because the term \"Employer\" is defined as \"TJI as a corporation\" and does not include TJI's board of directors. Consequently, they argue the board lacked authority to terminate them for cause. This argument is specious.
