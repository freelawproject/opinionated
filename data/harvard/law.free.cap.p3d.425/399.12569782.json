The jury recommended as punishment imprisonment for eighteen (18) years in each count. The trial court sentenced accordingly, granted Appellant credit for time served, ordered the sentences to run concurrently, and imposed a period of post-imprisonment supervision. It is from these judgments and sentences that Appellant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Appellant conspired with Brian Maher to deliver Methamphetamine to a confidential informant working for the District 2 Drug Task Force. On October 13, 2015, Appellant delivered Methamphetamine to the confidential informant during a controlled-buy wherein the informant wore an audio/video recording device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In his sole proposition of error, Appellant contends that the jury was improperly exposed to evidence and argument telling the jurors that Appellant had previously received suspended sentences. He concedes that he waived appellate review of his claim for all but plain error when he failed to challenge the evidence and argument below. Therefore, we review Appellant's claim pursuant to the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Simpson v.

This exhibit showed that several of Appellant's prior sentences had been suspended in whole or in part, and\n   in some instances, revoked for violations of the terms of suspension.

Jurors are free to consider the relevant proof of a prior conviction including any evidence that a defendant previously received probation, suspension, or deferral of a sentence and any acceleration or revocation of such a sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt v.

Since the jury is free to consider the relevant proof of a prior conviction, both parties are afforded wide latitude to discuss this evidence and make recommendation as to punishment in the second stage of a trial.

Similarly, prosecutorial argument invoking societal alarm is improper,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , calling for the jury to make an example out of the defendant to deter other potential criminals.\n   <em>\n    McElmurry v.

Giving the documents within the exhibit their maximum probative value and minimum prejudicial effect, we find that the probative value of the documents was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Mayes v.

The prosecutor's \"chance after chance\" argument properly commented on the evidence and did not invoke societal alarm, sympathy, sentiment or prejudice.

This case confirms my view that juries get it right more often than not. Far from being inflamed by the truthful information presented on the face of the judgment and sentence documents admitted to prove Appellant's six (6) prior felony convictions and the prosecutor's comment on same, the jury struck a balanced approach in recommending sentences based on the facts of the charged offenses in this case and Appellant's previous history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   KUEHN, JUDGE, CONCURRING IN RESULT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 1 I agree with the Court that the\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   case is unworkable, but disagree with the logic behind that conclusion and the proposed outcome after allowing the inclusion of probation language on a Judgment and Sentence for the jury to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 2 Currently, it is error to admit a Judgment and Sentence, or any other document, which informs jurors that the defendant previously received suspended/deferred sentences.\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Whether that error rises to the level of plain error, or if the error was preserved below, whether it requires relief, depends on various factors. Certainly, as in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   relief is required where the prosecutor explicitly calls the jury's attention to the suspended sentence, or otherwise explicitly and unmistakably refers to probation, suspended or deferred sentences.\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800902\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/508/\">\n    2016 OK CR 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800902\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/508/\">\n    372 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   512 ;\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7334727\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/208/931/\">\n    2009 OK CR 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7334727\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/208/931/\">\n    208 P.3d at 933-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, on appeal, the Court has consistently had to weigh prosecutors' statements contemplating the \"totality of the circumstances\" test from\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   . In doing so, the line a prosecutor must cross for the error to be harmful has become undefinable and non-existent. This is why\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   is unworkable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 3 I am disturbed by the frequency of cases before this Court in which Judgment and Sentence documents are improperly redacted or not redacted at all. The current law is clear. Attorneys have an obligation to review all documents submitted to prove an allegation of prior convictions, before their admission-whether or not the documents are contested or admitted by stipulation. The law regarding mention of suspended/deferred sentences and probation is long standing and unambiguous: it is error. It should be routine for the attorneys and the judge in any case to ensure that the law is followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 4 As I say, this is the current law. The prohibition against mentioning probation, parole, etc., was intended to prevent jurors from allowing information about the actual sentence served on previous convictions to improperly influence their consideration of the sentence they should impose. The length of time a defendant actually served for previous convictions has no probative value in a current case.\n   <em>\n    Martin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20OK%20CR%20168\">\n    1983 OK CR 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10415308\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/674/37/\">\n    674 P.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41-42. For this reason, it is not error to introduce a Judgment and Sentence which merely states the term of years a defendant received on a prior conviction, where there is no reference to probation or parole.\n   <em>\n    Stewart v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800902\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/508/\">\n    2016 OK CR 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800902\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/508/\">\n    372 P.3d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512. This is the case even if jurors could infer, from the dates and imprisonment imposed, that a defendant did not serve his full sentence for the prior offense.\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983480\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/271/67/\">\n    2012 OK CR 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983480\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/271/67/\">\n    271 P.3d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78. Since\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   , this Court has, in practice, refused to grant relief where a Judgment and Sentence contains improper reference to probation, parole, etc., unless the prosecutor unmistakably draws the jury's attention to the improper information.\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800902\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/508/\">\n    2016 OK CR 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800902\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/508/\">\n    372 P.3d at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 5 Given the apparent difficulty parties have in following the rule at issue here, I believe the purposes behind it may be better served by a modification of this doctrine. The evil we seek to avoid is jurors' use of irrelevant information in sentencing determinations. Following\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , I would find it is not error to admit, for purposes of proving an allegation of prior convictions, Judgment and Sentence documents, which may refer to suspended or deferred sentences. In order to ensure jurors do not use this information improperly, they must be properly instructed. Jurors already receive instruction on the use of prior convictions to determine punishment. I propose we add to that instruction the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If you find the defendant has [a] prior conviction[s], you must not consider the type of sentence imposed in [that] [those] case[s] in determining the punishment in the present case. You must not let your decision on punishment be influenced by the type of sentence (i.e., deferred or suspended sentence) the defendant previously received or the term of years previously imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In proposing this change, I emphasize that our current prohibition against prosecutors using that information to argue a defendant deserves a longer sentence in his or her current case, must remain in effect. Prosecutors must not call jurors' attention to this information or encourage them to use it against the defendant, as that will be error.\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800902\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/508/\">\n    2016 OK CR 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800902\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/508/\">\n    372 P.3d at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 6 I understand the Court's reasoning behind a jury considering the terms, along with the parties commenting on the evidence in examinations and closing arguments. The reasoning is sound, but the result will be chaos. I am not arguing that probation should or should not be admitted as evidence in a trial. But, until thoughtful consideration has been given to all aspects of what procedure must be changed, the discussion of such terms is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 7 Now, as written, with the process of allowing comment on the probation terms, the Court goes back to the same balancing test that was the problem in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not only will the balancing be more difficult, but the scope of what can be tolerated in the courtroom is vague and broad as outlined by the Court. What does ''wide latitude to discuss this evidence\" mean?\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   What does \"properly address\" error when a prosecutor \"offends\" mean? I cannot imagine what trials will entail with this open invitation to argue. This Court on appeal could be reviewing a prosecutor describing free chances, details of what a deferred or suspended sentence mean, and how the defendant got a good\n   deal. And what of the defense? In order to rebut the \"wide latitude\" of the State, the defense will want to present evidence of why the plea was a probationary term, what the defendant had to complete in order to finish probation, how the defendant completed the probation, etc. The second stage will become an aggravation and mitigation spectacle leaving the unguided trial judge with no choice but to sit back and watch the show. The Court is stirring up a hornet's nest without more guidance to the parties and the trial courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 8 In this case, using my proposed analysis, admission of the documents was not error. The prosecutor should not have commented on them and clearly went too far under\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   . However, Appellant had six felony convictions, and his sentences were relatively lenient. Under these circumstances the error in argument neither resulted in a miscarriage of justice nor constituted a substantial violation of a constitutional or statutory right. 20 O.S.2011, \u00a7 3001.1. For this reason, I concur in result.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \"History does not repeat itself but it rhymes.\" Attributed to Mark Twain.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Merriam-Websters Dictionary defines \"wide latitude\" as, \"freedom of action or choice.\" Freedom to explore legal probationary terms and what facts are behind them is a dangerous freedom to grant either party without guidance. As noted by Thomas Jefferson in a letter to James Madison on January 30, 1787, \"The mass of mankind under [freedom] enjoys a precious degree of liberty and happiness. It has its evils too: the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-41\">\n   LEWIS, VICE PRESIDING JUDGE, DISSENTING:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 1 Today's majority discards as \"unworkable\" a case-law rule that imposed modest limitations on the prosecution's ability to use prior suspended sentences as aggravating evidence in jury sentencing proceedings. As the opinion shows, the rule has proved \"unworkable\" for the Court just to the extent that prosecutors have frequently ignored it and the Court has no future intention to enforce it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 2 The majority yet insists that it has not given free rein to prosecutors, limiting such evidence to the general rules of relevance, and prohibiting \"blatant appeals to sympathy, sentiment, or prejudice,\" \"invoking societal alarm,\" and \"calling for the jury to make an example out of the defendant\" in sentencing stage arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 3\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   and subsequent cases had already struck a practical, relevance-based balance, allowing evidence of suspended sentences to be admitted in judgment and sentence documents, so long as the prosecutor \"did not mention the suspended sentences ... or otherwise draw the jury's attention to them\" in argument.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152071\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/934/\">\n    2016 OK CR 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152071\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/934/\">\n    387 P.3d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 945 (finding error, but neither plain error nor prejudice, from evidence indicating a suspended sentence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Court in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   seemed to recognize, at least implicitly, that the typical \"chance after chance\" arguments, using suspended sentences as aggravating evidence, suggest a false narrative that the defendant has abused some great kindness in the past and thus deserves a much longer sentence. Recidivist defendants are certainly blameworthy for their commission of new crimes, but prior suspended sentences are often a by-product of the complex realities of sentencing. Leniency is often incidental in the mutually convenient terms of a plea bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 5 Such arguments therefore often\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   violate basic principles of relevance and fairness. They\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   play upon everyday prejudices of lay jurors about plea-bargaining and probation. They\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   urge jurors to deal more harshly with the defendant because of prior suspended sentences, regardless of the complex realities behind them. The Court today approves such arguments; and under this more \"workable\" rule, we shall see more of them in the future. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
