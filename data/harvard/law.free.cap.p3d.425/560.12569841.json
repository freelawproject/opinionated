LCMC counterclaimed to quiet title in fee or to an exclusive easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 LCMC moved for summary judgment on the Johnsons' quiet title, trespass, waste,\n   timber trespass, and nuisance claims. The superior court granted LCMC's motion for summary judgment in part and dismissed the Johnsons' claims for trespass, waste, timber trespass, and quiet title. The superior court also quieted title in LCMC to an exclusive easement for park and road purposes, free and clear of any claim for use of the property by the Johnsons, except in their capacity as LCMC members. The superior court further enjoined the Johnsons, their heirs, executors, agents, and assigns from asserting any right, title, or interest in the exclusive easement, and from interfering with LCMC's use and enjoyment of the easement. The Johnsons appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 We hold that the superior court did not err in dismissing the Johnsons' quiet title, trespass, waste, timber trespass, and injunction claims. However, we also hold that the superior court erred in quieting title in LCMC to an exclusive easement free and clear of any claim for use by the Johnsons because LCMC failed to show that there was no genuine issue of material fact that their easement was intended to be an exclusive easement. Because the superior court erred in quieting title in LCMC to an exclusive easement, the superior court also erred in enjoining the Johnsons, their heirs, executors, agents, and assigns from asserting any right, title, or interest in or to the exclusive easement quieted in LCMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In the unpublished portion of this appeal, we hold that the superior court erred in striking the portion of Schomaker's affidavit related to payment of taxes on the property, but it did not err in striking the other portions of the submitted affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The City of Tacoma owns a large tract of land adjoining the Cushman project reservoir.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City decided to make the existing Cushman project reservoir available for recreational use and to privately develop the tracts of land on or near the reservoirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 In March 1966, the City entered into a 99 year lease with Lake Cushman Company [LCC], a private developer. The lease provided LCC the right to use the waters of the lakes for recreational purposes, including boating, swimming, and fishing. The lease also provided that it was \"mutually understood by the parties hereto that [LCC] may sublet any part or portion of the lands hereby leased for any period or periods within the lease term upon such sublease forms first approved by the City Attorney of Tacoma.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 In June, LCC formed Lake Cushman Maintenance Company [LCMC], a non-profit corporation, for the express purpose of developing, repairing, maintaining, and operating the land that LCC had leased from the City of Tacoma. LCMC would also levy and collect dues or maintenance fees from the sublessees of the property within the subdivisions of Lake Cushman, as established by the LCC. LCC created LCMC to \"act as a homeowners' association for the operation, maintenance and repair of the common areas of the development.\" CP at 293\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 In February 1983, LCC created an \"easement for the exclusive use of the Lake Cushman Maintenance Co., its successors and assigns, for park and road purposes over ... [t]hat portion of Lot 62 in the Plat of Lake Cushman No. 14.\" CP at 151. The easement was recorded in the Mason County Auditor's Office under Auditor's File No. 414987.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 In May, LCC subdivided Lot 62 into four smaller lots (Lots 1-4) under short plat 1260. The legal description for Lots 1-4 of short plat 1260 stated that Lot 1 was \"subject to an easement in favor of Lake Cushman\n   Maintenance Co. for road and park purposes[,] recorded under Auditor's File No. 414987.\" CP at 156. The legal descriptions for Lots 1-4 in short plat 1260 was recorded under Mason County Auditor's File No. 415052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 In October, LCC subleased Lot 1 to Stephen and Carol Brandt. The lease agreement described the land leased as \"[t]hat portion of Lot 62 in the Plat of Lake Cushman No. 14, recorded in Volume 9 of Plats, Pages 17 through 19, records of Mason County, Washington described as follows: See Exhibit \"A\" for legal description.\" CP at 94. Exhibit A was a copy of the legal description for Lot 1 in short plat 1260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 In March 2014, Matthew and Amy Johnson obtained a leasehold interest in Lot 1 of the short platted Lot 62 through an assignment of lease. The assignment of lease referenced short plat 1260, provided a legal description of Lot 1 in short plat 1260, and stated that the land assigned was \"subject to easements, restrictions, covenants, reservations, agreements, and conditions of record.\" CP at 168 (capitalization omitted). The assignment of lease also included a list of special exceptions and included the \"[e]asement, including its terms, covenants and provisions as disclosed by instrument; Recorded: May 12, 1983 Recording No: 414987 For: park and road purposes Affects: portion of said premises.\" CP at 170. The special exceptions under the assignment of lease also referenced the \"[c]ovenants, conditions, restrictions, recitals, disclaimers, notices, agreements [and/or] easements as contained in Short Plat No. 1260.\" CP at 171. And included in the assignment of lease was a survey depicting Lot 1 of short plat 1260. The survey showed the boundaries of the easement \"FOR PARK AND ROAD PURPOSES A.F. NO. 414987 GRANTED PRIOR TO SHORT PLAT NO. 1260.\" CP at 173. In accepting the assignment of lease, the Johnsons acknowledged that they \"accept all of the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements of the assigned Lease\" and \"agree to be bound thereby.\" CP at 167.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B. LITIGATION BETWEEN THE JOHNSONS AND LCMC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   1. The Johnsons File Complaint to Quiet Title\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Shortly after subleasing Lot 1, the Johnsons began to notice trash and debris accumulating on the park easement located on their property. The debris mostly consisted of contraband, including alcohol containers, makeshift pipes, and needles. According to the Johnsons, every time they removed the contraband from the park on their property, more would appear. The Johnsons also began to hear noise and \"late night partying.\" CP at 212. The Johnsons believed that these \"trespassers\" were responsible for the needles and drug paraphernalia continuously left on their property. CP at 212. According to the Johnsons, LCMC employs security to monitor the park until 5 PM. After security leaves for the day, \"a rush of cars ... come pouring in\" to use the park after hours. CP at 214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Frustrated with LCMC's response to their complaints, the Johnsons began posting \"no trespassing\" signs throughout the park easement area. CP at 213. LCMC removed these signs. The Johnsons also erected a gate and several hedges, which LCMC claimed limited access to the park easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 On June 23, 2015, the Johnsons filed a complaint to quiet title to the park easement, claiming that the easement was void. The Johnsons sought an order declaring the park easement void, arguing that LCC and LCMC were so intertwined and related that the park easement was a grantor easement and, thus, invalid. The Johnsons also sought an injunction prohibiting LCMC and its members from using the park easement \"in any manner.\" CP at 318. The Johnsons also brought causes of action against LCMC for trespass, waste, nuisance, and timber trespass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 LCMC filed an answer, asserting that its successors, and assigns were the benefited \"owners of a fee title or an exclusive easement\" over and across the park located on the Johnsons' property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   CP at 311.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   LCMC also raised several affirmative defenses, including that LCMC had \"established fee title\" to the park through adverse possession, had established a prescriptive easement, or alternatively had an implied easement to the property. CP at 312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 LCMC also filed a counterclaim, asserting that LCC had granted LCMC \"an exclusive easement which included right to exclude the plaintiffs as owners of the servient estate from using the property in any way.\" CP at 313. LCMC further asserted that its\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-32\">\n   exclusive easement is an unusual interest in land amounting to almost a conveyance of the fee title to [LCMC]. The grant of an exclusive easement to [LCMC] conveyed unfettered rights to [LCMC] as owner of the easement to use that easement for purposes specified in the grant to the exclusion of all others, including the plaintiffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   CP at 313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 In its prayer for relief, LCMC requested a decree \"adjudging\" LCMC \"to be the owner\" of the park \"in fee or exclusive easement, quieting its title thereto and barring [the Johnsons] ... from asserting any interest therein superior to the title of [LCMC].\" CP at 314. LCMC also requested an injunction permanently prohibiting the Johnsons from interfering with LCMC's quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the park property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2. LCMC's Motion for Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 On October 13, 2016, LCMC filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the Johnsons' quiet title, trespass, waste, and timber trespass claims. LCMC argued that the Johnsons' claim that the easement was a grantor easement was without merit because LCC is a privately held, for-profit corporation, while LCMC is a non-profit homeowners' association. LCMC also argued that the easement \"clearly and unambiguously\" created an exclusive easement because the language states the easement was \" 'for the exclusive use of the Lake Cushman Maintenance Co.' \" CP at 179 (emphasis omitted). According to LCMC,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-37\">\n   Lake Cushman Co. clearly and unambiguously created an exclusive easement for LCMC to use the southerly portion of Lot 1, Short Plat 1260 for park purposes. Plaintiffs therefore have no right to use of any of the easement area except as members of LCMC and subject to LCMC rules and regulations for member use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CP at 182-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 In response, the Johnsons argued that LCMC and LCC were the same entity because (1) LCMC was formed to administer recreational opportunities to members of LCC and LCMC, and (2) the trustees of both companies were the same. The Johnsons further argued that LCMC did not have the right to exclude them from using the easement because they were the servient estate. The Johnsons also argued that the easement was \"clearly to be used solely for ingress and egress to the boat launch and viewpoint.\" CP at 132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21 In support of their arguments, the Johnsons provided a declaration of Matthew Johnson, which stated that \"[a] portion of our property that LCMC has been using for the road and viewpoint is clearly not being used only for residential purposes, which is contrary to the original covenants.\" CP at 48. The Johnsons also provided a declaration of Mark Schomaker, who had leased a lot at Lake Cushman for approximately 24 years. Schomaker stated that to his knowledge, LCMC had not paid any taxes on the portion of his property containing the easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 The Johnsons also filed a declaration of Gary Christman, who has lived within the subdivision of Lake Cushman developed by LCC since 1979. According to Christman, an area on the easement that LCMC claimed had been used as a parking lot, \"had only ever been used for the owner access.\" CP at 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 Finally, the Johnsons filed a declaration of Bonnie Bunmaster, a \"lot owner\" of Lake Cushman since 1982. CP at 117. According to Bunmaster, \"[t]he only portion of the Johnson/Schomaker property that has\n   ever been used or maintained is the road, and the path to the viewpoint.\" CP at 118. Bunmaster also claimed to frequent the viewpoint regularly and had never seen any other LCMC members or anyone else use the hillside near the area. Bunmaster further asserted that the \"lower flat area North of the road has never been used by the membership. This has always been a driveway for the owners of the Johnson/Schomaker property.\" CP at 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   3. Ruling on Summary Judgment Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 The superior court granted LCMC's motion for summary judgment in part, dismissing the Johnsons' claims for trespass, waste, timber trespass, and quiet title.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also ordered that, \"Lake Cushman Maintenance Company's title in and to an exclusive easement for park and road purposes ... is quieted in [LCMC] free and clear of any claim for use of the property by plaintiffs, except for any right of use related to their membership in Lake Cushman Maintenance Company.\" CP at 14. The superior court further ordered that, \"Plaintiffs and their heirs, executors, agents and assigns are perpetually enjoined from asserting any right[,] title[,] or interest in or to the exclusive easement herein quieted in defendant and are further enjoined from interfering with defendant's use and enjoyment of said easement.\" CP at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 The Johnsons appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 26 The Johnsons assign error to certain findings of fact and conclusions of law entered by the superior court. The Johnsons also assign error to the superior court's failure to make certain factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 27 On review of summary judgment, we review de novo whether there are any genuine issues as to any material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Therefore, we do not address the Johnsons' assignments of error to specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 28 The Johnsons also assign error to the superior court's grant of summary judgment in favor of LCMC on the Johnsons' claims for quiet title, waste, trespass, and timber trespass. The Johnsons further assign error to the superior court's order quieting title in LCMC to an exclusive easement, free and clear of any claim for use of the property by the Johnsons, and permanently enjoining the Johnsons or any of their successors and heirs from asserting right, title, or interest to the exclusive easement. We consider each in turn and hold that the superior court did not err in dismissing the Johnsons' quiet title, waste, trespass, and timber trespass claims on summary judgment, but hold that the superior court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of LCMC on LCMC's quiet title claim; erred in permanently enjoining the Johnsons from using the property except in their capacity as LCMC members; and erred in enjoining the Johnsons, their heirs, and successors from ever asserting any right, title, or interest in or to the exclusive easement.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Mark and Katherine Schomaker were also parties to this lawsuit in the superior court, but they did not file a notice of appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Located on the Olympic Peninsula, the Cushman Project \"is a hydroelectric generating facility ... consisting of two dams on the north fork of the Skokomish River, two reservoirs, two powerhouses and transmission lines.

At oral argument, the Johnsons argued that there was evidence LCC and LCMC were not separate because the trustees of the companies were the same individuals. The Johnsons' only reference to piercing the corporate veil on summary judgment was at oral argument when they responded to LCMC's argument that it would be inappropriate to pierce the corporate veil here.

The deed and plat dedication are clear. The exclusive nature of the easement is clear.\" CP at 187. LCMC also argued at summary judgment that allowing the Johnsons \"use of the park property for any purpose other than using the park as a member community would substantially interfere with this easement.\" CP at 183. LCMC solely relied on the language in the easement document stating that LCC \"hereby declare[s] an easement for the exclusive use of the Lake Cushman Maintenance Co., its successors and assigns, for park and road purposes.\" CP at 151.

Over the past few years, LCMC has turned the park into a business. They are now selling passes that members can purchase that allow non-members access to our property (which includes the easement). There are a number of rentals that take advantage of this for the clients that purchase accommodations. In 2015 alone, LCMC issued 703 annual passes, 155 3-day passes, 359 1-day passes, 142 3-day boat launch passes, 221 1-day boat launch passes. The board has also given passes to employees of Tacoma Power, the fire department and who knows how many other non-members. This has increased traffic and use well beyond that which was contemplated in the easement, and has gotten to a point there [sic] LCMC cannot control the behavior of the users, thus resulting in a loss of enjoyment of, and damage to, our property.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    CP at 48.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    \u00b6 56 The Johnsons also filed a declaration of Mark Schomaker, who had leased a lot at Lake Cushman for approximately 24 years.

In Dave Curley's Declaration he copied the Articles of Incorporation, in which paragraph 10 states that LCMC will pay all taxes and assessments for parks and public areas. I do not believe they have paid any taxes on our lot in the past and I know they haven't paid taxes on it since our purchase. Paragraph 19 also states that they are not to operate the parks at a profit.

Matthew then stated how many passes the LCMC board had issued over the past few years and claimed that many of these passes were given to non-LCMC members. Finally, Matthew asserted that \"LCMC cannot control the behavior of the users, thus resulting in a loss of enjoyment of, and damage to, our property.\" CP at 48. In making these statements, Matthew provided no foundation as to his personal knowledge of the number of passes LCMC had issued nor did he provide any foundation as to his knowledge of who was using the passes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    \u00b6 64 The Johnsons argue that these statements were based on \"the personal knowledge Mr. Johnson has as an LCMC member, further supported by an exhibit LCMC submitted in its moving papers.\" Br. of Appellant at 22. However, Matthew never stated in his declaration that he was an LCMC member, nor did he state that as a member of LCMC he was aware of the number of annual passes the board distributed to members and nonmembers. In fact, in the paragraphs proceeding these statements, Matthew failed to even establish that the property he referred to was developed by LCC, leased by LCC, or managed by LCMC. His only references to the location of his leasehold interest was, \"We wanted property that would allow our kids, and someday grandkids, to experience the lake and wooded area around Cushman. We fell in love the second we looked onto the property in which we currently have a leasehold interest.\" CP at 47.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    \u00b6 65 Therefore, Matthew failed to provide adequate foundation in his declaration to establish that the property in which he held a leasehold interest was leased by LCC or managed by LCMC. Even had Matthew established these facts, he provided no foundation that he was a member of LCMC or that the members of LCMC had personal knowledge of the specific number of park passes the LCMC board distributed to members and nonmembers each year. Therefore, the superior court did not err in striking the challenged portion of Matthew's affidavit.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    \u00b6 66 The superior court also properly found that Matthew's statement that LCMC could not control the behavior of its users was outside of his personal knowledge, as required by CR 56(e). The Johnsons argue that these statements \"reflect[ed] personal knowledge based on Mr. Johnson's experience as an owner and user of the Property.\" Br. of Appellant at 22. However, the Johnsons failed to provide any foundation for how, as a user of the property, Matthew had personal knowledge as to what was within LCMC's control with regard to park users. Thus, we hold that the superior court did not err in striking this portion of Matthew's affidavit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    C. SCHOMAKER'S DECLARATION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    \u00b6 67 Again, \"[a] witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\" ER 602. Further, evidence which is not relevant is inadmissible. ER 402. Relevant evidence \"means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" ER 401.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    \u00b6 68 Here, the superior court ruled that Schomaker's statements were speculation, not based on personal knowledge, and specifically stated to be his personal beliefs. As in Matthew's affidavit, Schomaker failed to provide any foundation as to his knowledge of the annual park passes LCMC issued to non-members. Further, in the first two sentences of the challenged statements, Schomaker fails to offer testimony at all, but instead poses a question and then makes an argument based on another witness's testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    \u00b6 69 Nonetheless, Schomaker does have personal knowledge as to whether LCMC paid taxes on his property from the time he acquired his leasehold interest in the property. This information could have a tendency to make a fact regarding the scope and historical use of the easement more or less probable than it would be without this evidence. Therefore, Schomaker's statement that LCMC had not, to his knowledge, paid taxes from the time Schomaker acquired his leasehold interest was relevant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ER 401. Therefore, we hold that the superior court erred in striking this one sentence from the paragraph at issue in Schomaker's declaration. The superior court properly struck the remainder of the paragraph.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    \u00b6 70 The superior court did not err in dismissing the Johnsons' quiet title, trespass, waste, timber trespass, and injunction claims. The superior court also did not err in striking portions of Matthew's and Schomaker's affidavits.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    \u00b6 71 However, the superior court erred in quieting title in LCMC to an exclusive easement free and clear of any claim for use by the Johnsons because LCMC failed to show that there was no genuine issue of material fact that their easement was intended to be an exclusive easement. Because the superior court erred in quieting title in LCMC to an exclusive easement, the superior court also erred in enjoining the Johnsons, their heirs, executors, agents, and assigns from asserting any right, title, or interest in or to the exclusive easement quieted in LCMC. The superior court further erred in striking the portion of Schomaker's affidavit related to payment of taxes on the property.

LCMC's inability to provide evidence establishing intent does not sway this court in interpreting the deed as ambiguous.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-124\">\n     LCMC also moved to strike other portions of the Johnson and Schomaker declarations, as well as other submitted declarations, which the superior court granted. However, the Johnsons only assign error to the portion of the superior court's order striking the two paragraphs of Matthew and Schomaker's declarations quoted above.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"11\">\n    <p id=\"p-125\">\n     Under CR 56(e), affidavits supporting and opposing summary judgment \"shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"12\">\n    <p id=\"p-126\">\n     The superior court struck other portions of Matthew's declaration, but the Johnsons only challenge the portion of the order striking Matthew's references to the park passes and statements that LCMC could not control users' behavior.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"13\">\n    <p id=\"p-127\">\n     The superior court did not strike this statement from Matthew's declaration.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"14\">\n    <p id=\"p-128\">\n     Evidence of the number of annual park passes issued by the LCMC board was before the superior court through the declaration of David Curley, which was submitted by LCMC, along with documentation detailing the number of annual passes the LCMC board distributed. Therefore, even though we hold that the superior court did not err in striking Matthew's references to the annual park passes, this information remains in evidence before this court through Curley's declaration and accompanying documents.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
