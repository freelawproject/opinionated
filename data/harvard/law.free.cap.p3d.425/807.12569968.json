The trial judge in this case erred by dismissing an impaneled juror after multiple days of trial testimony when there was no evidence that the juror was biased. We must now decide the remedy for an erroneous dismissal of an impaneled juror. We hold that the defendant is entitled to a new trial if there is any reasonable possibility that the erroneous dismissal stemmed from the juror's views on the merits of the case. However, if an impaneled juror's dismissal does not stem from his or her view of the merits of the case but is nonetheless erroneous, no new trial will be granted if the State establishes that the error was harmless. Here, there is a reasonable\n   possibility that juror 12 was dismissed because of her views of the merits of the case. Sassen Van Elsloo is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Sassen Van Elsloo also appeals the sufficiency of evidence supporting a firearm enhancement. We hold that the State presented sufficient evidence to support the enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On September 7, 2012, while monitoring traffic, Bellingham police officer Lewis Leake saw a black Kia Sorrento make an illegal right turn. When Leake tried to stop the Kia, a chase ensued. When Leake overtook the Kia, he found it stopped in the middle of the road with the driver-side door open and the driver gone. A woman, Athena Aardema, was in the passenger seat and ultimately identified the driver as Adrian Sassen Van Elsloo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 The police permitted Aardema to leave the scene. While helping Aardema remove her belongings from the car, Officer Leake saw the handle of a shotgun. The police impounded the Kia and obtained a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 The search revealed a shotgun in the cargo hold. The search also revealed a digital scale, methamphetamine, 5 morphine pills, a pipe, a butane torch, 30 alprazolam pills, 67 clonazepam pills, seven small bags of heroin, a bill of sale with Sassen Van Elsloo's name, four prepaid cell phone cards, seven \"burner\" cell phones, gold jewelry, a bundle of 20 $1 bills, an iPad, the title for a 1990 Lincoln Town Car, a .38 revolver loaded with four bullets, a .22 pistol loaded with a magazine containing five bullets, six more rounds of ammunition, and a sock holding eight 12 gauge shotgun shells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 Three months later, Leake stopped a 1990 Lincoln Town Car driven by Sassen Van Elsloo. Sassen Van Elsloo was charged with nine felony counts relating to the earlier encounter. The State added firearm enhancements to five of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 At trial, Sassen Van Elsloo's defense theory was misidentification, supported by an alibi witness named Sharon Burton. Burton testified that Sassen Van Elsloo was at her home on the day of the incident and therefore could not have been driving the Kia on that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 Following Burton's testimony and cross-examination, juror 12 informed the bailiff that she recognized Burton from Burton's work with juror 12's nephew. Burton worked as an inpatient coordinator and a drug and alcohol counselor for the Lummi Nation. Juror 12 had met Burton when she went to the Lummi Business Council's \"CARE\" office, a chemical dependency treatment program for Lummi Nation tribal members, to obtain information that would help juror 12's nephew receive chemical dependency treatment services. Juror 12 had not recognized Burton's name on the juror questionnaire, but after seeing her testify, she recalled meeting Burton twice. Juror 12 said that she did not socialize with Burton, and that she would likely not remember Burton if she later saw her on the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 The trial court allowed the parties to question juror 12 about her experience with Burton. The prosecutor pressed juror 12 about whether she had a \"positive feeling\" toward Burton:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: ... So you just told us about asking Ms. Burton to help you with your nephew?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Was this able to help you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: Well, she got us the help for our nephew to go into treatment. We got the help, they paid for the treatment program and the bus ticket for him to go there and back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: So did you have a positive experience with her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: Well, I never did the intervention part of it because I left that up to my sister, his mother, and his siblings because he had four siblings, four sisters, so I kind of stepped back once my\n   family kind of got back into trying to help him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Right, l understand that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: Do I believe she was a positive person for him? I can't say that because I think what was more positive for my nephew is when he finally went to treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: My question is not so much about the nephew, but do you feel like, do you feel like it was a positive experience for you to deal with her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: I am not really sure....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Was there a negative experience at all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: No, there was no good or bad, it was just all, you know, normal as it would be trying to just get the help I wanted for my family member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Well ... it sounds to me like your nephew did get the help he needed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: You're pretty happy about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: So that's kind of a positive thing or positive feeling that you're having about Ms. Burton; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: Well it's not Ms. Burton, it's my nephew I'm more positive with. She wasn't inter-reacting with my nephew while he was gone or when he came back. It's more what he did for himself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: I understand that, but it sounds like you kind of intellectualized it. I mean you're talking about, I mean you had a pretty good feeling, you must have a pretty good feeling about Ms. Burton and how she helped you; isn't that fair?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: I guess. It's not, I wouldn't call it from her. I'd call it from our own community for the help so that's what your tribe is for is to try to help the funds with our community people that need the assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: What do you think about me cross-examining her, is that something that concerned you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: No, I just brought up that I think I knew her. I don't socialize with her or anything. I just kind of recognize her. I don't know her by name, or first name.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: I can tell you that if I was to see her again out on the road I probably won't remember her again any way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   5 Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (July 29, 2014) at 856-59. After questioning juror 12, the prosecutor could not point to any evidence of bias: \"Now, whether I can absolutely put a finger on that she can't be fair or whether what she says is about, what she says about being fair or not I think that's kind of beside[ ] the point.\" 5 VRP (July 29, 2014) at 860.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 10 The prosecutor sought dismissal nonetheless, claiming that Burton was an important witness for the defense and that \"if the jurors believe Ms. Burton then it's a big deal\" because \"that means my case goes nowhere.\" 5 VRP (July 29, 2014) at 860.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 11 Defense counsel objected to the motion, calling juror 12's interactions with Burton perfunctory and minimal, noting that juror 12 stated nothing about being unable to be fair, and pointing out that juror 12 was the only tribal member on the jury panel. The court acknowledged that it was a \"close case\" but dismissed juror 12 because \"Ms. Burton is a critical witness and even though there is not a real strong relationship between the juror and the witness I think given the importance of the witness's role in the case it's appropriate for juror 12 to be excused....\" 5 VRP (July 29, 2014) at 861.

VI ; WASH. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 22. This right exists throughout the entire trial process and is safeguarded in part by statutes and rules that require the trial judge to dismiss biased jurors. RCW 4.44.170 ; RCW 2.36.110 ; CrR 6.5. The operation of these statutes and rules depends on whether the juror is a potential, impaneled, or deliberating juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 17 \"Potential jurors\" are those who have been summoned for jury duty prior to the beginning of trial, have appeared, and have not been excused.

Thus, to determine the appropriate remedy when an impaneled juror is erroneously dismissed, we analyze the framework already established for remedying the erroneous dismissals of potential and deliberating jurors. In doing so, we conclude that prejudice exists when the erroneous dismissal of an impaneled juror stems from concern over the juror's views of the merits of the evidence presented, thus warranting a new trial. However, when the erroneous dismissal of an impaneled juror does not stem from concern over the juror's views of the merits of the evidence presented, no new trial is warranted if the State establishes that the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   A.

Therefore, Sassen Van Elsloo is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 63 Juror 12 repeatedly denied that she had positive feelings toward Burton because of their prior encounters, and the State failed to articulate any evidence that juror 12 was\n   biased or unfit to serve as a juror. Rather, the State argued that juror 12 should be dismissed because Burton was an important witness for the defense, that it \"just didn't feel fair,\" and that \"if the jurors believe Ms. Burton then it's a big deal.\" 5 VRP (July 29, 2014) at 860.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 64 The trial judge dismissed juror 12 not because she was biased but because of the importance of Burton's testimony to the success of the defendant's case. The trial judge stated, \"Counsel [for the State] points out correctly that Ms. Burton is a critical witness and even though there is not a real strong relationship between the juror and the witness[,] I think given the importance of the witness's role in the case it's appropriate for Juror 12 to be excused....\" 5 VRP (July 29, 2014) at 861.

For that reason, the midtrial dismissal of juror 12 amounts to constitutional error; the State has the burden of proving such error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the State has failed to carry that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 90 I therefore concur in the lead opinion's conclusion that we must reverse and remand for a new trial.

Instead of stopping, the Kia sped away and led Officer Leake on a chase. 1 VRP (July 22, 2014) at 85-89; 4 VRP (July 28, 2014) at 541-44. When the officer finally caught up to the Kia, it was stopped in the middle of the road with the driver's side door open and the driver gone. 1 VRP (July 22, 2014) at 90; 4 VRP (July 28, 2014) at 546-48. Inside the Kia was passenger Athena Aardema, who eventually identified the driver as Adrian Sassen Van Elsloo. 1 VRP (July 22, 2014) at 90-91; 4 VRP (July 28, 2014) at 550-51, 554-56, 684. After observing the handle of a shotgun inside the Kia, Officer Leake impounded the car. 4 VRP (July 28, 2014) at 558-60. When police searched the vehicle several days later, they found guns and ammunition, various drugs, a digital scale, and receipts for prepaid cell phones. 2 VRP (July 23, 2014) at 300-02, 305, 315-19, 324, 330, 337; 4 VRP (July 28, 2014) at 560-62, 566-67, 635, 659-64, 667-70. Several months later, the Whatcom County prosecutor charged Sassen Van Elsloo with nine felonies in connection with the weapons and contraband recovered from the Kia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 92 Sassen Van Elsloo's defense theory at trial was that he was not in the Kia at all-he was elsewhere. In support of that theory, he presented testimony by an alibi witness, Sharon Burton. 5 VRP (July 29, 2014) at 770-826. Burton testified that she was an inpatient coordinator and counselor for the Lummi Nation's drug and alcohol treatment program, that Aardema and Sassen Van Elsloo had a \"[v]ery volatile\" relationship, and that Sassen Van Elsloo had been at Burton's house on September 7, 2012-the day of the crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 770, 774-76. Burton remembered her activities that day because she had gone to the doctor in the morning, regarding complications from cataract surgery, and then called in sick for the rest of the day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 799. She testified that Sassen Van Elsloo started receiving phone calls at some point after 11:30 a.m. that day, and that the calls seemed to upset him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 780. On cross-examination, Burton was evasive about statements she made to investigators before trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 807-11. A written report about those statements indicated that she told investigators she was not sure whether she had arrived home in the late morning or the early afternoon on September 7, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 825, 881. Burton also admitted that she was lying down and resting for part of the time that she claimed Sassen Van Elsloo could not possibly have left her house and that Sassen Van Elsloo called her home several times from jail after his arrest on the charges in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 815-17. In short, Burton was a crucial, but imperfect, alibi witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 93 After Burton's testimony, juror 12 approached the bailiff and indicated that she\n   had previously met Burton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 853. The connection was so remote that juror 12 had not recognized Burton's name when it was mentioned on the juror questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 853, 859. The court questioned juror 12 and learned that she had met Burton at the Lummi Business Council's \"CARE\" office, a chemical dependency treatment program, where juror 12 went to provide information that would help juror 12's nephew obtain services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 854-55. Juror 12 said she believed she had met Burton \"maybe twice\" about two years before the trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 856. The prosecutor pressed juror 12 to admit that she had a \"positive experience\" or \"a pretty good feeling\" about Burton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 857-58.

RCW 2.36.110 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   It shall be the duty of a judge to excuse from further jury service any juror, who in the opinion of the judge, has manifested unfitness as a juror by reason of\n   <em>\n    bias, prejudice, indifference, inattention\n   </em>\n   or any physical or mental defect or by reason of conduct or practices incompatible with proper and efficient jury service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   (Emphasis added.) In other words, a juror cannot be dismissed just to be sure they don't lean too far toward believing one witness or another. A seated juror can be discharged or excused only for specific reasons like bias, prejudice, inability to perform, and the like.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6 101 The lead opinion is correct that chapter 2.36 RCW does not define the main term at issue here, \"bias.\" Lead opinion at 814-16. In this case, however, it is unnecessary to determine the specific contours of the bias required for dismissal. The reason is that there is no indication that juror 12 harbored any bias at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6 102 The trial judge basically acknowledged this. She agreed with defense counsel's statement that \"[juror 12] stated nothing about how she couldn't be fair or that she had any feeling one way or another\" and concluded that juror 12 should instead be dismissed because the alibi witness was so important. 5 VRP (July 29, 2014) at 861.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6 103 Indeed, despite repeated questioning by the State, juror 12 clearly stated that she did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have positive feelings about alibi witness Burton. Instead, her brief prior interaction with Burton gave her only positive feelings for her tribe, the Lummi Nation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   [STATE]: So did you have a positive experience with her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   JUROR NO. 12: Do I believe she was a positive person for him?

This record, as discussed by the lead opinion, shows that juror 12 was indifferent to Burton. Lead opinion at 816 (\"Juror 12 made it clear that her interactions with Burton were neither positive nor negative, despite being asked four times by the prosecutor whether she had positive feelings toward Burton.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   \u00b6 104 As the lead opinion concludes, indifference toward a witness does not justify dismissal under the governing statute, RCW 2.36.110.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 816.

Adrian Sassen Van Elsloo has no constitutional right to a particular juror, and he made no objection to the jury panel that ultimately decided his case. Absent a showing of prejudice by Van Elsloo, his conviction must be affirmed. The lead opinion goes astray by shifting the burden to the State to establish harmless error, on the premise that the erroneous removal of an empaneled juror implicates the same constitutional interests as when a deliberating juror is removed for reasons that possibly stem from the juror's \"views of the merits of the case.\" Lead opinion at 812. The two situations are, in fact, quite different. Courts properly inquire into juror bias during voir dire and when issues arise midtrial to make certain that potential\n   and empaneled jurors can fairly and impartially decide the case. If jurors express \"views of the merits of the case\" before hearing all the evidence, they should not serve. Once jury deliberations commence, however, courts must proceed with caution because calls to remove a particular juror for misconduct might implicate the juror's views about the case based on the evidence, for example, if the juror seems to be a \"holdout.\" Caution in removing a deliberating juror is thus necessary to safeguard the defendant's constitutional right to an impartial jury and to a unanimous verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   \u00b6 126 When questions of juror bias arise midtrial, as here, the trial court's decision whether to replace a juror with an alternate is governed by RCW 2.36.110 and CrR 6.5. The court exercises considerable discretion. While this discretion may be abused when a juror is removed without a sufficient showing of bias, the error should be treated the same as any erroneous dismissal of an empaneled juror, for example dismissal of the wrong alternate juror. In such instances, prejudice is not presumed but must be shown by the complaining party. Because Van Elsloo makes no attempt to demonstrate any prejudice, I would affirm the Court of Appeals and uphold his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   I.

Instead, the lead opinion presumes prejudice and places the burden on the State to show harmless error. As explained below, this new approach is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   II. The Lead Opinion Improperly Shifts the Defendant's Burden To Show Prejudice, Instead Requiring the State To Show Harmless Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   \u00b6 132 In presuming prejudice and burdening the State with showing harmlessness, the lead opinion reasons that the removal of juror 12 implicated Van Elsloo's Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial and to a unanimous verdict in much the same way that removing a deliberating juror might. Thus, it holds that prejudice is presumed and the State bears the burden of showing that the removal of juror 12 was harmless error. This holding reflects a misunderstanding of our precedent and of the facts in this case. Moreover, the new rule the lead opinion announces relies on a decision from another jurisdiction that was not cited by the parties and rests on entirely different circumstances and procedural rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   \u00b6 133 The lead opinion invokes the \"reasonable possibility\" standard of\n   <em>\n    Elmore,\n   </em>\n   which states that \"where a deliberating juror is accused of refusing to follow the law, that juror cannot be dismissed when there is any reasonable possibility that his or her views stem from an evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence.\" 155 Wash.2d at 778,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20P.3d%2072\">\n    123 P.3d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The concern is that claims of juror misconduct during deliberations might mask disagreements between the target juror and the rest of the panel, such that removal of the juror would violate the defendant's right to a unanimous decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   \u00b6 134 There is an obvious difference between such claims of juror misconduct during deliberations and claims that a potential or empaneled juror is biased or prejudiced. The lead opinion appears to equate \"bias\" with the juror's \"views of the merits of the case.\" Prior to the commencement of deliberations, the trial court has an ongoing obligation to assure that the jurors who ultimately decide the case can do so fairly and impartially. If they are biased or prejudiced-i.e., if they have preconceived \"views of the merits of the case\"-they should not serve. By equating\n   impermissible juror bias with the protected views of a deliberating juror, the lead opinion completely undermines a central purpose of RCW 2.36.110 and CrR 6.5, to remove and replace biased jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   \u00b6 135 The lead opinion also misunderstands the facts of this case. It acknowledges that juror 12 was challenged after she indicated her past interactions with a key witness in the case. The question was whether her acquaintance with the witness would hinder her ability to be a fair and impartial juror. Under RCW 2.36.110 and CrR 6.5, if the answer to this question was yes, then the trial court unquestionably should have removed the juror. But, it appears the trial court answered no to the critical question of bias.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   lead opinion at 816 (\"The record indicates that juror 12 was dismissed because Burton was a critical witness for the defense, not because juror 12 displayed actual bias.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20P.3d%2072\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[T]he record contains no indication that juror 12 formed an opinion about Burton or that such opinion would prevent her from trying the case impartially.

An unobjectionable alternate juror was sworn in, and the trial continued. The lead opinion points to no incidence in the record where the court offered the remaining jurors any opinions on the credibility of witnesses, sufficiency of the evidence, or \"views of the merits of the case.\" Nor does it reference in the record where juror 12 did so.
