We today hold that plaintiffs cannot assert a negligence claim based solely on an officer's intentional use of physical force. The appropriate state-law claim is for battery, and an officer asserting the justification defense set forth in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-409 bears the burden of proof on that issue. Plaintiffs may, however, base a negligence claim on conduct by the officer that is independent of the intentional use of physical force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 We also hold that at trial on such a battery claim, expert witnesses cannot suggest to the jury that\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

Experts may explain their reliance on the factors, as appropriate, but should not imply by mentioning their source that these factors legally control the jury's determination of justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Brian McDonald was driving in Tucson late one evening when he swerved into the opposite lane and nearly collided with a patrol car driven by Pima County Sheriff's Deputy Matthew Dixon. Activating his siren and flashing lights, Dixon made a U-turn and pursued McDonald. McDonald did not immediately stop, and Dixon called for assistance. Other deputies placed traffic spikes in McDonald's projected path, but he pulled over before hitting them. Dixon stopped and, treating the encounter as high-risk, shouted at McDonald to show his hands and throw out the car keys. Although McDonald's window was down, he did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 More deputies, including Deputy Joseph Klein and his police dog, Barry, arrived at the scene. Barry was trained to \"bite and hold\" on command to assist officers in apprehending suspects. Klein assumed command and warned McDonald he would \"send [his] dog\" unless McDonald started talking. McDonald responded by rolling up his window and driving towards the spikes with the deputies giving chase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Pursuing, Klein announced over the police radio that if McDonald \"went mobile,\" after the spikes stopped his car, Klein would deploy Barry. McDonald's car ran over the spikes, hopped a curb, and stopped. McDonald staggered from the car and walked around the back toward the passenger side while leaning on the car for support. Klein got out of his patrol car with Barry and warned McDonald, \"stop or you will be bitten.\" When McDonald reached the passenger-side door, he stopped and put his hands on the roof of the car. According to Klein, he intentionally released Barry the instant before McDonald placed his hands on the top of the car. Barry bit McDonald's leg and held onto it between twenty-five and thirty-eight seconds until Klein ordered the dog to release. McDonald suffered severe injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Authorities later learned that McDonald had type 1 diabetes and, at the time of the\n   events here, was experiencing a severe hypoglycemic event. As a result, he lacked cognitive function to understand what was happening or respond to police commands. The state did not pursue criminal charges against McDonald.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 McDonald sued Klein and the Pima County Sheriff (\"Defendants\"), alleging that Klein \"negligently released\" Barry and that use of the dog \"constituted a negligent, unjustified, and excessive use of force.\" McDonald's claim against the Pima County Sheriff was based solely on vicarious liability. (The trial court granted summary judgment against McDonald on two additional claims, including a claim that the Pima County Sheriff \"failed to promulgate appropriate and adequate policies and procedures.\" That ruling is not at issue here.) McDonald did not assert claims for battery or for deprivation of rights under \u00a7 1983. Instead, as related at oral argument before this Court, McDonald deliberately decided to assert only a negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Klein's intentional use of force could not constitute negligence. The trial court denied the motion two weeks before trial, ruling that McDonald could pursue a claim for \"negligent use of force\" despite Klein's intentional decision to release Barry against McDonald. The court correctly noted that law enforcement officers can be liable for negligent acts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clouse ex rel. Clouse v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186764\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/196/\">\n    199 Ariz. 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198 \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186764\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/196/\">\n    16 P.3d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759 (2001), but did not otherwise explain its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 At trial, the primary issues were whether Klein acted negligently in releasing Barry and, if so, whether he was legally justified in doing so, thereby relieving Defendants of liability pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-409, -413. Over Defendants' objection, the court permitted evidence of factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , in the Fourth Amendment context, to assess the reasonableness of police force. The court also instructed the jury that Defendants bore the burden of proving that Klein's release of Barry was justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The jury found in favor of McDonald and awarded him $617,500 in damages but found him five percent at fault. Defendants unsuccessfully moved for a new trial, asserting that the court improperly instructed the jury on negligence, incorrectly admitted evidence of the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors, and incorrectly instructed the jury that Defendants bore the burden of proving justification under \u00a7 13-409.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 The court of appeals affirmed in a split decision.\n   <em>\n    Ryan v.

It declined to \"decide whether Arizona law recognizes a separate tort of negligent use of excessive force.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20330\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 282 \u00b6 19 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20330\">\n    406 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   335 n.6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the court concluded that McDonald could recover damages under a negligence claim for \"Klein's\n   <em>\n    evaluation of whether\n   </em>\n   to intentionally release [Barry],\" which the court found distinct from a battery claim based on Klein's intentional release of the dog.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20330\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 282 \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20330\">\n    406 P.3d at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also determined that the justification defense under \u00a7\u00a7 13-409, -413 did not apply to negligence claims, meaning that if Klein negligently released Barry, he was not privileged to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20330\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 283 \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20P.3d%20330\">\n    406 P.3d at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

McCarver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1327381\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/208/219/\">\n    208 Ariz. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224 \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1327381\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/208/219/\">\n    92 P.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 854 (2004) (stating that in negligence cases, \"the duty is always the same[:] to conform to the legal standard of reasonable conduct in the light of the apparent risk\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ). The jury has no reason to again consider reasonableness in the context of the justification defense, and it could be confused if asked to do so. If the claim is based on a negligent act preceding an intentional use of force, the justification defense would be immaterial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-409 (authorizing the justification defense only for acts of \"threatening or using physical force against another\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b637 The inapplicability of the justification defense in negligence actions is demonstrated by considering hypothetical scenarios drawn from this case. If McDonald had asserted negligence based on evidence that Klein unintentionally dropped Barry's leash, and the jury found this occurred, it then would have found that Klein either did or did not act reasonably. If the former, the negligence claim would fail without the need to consider the justification defense. If the latter, Klein's unreasonable conduct could not have been justified. In other words, the jury's determination that Klein acted unreasonably would preclude a finding under \u00a7 13-409 that his conduct met that statute's reasonableness requirements and was therefore justified. Similarly, had McDonald asserted that Klein was negligent in a distinct act preceding his intentional release of Barry, such as failing to properly train the dog on\n   when to release the bite, the justification defense would not excuse this conduct. In that scenario, the negligent act was Klein's training and not the use of force, so \u00a7 13-409 would not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b638 Based on the foregoing, a trial court should not instruct a jury on the justification defense under \u00a7 13-409 if the only claim against the law enforcement officer is negligence. If a claim is also made for battery, the court should instruct on the justification defense but explain that the defense applies only to the battery claim to avoid juror confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The statute provides that a defendant must prove any affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, but then excludes justification defenses from the category of affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-103(B) (\"Affirmative defense does not include any justification defense.\"). This language supports Defendants' view that the legislature intended to displace the common law principle that justification defenses are affirmative defenses, which defendants bear the burden of proving in civil cases. In contrast, the last sentence of \u00a7 13-205 explicitly places the burden of proving justification in criminal cases on the state but is silent on who bears the burden in civil cases. This language supports McDonald's view that the legislature did not intend to upend the common law regarding the burden of proof in civil cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b643 We agree with McDonald that \u00a7 13-205 did not change the common law precept that defendants bear the burden of proving\n   justification in civil cases. First, nothing in the language of \u00a7 13-205 or its legislative history suggests that the legislature intended to place the burden on plaintiffs in civil cases to disprove justification. The statute was amended by passage of Senate Bill 1145, which added several provisions to our criminal code pertaining to affirmative defenses and justification defenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2006 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 199 (2d Reg. Sess.). The primary focus of SB 1145 was the addition of laws concerning self-defense and home protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. State Sen. Fact Sheet for S.B. 1145, 47th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (June 27, 2006). It also codified the common law principle that if a defendant presents some evidence of justification in a criminal case, the state bears the burden of proving a lack of justification. But there was no mention of civil liability in Senate Bill 1145 or in its legislative history. We expect that the legislature would have been explicit if it intended to change the common law view that defendants bear the burden of proving justification defenses in civil cases.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Louis C. v.

Removing justification defenses from that definition in criminal cases does not impact the common law treatment of justification defenses in civil cases as affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b645 Third, as pertinent here, placing the burden on law enforcement officers in civil cases to prove the \u00a7 13-409 justification defense aligns with the burden placed on them to prove non-statutory justification defenses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Whitlock v.

To do so, the defendant may use any applicable presumption set forth in \u00a7 12-716, which sets forth presumptions concerning crime victims and law enforcement officers. If a presumption applies, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence to rebut the presumption, although the defendant retains the burden of persuasion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.
