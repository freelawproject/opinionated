The issues raised by the claimant can be summarized as whether the physical assault that caused Carlos Ibarra's injuries \"arose out of\" his employment. We hold: (1) an assault is caused by the relations and conditions of the employment (the \"friction and strain\" of the employment) when the claimant and the other party to the assault have no personal contact outside of the employment, regardless of whether other job-related factors exist; and (2) the passage of time between an original dispute and an assault, known as a \"cooling off\" period, is not material to the question of whether the assault was work related when parties have no personal relationship outside of employment and all interactions between them occurred at work. We set aside the award and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 Ibarra worked for the respondent employer, Arizona Department of Corrections (\"ADOC\"), as a correctional officer. He was injured during a fight with Jihad Bilal, another correctional officer at the prison. He filed a workers' compensation claim for injuries sustained during the altercation. The claim was denied for benefits by the respondent carrier, State of Arizona, and Ibarra timely requested a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 The ALJ heard testimony from Ibarra, two other correctional officers, and three supervisory officers. Ibarra and Bilal testified they have known each other for at least four years. The men had a history of hostile work-related interactions culminating in a fight on August 11, 2016. They have never socialized, or even spoken to each other, outside of work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Testimony about six incidents between Ibarra and Bilal was presented. The first incident occurred shortly after Ibarra began working at ADOC's Meadows Unit in 2012, when Bilal refused to assist Ibarra and correctional officer Travis Murty in performing \"roll-ups,\" i.e., preparing inmates for the following day's activities. After that incident, Ibarra asked his supervisor, Sergeant Babeu, not to post him with Bilal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Sergeant Babeu continued to post Ibarra with Bilal and the second incident occurred in a prison control room. Ibarra testified that Bilal asked him many personal questions about his family: where his mother worked, where his sister worked, lived, and went to school, etc. Officer Murty, who was also present at the control room, testified that Bilal insinuated he wanted to have sexual relations with Ibarra's sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 The third incident occurred when Ibarra was working in the prison yard. Ibarra asked another officer to bring him a gate key. According to Ibarra, Bilal unilaterally left his assigned post to retrieve the key and verbally abused Ibarra in the process. Ibarra subsequently informed Lieutenant Perron about his difficulties with Bilal. In response, Perron directed Ibarra to speak to his direct supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 The fourth incident occurred in May 2015. While walking down a narrow hallway during a shift change, Ibarra met Bilal and Lieutenant Perron coming from the opposite direction. Ibarra testified that Bilal intentionally bumped into him hard enough to cause him to stumble into the wall. Perron testified he was aware Ibarra and Bilal had a \"personal issue,\" but denied having witnessed this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 The fifth incident between Ibarra and Bilal occurred in September 2015 in a briefing room. To address the hostile relationship, Ibarra approached Bilal and inquired what Bilal's problem was with him and if it could be resolved. In response, Bilal became loud and abusive. Although two supervisory officers, Lieutenant McClellan and Sergeant Bolf, were also present, neither supervisor recalled the incident. Also present was Officer Murty; he testified the argument started because Bilal was staring at Ibarra and made negative comments about Ibarra \"still living with his mother.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 The final altercation between Ibarra and Bilal occurred on August 11, 2016. At the end of a shift, an officer comes to an ADOC building's control room and picks up count sheets, which account for all inmates in the building. That night, Bilal came to pick up the count sheets from Ibarra, who was at his post in the control room. Ibarra did not know that Bilal would be picking up the sheets until he opened the control room door and saw Bilal. As he handed Bilal the count sheets, Bilal struck Ibarra in the face and said, \"what are you gonna do now bitch?\" Ibarra defended himself and a fight ensued. When the fight finally broke up, Bilal radioed for help, and Ibarra was taken to a hospital. There is no dispute that Ibarra was injured during the fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 Sergeant Bolf testified he responded to Bilal's radio call about the fight. Soon thereafter, he interviewed both officers and each blamed the other for the altercation. Bilal denied any previous hostile interactions occurred between the two men; he also stated he did not initiate the assault, but merely defended himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 After the hearing, the ALJ determined that the assault was not work related and thus not compensable. Although Ibarra timely requested administrative review, the ALJ supplemented and affirmed the decision. Ibarra then filed this statutory special action. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") sections 12-120.21(A)(2) and 23-951(A), and Arizona Rule of Procedure for Special Actions 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 We defer to the ALJ's factual findings,\n   <em>\n    Young v.

The ALJ considered each of Ibarra's six enumerated incidents with Bilal and concluded that, except for the initial \"roll-ups\" incident, each subsequent incident was personal in nature and, thus, not work-related. We disagree with the ALJ's legal conclusion about the classification of the incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 To establish a compensable claim, Ibarra had the burden of proving he had sustained an injury by accident \"arising out of\" and \"in the course of\" his employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1021. \"Arising out of\" refers to the origin or cause of the injury, while \"in the course of\" refers to the time, place, and circumstances of the injury in relation to the employment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Peter Kiewit Sons' Co. v.
