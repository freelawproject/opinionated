In\n   2010 or 2011, Wiard was working in the planer department when she was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). At that time, Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. (Liberty) provided Tricon with workers' compensation insurance coverage. Liberty accepted liability for Wiard's CTS as an occupational disease (OD) in August 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Wiard transferred to a different job position at Tricon and her CTS symptoms largely dissipated. She used over-the-counter pain medication, ceased wearing wrist braces, and did not seek additional treatment for her CTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In 2012 or early 2013, Wiard again changed jobs at Tricon, moving into a grader position, which she found more mentally and physically demanding than her previous positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On November 1, 2013, Liberty ceased providing workers' compensation insurance coverage for Tricon. State Fund then became Tricon's workers' compensation insurance provider and remained Tricon's insurer for the remainder of the time relevant to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 After Wiard had worked in the grader position for some time, she began working longer and more frequent shifts. She was having pain in her left hand, but was unable to take time off work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Wiard sought medical treatment for bilateral wrist pain on\n   February 17, 2014. She was taken off work and scheduled for follow-up care. However, her condition worsened and she went to an emergency room later that night, complaining of severe right-wrist pain radiating into her shoulder. She was diagnosed with an acute exacerbation of CTS, given medications, and referred to an orthopedic surgeon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 On February 19, 2014, Wiard went to another emergency room, complaining of pain in her left hand. Michael Righetti, MD, diagnosed Wiard with an acute exacerbation of chronic left CTS. Due to the severity of her symptoms, Dr. Righetti performed an emergency carpal tunnel release on her left wrist that day. He then performed a carpal tunnel release on Wiard's right wrist in March 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Wiard filed an OD claim for left CTS with State Fund. State Fund denied the claim, asserting that her OD diagnosis preceded State Fund's insurance coverage. Wiard then submitted her claim to Liberty, who denied liability on the basis that State Fund was now liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 State Fund paid Wiard's benefits pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-407(8), MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The insurers then filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of liability in the WCC. The WCC granted summary judgment in favor of Liberty. The court concluded Wiard had reached maximum medical improvement from her earlier CTS diagnosis, and that her later job duties materially aggravated her OD. State Fund appeals from the grant of summary judgment in Liberty's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 We review the WCC's conclusions of law for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

These provisions state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (13) When compensation is payable for an occupational disease, the only employer liable is the employer in whose employment\n   the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazard of the disease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (14) When there is more than one insurer and only one employer at the time that the employee was injuriously exposed to the hazard of the disease, the liability rests with the insurer providing coverage at the earlier of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (a) the time that the occupational disease was first diagnosed by a health care provider; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (b) the time that the employee knew or should have known that the condition was the result of an occupational disease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 In this case, there is more than one insurer-Liberty and State Fund-and only one employer: Tricon. There is no dispute that Wiard was injuriously exposed to the hazard of the disease while in Tricon's employ. State Fund argues, therefore, that under \u00a7 39-71-407(14), MCA, liability would rest with Liberty, since it was the insurer providing coverage at the time the OD was first diagnosed by a healthcare provider, as well as at the time Wiard knew her condition was the result of an OD. However, the WCC determined that State Fund's reliance on \u00a7 39-71-407(14), MCA, was misplaced. Rather than applying the statute, the WCC ruled that the attribution of liability for recurrence of an OD condition is based on two factors: (1) maximum medical improvement; and (2) causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 In reaching its conclusion, the WCC relied upon several cases in which liability was determined by application of the last injurious exposure rule:\n   <em>\n    Liberty Northwest Ins.

In\n   <em>\n    In re Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , a worker developed an OD after having been arguably exposed to the hazard of the OD among multiple employers. We distinguished that scenario from those situations in which a worker was diagnosed with an OD and then later suffered from symptoms which arguably arose from that OD-a scenario where, as we explained, \"an OD has already been diagnosed, liability for the OD has been determined, and the question is whether a recurrence of the OD condition is attributable to the original employer or is attributable to a second employer based on an intervening exposure to the hazard of the OD....\" We held that in such situations, the analysis established in\n   <em>\n    Caekaert\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lanes\n   </em>\n   determines liability.\n   <em>\n    In re Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24. Since Wiard had already been diagnosed with the OD of CTS, the WCC used\n   the\n   <em>\n    Caekaert\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lanes\n   </em>\n   analysis to determine liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 State Fund argues that the WCC misapprehended the significance of\n   <em>\n    In re Mitchell's\n   </em>\n   distinction when it focused on whether an OD had been previously diagnosed-rather than whether the worker had had more than one employer-in determining whether to analyze Wiard's case under \u00a7 39-71-407(13), MCA, or \u00a7 39-71-407(14), MCA. Since Wiard had only one employer, State Fund contends that\n   <em>\n    Caekaert\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lanes\n   </em>\n   does not apply and liability is properly determined under \u00a7 39-71-407(14), MCA.

In 1994, he developed an OD in his back, and Cereal Food's then-insurer, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Nationwide) accepted liability.\n   <em>\n    Abfalder\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. Abfalder continued working, but suffered periodic flare-ups of his back problems. After Cereal Food increased the physical demands of Abfalder's job, the company laid him off because the requirements exceeded his work restrictions. By the time Abfalder was laid off, Travelers Indemnity Company of Illinois had become Cereal Food's insurer.\n   <em>\n    Abfalder\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7. While the insurers agreed Abfalder's OD was compensable, they disagreed as to which was liable.\n   <em>\n    Abfalder\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 The WCC determined that Nationwide was the liable insurer. We affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Abfalder\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2. In so doing, we specifically distinguished\n   <em>\n    Abfalder's\n   </em>\n   facts from cases which involved two employers, holding that \u00a7 39-72-303(2), MCA, applies to situations in which there is more than one insurer but only one employer.\n   <em>\n    Abfalder\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14.

Fuss was diagnosed with a respiratory OD in 1997, at which time Insurance Company of North America (ICNA) insured his employer for workers' compensation. Fuss sought additional medical treatment for the OD in 2002, at which time Valor Insurance Company, Inc. (Valor), insured his employer. ICNA argued that it should not be liable for the 2002 recurrence. The WCC disagreed. Relying on our holding in\n   <em>\n    Abfalder\n   </em>\n   , the WCC ruled, \"To shift liability to Valor, however, ICNA must demonstrate that claimant suffered a\n   <em>\n    new and different\n   </em>\n   occupational disease while Valor was at risk. It is not enough that the occupational disease for which ICNA is otherwise liable worsened during Valor's watch, or even that his work under Valor's watch materially aggravated his underlying disease.\"\n   <em>\n    Fuss\n   </em>\n   , 2003 MTWCC 68, \u00b6 19 (emphasis in original).

At that time, Caekaert worked for Frank Wilson Plumbing and Heating (Wilson) and concurrently owned and operated a poultry business. Wilson was insured by State Fund, which accepted liability. Although Caekaert underwent surgery for his CTS in 1988, it did not resolve his condition.

In those instances, we applied \u00a7 39-72-303(1), MCA -now codified as \u00a7 39-71-407(13), MCA -to determine liability. In all four cases, the worker developed an OD, and then allegedly experienced a recurrence or aggravation of the OD. What distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Abfalder\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fuss\n   </em>\n   from\n   <em>\n    Caekaert\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lanes\n   </em>\n   -and therefore requires different analyses-is the number of employers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 27 The determinative facts of this case are directly on point with\n   <em>\n    Abfalder\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fuss\n   </em>\n   -the injured worker experienced a recurrence or aggravation of the same OD while working for the same employer-and fall squarely within the application of \u00a7 39-71-407(14), MCA. Nevertheless, the WCC concluded that State Fund was liable for the recurrence of Wiard's OD on the basis that State Fund failed to prove that Wiard did not reach maximum medical improvement for her 2011 condition before her 2014 exacerbation, or that her 2014 exacerbation was the direct and natural result of her 2011 condition. The WCC reasoned, \"It is not enough to contend, as State Fund does, that Liberty is liable for Wiard's recurrent condition because it is the same condition for which Liberty previously accepted liability. As the Supreme Court demonstrated in\n   <em>\n    Caekaert\n   </em>\n   , even when the OD remains the same, it is the cause of the recurrence that is key.\" However, the cause of an OD's recurrence is key only when the injured worker has worked for multiple employers and it is necessary to determine \"the employer in whose employment the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazard of the disease.\" Section 39-71-407(13), MCA. The flaw in the WCC's reasoning is that it applies an analysis designed to ascertain last injurious exposure for purposes of assigning liability among multiple employers under \u00a7 39-71-407(13), MCA, when the facts of this case-same employer and same OD-require the application of \u00a7 39-71-407(14), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 28 Whether Wiard had reached maximum medical improvement and whether she sustained a material aggravation to her underlying OD, while relevant to a determination of liability in a multiple-employer scenario such as\n   <em>\n    Caekaert\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lanes\n   </em>\n   , are irrelevant when determining liability in a single-employer, multiple-insurer scenario. As the WCC noted in\n   <em>\n    Fuss\n   </em>\n   , a worsening or material aggravation of the underlying disease is insufficient to shift liability; in a single-employer, multiple-insurer scenario, the only way the originally liable insurer can avoid liability is if it demonstrates that the injured worker is suffering from a new and different OD.\n   <em>\n    Fuss\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. There is no dispute here that Wiard is not suffering from a new and different OD. She is suffering from a recurrence of the same OD, while working for the same employer. The WCC's determination that Wiard's later work materially aggravated her CTS is insufficient to shift liability from Liberty to State Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 29 The Workers' Compensation Court erred when it held that \u00a7 39-71-407(14), MCA, does not apply for purposes of determining liability for the exacerbation of\n   Wiard's OD. Section 39-71-407(14), MCA, applies to the instant case and thus liability for the OD remains with the insurer providing coverage at the time the OD was first diagnosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 30 Reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   DIRK M.
