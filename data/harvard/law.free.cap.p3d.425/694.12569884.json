A Hill County jury found Larsen guilty on both counts. The Twelfth Judicial District Court sentenced Larsen as a Persistent Felony Offender (PFO) to ten years in Montana State Prison, with none suspended, for the felony conviction. Larsen raises three issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did trial counsel provide ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress evidence found during the search incident to arrest because Larsen's initial arrest was illegal?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    2. Did trial counsel provide ineffective assistance by incorrectly advising the District Court that Larsen's sentence could not be deferred or suspended?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    3. Does the sentence illegally include multiple court information technology (\"I.T.\") fees?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We affirm Larsen's conviction, but reverse Larsen's sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the morning of October 5, 2014, Officer Jesse Eller of the Havre Police Department saw Larsen and Robert Sunchild walking down an alley. He recognized both men from prior contacts and knew that Larsen was out on bond for pending charges. The conditions of Larsen's release order prohibited him from having contact with victims or witnesses related to his pending charges. The order stated that Larsen was \"subject to immediate arrest upon violation of these conditions, and a hearing will thereafter be set.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Eller\n   confirmed through dispatch that Larsen was not allowed to have contact with Sunchild as a condition of his bond. Officer Eller approached Larsen and asked Larsen directly whether he was permitted to have contact with Sunchild. Larsen confirmed that his bond conditions prohibited him from having contact with Sunchild. Officer Eller directed Sunchild to leave the area and told Larsen that he was under arrest \"for violation of conditions of release.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b62 After arresting Larsen, Officer Eller conducted a search incident to arrest. Knowing that Larsen was diabetic, he asked if Larsen had any needles on him. Larsen stated that there was a needle in his right sock, which Officer Eller found. Officer Eller testified that he observed a plastic bag protruding from the front pocket of the hooded sweatshirt Larsen was wearing. As Officer Eller reached into the pocket to retrieve the plastic bag, Larsen stated that it was not his sweatshirt. Officer Eller found what was later confirmed as marijuana buds in the plastic bag. He also found a vile containing a small quantity of a white powdery substance, later confirmed as methamphetamine, in the sweatshirt pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 The State charged Larsen with misdemeanor criminal possession of dangerous drugs under \u00a7 45-9-102(2), MCA, for the marijuana and with felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs under \u00a7 45-9-102(3), MCA, for the methamphetamine. The State also sought PFO status. This was Larsen's second designation as a PFO, subjecting him to sentencing under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA (2013).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the omnibus hearing before trial, defense counsel did not move to suppress physical evidence gathered during the search incident to arrest and left blank the portions of the omnibus hearing memorandum pertaining to suppressing physical evidence due to illegal search and seizure or illegal arrest. During trial, the District Court admitted the evidence from the search without objection from Larsen. The jury convicted Larsen of both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 During sentencing, Larsen spoke on his own behalf and asked the court for credit for time served and a suspended sentence with a recommendation to participate in treatment court. He reasoned that it was a non-violent possession charge and that \"they have that\n   opportunity here now ... that they did not then on, you know, drug related crimes.\" Larsen's counsel, however, told the court that the \"bare minimum\" sentence was ten\n   years without suspension or deferment. The District Court asked defense counsel, \"Now, you tell me to give him the mandatory minimum. Do you agree that that's ten years? That I cannot suspend or defer a ten-year sentence.\" Defense counsel replied, \"Unfortunately, I do agree that it is, your Honor.\" After hearing testimony and arguments, the District Court sentenced Larsen to ten years. The District Court repeatedly stated its dissatisfaction with this sentence. During the hearing, the District Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I do find that that sentencing guideline is inconsistent with the term of this sentence that I must give in this case. That, I will put on the record, that I find that a ten-year sentence for simple possession, which is what this is, simple possession, is inappropriate. Now, that's not taking into consideration your history, obviously. Once I've taken that into consideration, then I must do it. I must give that as a sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After announcing the sentence, the District Court stated, \"I want it clear that I would not impose a sentence for criminal possession on a felony or a misdemeanor on this, if were [sic] it not for the PFO statute.\" And in the written sentence, the District Court wrote under the reasons for the sentence, \"This is an unfortunate circumstance, but the Court has no choice since it is required by Persistent Felony Offender status.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b65 The written judgment imposed a separate court information technology fee on each conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b66 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Did trial counsel provide ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress evidence found during the search incident to arrest because Larsen's initial arrest was illegal?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b610 Larsen argues that his counsel was ineffective because there was \"no plausible justification\" to not file a motion to suppress the evidence found during the search\n   incident to arrest based on the unlawfulness of the arrest itself. Larsen contends that violating the conditions of release is not a lawful basis for a warrantless arrest because \u00a7 46-6-311(1), MCA, allows an officer to arrest a person without a warrant only \"if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person is committing an offense or that the person has committed an offense and existing circumstances require immediate arrest.\" Larsen argues that violating the conditions of his bond is not itself an \"offense\" under the statutory definition or an independent basis for criminal contempt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 46-1-202(15), 45-7-309(1)(c), MCA. Therefore, Officer Eller had no probable cause to initiate a warrantless arrest under \u00a7 46-6-311(1), MCA, and was required to first obtain a warrant under \u00a7\u00a7 46-9-503 and -505, MCA. Larsen argues that because the motion to\n   suppress would have been successful, his trial counsel had no plausible justification not to file the motion and was therefore ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b611 The State counters that \u00a7\u00a7 46-9-503 and -505, MCA, do not provide the exclusive mechanisms for arresting a person who violates a condition of bail or release. Further, the State argues that Officer Eller did have probable cause to arrest Larsen without a warrant for committing criminal contempt under \u00a7 45-7-309(1)(c), MCA. The motion to suppress therefore would not be obviously meritorious or arguably successful. The State concludes that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is inappropriate on direct appeal because there are plausible justifications for counsel's failure to file the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b612 Larsen bears a heavy burden in bringing this non-record-based claim. Trial counsel is afforded considerable latitude, and Larsen \"must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances,\" counsel's decision could be considered a sound strategy.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Since\n   <em>\n    Letasky\n   </em>\n   , we have not addressed directly whether a defendant may be charged with criminal contempt for violating bail conditions. But the bail order releasing Larsen pending trial on the earlier charge stated that he was \"subject to immediate arrest upon violation of these conditions.\" Counsel likely was aware of this order and would have had to mount a collateral attack against the order's \"immediate arrest\" provision to challenge the search incident to his arrest that led to the new charges. Whether the bail release order was proper, and whether\n   <em>\n    Letasky\n   </em>\n   's rationale would extend to a release order with its specific language, are not so clear as to support a conclusion that counsel's failure to pursue suppression lacked any plausible justification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sartain\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31 (recognizing that there was \"at least a plausible justification for the attorney's omissions\" where defense counsel could \"believ[e] the grounds for the objection were meritless.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foston v.

Larsen argues that\n   trial counsel's error prejudiced him, because the District Court repeatedly expressed its frustration with sentencing Larsen to ten years in prison with no suspension or deferment under the PFO statute and there is \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Kougl\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Turnsplenty\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 The State responds that counsel correctly answered the court's questions and that Larsen cannot establish prejudice because he cannot show a reasonable probability that the District Court would have suspended or deferred his sentence.

We explained that the alternative sentencing provisions of \u00a7 45-9-202, MCA, are permissive and that if a district court determines that incarceration is inappropriate, the defendant \"may, in lieu of imprisonment\" under the PFO statutes, \"be sentenced according to the alternatives\" provided in \u00a7 45-9-202(2), MCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brendal\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 29 (quoting \u00a7 45-9-202(1), MCA ).

That I cannot suspend or defer a ten-year sentence?\" Counsel answered, \"Unfortunately, I do\n   agree that it is, your Honor.\" We reject the State's narrow construction of this exchange. The District Court was not asking what the PFO statute required in a vacuum, but rather what authority the court had to give Larsen a sentence that departed from the PFO minimum requirements. Larsen was convicted of a felony drug offense under Title 45, chapter 9, MCA. Given our precedent in\n   <em>\n    Brendal\n   </em>\n   , counsel's erroneous answer to the District Court's inquiries constituted deficient performance and fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 The second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   requires that Larsen show prejudice from counsel's deficient performance.
