A dispute took place be-teen <em>Parr </em>and Armstrong, and on the 4th <em>April </em>1770, the latter entered a caveat in the land office against the acceptance of a survey for, or the grant of a patent to, <em>Parr </em>or any other person in right of Pingley, alleging <em>that Pingley\u2019s application -was executed </em>elsewhere, <em>and that the land last surveyed upon that application belonged to him by virtue of his application No. </em>711. On the 29th <em>October </em>1770 the hearing on the caveat was postponed, and in 1771 <em>Parr </em>and <em>Armstrong </em>agreed to divide the land in front on the river, so that the former should,include his improvement, and <em>Armstrong </em>was <em>to fill up his application by taking in land in the rear. </em>This back land included the premises in controversy. Accordingly, when in the year 1773, one <em>Henry </em>settled down upon the land in question, <em>Armstrong </em>drove him off, and in <em>March </em>1776, he caused a survey to be made upon his application by the deputy surveyor, and took in part of the land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-11\">On the 25th <em>April </em>1794, <em>Armstrong </em>conveyed to <em>Dale, </em>under whom the defendant held, his application No. 711, and on the 4th <em>May </em>1794, a survey was made for Dale, which extended the lines so as to include 320 acres, comprehending more of <em>Boards </em>survey. <em>Dale </em>also became the proprietor of <em>Pingley\u2019s </em>application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-12\">The questions were two. 1. Whether <em>Boon </em>was the owner of <em>Burk\u2019s </em>warrant. 2. Whether the title to the land in dispute had not vested in Armstrong, and by him been transa mitted to the defendant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-13\">For the plaihtiff it was said on the <em>first </em>point, that <em>Boon\u2019s </em>ownership of the warrant to <em>Burk </em>was a matter of necessary inference. <em>Boon </em>directed and probably paid for the survey. It was <em>Boon </em>who disputed with Armstrong, and from that time to the trial no one had ever claimed the war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>rant in opposition to Boon. His death in 1778, and the destruction of his papers by fire, sufficiently accounted for the ' want of a written document; but his acts, and the silence of others, shewed that he either was the owner of the warrant, when it issued, having used <em>Burk\u2019s </em>name, or he became the owner by purchase immediately after.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-3\">On the <em>second, </em>point, it was remarked that in the year 1770 <em>Armstrong </em>claimed the survey made under <em>Pingley\u2019s </em>application, and nothing more or less. According to his assertion, it was the land covered by his own application, and he therefore caveated the acceptance of the survey for <em>Pingley. </em>This was conclusive evidence to shew what was <em>Armstrong\u2019s-</em>claim, and what his improvement in 1769 extended to. His agreement with <em>Parr </em>was a private matter between the two, and could affect no one else. Before <em>Armstrong </em>extended his lines so as to take in the back land, <em>Burk\u2019s </em>warrant of 5th <em>April </em>1774 called expressly for it, and therefore bound it from its date; and the proprietaries, knowing officially that <em>Armstrong </em>claimed other land, had a perfect right to grant the warrant. <em>Boon </em>having followed up the warrant by a survey in 1776, did not lose his priority, and therefore the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-11\">On behalf of the defendant it was contended, that no right to <em>Burk\u2019s </em>warrant being established in Boon, was of itself fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. This being a warrant upon which the purchase money was paid, stronger proof should be required of a conveyance, than in the case of a location; and there was no proof of any kind. The fire might afford presumption of the loss of a deed, if its former existence had been shewn; but to take it as evidence of loss in this case, was to argue both the destruction and existence of the deed from tire same accident. <em>Boon\u2019s </em>superintendence of the survey was as much the act of an agent, as of a principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-12\">The answer to the plaintiff\u2019s <em>second </em>ground, was that <em>Armstrong </em>had an improvement on the land in 1769, that' in 1770 he claimed the premises under his improvement, and that in 1773 he turned-off a man who had settled upon the land in dispute, because it was within his claim of 300 acres. <em>Burk\u2019s </em>warrant adjoined lands of <em>Pingley </em>and <em>Armstrong; </em>therefore the only question was, what did <em>Pingley </em>and <em>Arm</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>strong </em>claim on the 5th <em>April 1774, </em>the date of that warrant? Now, it was most evident, that one of them claimed the land in dispute, and had exercised an act of ownership, by turning off a settler. If the plaintiff succeeded, neither <em>Armstrong\u2019s </em>nor <em>Pingley\u2019s </em>survey would include the 300 acres, to which they were respectively entitled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">His Honour charged the jury, that in his opinion, there was sufficient in. the fact of <em>Boon\u2019s </em>directing the, survey, in his disputing the right with <em>Armstrong, in </em>the destruction of his house and papers, and in the non-claim of any person under <em>Burk </em>except <em>Boon, </em>to justify a presumption that <em>Burk </em>had conveyed to <em>Boon, </em>or that the warrant was taken out by <em>Boon </em>in the name of <em>Burk. </em>He therefore thought the plaintiff ought to recover; for if <em>Armstrong </em>by his <em>earlier </em>application and residence had a priority, still if by determining his claim on any side, he led another to take an office right for, or even to settle on that side, that other ought not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-8\">The jury found for the defendant. A motion was made for a new trial, which was overruled with a view to take the opinion of this court; and accordingly the case was now argued upon appeal, by <em>Huston </em>and <em>Watts </em>for the, plaintiff, and <em>by-Hall </em>and <em>Duncan </em>for the defendant, upon the points made below.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b66-9\">Tirghman C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxPB\">after stating the facts, delivered the opinion of the Court. Upon the trial of this pause, two questions arose. 1. Whether <em>Boon </em>was the owner of <em>Burk\u2019s </em>warrant. 2. Supposing he was, whether he was entitled to the land in dispute. As to the <em>first, </em>without discussing the testimony, we think it sufficient to express our opinion that under all the circumstances of this case, there was satisfactory evidence of <em>Boon\u2019s </em>being the owner of <em>Burk\u2019s </em>warrant. On the <em>second </em>point, it appears to us that the plaintiff made a very strong case. It was to be seen on the records of the land office that <em>Armstrong </em>claimed a survey made and returned for <em>Phigley, </em>and that he claimed nothing else. In this situation, <em>Armstrong </em>had no right to make any addition to the survey returned into the land office, without an order from the land office; and no private, intention or action of his, could hinder the proprietaries from selling the adjoining land to any .person who might apply for it. ,We consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>law on this point to be settled; and if it were otherwise, it would be productive of great confusion, and great injustice. On what ground the jury formed their verdict, does not appear. But the judge before whom the cause was tried was not satisfied with the verdict, although in order to take the opinion of this court on a point of law which he thought of importance, he overruled the motion for a new trial. Our opinion is, that a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"ANb\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
