On the 2d of <em>January </em>1809, he took an <em>habere facias </em>returnable to March, which was executed on the 4th of <em>January; </em>and at <em>December </em>term 1809, the sheriff returned that he had delivered possession to the plaintiff of one undivided sixth part of the lot, &amp;c; in the writ mentioned, as by the writ he was commanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AdMx\">As early as the 1st of <em>March </em>1809, which was before the return day, the plaintiff agreed with two persons to lease them the <em>whole </em>of certain landings and wharves on the lot, for one year, informing them, that although- the action was *n ^le na-me \u00b0f onei yet he understood from his counsel that the whole was recovered for the heirs of <em>Peter </em>and <em>Sarah </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Gardiner; </em>and on the 6th of April; the lease was executed, reserving rent to the plaintiff, and stipulating that the premises should be delivered to him or his representatives at the end of the year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-4\">On the 21st of <em>September </em>1809, the attorney in fact of the defendants attempted to take possession of five sixths; but he was ordered to leave the ground by the plaintiff, who said he claimed and would hold possession of the lot in right of himself and the heirs of <em>Peter Gardiner; </em>and upon another attempt on the 2d of October, the attorney was kept off the premises by force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">Upon affidavit of these facts, a rule was obtained upon the plaintiff at the last term, to shew cause why the defendants should not be restored to five sixths of the premises in the ejectment; and on this day,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-6\"><em>Peters </em>and <em>Eawle </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQD\">contended that the process of the court had been abused by the plaintiff, who had colourably used it to take possession of the whole. That he had always entertained the design of taking the whole, because he told his lessees that the whole had been recovered, and before the return day of the writ, contracted to l\u00e9ase them all the wharves and landings. That his claiming possession for other persons was a pretence, for by his lease he reserved the rent to himself, and stipulated for the re-delivery of possession to him or his representatives. That therefore the process of the court had been used to do a wrong to the defendants, by obtaining possession of the whole even before the return day, although no violence was used to keep possession until afterwards. To shew that under these circumstances, the court would do the defendants justice in a summary way, they cited <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Dawson </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>, <em>Collingham </em>v. <em>King </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>, <em>Connor </em>v. <em>West </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>, <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Fortune </em><footnotemark><em>(</em>d)</footnotemark>, 2 <em>Eq. Abr. </em>123. 1 <em>Hawk. </em>210. <em>c. </em>33. <em>sec. </em>12, <em>Sir Th. Ray. </em>275.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-7\"><em>Levy </em>and <em>Tilghman </em>shewed cause.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkU\">The plaintiff recovered upon such facts, as gave all the other representatives of <em>peter Gardiner </em>an equal right; and there is no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the bridge company was in possession as against them. If he has taken and kept the whole, he has done it as their agent for five sixths, and they are the parties against whom the rule should be directed. If <em>A. </em>disseise <em>B. </em>for \u00a37., it is the disseisin of \u00a37. But granting, that the plaintiff has done wrong, this is not the way to redress it. The writ was for one sixth, the possession of only one sixth was given, and so is the return. All the defendants\u2019 cases, are of abuse of process at the time of executing it, or of intention1 to abuse it at the time of taking it out. Here was neither one nor the other. Until long after the process was <em>functus </em>oficio, possession of the five sixths was not withheld; so that if there has been any wrong, it has not been in abuse of process, and therefore the defendants cannot have a summary redress.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b459-16\"><em> </em>3 <em>Wils. </em>49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b459-17\"><em> </em>1 <em>Burr. </em>629.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b459-18\"> 5 <em>Burr. </em>2673.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"AqZD\"> 1 <em>Binn. </em>125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b460-12\">Tilghman C.

If the writ has been properly executed, what the party does afterwards, we have nothing to do with in this way. If the officer gives orchard, and the party takes meadow, or commits fifty trespasses before the return, and after possession delivered, the person injured must resort to his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">Rule discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
