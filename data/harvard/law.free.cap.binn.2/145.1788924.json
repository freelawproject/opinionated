Because the rule was obsolete. 2. Because it gave a priority merely in the <em>arrangement </em>of the list of arguments, which implied that the party must state his claim, to the prothonotary before the list was arranged. 3, Because even if the claim could be made after the arrangement of the list, it should have been made, according to <em>The Commonwealth </em>v.

The application is therefore too late, even if the rule is at present in force; but in fact it has not been adopted in practice for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-16\">Motion denied-.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
