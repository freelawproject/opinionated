Upon the trial of the cause, the defendant\u2019s counsel offered in evidence the record of a verdict which had been given upon a former trial of this cause, and was afterwards set aside. The evidence was objected to; but the court admitted it, and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\">There were other points of law and evidence ruled by the court below, upon the trial and in their charge to the jury, which appeared upon the same bill of exceptions; particularly that the opinion of witnesses as to the custom of carriers upon the Juniata, and the general understanding and belief of the country as to the liability of carriers by water, might be given in evidence; and that it was a matter for the decision of the jury, whether the facts proved were sufficient to discharge the carrier; but this court gave no opinion upon these points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-5\"><em>S.
