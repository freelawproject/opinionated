The <em>Charles </em>arrived at <em>St. Kitts </em>about the 22d <em>December </em>1804, where almost all the outward cargo was sold excepting twenty-five barrels of beef and the shooks, and produced exclusive of freight and charges, 5831 dollars eighty-five cents, of which a small part was sent home in molasses, a part was left in the hands of a merchant to be remitted, and 4716 dollars and forty-nine cents was invested in eighty puncheons of rum: about 750 pounds currency was paid to the supercargoes in cash. With this cargo the vessel proceeded to <em>St. </em>Thomas, where she arrived in <em>February </em>1805. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The rum and beef were there sold, and an invoice of dry S00&lt;^s5 wine&gt; &amp;c. to the amount of 5225 dollars fifty cents was purchased with the proceeds, and shipped in the <em>Charles </em>for <em>Havanna, </em>in the name and for the account and risk of the plaintiffs. At the same time, <em>Stites took on board in his own name an invoice of dry goods, and </em>670 doubloons, <em>worth </em>11300 dollars, and then proceeded to the <em>Havanna. </em>The invoice of the plaintiffs there netted 5478 dollars, which was invested in 150 boxes white and brown sugars; and the invoice and gold of captain <em>Stites </em>netted 17623 dollars, which \u2022was invested in <em>350' </em>boxes of sugars, and 27 bales of beeswax. The former were invoiced and shipped on board the <em>Charles </em>in the name and <em>for the account and risk of Pratt and Clarkson; </em>and <em>Stites </em>signed bills of lading <em>in their name </em>deliverable to himself at <em>St. Thomas. </em>The latter were invoiced and shipped <em>in the name of Stites, andfor his sole account and risk. </em>To the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of lading was annexed an affidavit of <em>Hernandez, </em>of the house of the widow <em>Poey </em>and <em>Hernandez, </em>who made all the sales and purchases of the cargo, that the property was for the sole account and risk of the plaintiffs, and that no citizen or subject of any of the belligerent powers had any interest therein. To the bill of lading of <em>Stites, </em>an affidavit by himself was annexed to the same effect. The <em>Charles </em>sailed with this cargo for <em>St. Thomas </em>on the 12th of <em>April, </em>and was captured on the 9th of <em>May </em>by the brigantine <em>VEpervier, </em>and carried into <em>Tortola. </em>On the 11th <em>Maij, Stites </em>wrote to the plaintiffs that there was no doubt the vessel and cargo wouldbe condemned, and recommended an abandonment, which was accordingly made on the 8th of <em>June, </em>On the 3d <em>fune </em>the judge of vice-admiralty pronounced the vessel and cargo to have belonged at the time of capture to enemies of the crown of <em>Great Britain, </em>and as such or otherwise liable to condemnation, and condemned the same accordingly as good and lawful prize.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">By the proceedings in the vice-admiralty, which were given in evidence by the plaintiffs, it appeared that the captain in answer to the standing interrogatories, swore that the plaintiffs were laders of all the cargo that was put on board at <em>Philadelphia, </em>and owners of the greatest part; and that he owned the rest. That they owned 150 boxes sugar at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>time of the capture, and that all the rest of the lading belonged to him. That he knew the lading so belonged, from its being the returns of the cargo carried out, <em>of which a </em>part, <em>to the amount of seven or eight thousand dollars, was sold at St. Kitts, and the rest, to the value of about six thousand dollars, was sold at St. Thomas; that of </em>this, <em>part was carried down to the Havanna in goods, and part in </em>670 doubloons, <em>added to </em>which, <em>he received about eight or nine thousand dollars at St. Thomas for nankeens he sold there, which were his own property, and which came to him there in the schooner Intrepid; </em>and that if restored, it would belong as aforesaid, and to none others. In his claim he also mentioned <em>two thousand dollars which he took with him from St. Kitts, </em>and which he did not recollect upon his examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">No other explanation was given of the source from which the property claimed by <em>Stites </em>proceeded, except his own .account in the preceding answers. At the same time, in the correspondence with the plaintiffs, which was principally carried on by <em>Stites </em>alone, he repeatedly requested them not to let <em>his poor wife and children want </em>in his absence. It did not appear whether <em>Thomas </em>the assistant supercargo had participated in the shipment of this property, and in one or two of his private letters, he complained that <em>Stites </em>kept him in the dark as to the business of the cargo, and seemed to wish him out of the way. But to shew clearly that the account given by <em>Stites </em>was false, the defendants produced the captain of the schooner <em>Intrepid, </em>who swore that he was at <em>St. Thomas\u2019 </em>in that schooner in the winter of 1805 while <em>Stites </em>was there, that he had on board <em>but 3000pieces of nan-keen, no part of xvhich belonged to Stites, </em>and that in the two \u00bfr three voyages he had previously made to that island in the <em>Intrepid, </em>he did not carry any nankeens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">The defendants\u2019 counsel thereupon insisted, that the matters given in evidence were sufficient and ought to be admitted and allowed as decisive evidence to entitle the defendants to a verdict in their favour. But the court delivered the following opinion to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">' \u201c This is an action brought by <em>Pratt </em>and. <em>Clarkson </em>against the Phoenix Insurance Company, to recover 7000 dollars \u201c insured on goods on board the ship <em>Charles </em>from <em>Havanna </em>to <em>St. Thomas. </em>The policy is a valued one; and the plain- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201c tiffs therein stipulate that the property insured is <em>American\u2022 </em>\u201c It is in proof that the property insured at the <em>Havanna </em>\u201c belonged to the plaintiffs, who are <em>Americans; </em>that the in- \u201c surance was effected at <em>7 </em>and a half per cent., and that both \u201c vessel and cargo have been taken, and condemned by a \u201c <em>British </em>court of vice-admiralty at <em>Tortola. </em>Two thirds of \u201c the vessel were owned by the plaintiffs, and one third by \u201c <em>Richard Stites </em>the captain. She sailed the 12th <em>November </em>\u201c 1804 from <em>Philadelphia </em>to <em>St. </em>Kitts, from <em>St. Kitts </em>to <em>St. </em>\u201c Thomas, from <em>St. Thomas </em>to the Havanna, and on her \u2018\u2018 way back to <em>St. Thomas </em>she was captured by a <em>British </em>\u201c vessel of war on the 9th <em>'May </em>1805, and condemned a few \u201c days after. The reasons assigned for the condemnation of \u201c ship and cargo, are singular in the mode of expression. If \u201c captain <em>Stites </em>actually <em>covered </em>the property of the enemy \u201c of Britain, the true reason of condemnation is not assign- \u201c ed in the sentence of the judge. Both vessel and cargo are \u201c condemned as belonging to the enemies of <em>Great </em>Britain, \u201c and as such or otherwise liable to confiscation. From the \u201c mass of papers that have been read, there is not any evi<em>(l </em>dence to support the decree, <em>with respect to the property of </em>\u201c <em>the plaintiffs, </em>and the counsel for the defendants have wisely \u201c,taken another ground to j ustify the decree of the admiralty <em>a </em>court at Tortola.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-9\">\u201c The extensive commerce and immense naval force of <em>u. Great </em>Britain, have given her a commanding influence over \u201c the maritime laws of <em>Europe </em>for above half a century. But \u201c it is not in superior power we are to expect moderation, \u201c and at all times a due respect for the rights of others.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-10\">\u201c In the discussion of this cause a wide and extensive \u2018,\u00a3 range has been taken; more so than perhaps was e\u2018 necessary. If the 150 boxes of sugar, the undisputed pro- \u201c perty of the plaintiffs, have been legally condemned,.they \u201c have no right to recover, and the underwriters are dis- \u201c charged from their contract. On the other hand, if they \u201c have been condemned contrary to the laws of nations, the \u201c insured have a right to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-11\">\u201c Whether captain <em>Stites covered </em>the property of a belliM gerent, is a question of fact enveloped in some obscurity. \u201c The bills of lading and invoices at the <em>Havanna </em>are ap- \u201c parently fair and regular, and carry on the face of them no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>44 evidence of the charge. The sudden accumulation of pro\u00bb 44 perty; is the principal circumstance rested on by the defen44 dants to shew, that <em>Stites </em>was, at the time of the capture, \u201c covering the goods of a belligerent. It is certain he had 44 during the voyage become possessed of a large sum of 44 money, and hence the presumption, that it was the property 44 of an enemy, is urged by the defendants. That the captain 44 had acquired possession of property to the amount of 350 44 boxes of sugar, and 27 bales of beeswax, cannot be con\u00bb 44 tr\u00f3verted. <em>But whether it was belligerent or neutral pro-</em>44 <em>perty is very doubtful\\ and has not been proved. </em>When he 44 sailed from <em>Philadelphia </em>there is no evidence that he car\u00bb 44 ried any money; but there is every reason to believe he \u201c did; because he had just sold his share in two thirds of the 44 ship, and mortgaged the other third, the whole amount 44 being 1-166 dollars.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He swears too, that he carried from 44 <em>St. Thomas </em>to the <em>Havanna </em>670 doubloons. Who owned 44 this sum, from what source it was derived, whether from a \u20224'4 neutral, or an enemy of <em>Great </em>Britain, is a point on which 44 much observation has been expended, but nothing satis\u00bb 84 factorily established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">41 It is an acknowledged principle, that the captain, generally K speaking, is the representative of the owner, and that in 44 many instances the owner is responsible for his acts. In \u00e1 4,4 voluntary deviation, in case of trespass comihitted by him, 44 and in case of illicit trade, this is the consequence, The 44 acts of the captain in these cases; are in their nature in* 44 divisible, and their operation cannot be restricted toa por\u00bb 44 tion of the property committed to his trust, but must ne\u00bb44 cessarily extend to the whole. But the case before us is not 44 of this sort. Here the owners and the property are clearly 44 distinguishable; and the ship was not engaged in the viola.\u00bb 84 tion of the laws of nations, or of any treaty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-12\">44 The commerce of a neutral with an enemy, except in 44 contraband goods, is certainly lawful. The ship <em>Charles </em>44 therefore, being neutral property, owned by <em>American </em>44 citizens, was not illegally employed between the <em>Havanna </em>44 and- the island of <em>St. Thomas. </em>They had a right to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201c sugar and beeswax from the former to the latter place. No \u201c law of nations forbids it. Being a neutral vessel, and liable \u201c to be searched, the belligerent had a right to take enemy\u2019s \u201c property found on board, but nothing more. If they found \u201c property, which in fact belonged to the enemy of <em>England, </em>\u201c covered by captain Stites, it is admitted they had a right to \u201c take it; but it is not admitted they had a right to seize \u201c and condemn property, which it is acknowledged on all hands belonged- to a friend. When I say this, I allude to \u201c the 150 boxes of sugar, the property of <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Clarkson, </em>\u201c and which certainly did not belong to the enemies of \u201c <em>Great Britain. </em>The general law of nations cannot be alter- \u201c ed by the arbitrary ordinances of a single nation. Even the \u201c courts of <em>England </em>admit, that the concurrence of all nations \u201c is required, to produce a change in the law of nations. <em>The \u201c\u25a0 law of nations appears to be, that neither ship nor lawful </em>\u201c <em>goods are liable to be condemned by means of unlawful ones, \u201c unless when they belong to the same owner, or cannot be </em>\u201c <em>distinguished, </em>which is acknowledged not to be the case on <em>u </em>this trial. The insured in the case before the court, \u201c have warranted against seizure on account of any illicit \u201c or prohibited trade, which must mean trade prohibited by \u201c treaties, or the law of nations, not the ordinances of a par-w ticularnation. Itis true the risk of the insurers cannot bein- \u201c creased by the insured; but that is not the case <em>heyc,because </em>\u201c <em>by the law of nations the risk of the underwriters is not in- </em>\u201c <em>creased with respect to the property of the plaintiff, by cap- </em>\u201c <em>tain Stites taking on board goods belonging to a belligerent. </em>\u201c Every thing usual and agreeable to the law of nations is \u201c supposed to be contemplated by both parties at the time of \u201c the insurance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-8\">\u201c Upon the whole, gentlemen, if you are satisfied that \u201c captain <em>Stites </em>had on board <em>Spanish </em>property, and that &lt;c <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Clarkson participated in the </em>act, your verdict \u201c should be for the defendants. But if you are of opinion that \u201c the captain had <em>Spanish </em>property on board, but that <em>Pratt </em>\u201c and <em>Clarkson had no knowledge of the </em>fact, your verdict \u201c should be for the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-9\">With this direction the cause was left to the jury, who found a verdict for the whole sum in favour of the plaintiffs; and the defendants\u2019 counsel tendered a bill of exceptions tp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the opinion, insisting in the usual form, that \u201c the said several \u201c documents, matters and proofs, were sufficient in laW to <em>bar </em>,. , , . \u201e \u201c the plaintiffs recovery. \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-8\"><em>TIallozuell </em>and <em>Rawle </em>for the plaintiffs in error</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATtQ\">took three exceptions to the charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-9\">1. That the proof of enemies\u2019 property being covered by Stites, was so irresistible, from the sudden acquisition of so large a sum, from his necessity at the commencement of the voyage to mortgage one third of the ship for a small debt, from his repeated requests to the owners not to let his poor-wife and children want in his absence, from the falsehood of his account of the cargo in his answers at Tortola, and from the want of all possible temptation to disguise neutral property, that the court below were wrong in saying it was doubtful. They should have charged the jury that the evidence was decisive, and that the underwriters were discharged. Both vessel and cargo were warranted neutral, because a warranty of neutral goods was in this case the same as a warranty of neutral cargo; and the excess, of funds obtained upon such a voyage, beyond the amount carried out, not being explained, was, in connexion with the preceding circumstances, decisive evidence that the warranty was not performed. <em>Blagge </em>v. <em>New York Insurance </em>Company. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-10\"><em>2. </em>That the court were wrong in stating the law to be, that neither ship nor lawful goods are liable to be condemned by means of unlawful ones, unless when they belong to the same owner, or cannot be distinguished; for where the goods of aii enemy are'taken on board and masked by the general agent of neutral cargo, his conduct affects the whole, notwithstanding the sound parts may be distinctly documented, and his principal is answerable to the whole amount of his property-on board. If a master, without the knowledge of the shipowner, breaks a blockade, the ship is forfeited, because the master is the ship owner\u2019s agent; and if he is expressly constituted ager.t of the owners of cargo, or the cargo belongs to the owners of the ship, for the same reason the cargo is forfeited. <em>The Mercurius </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The belligerent property was here taken on board by <em>Stites </em>the general agent. It was his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>intention in this part of the transaction \u201cto mislead fhp \" \u201c <em>British </em>courts of justice, and the <em>British </em>cruizers, as to the \u201c property of the cargo;\u201d and upon the effect of such an intention, the opinion of Sir <em>William Scott </em>in the case of <em>The Eenrom </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is decisive, that let the interests of his employers be what they may, they must be affected by the conduct of the agent, and the consequence will attach on them, to confiscate the property so engaged. In strict law, he says, every supercargo will bind his employer; and although cases may arise where the owner will not be implicated, as where supercargoes have taken in small parcels of goods in contradiction to orders, yet where there is a deliberate interference in the war, by masking a large property of the enemy, this indulgence is not shewn, and the owners who have conferred the power upon the agent, must look to him for redress. The neutral is not at liberty to say, \u201c I have endeavoured to protect the \u201c whole, but this part is really my property, take the rest, and \u201c let me go with my own.\u201d If he will engage in fraudulent concerns with other persons, <em>they must all stand or fall together. The Princessa </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>, <em>The Susa </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>, and <em>The Mars </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are all to the same point. In the latter case, Sir <em>William Scott </em>says, that whatever the hardship may be, the rule of law is established, that the principal is answerable for the act of his agent, not only civilly, but penally, <em>to the whole amount of the property under his care. </em>The case of <em>Crousillat </em>v. <em>Ball </em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>recognized the same principle. The blending of the property-in one bill of lading or invoice is of no consequence. If the agent of the cargo covers property in his own name, it is the same by the law of the admiralty, as if the owner covered it in the agent\u2019s name; it is a fraud by the owner himself up op. belligerent cruizers, which is punished by the condemnation of all his property. But here was in fact a confusion of property. The agent swore that 150 boxes belonged to the plaintiffs, and the residue to himself; whereas the papers on board, and the whole history of the voyage, shewed that as it respected his own part, the oath was false; and therefore as was decided in <em>The Rosalie and Betty </em><footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark>, tke whole of his testimony was discredited, and the property of his employers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>was reasonably affected by it. This is the real confusion pf property. The agent resorted to a false oath to protect the' epemy\u2019s interest; and this being detected, it became impossible to say what was neutral and what was not. The only question then is, was the misdirection of the court upon this point of law material to the issue? And it certainly was, for this \u2022 reason. The warranty of <em>American </em>property meant, not only that the goods belonged to Americans, but that the owners or their agent, would do no act in the course of the voyage to compromit their neutral character; that the goods should not be liable even to impediment, in consequence of - unneutral conduct. <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Parker </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>Now by putting out of view the relation of agency which subsisted between <em>Stites </em>and the assured, his acts became unimportant; whereas it was by those unneutral acts, and by his false swearing, that the condemnation was justified, and that the warranty of neutrality was broken. In <em>Calbraith </em>v. Gracie, in the Circuit Court of the <em>United </em>States, <em>April </em>sessions 1805, the condemnation of the property being caused by the false oath of the supercargo, the court held that the warranty was broken, notwithstanding the property was most clearly <em>American.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahm\">3. That the court were wrong in charging the jury that the risk was not increased by the conduct of <em>Stites. </em>It was beyond doubt increased for two reasons. First, because the masking of property to so great an extent, threw a suspicion over the whole cargo, which made it the more liable to be both taken in and condemned; and secondly, because the agent\u2019s persisting in a gross falsehood as to the bulk of the cargo, discredited his testimony as to the rest, and his being the perpetrator of the fraud, led to the entire condemnation. Without attending to the consequences which did occur, no one can believe that the company would have insured these goods for seven and a half per cent., if they had been told that two thirds of the cargo were enemies\u2019 property covered by the agent of the assured, If the law given in charge, had been founded upon the assumption that there was no covered property on board, the case might have been different; but in the conclusion, the court say, even if <em>Stites </em>did cover <em>Spanish </em>property, yet if the plaintiffs had no knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>it, they were entitled to a verdict. For the purpose of stating the law, they therefore admit the fact of covering, and put the case upon the knowledge, which was wholly immaterial. The true question has never been submitted to the jury, and of course we are entitled to a <em>venire de novo.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-8\"><em>Ingersoll </em>and <em>Lewis </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aab\">The bill of exceptions is bad <em>in </em>toto, because it was tendered in consequence of the court\u2019s not charging that the evidence was a bar to the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. The form of the bill is taken from <em>Buller\u2019s Nisi Prius </em>317, where the defendant insisted that the evidence was decisive to give him the benefit of the 24 <em>G. </em>3. c. 44. which was a bar to the action, and it was therefore a question of law; whereas in this case, where evidence was given on both sides, where the foreign sentence was not conclusive, and where the fact of agency, of enemy\u2019s property, and of covering, were questions for the jury, it was impossible for the court to charge that the evidence was a bar, or that it was decisive. The bill of exceptions ought to be taken on some point_ of law arising upon a fact not disputed. <em>Show. Par. Ca. </em>120. 1 <em>Mod. Plead. </em>104, 105. <em>Trials per Pais </em>222, 223. If a party wishes an opinion as to the sufficiency of the evidence, he must demur; <em>Show. Par. Ca. </em>115; he cannot draw the whole matter into controversy again upon a writ of error. But further, if the bill contains matter upon which the party excepting was not overruled, it is not to be signed; <em>Show. Par. Ca. </em>120; and as the only point upon which the plaintiffs in error were overruled, was as to the evidence being a bar, upon which they had no right to ask an opinion, we submit that the bill of exceptions falls; at least that the question in this court must be confined to that point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-9\">It is said that the evidence was decisive, because as there was no explanation given of the excess beyond the outfit, the warranty was falsified. This was in part matter of fact for the jury. But as matter of law the premises do not warrant the conclusion. The warranty applied only to the <em>goods </em>of the assured, not to the cargo of the vessel; and the neutrality of the former was proved. The case of <em>Blagge </em>v. <em>The New-York Insurance Company </em>does not apply. There the warranty extended to the whole cargo, and the excess was obtained at a hostile, port. Here the warranty was confined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to particular goods, and the excess was taken in at the neutral island of <em>St. Thomas. </em>Whether the court were right in charging that the fact of enemies\u2019 property was doubtful, is of no consequence. It was merely an opinion as to a question of fact, which is not examinable here. The admiralty proceedings, which are treated as if they were conclusive upon the matter, were not even evidence of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-4\">The court were not wrong in the opinion which is the ground of the second objection. That opinion is to be understood in relation to the facts. The goods of the plaintiffs were clearly distinguishable from the property in the name of <em>Stites; they </em>were personally guiltless; and <em>Stites </em>was\u2018not their agent as to the property covered; and it results from all the admiralty cases, that under such circumstances, a discrimination is made between the guilty and the innocent property. <em>The 3Iercurius </em>recognises this principle. The cargo is not affected by breach of blockade, unless the owners are conusant of the blockade, or the captain is the agent of the cargo. In <em>The Eenrom </em>the whole property was invoiced as belonging to the same neutral owners, who had themselves directed the masking of the property; there was therefore no means of discrimination, and- the owners were personally implicated. It is there said, that if a neutral will weave a web of fraud, the admiralty will not take the trouble of picking out the threads for him, in order to distinguish the sound from the unsound. This is undoubtedly the rule. But if there is no web, if the threads are not interwoven, if the sound is already distinguished upon the papers, then it follows that the rule must be to restore. <em>The Rosalie </em>and <em>Betty </em>was also a case of mixed property; for Sir <em>William Scott </em>says in page 294, \u201c if Mr. <em>Raster </em>has any property in this cargo, if he \u201c has <em>mixed </em>his interest in any proportion with the interest \u201c of the enemy, and resorts to modes of prevarication to \u201c conceal the enemies\u2019 interest, such a conduct will affect his \u201c own share.\u201d It is the obscurity and doubt produced, not by the answers of the master, but by the state of the property itself, which leads to the condemnation of the whole; no means of discrimination being furnished by the documents of the property, as was required in <em>The Franklin </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In the case of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>The Resolution </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court of' appeals discriminated without hesitation when means were offered. The transportation of enemies\u2019 goods is agreed to be lawful; when done fairly, the ship owner in case of capture gets full freight. <em>The Copenhagen </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>. The fraud consists in the concealment, and the penalty lies in the forfeiture of the concealed goods, and of those which are identified with them. <em>Lee on Captures </em>141. What shews this rule decisively, is the conduct of the admiralty with respect to neutral ships in which property is masked. If the penalty extended to the whole property of the owner, whether distinguishable or not, the ship would be forfeited with the cargo; whereas the penalty in such a case is simply the loss of freight. <em>The Atlas </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>. <em>The Vrow Henrica </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The case of <em>The Rising Sun </em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is in point to the present. Then as to the liability of the owners for their agent. Certainly it cannot be to a greater extent, than if they were personally implicated; and even then the discriminated property is not forfeited. But in no case are owners implicated at all by the agent\u2019s misconduct, except when he acts in relation to their-property, or under a general authority. In <em>The Princessa </em>the very property claimed by an Englishman, was shipped by his agent as <em>Spanish. The Susa </em>was a ship claimed for the <em>American </em>owner, whose agents had impressed upon her the character of a <em>French </em>ship; and in <em>The </em>Mars, where Sir <em>William Scott </em>asserts the rule that the owner is answerable penally to the whole amount of the property under the agent\u2019s care, the whole property was in fact claimed by the <em>American </em>owner, and the fraud was in relation to the whole. In <em>Crousillat </em>v. Ball the master was the general agent of the whole cargo, and covered the enemies\u2019 property in his owner\u2019s name. <em>Stites </em>was not the agent of the plaintiffs as to the covered property, nor did he in fact act as their agent. He was joint supercargo with Thomas, who knew nothing of <em>Stites's </em>property. The two made one agent; neither could bind the principa! without the assent of the other. His acts alone could not therefore condemn his owner\u2019s property. Nor did his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>duct at <em>Tortola </em>lead to the condemnation. False papers, prevarication, spoliation, are not a ground of condemnation,' but merely causes of suspicion, grounds for further proof, or of refusing costs upon acquittal. <em>The Rising Sun </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>. 2 Brown Civ. and Adm. </em>450. <em>Lee on Cap. </em>238, 240. The fact is that the cargo and ship, the latter of which was clear <em>American </em>property and never would have been condemned on account of the covered goods, were both condemned for another cause; and that was her sailing from an enemy\u2019s colony to a port not in her own country, contrary to the spirit of the order of 24-th <em>June </em>1803. It follows therefore from the whole, that nothing was done by the agent of the assured to compromit the neutrality of the goods insured, that the warranty was performed, and that the opinion of the court was right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-4\">As to the increase of the risk, it was a matter of fact for the jury, and the court were not asked to charge upon that point. But the risk was not increased; not the risk of being' taken in, because the underwriters must have known that the vessel would be taken in if met on this voyage; nor the risk of being condemned, because condemnation followed from the voyage; and if it did not, it could not result, as has before been shewn, from covering property as <em>Stites </em>is said to have covered it. At all events the plaintiffs\u2019 agent did not increase the risk as agent, but as captain. In <em>Calbraith </em>v. <em>Gracie, </em>it was the supercargo whose acts condemned the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-5\">The errors in the conclusion of the charge, if any, were in favour of the defendants; because' the jury were told that if the assured knew of the covering, they were not entitled to a verdict; whereas their knowledge of the fact ought not to be followed by any such result; they ought at least to have been parties to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-6\"><em>In reply </em>to the argument against the bill of exceptions, it was said that there were two questions. 1. Whether on the face of the bill a writ of error would lie. 2. Whether there was sufficient on the record to reverse the judgment. As to the <em>first, </em>a bill of exceptions lies to the whole charge, because it lies to each part separately. The word <em>dedsive </em>does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>mean conclusive; but that the evidence was such as entitled us to a decision in our favour, and so the judge was asked to charge. If he had said that the evidence had weight, and so referred it to the jury, no exception could have been taken; but instead of that, the opinion of the court was given upon points of law, all of which we say are erroneous, when applied to the facts, and we have excepted to all. If the bill was too broadly taken, it should have been corrected below; it is now too late.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"APf\">delivered the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">This cause was brought before us, by a writ of error to the Court of Common Pleas, founded on a bill of exceptions which states all the evidence, and contains the charge of the court at large. It was an action on a policy of insurance on goods shipped by <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Clarkson </em>on board the ship Charles, on a voyage from the <em>Savanna </em>to the <em>Danish </em>island -of <em>St. Thomas </em>in the year 1805, when <em>Denmark </em>was a neutral power. The ship was owned by <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Clarkson; </em>and the captain and <em>Isaac Thomas </em>were joint agents of the plaintiffs, and supercargoes. The policy contained a warranty that the goods were <em>American </em>property, to be so proved here only, and it was fully proved that'the goods were the property of the plaintiffs, who are <em>Americans. </em>Some evidence was given to prove, that captain <em>Stites </em>had taken in three hundred and fifty boxes of sugar, and twenty-seven bales of beeswax, which in truth were <em>Spanish </em>property, and carried them under false papers as his own property; but they were not blended with the goods of the plaintiffs. The invoice and other papers respecting them, were distinct from those of the plaintiffs. After the evidence was closed, the counsel for the defendants insisted that the several matters given in evidence, ought to be allowed as <em>decisive evidence </em>to entitle the defendants to a verdict. I think it would have been mo.re proper, and would have brought the questions of law more to a point, if the counsel had proposed the particular matters on which they desired the opinion of the court to be given. Indeed it would have been impossible to give in charge to the jury, that the evidence was <em>decisive </em>on either side, without assuming the decision of facts, which is beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>tlie power of the court. The judge viewing it in this light, did not say whether it was decisive or not, but summed up the evidence, and then gave his opinion on certain points of law, arising as he conceived out of the facts. The jury found for the plaintiffs; and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted to the court\u2019s opinion,\u2019 in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">It has been made a question how this bill of exceptions is t\u00f3 be understood, and what points are now open for discussion. If the president of the Court of Common Pleas had declared to the jury that the evidence was not <em>decisive </em>in favour of the defendants, I do not know that any objection could have been made to it. The evidence was legal, but how, far decisive, the jury were to judge. It has been determined by this court in the case of <em>Burd </em>v. <em>The Lessee of Dansdale </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that if a judge gives an opinion upon facts, not warranted by the evidence, it is no error which can be assigned on a bill of exceptions. Neither do we conceive that advantage can be taken of an erroneous opinion on a point of law, immaterial to the is\u00e1ue which the jury are trying. But it is open to the plaintiff in error, to assign error in an opinion on any matter material to the issue, appearing on the bill of exceptions, although it is not particularized in stating the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">, The judge\u2019s charge appears to be in substance, this, that the conduct of captain <em>Stites </em>in covering <em>Spanish </em>property (if he did cover it) without the knowledge of the plaintiffs, could not affect the goods of the plaintiffs, which were not blended with the covered goods; and therefore if the,jury should be of opinion that the captain had on board <em>Spanish </em>property, and the plaintiffs <em>participated </em>in the act, their verdict should be given for the defendants; but if they should be of opinion that the plaintiffs had no <em>knowledge </em>of it, their verdict should be for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">It is contended,on the part of the defendants, that the plaintiffs are answerable for the conduct of their captain and agent, and his conduct has been such as to break the warranty of <em>American </em>property, or at any rate to increase the risk of the voyage, so that the plaintiffs ought not to recover. It is not unlawful for a neutral to carry the goods of a belligerent. So far from it, that it is the constant practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>of courts of admiralty to. restore the ship with full freight t# \" the neutral owner, unless the case is attended with particular circumstances. It was not the carrying of <em>Spanish </em>goods then, but the attempt to mask them under a neutral cover, that was a breach of neutrality. This attempt was the act of the captain, or perhaps of the captain and his colleague Mr. <em>Thomas. </em>It is therefore to be considered how far the act of one, or both of these persons, may be imputed to the plaintiffs. There are some principles about which there is no dispute. The captain is the agent of the owners with respect to the ship, and they must answer for his conduct. But he is not agent for the owners of the goods, unless so specially constituted. If he attempts to enter a port, in breach of a blockade, the ship is subject to condemnation, and so also is the cargo, although not committed tothe care of the captain, if it belong to the owners of the ship. An agent for the owner of the goods, may likewise affect his principal, by his acts respecting the goods committed to his charge. If he violates the law of nations with respect, to those goods, they may be condemned. So if he mixes or entangles them with goods which are contraband, or the property of an enemy, they must all share the same fate. This is the principle laid down by Sir <em>William Scott </em>in the case of the <em>Rosalie </em>and Betty, 2 <em>Rob. 294. </em>The same judge has decided that owners of the cargo, are affected by the conduct of their general agent or supercargo, not only civilly, but penally, to the amount of their property on board; <em>The </em>Mars, 6 <em>Rob. 87; </em>and this doctrine was adopted by this court in <em>Crousillat </em>v. Ball, of which my brother <em>Teat.es </em>has a manuscript note, fuller than the report by Mr, <em>Dallas. </em>Taking the law to be so, the charge of the Court of Common Pleas seems to have drawn the attention of the jury to the wrong point; or at least to have laid them under too great restriction. The point submitted to their consideration, was, whether the captain covered <em>Spanish </em>property with the knowledge, or participation of the plaintiffs. The consequences resulting from improper conduct in a supercargo, or general agent, were thrown out of the question. Now suppose the jury had thought, that the captain, with the acquiescence of his colleague Mr. Thomas, had attempted to cover <em>Spanish </em>property without the knowledge of the plaintiffs; in that case the ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>diet ought to have been for the defendants; and yet the jury 'under the charge of the court were bound to find for the - o plaintiffs. The Court of Common Pleas have laid down the law, that the goods of the plaintiffs could not be affected by any conduct of their agent, because they were not blended with the covered goods. In this we think they were wrong. The jury should have been told, that the whole property of the plaintiffs on board the ship, was liable to condemnation by the law of nations, if their general agents attempted to deceive one of the belligerent powers by covering the property of his enemy. We are therefore of opinion, that in this respect the charge was erroneous, and consequently the judgment must be reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Judgment reversed, and <em>Venire de novo.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\"> <em>Ante </em>80.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
