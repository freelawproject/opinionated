Seth </em>and <em>Robert Rodgers </em>took but an estate for <em>life. </em>2. That estate is confined to one half the plantation, the other half to the wife being excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-9\">1. The devisees took but an estate for life, because it is an established rule of law that express words of inheritance, or words tantamount, are necessary to pass an estate of inheritance; and that the heir at law is not to be disinherited by a doubtful construction. The decisions upon this head are without end; and they enforce the principle without a single exception, even in cases where privately there could not be a doubt, that the intention of the testator was thereby defeated. In <em>Right </em>v. <em>Sidebotham </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>where this rule is laid down, it appears that the words <em>tantamount </em>to words of inheritance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>are such only as indicate the whole interest of the testator, and not such as are descriptive of local situation, or the kind \u00a9f property. \u201c All my lands in <em>B.f </em>\u201c all my farms,\u201d are descriptive of situation and kind; \u201c my estate,\u201d \u201c all my \u201c interest,\u201d on the other hand, are descriptive of interest; the latter will pass a fee, the former but an estate for life. Now, there is no difference either in legal or vulgar acceptation between \u201c farm\u201d and \u201c plantation,\u201d nor has it ever been held, that either term, any more than that of \u201chouse,\u201d was descriptive of interest. It is true, that sometimes the context of the will is allowed to extend a devise beyond an estate for life; but there is nothing in this will that can properly have that influence. The first clause, \u201c as to all my worldly \u201c estate,\u201d &amp;c. certainly has no such effect. In <em>Right </em>v. <em>Side</em>botham, in <em>Denn </em>v. <em>Gaskin </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>, in <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Bolton </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>, and in many other cases, where that clause is found, the devisee took but an estate for life. They are words of course in wills, and are never meant to relate to the quantity of interest given in the thing devised. There is also a devise to the' wife for life, which may be said to indicate an intention to give a fee where the same limit is not affixed to the estate. But this was precisely the case in <em>Roe v. Bolton, </em>which, in several particulars, is almost in point to the present. There the will contained the introductory words, \u201c as touching \u201c such <em>worldly </em>estate,\u201d &amp;c. The testator then gave all his real and personal estate to his wife for life, and afterwards made the devise in question. \u201c Item, I give unto my son \u201c <em>Paul Car\u00e9ale </em>all that my land, lying and being in the pa- \u201c rish of Dudley, in the county of Worcester, near unto a \u201c certain place called <em>Finsley </em>Hill, into three parts divided, at or immediately after my wife\u2019s decease.\u201d There was also' a legacy of five shillings to the heir at law; but <em>Paul Card\u00f3le </em>took only an estate for life. In fact, the cases in which a fee has passed without words of perpetuity, are either where a word has been used indicating the entire interest, as \u201c estate,\u201d or where the devisee has been directed to pay a rent charge, or other solid sum out of the property devised. <em>Denn </em>v. <em>Mellor </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>. The Court may conjecture that a fee was intended by the testator, \u201cbut <em>quodvoluit non </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201c dixity\u201d and they are bound to consider the series of author*t\u2019es which reject these private conjectures, and set up permanent rules of construction in their place, as the law of the land. The anonymous case in 3 <em>Dall. </em>477, turns upon the peculiar nature of an improvement under warrant in 1745. The testator, by a will of that date, devised the improvement whereon he lived to his son <em>James/ </em>and it rvas held to pass a fee. But it is well known that in 1745 such an improvement was considered, and taken in execution, as personal property; whereas the testator in this case held under a patent, which has always been deemed an absolute legal estate in fee simple.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">2. The devise passes only two thirds, and one third, of the moiety not devised to the wife. It is not a devise of the whole, subject to a prior devise of part; but it is a devise excepting a part which had been previously devised. The moiety therefore went to the heir at law upon the wife\u2019s death, and judgment should be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\"><em>For the plaintiffs. </em>The intention of the testator is to be gathered from the whole will; and although each of the peculiarities of this will may have separately occurred in cases where the devisee has taken but an estate for life, yet together they must be considered as tantamount to words of inheritance. The testator meant to devise every thing; when he intended to give but an estate for life, he did it in express terms; and when he made an exception out of the whole plantation devised to the nephews, it was an exception of the wife\u2019s life in a moiety, and nothing more. The first circumstance has always been allowed great weight in the construction of the quantity of interest subsequently devised; for after such a beginning the testator must intend to dispose of the fee. The next circumstance shews, that in the case of the nephews, he did intend a fee, because had he meant a life estate he would have copied the devise to the wife. And the third shews, that as one exception to the extent of their devise is provided for, both as to quantity of land, and duration, of estate, namely, a moiety for the wife\u2019s life, no other ex\u00bb eeption in either particular was intended. Altogether they establish an intention to give a fee. The case of <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Smiton </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>, shews the effect of using restrictive words in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>former part of the will, and dropping them afterwards. <em>Grose y. </em>says, \u201c where the devisor intended to confine the operation \u201c of the word \u201c estates,\u201d he added <em>'\u2022'\u25a0for life;\" </em>but in the latter \u201c clause there are no words of restraint added.\u201d So here, where he intended to confine the operation of the word \u201c plantation,\u201d which he thought would pass every thing, and which' is fully as descriptive of interest as \u201c estates,\u201d he added <em>ufor life;\u201d </em>but in the devise to the nephews there are no words of restraint. In <em>Loveacres </em>v. <em>Blight </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>, the Court say, although the introductory clause is not <em>alone </em>sufficient, yet it is a strong circumstance connected with other words to explain the testator\u2019s intention of enlarging a particular estate, or of passing a fee where he has used no words of limitation; and by the aid of that, and some other circumstances of no great weight, they held a fee to pass by a devise of all his lands to his two sons, freely to be enjoyed and possessed alike. In fact, as Lord <em>Mansfield </em>says in that case, the question is always a question of construction, and depends upon observations naturally arising out of the will itself. Now, can there be a doubt, if we resort to these observations, that the testator intended a fee? In universal understanding the plantation is the estate, it is the whole interest; and although, by arbitrary decisions heretofore, a devise of the plantation may, standing by itself, pass but a life estate, yet there is no decision that, with the other circumstances of this will, it would not pass a fee. The case is stronger than <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Price </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>, <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Edgeworth </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>, or <em>Lambert's Lessee </em>v. <em>Pain </em><footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark>, in each of which the devise passed a fee. In <em>Right </em>v. Sidebotham, the testator had before given the same devisee a fee in other lands by technical words, which he omitted in the devise in question; and in <em>Denn </em>v. Mellor, both the introductory clause, and the express devise for life were wanting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-4\">2. About the proportion devised there can be little doubt. It is a devise of the plantation, that is the fee, excepting out of it a life estate in a moiety. Half of the land for a life in being, is excepted out of the whole land in fee simple; which, in other words, is an immediate devise of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>moiety in fee, and the reversion of the other moiety after the wife\u2019s death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-8\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b22-10\"> <em>Doug. </em>730.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\"> <em>Cowp. 657,</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b23-9\"> <em>Doug. 732.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b23-10\"> <em>5 D. &amp; E. 562</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b24-8\"><em>2 </em>D. &amp; E. 656.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b25-5\"><em> Cowp. </em>352.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b25-6\"><em> </em>3 <em>P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcV\">This case arises on the will of <em>Seth </em>Rodgers, made the 3d <em>October </em>1757; and the question is, whether the testator\u2019s nephews took an estate in fee simple in the land devised to them. '</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">At the time of the argument of this cause in the Circuit Court of <em>Dauphin </em>county, it was supposed that the testator held the land only by <em>warrant </em>and survey, and it is probable that the court relied on that circumstance. Titles of this kind were formerly considered as <em>personal </em>estate; and accordingly it was decided in an anonymous case reported in 3 <em>Dall. </em>477, that a devise to a man\u2019s son of the \u201c improvement whereon the testator lived,\u201d without other words, passed a fee simple, because the land was held by <em>warrant </em>only. According to the most accurate account I have been able to obtain, it was about the year 1758, that these equitable titles began first to be considered as <em>real </em>estate. It is now however ascertained that the land in question was held by patent by <em>Seth Rodgers </em>at the time he made his will. It is therefore the common case of a devise by a person seised of the legal estate in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">The testator begins his will with the usual introductory clause, \u201c as for such worldly estate wherewith it has pleased u God to bless me in this life, I give, dispose and bequeath \u201c the same in the following manner.\u201d He then gives his wife one half of his plantation during her natural life; and then, after giving several legacies, comes the devise to his nephews in the following words. \u201c Also to my nephew <em>Seth </em>\u201c <em>Rodgers </em>two thirds of my plantation, excepting what is \u201c above to my wife already willed. Also to my nephew \u201c <em>Robert </em>aforesaid, one third of my plantation, excepting also \u201c what is above willed to my wife.\u201d After this follow legacies of money to several persons which it appears by the expressions of the will, the testator intended to include the whole of his personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">If I was at liberty to indulge my own conjectures', I should -think it probable that the testator intended to give a fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>feinip\u00ede to his nephews. But as this is only a conjecture, 1 know not how to get over a principle which seems well established, viz. that the inheritance shall not be taken from the heir, unless the devise contains either proper words to create a fee simple, (to the devisee and his heirs) or words which have been construed as tantamount, as to the devisee <em>for </em>ever, or all his <em>estate </em>in the land to the devisee; or unless in some other part of the will an intent is manifested inconsistent with a less estate than a fee simple, as if the devisee is directed to pay a sum of money to a third person*, Now there are no words of that kind in this will. It is a simple devise of a plantation, excepting what had been given to the wife, which as much as to say, subject to the devise of one half of the said plantation before made to the wife for life*,</p>\n<p id=\"A6A\">There are indeed the introductory words, shewing an intention to dispose of all the estate; but although such words have been relied on, in conjunction with others, yet they have not of themselves the force to give a fee simple. The last case adjudged in England, which is an authority upon this subject, is <em>Mudge\u2019s Lessee v. </em>Blight, in the year 1775. <em>Cowp. </em>352. Lord <em>Mansfield </em>in delivering his opinion, declares, that where there are no words of limitation, the devisee can take only for life, because the principle is fully settled, and no conjecture of a private imagination can shake a rule of law. If the intent is doubtful, the rule must take place; so must it, if the Court cannot find words to carry a fee, though they have no doubt of the intent. Introductory words alone, will not do. \"The opinion of Lord <em>Mansfeld </em>is entitled to great weight, because the liberality of his mind in general, and his strong inclination to carry the testator\u2019s intent into effect without regard to form, is well known. Subsequent decisions in England, though not to be regarded as authority, shew that the opinion just recited is still considered as law there. In <em>Mitchell's Lessee </em>v. Sidebotham, Doug. 730. the testator devised \u201c all his lands, tenements, and houses in the parish of <em>C.;\u2019 </em>the will had the introductory words sometimes relied on, and a devise of one shilling to the heir at law, which was certainly a strong circumstance to shew that it was intended the heir should have nothing but a shilling; but it was determined that the devisee took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>only an estate for life. In the <em>Lessee of Gaskin </em>v. <em>Gaskin, Cowp. </em>657, there was the same decision, although there were the introductory words, a devise of one shilling to the heir, and a devise of all the residue of the <em>personal </em>estate. In this case, Justice <em>Aston </em>cited <em>Wright, Lessee of Shaw </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>determined in the exchequer in 1761. After the introductory words, there was a devise of a <em>house </em>to testator\u2019s grandson A. and after his decease to his two sons B. and C., and a devise of one shilling to the husband of the heir at law; held, that B. and C. took only for life. In <em>Moor\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Mellor, </em>2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>247. and <em>5 D. </em>&amp; <em>E. </em>558, the same principle was decided by the court of King\u2019s Bench, and affirmed on a writ of error in the house of lords. I think the principle of not disinheriting the <em>heir </em>without sufficient words, ought if possible to be more strictly observed here than in <em>England; </em>because there the <em>eldest </em>son is the heir, but here the law is more equitable, and all the children together are considered as heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The case of <em>Lambert\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Paine, 3 Cranch </em>97. decided by the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, </em>was cited on the argument of this case. It was a devise of \u201c all the estate \u201c called <em>Marrowbotte </em>in the county of <em>Henry </em>containing by \u201c estimation 2500 acres.\u201d Three judges, against Judge <em>Washington, </em>held that the devisee took a fee. This opinion was founded solely on the import of the word <em>estate, </em>which has been held to refer not only to the local situation of the land, but to the <em>interest </em>which the testator had in it. The word <em>plantation </em>never was construed in that sense; and it is worthy of remark that Judge <em>Patterson, </em>in giving his opinion in <em>Lambert </em>v. Paine, thus expresses himself: \u201c some expres- \u201c sions in a will, as I give my farm, my <em>plantation, </em>my house, \u201c my land, do of themselves contain no more than a descrip- \u201c tion of the <em>thirig, </em>and carry only an estate for life.\u201d On the same principle (the import of the word estate) was decided the case <em>of Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>before Judge <em>Teates </em>at the Circuit Court of <em>Dauphm </em>county, <em>September </em>1805. The testator devised \u201c all his real estate\u201d to his five nephews, each share and share alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">In considering the case now before us, I confess it was my wish to find words which might authorize the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>that the testator\u2019s nephews <em>Seth </em>and <em>Robert Rodgers </em>took an estate in fee; but I can find no words which can be so con- ' strued, without breaking down an established principle, and thus opening a door for uncertainty and confusion. I am therefore of opinion that they took no more than an estate for life in the land devised to them, and that the judgment of the Circuit Court be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b29-3\">Brackenridge J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKD\">stated the material devises, and then proceeded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Were we at liberty to construe the above words as we would construe the words of any other writing, no doubt could be entertained but that the testator by giving the plantation, or giving any part of it, intended that gift to be to the <em>extent of the interest he had in it. </em>Because such is the meaning and acceptation of the terms, in conversation and in writing. It would be so understood by the people. But it will be said we are not at liberty to construe a will, according to the common meaning of the words; but according to the technical acceptation of the terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">It is a maxim, that the intention of the testator shall prevail; yet that must be consistent not only with the rules of law as to the extent of his gift, but with the rules of construction as to what he does give. This restraint upon alienation by devise, was unknown to the <em>Roman </em>law, and had no place in our law with regard to devises of goods and chattels. It would seem to have come from the strictness of the common law conveyance, the courts going a certain length in applying the rules of construction in one case to the other; not so far as to say \u201c that words of inheritance shall be ne- \u201c cessary to give a fee, or words of procreation an estate tail,\u201d 2 <em>Black. Com. 381.; </em>yet so far as to say, that the popular acceptation of a term shall give Way to technical construction, however inconsistent this with what is laid down by the same writer, in the same place, \u201c that a devise be favourably expounded to pursue if possible the will of the devisor, who for want of advice or learning may have omitted the proper or legal phrases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In <em>Perrin </em>v. Blake, Lord <em>Mansfield </em>observes, \u201c that as the \u201c law allows a free communication of intention to the testa- \u201c tor, it would be a strange law to say, now you have com- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201c municated that intention so as every body understand^ \u201c what you mean, yet because you have not used a certain \u201c expression of art, we will cross your intention, and give \u201c your will a different construction, though what you mean \u201c to have done is perfectly legal; the only reason for contra- \u201c vening you, is because you have not expressed yourself as \u201c a lawyer.\u201d Yet on a writ of \u00e9rror in the exchequer chamber the contrary doctrine prevailed; and it was held to be the principle, \u201c that the testator shall be permitted to fulfil \u201c his intention, so far as such construction is consistent with \u201c the established rules of construction.\u201d <em>Collec. fur. </em>229.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The inconsistency of this principle with that of \u201c serving \u201c the intention\u201d was such, that from an early period we find the courts giving a meaning to <em>terms </em>in support of the intention, which they technically had not before that time; as that the Word <em>estate </em>shall be construed to give a fee; \u201c that \u201c it shall be- understood to comprehend, not only the thing, \u201c but the interest in it.\u201d 2 <em>Peere Will. </em>524. So in <em>3 Peere Will. </em>295, where <em>temporal </em>estate is said to mean <em>-worldly </em>estate, and the <em>rest of my </em>estate, temporal estate, which without the word heirs would have sufficed to pass a fee. And in 1 <em>Wilson </em>333, after the introductory words, \u201c all my temporal estate,\u201d a devise of \u201c all the rest of my goods and \u201c chattels, real and personal, moveable and immoveable, as \u201c houses, gardens, tenements,\u201d without making use of the word estate, or any words of limitation, was held to give a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">In <em>Brown </em>v. Taylor, 1 <em>Burrows </em>270, the word <em>legacy </em>by relation is construed to carry land. Lord <em>Mansfield </em>says \u201c this \u201c is plainly a will of the man\u2019s own drawing. The explana- \u201c tion of the word legacy, must be governed by the inten- \u201c tion of the testator; and to this purpose some stress may \u201c be laid upon this introduction of the professed disposition \u201c of all his \u2018 worldly estate.\u2019 Common people do not make \u201c a distinction between money and land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">Yet in the case of <em>Mitchell </em>v. Sidebotham, <em>Doug. </em>730, this freedom of thinking would seem to have been restrained somewhat; for in this case, which was, \u201c I give and bequeath \u201c to <em>A. </em>all my lands at <em>Cf </em>it was held that an estate for life only was given, notwithstanding the introductory words, <em>u </em>for those worldly goods and estate with which it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u201c pleased God to bless me.\u201d \u201c I verily believe,\u201d says Lord <em>Mansfield', </em>\u201c that in almost every case, where by law a general\" \u201c devise of lands is reduced to an estate for life, the intent of \u201c the testator is thwarted; for ordinary people do not distin- \u201c guish between real and personal property. The rule of law \u201c however, is established and certain, that express words of \u201c limitation, or words tantamount, are necessary to pass an es- \u201c tate of inheritance.c All my estate\u2019 <em>orf </em>all my interest\u2019 will \u201c do: but \u2018 all my lands lying in such a place,\u2019 is not sufficient. \u201c Such words are considered descriptive merely of the local \u201c situation, and only carry an estate for life. Nor are words \u201c tending to disinherit the heir at law sufficient to prevent his \u201c taking, unless the estate is given to somebody else.\u201d In <em>Hogan </em>v. Jackson, <em>Cowp. 307, </em>he again admits this rule of construction, which by analogy to the law of conveyance would seem to have been adopted to some extent in the construction of devises; but he shews an astutia in giving a technical meaning to popular language in order to support the intention. It may be worth while to give his words at some length. \u201c The law of <em>England </em>formerly admitted of no tes- \u201c tamentary dispositions of <em>real </em>property. This restriction \u201c took place on the introduction of military tenures, and was \u201c a branch of the feodal doctrine of non-alienation without \u201c the consent of the Lord. But when the rigor of the re- \u201c striction became by degrees to be relaxed, and tenants were <em>(l </em>permitted to make dispositions by testament, a devise of w land operated as an appointment to uses, in nature of a u legal conveyance. As such, the courts of law in the con- \u201c struction of them, held, that a devise affecting lands could \u201c operate only on such real estates as the testator had at the \u201c time of executing and publishing his will, and not upon \u201c any after purchased or acquired lands; because there M could be no legal conveyance at common law of what a \u201c man should acquire in future. Another distinction, found- \u201c ed upon the notion that a will affecting lands is merely a \u201c species of conveyance, and derived from the same source, \u201c is this. The law of <em>England, </em>in the conveyance of real \u201c estates, requires words of limitation in the donation or \u201c grant, to the creation of a fee. Without the word <em>heirs, </em>\u201c general or special, no man can create a fee at common law u by conveyance. When wills therefore were introduced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u201c and devises of real property began to prevail, being con- \u201c sidered as a species of conveyance, they were to be govern- \u201c ed by the same rule. Therefore, by analogy to that rule, \u201c in the construction of devises, if there be no words of \u201c limitation added, nor words of perpetuity annexed, which \u201c have been held tantamount, so as to denote the intention of \u201c the testator to convey the inheritance to the devisee, he \u201c can only take an estate for life. For instance, if a testator \u201c by his will says, I give my lands, or such and such lands \u201cto <em>A.; </em>if no words of limitation are added, <em>A. </em>has only \u201c an estate for life. Generally speaking, no common person \u201c has the smallest idea of any difference between giving a \u201c person a horse and a quantity of land. Common sense \u201c alone could never teach a man the difference; but the dis- \u201c tinction now clearly established, is this, if the words of the \u201c testator denote only a <em>description </em>of the <em>specific estate </em>or \u201c <em>lands </em>devised, in that case, if no words of limitation are \u201c added, the devisee has only an estate for <em>life. </em>But if the \u201c words denote the <em>quantum </em>of <em>interest </em>or property that the \u201c test\u00e1tor has in the lands devised, there, the <em>whole </em>extent \u201c of such his <em>interest </em>passes by his gift to the devisee. The \u201c question therefore, is always a question of construction, \u201c upon the words and terms used by the testator. It is now \u201c clearly settled, that the words <em>1 all his </em>estate\u2019 will pass \u201c <em>every thing </em>a man has: but if the word \u2018 all\u2019 is coupled \u201c with the word \u2018 persona/\u2019 or a <em>local </em>description, there, the \u201c gift will pass only personalty, or the specific estate parti- \u201c cularly described.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">In <em>Fletcher </em>v. Smiton, 2 <em>Term Rep. </em>656. it was determined that the word <em>estates </em>in a will, carries a fee, unless coupled with other words which shew a different intention. Lord <em>Kenyon </em>says, \u201c there are cases in which <em>nice distinc- </em>\u201c <em>tions </em>have been taken between a devise of an estate <em>at </em>such \u201c a place, and a devise of an estate <em>in </em>a particular place; and \u201c Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>alluded to it in the case cited from <em>Vesey; </em>\u201c but he added, that there is no case in which it was held \u201c that a fee passed by the devise of an estate, if the testator \u201c added to it, 1 in the occupation of any particular tenant.\u201d \u201c And I admit that the word \u2018 estate\u2019 may be so coupled \u201c with other words as to explain the general sense in which \u201c it would otherwise be taken, and to confine it to mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201c <em>farms </em>and <em>tenements. </em>The word 4 estates\u2019 has been held 44 equivalent to 4 estate,\u2019 unless other words be added to ex-44 press a different intention. In the case of <em>Tilley </em>v. <em>Sim</em>pson, in the Court of Chancery, <em>E. </em>1746, Lord <em>Hardivicke </em>44 said, it would be productive of bad consequences to con-44 fine the devise to a chattel interest, unless there were other 44 words to shew that it was so intended to be restrained.\u201d <em>Buller </em>J. \u2014 44 This is a question merely on the intention of 44 the testator; and I think it is apparent, on reading the 44 whole, that it was his intention that every thing he had, 44 should pass by it.\u201d <em>Grose </em>J. \u2014 44 Where-the devisor inten44 ded to confine the operation of the word 4 estates,\u2019 he ad-44 ded, 4 for life;\u2019 but in the latter clause there are no words 44 of restraint added.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\">In a note to this case, we find a reference to that of <em>Tilley </em>v. <em>Simpson </em>in Chancery, <em>Easter </em>1746. The testator, after declaring that he intended to dispose of all his worldly estate, and making several devises to different persons, gave and bequeathed all the <em>rest and residue </em>of his money, goods, chattels and estate whatsoever to his nephew <em>A. B. </em>The question was, whether a beneficial interest in a real estate not before disposed of, would pass to the nephew by this devise. Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>chancellor, was of opinion that it would. He said, 44 where the court have restrained the word <em>estate </em>to 44 carry personal estate only, hath been where it hath ap44 peared that it was the intention of the testator it should be 44 so undei'stood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Yet in <em>Moor </em>v. Mellor, <em>5 T. </em>R. 559, where the devise was 44 all the rest of my lands and tenements,\u201d it was determined that but an estate for life passed. Lord <em>Kenyon </em>said, 44 had 44 there not been such a current of authorities as we find 44 in the books, since the passing of the statute of wills, to 44 further (as it has been called) the intention of the testator, 44 perhaps it would have been better if the same strict words 44 had been required in testamentary dispositions of land as 44 in those by deed; because then the language of passing 44 estates would have been so familiar that few questions 44 would have arisen on wills. For it has been often observed, 44 that few questions arise on the construction of deeds, when 44 compared to those which daily arise on wills. But we are 44 bound to consider the series of authorities on this subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201c as the law of the land; and it would be extremely danger- \u201c ous, now, to remove those landmarks of real property, on \u201c which mankind ha\\ e acted for such a length of time. In \u201c many of the cases that have been litigated, and in which it \u201c has been decided that the first devisee was only entitled \u201c to a life estate, one cannot but suspect, privately speaking, \u201c that it was the intention of the devisor to give the absolute^ \u201c property to the first taker; and Lord <em>Mansfield </em>used to \u201c observe that the common class of men imagined that they \u201c could give a fee simple by the same words that are suffi- \u201c cient to give a piece of plate. But the contrary of such a \u201c supposition has now been decided by so many authorities, \u201c that it would be dangerous to shake them; and in deciding \u201c on the construction of wills, we must not indulge in conjectures or wishes, but determine on the words used ac- \u201c cording to those authorities. Where the word \u2018 estate\u2019 has ^ occurred, that word has been held <em>ex vi termini </em>to pass a \u201c fee. The courts indeed have gone as far as they could, to \u201c give the absolute interest to the first devisee: but there are \u201c certain limits which they have put upon their construction \u201c of wills, and we must take care not to transgress them. \u201c Privately speaking, I think the devisor meant to give an \u201c estate in fee to his wife, but we are compelled by the au- \u201c thorities to say that she only took an estate for life.\u201d <em>Grose </em>J. \u2014 \u201c In the construction of wills, we must be guided \u201c by those rules which we find established in former cases. \u201c And one rule is clear, that the heir at law is not to be \u201c disinherited, unless the devisor\u2019s intention to disinherit him \u201c can be collected from the words of the will. What is a <em>u </em>sufficient proof of that intention, is not indeed accurately \u201c defined, as applicable to every case that may arise: but \u201c there are some rules laid down upon this subject, to which \u201c we are bound to adhere; and one of them is, that if a man \u201c give his house to <em>A. </em>without other words, it is only a de- \u201c vise for life, whatever may be our conjecture of the devi- \u201c sor\u2019s intention. On the authority of the cases alluded to, I \u201c am compelled to say that in this case the widow took only \u201c an estate for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">In <em>Palmer </em>v. Richards, 3 T. R. 356, Lord <em>Kenyon </em>says, \u201c the court will not anxiously seek for words to disinherit \u201c the heir at law, though they will endeavour to give effect \u201c to the intention of the testator. No person who reads this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>u </em>will, except a lawyer, can have any doubt on the meaning \u201c of it.\u201d <em>Buller </em>J. \u2014 \u201c There is hardly any case of this sort,\" \u201c where only an estate for life is held to pass, but that it \u201c counteracts the testator\u2019s intention. For where a testator \u201c uses general words, he means to dispose of every thing he \u201c has. But such is the rule of law, that unless some words \u201c are used which the law considers sufficient to carry a fee, \u201c the devisee can only take an estate for life, though indeed \u201c slight expressions are sufficient to pass the\u201d inheritance, \u201c where the Court thinks that such is the devisor\u2019s intention. \u201c No technical words are necessary in a will to give a fee; \u201c but if any words are inserted to effectuate which it is \u201c necessary that a fee should pass, that is sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In <em>Childwife </em>v. <em>Wright and </em>others, 8 <em>T. R. </em>67, there was a devise of all estate, lands, &amp;c. lying and being, &amp;c. Lord <em>Kenyon </em>observes that \u201c it has been frequently lamen- \u201c ted that the same technical words were, not required in \u201c wills as in deeds; because had such a rule been adopted, \u201c few questions .would have arisen on the construction of \u201c wills. Certain rules have been adopted by which the real \u201c property of this country has been governed for ages, and \u201c it would be too much for us now to overthrow them. I am \u201c therefore of opinion that <em>J. W. </em>only took. an estate for \u201c life.\u201d And <em>Ashhurst J. </em>remarks that \u201c it is better for the \u201c public that the intention of one individual should be de- \u201c feated, than a series of decisions on which the property of \u201c this country depends should be shaken. <em>Stare decisis </em>is a \u201c maxim in our law. Where there is a general devise of lands \u201c without any words of inheritance, the law says the devisee \u201c shall only take an estate for life, and such is the present \u201c case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">I would ask whether it has not been as much lamented, or at least as lamentable, that the maxim of <em>debet intentioni servire </em>had ever been broken in upon in the case of wills, by introducing the idea of a technical construction; and whether that has not been the cause of the uncertainty. That the compound construction of the <em>common acceptation of terms-, and the technical </em>meaning, has been the cause of uncertainty, no one can doubt. In 2 <em>Peere Will. </em>741, in the argument of sir <em>Joseph Jek-yl </em>as master of the rolls, we have these observations: \u201c I am sensible there is a diversity of opinions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201c among the learned judges of the present time, whether the \u201c\u25a0 legal operation of words in a will, or the intent of the tes- \u201c 'tator, should prevail? For my part, I shall always contend \u201c for the intention where it is plain, and I think the strongest \u201c authorities are on that side; for if the intention is sometimes \u201c to govern, as it is admitted it must, and not always give \u201c way to the legal, construction, and yet at other times shall \u201c not govern, there will then be no rule to judge by, nor will \u201c any lawyer know how to advise his client; a mischief which-\u201cjudges ought to prevent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The same question arising from the same will, where the same plaintiff was defendant, was argued and decided in the Court of Common Pleas, seven years afterwards, and is reported 1 <em>Bos. </em>&amp; <em>Pul. N. S. 342, </em>where sir <em>James MansJield </em>expresses himself thus: \u201cThis case has been long de- \u201c pending, not so much on account of any doubts entertained \u201c by my brothers, as by myself, the rest of the Court being f\u2018 of opinion that the defendant is entitled to judgment; \u201c and though I now defer to the opinion of my brothers and \u201c the judges of the Court of Ring\u2019s Bench, yet I must \u201c declare that if it had fallen to my lot onty to decide the \u201c case, I should have decided it in favour of the lessor \u201c of the plaintiff. Though I am bound therefore to say \u201c that this-is still my opinion, yet I entertain it with great \u201c doubts of its solidity. Many cases have been cited, on \u201c which it would be wasting time to observe. My brother \u201c <em>Heath, </em>indeed, has furnished me with a case which is \u201c stronger than any, but to which I never could have agreed. \u201c In almost all the cases where questions of this sort have \u201c arisen, it has been next to impossible, out of a court of \u201cjustice, to doubt of the testator\u2019s intention to give the thing \u201c absolutely to the devisee. When a man gives a house, he \u201c supposes that he gives it in the same manner as he gives a \u201c personal chattel. On the other hand, it may be said, that \u201c as the common sense of mankind proves the intention to \u201c give an absolute estate, particular circumstances indicating \u201c such intention cannot prove it more strongly than the \u201c genei-al devise; and that nothing therefore ought to be \u201c relied upon but express words in the will. And this cer- \u201c tainly is the safest side; for it cannot be denied that where \u201c wills are interpreted on the force of particular circum- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201c stances, indicating particular intentions, decisions so \u201c founded are more likely to lead to litigation than those \u201c which are founded upon adherence to the general rule, \u201c that unless there be express words of limitation, or some- \u201c thing which renders it necessary to give an estate of inhe- \u201c ritance, the heir at law shall not be disinherited. Whenever \u201c a case is decided on circumstances, others, who are to \u201c judge afterwards, may receive a different impression from \u201c the same case; whereas the adherence to a general rule is \u201c more calculated to avoid uncertainty. I am bound to think \u201c that the opinion of my brothers is founded on more solid \u201c grounds than mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\">The weight of seven judges against him, the foiir judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in the case before determined, and his three associates in the Court of Common Pleas, in the present case, led him to concede this; but I think the time not far distant, when even in those courts the rule will be otherwise. The sense which would strike the common mind generally, will be the test of the meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">In <em>Burnsal </em>v. <em>Davy, </em>1 Bos. &amp; <em>Pul. </em>Chief Justice <em>Eyre, </em>says, \u201c Technical rules are not to be relied on in explaining \u201c the intention of testators, and yet <em>cases of intention are </em>\u201c <em>much embarrassed by </em>authoritiesBut in <em>Moor </em>v. <em>Mellor, </em>2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. 250, M'Donald,, </em>Chief Baron, who delivered the opinion of the judges in <em>camera procerum, </em>lays it down, \u201c that in order to preserve uniformity, and consequently \u201c security, in administering the law of real property devised \u201c by will, it is necessary that the sense which has been put \u201c upon particular modes of expression should be adhered to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In <em>Braidon </em>v. <em>Page, </em>in a note to 1 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>261, Lord <em>Mansfield </em>is reported to have said, \u201c that there is hardly an \u201c instance, where the words of a devise are restrained to a \u201c life estate only, in which the intention of the testator is \u201c not contravened; for common men are ignorant of the \u201c difference between land and money. This being so, the \u201c courts have been astute to find out if possible from other \u201c parts of the will, the intention of the testator.\u201d And in the case to which this is a note, Chief Justice <em>Eyre </em>says, \u201cI \u201c think that we do not want the authority of cases at this \u201c time of day, to establish the rule of law, that in the con- \u201c struction of a will, whether the words used be technical or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201c not technical, or even of vulgar and common parlance, the \u201c court is to put that sense upon them, in which, on a fair \u201c consideration of the whole context, they collect that the \u201c testator intended to use them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">But to come nearer home, I extract the note of Judge <em>Tucker </em>to his 2 <em>Black. Com. </em>where he quotes <em>Pendleton </em>President, as follows: \u201c that the intention of the testator is \u201c to give the rule of construction, is declared by all the \u201cjudges both ancient and modern; but the judges, after \u201c laying down the <em>true </em>rule built upon intention, unfortu- \u201c nately admitted that if there were no words of limitation, \u201c the common law rule must prevail; by which they tied a \u201c gordian knot, which they have struggled to untie. <em>It -would </em>\u201c <em>have been better to have cut it at once.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">What has been the doctrine on this head in the state of <em>Pennsylvania? </em>From the case in 3 <em>Dall. </em>4//, the devise was to \u201c my son <em>James </em>the improvement whereon I now live.\u201d The premises were held by warrant; and the only question was, whether an estate for life or in fee vested in the testator\u2019s son <em>James </em>by the devise. The court decided that the devisee took an estate in fee. This decision is under the year 1798, and in the Supreme Court. The will under which the lessor of the plaintiff claimed, is stated to be of the 8th of <em>October 1745. </em>Whether this decision was on the ground of considering the subject of the devise real property, or but a chattel interest, does not appear; though how it could be considered otherwise than as real estate, though with but an equitable title, I do not know. A bare <em>improvement </em>might have been considered as a chattel interest at a certain period, and I believe was by some, so that an inquisition was not necessary to condemn; but I do not know that any idea of this kind prevailed, where there was the inception of an office right. Be that as it may, <em>lam prepared to go the whole length of declaring independence of the decisions ofthe </em>English <em>courts^ subjecting the construction of a will to technical rules.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">In this case however it may not be necessary, if the technical construction will support the intention of the testator. There is left to the widow one half of the plantation <em>during her natural life; </em>to <em>Seth </em>two thirds of the plantation, except what is above to the wife already willed; and to <em>Robert </em>one third, &amp;c. This must be a <em>remainder </em>of at least one half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the plantation. Will not such a devise in remainder carry a fee? According to <em>Wallace </em>v. Jackson, <em>Cowper </em>290, on a devise of lands to the mother during her natural life, and after legacies and annuities to the heir at law and to several relations, a devise to the mother of \u201c all the remainder and \u201c residue of all his <em>effects </em>real and personal,\u201d the mother took a fee simple by this residuary clause, in all the testator\u2019s fee simple estates. It must be admitted there was a technical term in this case, effects, which had been holden to be equivalent to estate, and to carry a fee; and also the words \u201c remainder\u201d and \u201c residue;\u201d and the stress of the decision in,favour of the widow is laid upon these words.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">But it seems to be a rule, of even technical construction, that if it can be collected from the words of the will, what were the ideas of the testator with regard to the effect of the terms used by him, that sense shall prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In <em>Bowes </em>v. Blacket, <em>Cowp. </em>239, Lord <em>Mansfield </em>agrees that \u201c if from the whole of the will taken together, and ap- \u201c plied to the subject matter of the devise, it can be found \u201c that the testator\u2019s intention was to give a fee, it has been \u00ab very properly and very truly admitted at the bar, that it \u201c ought to be so construed as to give effect to such inten- \u201c tion.\u201d Now it is clear from the limitation tb the widow <em>during her natural </em>life, that he had conceived that but for this, the giving one half of the plantation would have carried a fee of that half. Independent therefore of the ordinary use of language, there is here evidence, <em>ex visceribus </em>testamenti, of the extent and meaning affixed in the mind of the testator to the devise of a plantation. It follows, by necessary implication from the qualification, that he thought, that by giving a plantation, without saying more, he would give a fee. It may seem, therefore, that we have at least some countenance from the rules of technical construction, and that we are not altogether without legal help in eliciting the testator\u2019s intention in this case. At a dead lift therefore, I think this may do: and that without infringing on the doctrine of the <em>cabala </em>in substance, we may say that, by the word <em>plantation </em>a fee under this will may pass, since the <em>expressio </em>unius, natural life, <em>est inclusio </em>alterius, which must be something more; and if any thing more, it cannot be less than a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"Al0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>I should, be much better satisfied to go back at once, an&lt;^ ^egin where the courts have gone wrong-, and to take the meaning of- a will as I would that of any other writing-. It will not bear examination to say, that this will lead to controversy; or if it did, how does it reconcile contradiction, <em>to say that intention shall govern, and yet set it aside. </em>It is inconsistent with the nature of the case to suppose, that a man <em>in extremis </em>can have the benefit of legal assistance, or that in ordinary cases, where he does not call for it, he ever thinks of legal terms or the want of them; he uses the words of common language, and ought to be so understood. Courts will differ about the meaning and effect of a legal term, and there is a much greater chance of a concurrence of opinion on the popular import of a word.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">I am confident there will be a beginning some time of emancipation from this affectation of mystery, in a science which has its foundation in reason and common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">As to estates having passed under this or that will, and the decisions thereupon, let what has taken place stand; why should it affect wills yet to be construed, or yet to be made? And this is the only consideration that can 'stand in the way, or can constitute an impediment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In the case before us the particular estate hewn out of the whole, <em>the one half of the plantation to the,xoife during her natural </em>life, and the devise of two thirds to <em>Seth, </em>and one third to <em>Robert, excepting xvhatwas devised to the xuife, </em>implies a devise <em>of all but xvhat is excepted, </em>and this is a fee simple in the whole after the expiration of the life estate. On the breaking of this case, and on the argument, I was inclined to think that on. the decisions of the <em>English </em>courts, there was but a life estate by the words of the devise; but of the intention I had no doubt; and with a willingness to support the intention, I may perhaps have gone farther than the strictness of technical construction in the <em>English </em>courts may warrant. But upon the whole, in support of the intention in this case, I will venture to give judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The Court being thus divided in opinion, Mr. <em>Duncan </em>for the defendant .observed, that judgment could not be entered for the plaintiffs unless a majority of the court concurred therein; the judgment in the Circuit Court having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>entered by consent, without prejudice, and without even hearing an argument on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<author id=\"b41-5\">Ye ates J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkO\">thereupon said, that he thought the case had come up by appeal from the opinion he had delivered, though the defendant\u2019s counsel had not argued the case. But if any misunderstanding prevailed on that point, he had no hesitation in declaring that he adhered to the opinion he had formerly given. The introductory words in the will he looked upon as a <em>strong </em>circumstance, when aided by the <em>manner </em>in which the testator had devised his plantation. When he meant to give an estate for life therein, he expressly said so; and his silence as to the extent of the estate devised to his two nephews, evinced that he meant to give them an estate in fee simple, as fully and absolutely as he himself held it. Judging on the whole of the will, he apprehended that the intention of the testator might be fairly collected from thence to give his nephews an estate of inheritance in his plantation, without infringing the settled rules of construction of wills, which had obtained either here or in the <em>English </em>courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
