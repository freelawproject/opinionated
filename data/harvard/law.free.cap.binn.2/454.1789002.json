It would be a precedent, that would involve us in endless difficulties. That a judge has given an opinion before, is not a cause of challenge; and as the judge who is interested, may qualify himself, I cannot, because he refuses to do it, interfere with the rights of a third person. I cannot answer it to those to whom I am answerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
