The creditors of <em>Kean </em>took out a domestic attachment against his property, and by virtue of it sold the tract to the lessor of the plaintiff. The defendant then sold his 100 acres to one <em>Farrell </em>to whom he gave possession, and he retained possession of the residue himself. The question was whether the plaintifF could recover, as he had not completed the title of <em>Farrell </em>before the ejectment was brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-10\"><em>Baldwin </em>for the defendant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai-\">contended that as the plaintiff asked equity in this suit, he ought not to be permitted to take away the defendant\u2019s possession, until the 100 acres were confirmed, or security given to make the title good.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-11\">\n<em>Foster contra</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUp\">insisted that the defendant had disavowed the article of agreement, by getting a- survey in his own name, and claiming the whole land; and of course that he had no equity.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b102-12\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AXU\">The defendant ought to be secured in the 100 acres according to the article; and that may be done <em>by-ordering </em>stay of execution until the title is secured.
