Riddle {or </em>the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-u\">argued that the evidence first objected to was inadmissible, because its object was to set up the opinions of witnesses against the settled law of the land. The law of <em>England </em>in relation to common carriers, he said was the law of <em>Pennsylvania; </em>it had been adopted in. practice, and it was sanctioned by the soundest policy. The <em>degree </em>of a carrier\u2019s liability was of the essence of his office. He might accept specially as to value, or as to the quality of the thing carried; but take from him his liability for every thing but inevitable accident, and the act of a public enemy, and he was no longer a common carrier, but a mere bailee; in which case, the proof of negligence lying exclusively in his own power, all those frauds against which the common law has established so complete a barrier, might be practised beyond the possibility of detection. Hence it was a maxim that every carrier for hire was a common carrier, unless there was a special exception in the contract, <em>Coggs </em>v. <em>Bernard </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>and to the contract alone the court should have looked for the extent of the defendant\u2019s liability in the present case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-6\"><em>Riddle </em>was here .stopped by the court, who desired the defendant\u2019s counsel to speak to the second exception..</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Huston </em>and <em>Duncan</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYy\">then argued that the evidence last admitted was proper, because it went to prove the opinion of the plaintiff himself, with regard to the custom for which the defendant contended. The whole case turned upon the existence of a custom in relation to carriers by water, varying from the law of <em>England. </em>This custom was to be proved by witnesses intimate with the subject, by their opinions understanding and belief founded upon this intimacy, and by their practice in cases to which the custom applied; the practice of the plaintiff was therefore a recognition of the rule, and corroborated the testimony before given. The material \u00a1joint was then the admission of the testimony first offered; for if it was correct, the acts of the plaintiff in confirmation of it, were evidence. As to the existence of the custom, it might be remarked that the verdict of the jury established it; but where could be the objection to it upon principles. A common carrier might limit his own liability by special provision, and take his case out of the general rule. <em>Bull. N. P. 71. Gibbon </em>v. <em>Paynton </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>He is liable on account of his reward. It might as well therefore be the object of a particular custom to limit his liability, and by so doing, to diminish his reward, as the object of a special contract. The restriction of the custom to water carriers in a certain part of the state, was no objection to it. A custom might apply only to a certain description of men; as the custom of the way-going crop among.farmers, <em>Wigglesworth v. Dallison </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>it might apply to a particular county, <em>Furneaux </em>v. <em>Hutchins </em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>and in these cases the particular custom would control the general rule. <em>Peak's Ev. </em>319. The admission of the evidence was the more proper, because it was not known that there had ever been a decision in Pennsylvania, upon the liabilityof carriers by water. [Yeates J. In <em>Lea </em>v. <em>Stroud, </em>before <em>M'Kean </em>Chief Justice and mv'self in <em>Northumberland </em>county, the plaintiff recovered upon the principles of the common law, on a <em>carrying by water.]</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-8\">\n<em>Piddle</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXA\">answered that the plaintiff\u2019s act was not evidence, even by the defendant\u2019s argument, because the evidence was simply that he had refused to pay a loss. There might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>have been a special contract, and a variety of circumstances to justify the refusal upon the ground of the common law.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b81-11\"> 2 <em>Ld.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvS\">after stating the exceptions, and that the court would give no opinion but upon the last, delivered judgment upon that point, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We are very clear that this exception was well founded. What the plaintiff and another person had done in the transaction alluded to, was totally irrelevant to the issue joined, and the evidence could only tend to draw the attention of the jury from the point before them, and perhaps to influence their minds. It has been contended that the evidence was proper, as it tended to corroborate the testimony given before, touching the custom of the country, by shewing that in the plaintiff\u2019s own opinion, a carrier was not liable for losses which happened without his neglect or want of skill. But this is not the case; for it does not appear that the plaintiff and <em>MlIlvaine </em>received any compensation for the goods in their vessel, nor whether or not the loss happened by the act of God, nor whether they were carried under a special agreement, as is often the case. In short it does not appear that they were to be considered in any respect in the light of common carriers. This kind of evidence was the more im-. proper, as it was taking the plaintiff by surprize; for he had no reason to suppose that a matter quite foreign from the business in question, would be made the subject of inquiry. On this exception our opinion is that the judgment of the court of Common Pleas be reversed. On the other exceptions we decline giving any opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Judgment reversed. <em>Venire de </em>novo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
