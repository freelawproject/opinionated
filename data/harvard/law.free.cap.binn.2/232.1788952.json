In the same month the general issue was pleaded in the original, and in <em>January </em>1807 the cause was tried, and a verdict ob-tamed by the plaintiff. The plea of <em>comperuit ad diem </em>was then entered in this action, and the issue upon it was tried by a jury.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> On the trial of the cause, the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge the jury, that the filing a declaration, accepting a plea, joining issue, and taking a verdict in the original action, were conclusive evidence to prove a waiver of special bail, and the acceptance of a common appearance, and that they were a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action. But the courtTefused, and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AbW\"><em>Milnor </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7G\">said it had been conceded by the court below, that the proceedings in the original action would have amounted to a waiver of special bail, but for the entry on the docquet in <em>March </em>1806. That this entry was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>not an agreement, but merely the consent of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to an act, which the defendants did not choose to' perform, and therefore it did not affect the general principle. That it was in the power of the plaintiff to accept the defendants\u2019 appearance,s or to insist upon bail; taking a plea and proceeding to trial admitted the defendants to be in court, and to be in a condition to plead and try, and this was accepting a common appearance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-4\"><em>S. Levy </em>for the defendant in error</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFvf\">insisted, that inasmuch as the bail were liable for debt and costs when the entry was doequeted, the plaintiff having their lost a trial in the original suit, <em>Orton </em>v. <em>Vincent </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>it could be considered in no other light than as an agreement by the defendants\u2019 attorney for his clients\u2019 benefit; and the acceptance of a plea immediately after the agreement, confirmed this construction. That the principle of waiver did not however apply to this case, as the bond was put in suit before the plea was entered, and the bail was fixed; and that at all events the waiver was not a bar under the issue of <em>comperuit ad diem, </em>but the defendants\u2019 only remedy was by motion to the court. <em>Caton </em>v. <em>M'Carty </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AqY\"> This was said to be by consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> Cowp. <em>71.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AeW\"> 2 <em>Dall. </em>141.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b241-5\">Tilghman C.

The bail bond was forfeited and put in suit, before the implied waiver by accepting a plea took place; and if the defendant was desirous to take advantage of it, he should have applied to the court below by <em>7notion, </em>to set aside or stay proceedings in the bail bond suit, when justice might have been done according to the circumstances. We must not be understood however to give any sanction to trying matter of record by a jury; but it having been by consent, we do not think it necessary in this instance to notice it.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
