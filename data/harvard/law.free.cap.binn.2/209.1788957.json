But they were a second time objected to, upon the ground that it ought first to be proved that <em>Grier </em>was lieutenant colonel of the regiment, which could be done only by shewing his commission; and the court being of this opinion, the evidence was rejected, and the defendant tendered a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-5\"><em>Frazer </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah7\">contended that the most reasonable construction of the law should be adopted, for the protection of officers, since the militia system was throughout compulsory upon them, and in this particular case the defendant was bound by the 19th section, under a severe penalty, to issue his warrant to the constable within ten days after the sentence of the court of appeals. The question is, not whether the proceedings were conclusive as to what they set forth, but whether the defendant was not entitled to read them in evidence without producing the commission of a third person. They should have been read upon two grounds. 1. Because they were the proceedings of an inferior court of record, which required no proof but the signature of the judges. 2. Because the parol proof was equal to if not better than the commission required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\">1. The court was constituted by the 17th section of the militia law, .with power to sentence military delinquents to a fine, the payment of which may be enforced by imprisonment; and it is therefore an inferior court of record. Such must have been the opinion of the legislature, or they could not have thought it necessary by the 18th section to provide that no <em>certiorari </em>should issue to remove its proceedings to any court in the commonwealth, nor would they have spoken of its decisions by the name of <em>sentences </em>and decrees, of which they prohibit all courts from taking cogni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>zance in the way of appeal. Such also is the result upon the \"principles of the common law, by which every jurisdiction erected <em>de novo </em>with power to fine and imprison, is a court of record. <em>Groenvelt </em>v. <em>Burwell </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>. 3 Bl. Comm. </em>24. That the fine is fixed by law, is no objection, because so it is in a variety of cases cognizable by the quarter sessions; nor is it of any moment, that the judges exercise the jurisdiction by way of appeal, and do not issue the warrant to execute their own decrees, because they constitute the only tribunal for definitively fixing the militia fines, and it is in fact their sentence which is executed by the warrant of the captain. Being thus an inferior court of record, the proof in question should not have been asked of the defendant, who was not sued as a member of the court, but for his independent act. Had the members of the court been sued in trespass, their authority might have been questioned; but since they had jurisdiction as to the matter of fines, unless their want of jurisdiction as to the person or place appeared on the record, the defendant was not a trespasser, whatever were the errors of the court; <em>Bull. N. P. </em>83; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Huntingdon </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em>; The case of the Marshalsea </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>; particularly after the appeal had gone by. <em>Durant </em>v. <em>Boys </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-7\"><em>2. </em>It is the duty of the <em>commanding </em>officer, not of the lieutenant colonel particularly, to appoint the court. Who was the commanding officer, is a matter in pais, to be proved by parol, and not by the commission. Besides, the commanding officers of regiments do not derive their authority from their commission, but from their election by the militia, which distinguishes this from the common case of a commissioned officer; and there is in the very act under which the defendant justified, a recognition by the legislature that <em>Grier </em>commanded the 27th regiment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-8\"><em>Hemphill </em>and <em>Ross </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARU\">The plaintiff below was imprisoned by the act of Wilson, who was desirous to justify under a paper signed by himself 'and two others as a court of appeals; and the point is, whether to make that paper evidence, it was necessary to shew that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>court \u201chad a lawful existence. The questions then are, 1. Whether the proceedings of the court are even <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the court\u2019s authority. 2. Whether sufficient proof \u2018was given <em>dehors.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-4\"><em>1. </em>The court of appeal has none of the properties of a court of record. The only circumstance relied upon to give it this character, is the power to fine and imprison, which it does not possess. The fine is incurred before a return is made to the court, and its authority is exclusively confined to the <em>remission </em>of it, and that for the specified causes of sickness, lameness, or unavoidable necessity, and no other. It has no power whatever to punish, but only in a limited way to mitigate punishment; and it is this which distinguishes the present case from <em>Groenvelt </em>v. <em>Burwell, </em>where Lord <em>Holt </em>limits his principle thus, that where a man has power to <em>punish </em>another for his offence by fine and imprisonment, he has judicial authority; and when a court is erected with this authority, it is a court of record. The court of appeals moreover have no authority to imprison; it is the captain who issues the warrant, not upon their sentence, for they never decree any \"thing but a remission; but upon the sentence of the law, where the court do not interfere. The proceedings not being evidence, it became the duty of the defendant in an action of trespass to prove every thing. If a man justify a trespass as justice of the peace, he must shew his commission. <em>Esp. Dig. 741. </em>If a court martial exceeds its jurisdiction, the members are trespassers, and so is the officer executing their warrant. <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Withers </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>. It </em>is therefore necessary to shew jurisdiction, which cannot be shewn unless the legal existence of the court is first proved. Even the judges of a superior court, must shew their authority, if sued in trespass. <em>Gwinne </em>v. <em>Poole </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-6\">2. Whether <em>Grier </em>was commanding officer within the law, was not a fact to be proved by parol. If it were immaterial whether he commanded lawfully or unlawfully, it might be so; but the question is, was he lawfully appointed commander. And of this the commission was the best evidence. He might have been elected, but unduly; he might have commanded, but unlawfully; the best evidence of his valid elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>tion and of his lawful command, was the commission. It was not only the best evidence, <em>Peake Ev. </em>8, but it is almost impossible to shew an appointment otherwise than by proving a commission. <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>As to the recognition in the act of assembly, it amounted to nothing, because the law was passed in 1802, and the question was as to his command in 1803.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-8\">\n<em>Erazer</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ6\">in reply said, that however judges of a court of record might be forced to shew their commissions when personally sued in trespass, it certainly was not the case with the prothonotary who issued the writ, in which relation the defendant might be considered as standing to the court of appeals. In <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison </em>the appointing and commissioning power were the same, and therefore the commission was almost essential to the proof of the appointment. Here the election was by one body, and the commission by another; so that there might be a valid election and command without a commission.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\"><em> </em>1 <em>Ld.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhzW\">delivered the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay0\">This action was brought in the Common Pleas of <em>Chester </em>county, by <em>David John </em>the defendant in error against <em>James Wilson </em>the plaintiff in error, for a trespass in issuing a warrant as captain of the militia, by virtue, of which the plaintiff below was arrested. The defendant justified under the militia law, passed 6th <em>April </em>1808; and in the course of his defence, offered in evidence a paper writing, purporting to be the proceedings of a court of appeals, which was objected to by the plaintiff, and overruled by the court. This is the first exception in the cause. The law directs that the court of appeals shall consist of three commissioned officers, to be appointed by the commanding officer of the regiment, who shall, when sitting, be under oath or affirmation to perform their duty with fidelity and impartiality. The Court of Common Pleas were of opinion it should be proved, not only that the members of the court were officers, by producing their commissions, but also that they took the oath prescribed by law. In this we think they were right. This court is of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>nature of special commissioners, and not a court of record as the defendant\u2019s counsel have contended. It is said they have _ . . . .. . , . , ... ... power to fine and imprison, which is the distinguishing quality of a court of record. But they have no such power. Their authority is limited to <em>remitting the fines </em>of such appellants, as shall give satisfactory proof, that their nonattendance on the days appointed for exercising the militia, was occasioned by \u201c lameness, sickness, or unavoidable neu cessity.\u201d It was necessary therefore to prove, before the proceedings of this court were read in evidence, that they were legally constituted, and had pursued the law in all material points.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The Court of Common Pleas having delivered their opinion on this point, the defendant gave evidence that the court of appeals had taken the oath prescribed, and then offered their proceedings in evidence again; at the same time offering parol testimony, that lieutenant colonel Grier, by whom they were appointed, was commanding officer of the regiment. The court rejected the evidence a second time, because the commission of lieutenant colonel <em>Grier </em>was not produced. In this also we think they were right. A man may assume command without lawful authority. The lawful authority is the commission, and that is to be proved by producing it in court. Our opinion therefore is that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
