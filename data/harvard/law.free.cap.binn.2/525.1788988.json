The instances in which chancery and our own courts have subjected lands to the payment of legacies, come within one of the following classes. Where the expressions of the testator are clear to that effect; <em>Tomkins </em>v. <em>Tomkins </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>, Trott </em>v. <em>Vernon </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>, <em>Alcock </em>v. <em>Sparhawk </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>, <em>Astley </em>v. <em>Powis </em><footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark>, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Gardiner </em><footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark>, <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Brittnell </em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>or where he leaves no personalty, <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Postlethwait </em><footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark>; or it is a provision for a wife or child, <em>Lypet </em>v. <em>Carter </em><footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark>; or where a fraud is intended by the residuary devisee, <em>Elliot </em>v. Hancock, <footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark>; or lastly where the words of the testator, if applied to real estate, would charge it with debts; <em>Thomas </em>v. Brittnell, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Chitty </em><footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-14\">In the present case the expressions are far from being clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>to that effect. The testator directs that his just debts and funeral expenses shall be paid, but says nothing about the payment of his legacies. He does not enjoin any one to see <em>Ais -whole -willperformed, </em>as in <em>Alcock </em>v. <em>Sparhawk; </em>nor does he commence his residuary devise, <em>after my debts and legacies paid, </em>as in <em>Davis </em>v. Gardiner, <em>Tomkins </em>v. <em>Tomkins, </em>and. <em>Trott </em>v. <em>Vernon; </em>but he gives the residue as a specific surplus of real and personal property not before devised. <em>Bagwell </em>v. <em>Dry </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>, Doe </em>v. <em>Underdown </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em>, Hogan </em>v. <em>Jackson </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>, <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Knott </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em>, Ridout </em>v. <em>Paine </em><footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark>. \u201c The \u201c rest and residue here pass as a specific devise, in the same \u201c manner as the next preceding devise did to the devisee \u201c thereof, and are to be understood, the residue of what he \u201c had not before particularly devised, not the residue after \u201c debts and legacies paid.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Meyrick </em><footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark>. The intention of Mr. <em>Melchor </em>is apparently the other way. If the land was to be charged with the legacies, why did he direct the legacy of <em>Maria Vandeeren </em>to be put out upon <em>good real security?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApP8\">The testator was possessed of personal property; and therefore there is no presumption, as in the second class of cases, of a design to charge the land. The sum of 1500/. due from a debtor in France, was thought more than sufficient to pay the legacies; and although subsequent circumstances have overthrown the calculation, the probability that the testator did so calculate, is sufficient to shelter the lands, this sum of 1500/. being exclusive of what very nearly paid his debts. <em>Knightly </em>v. <em>Knightly </em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-7\">This legacy is not a provision for wife or child, as in <em>Lypet </em>v. <em>Carter; </em>on the contrary, it will encumber the property of a sister with a bequest of 500/. to one in no way related to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-8\">The residuary devisees have made no improper disposition of the fund legally chargeable with the legacies. The debts have been partly paid by the personal property, and the rest by the law of <em>Pennsylvania </em>must come upon the lands. Hut the pecuniary legatees cannot take the place of the debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u00bbn the real estate. The devisees of the land are as specific devisees, and it was as much the testator\u2019s intention that they should have the land, as that the legatees should have their legacies. <em>Clifton v. Burt </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>, <em>Herne </em>v. <em>Meyrick </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjP\">Nor would the words of this will in <em>England </em>charge the land with the debts; <em>\u00e1 fortiori </em>it cannot charge it with the legacies. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Britnell, Williams </em>v. <em>Chitty, Eyles </em>v. <em>Carey </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>, <em>Shallcross </em>v. <em>Finden </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The act of assembly, of 21 <em>March </em>1772, 1 <em>Si. Laws </em>631, does not alter the case. It affords a remedy to the legatee, but it leaves the question as it stood, whether lands or chattels are to be the fund. Debts are undoubtedly chargeable on the lands, because as to them lands are chattels; but the. doctrine of charging them with legacies, stands as in <em>England, </em>where a clear and manifest intention is always required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-5\">2. <em>Maria Hassanclever </em>has an estate for life prior to the distribution of the residuum, and therefore prior to the payment of the legacies, if they are charged on that residuum. The testator has postponed his brothers and sisters to the life estate of this favourite devisee; and it is rational to presume the same limitation of his bounty to those not so near him. <em>Whole </em>means whole <em>estate, </em>and not whole residue. The antecedent words at the beginning of the clause, are not to be so imperative as to control the intention, collected with more certainty from the spirit of the will at large. <em>Phipps </em>v. <em>Annesley </em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-8\"><em>Adams </em>and <em>Ingersoll </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2Q\">1. The intention of the testator is in this case the sole guide. He certainly designed to pay his legacies, and every line of the will proves that he intended to subject his whole estate to the payment. In the first place he has blended the two funds together, which is of decisive influence. <em>Roper on Leg. </em>197. <em>Kidney </em>v. <em>Cousmaker </em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The language of the lord chancellor is, \u201c where a testator combines real with personal estate \u201c generally, there is no doubt that all the burthens of the \u201c personal, should be put upon this so combined with it. \u201c There are many cases for that.\u201d If there is no fund but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>real estate, it is agreed to be chargeable; what other result should there be when the testator treats both funds as one?' In <em>England </em>land is more sacred than personalty, and to charge it with simple contract debts or legacies, requires the assent of the testator; but in this state it is as chattels for the payment of debts, and therefore should not be exempted with extraordinary care, from the same liability to legacies. In the present will, lands and personalty are confounded. The testator bequeaths legacies, devises lands, and in one clause, and to the same persons, he gives every thing of which he had not already made a disposition. There is no one of the cases read which comes up to this. In <em>Masters </em>v. <em>Masters </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the strong expression of the master of the rolls is, that the estate should be so marshalled, that as far as possible, <em>the whole will might take </em>effect, <em>and all the legacies be paid. </em>The testator has done the same thing by putting both funds into one. <em>Herne </em>v. <em>Meyrick </em>amounts to this only, that lands are not liable unless charged. <em>Clifton v. Burt </em>declares that the intention of the testator shall not be disappointed, the legacies being charged on. copyhold. The case of <em>Clowdsly </em>v. <em>Pelham </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is stronger than the present. One devised land to <em>A </em>and the heirs of his body, remainder over, and in another part of his will bequeathed to <em>A </em>all his personal estate, and made him executor, willing- him to pay his debts. Though the clause as to the payment of debts seemed to relate to the personal estate only, and though the lands were devised to the defendant in tail, and it was objected that tenant in tail could not be a trustee, yet the court decreed both real and personal estate to be sold for the payment of debts. Now the same words will charge legacies as well as debts, which makes this case conclusive. The funds are here given to the same persons, and the lands arc in fee, so that it is a matter of indifference in the abstract, from which fund the legacies are paid, which was not exactly the case in <em>Clowdsly </em>v. <em>Pelham. </em>In <em>Eyles </em>v. <em>Carey </em>the charge upon the land was excluded by a special condition to pay a certain rent. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Brittnell </em>proves that an implied charge on real estate may be explained by a subsequent clause, which does not exist here. <em>Knight</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number><em>ly </em>v. <em>Knightly </em>was a bill to come upon the land specifically devised in the body of the will, to which this residuary clause cannot be compared; for here, \u201c rest and residue,\u201d unlike the cases of <em>Doe </em>v. Underdown, and <em>Bagwell </em>v. Dry, is a floating sum, likely to be increased by the lapse of some of the legacies, and therefore uncertain. If all the legacies are paid, the residue must be less; if not, then more. Can a devise of this kind be called specific, or can there be a doubt that it must pay the legacies, when it is upon their payment, that its quantum depends? <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Freeman </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>, Hockly </em>v. <em>Mawby </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>. The land devised to <em>Horatio </em>Lawrence, is a devise which might make <em>Knightly </em>v. <em>Knightly </em>applicable. What is meant by the residue of the personal estate? That which is left after payment of the debts andlegacies. But \u201crest and residue\u201d are applied to both funds. Can they include the payment of legacies in the one, and not in the other? Have they different meanings in the same sentence? It would be strange, says Lord Kenyon, if the same words should have different meanings when applied to real and personal estate. It is not so, if the estates are to go together to the same persons. 2 <em>Fearne </em>195 (362). <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Meyrick </em>is a full recognition of the general rule, that \u201c rest and residue\u201d means after debts and legacies paid. The rule in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Underdown </em>is correct, that things are to be taken as they were at the time of making the will; but here was a small personal, and larger real estate, the former insufficient to pay the debts within a very short time after the making of the will, and therefore probably so known to the testator. If the legacies were not to be paid out of the land, they were a mockery of benevolence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-16\">2. The second point is necessarily connected with the first; but there is in addition, a <em>time </em>annexed to the payment of the legacies. If the life estate is prior to the legacies, they cannot be paid within a year after the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b537-15\"><em> Prec, in Chan. </em>397.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"Ajn\"> <em>id. </em>430.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"Aqht\"> 2 <em>Vern. </em>228.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"ACUe\"><em> </em>1 <em>Ves. </em>496.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"A32\"> 2 <em>P.
