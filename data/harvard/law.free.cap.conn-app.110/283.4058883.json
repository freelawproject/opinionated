J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au5\">The pro se plaintiff, Eugene P. Mercer, appeals from the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendants, Katishia Cosley, Burchell Henry, Paul Lewis and Jerry Martin and their employer, Tribune Television Company, also known as WTIC FOX-61 (collectively FOX-61), and Thomas M. O\u2019Brien and his employer, Outlet Broadcasting, Inc., doing business as WVIT NBC-30 (collectively NBC-30). On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) failed to recuse itself, sua sponte, on the basis of judicial bias and (2) rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs libel claim. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and relevant procedural history. The plaintiff is an inmate serving a forty-five year sentence for felony murder. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>208 Conn. 52, 53-54, 544 A.2d 611 (1988). In July, 2004, the plaintiff filed an action against the state in the Superior Court, seeking treatment for physical symptoms related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and claiming discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that action, the plaintiff claimed, in part, that he \u201chas [AIDS] resultant from his [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)] infection\u201d and that the state had discriminated against him in denying his \u201crequest for the reasonable accommodation of testosterone gel in January, 2004, [when] the . . . request for testosterone gel was for the treatment of HIV-hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction . . . .\u2019\u2019He also alleged that the state \u201cknew or should have reasonably known that the plaintiffs medical record reflects multiple instances over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>course of several years concerning his decreased spontaneous erections, erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle mass and strength\u201d and that the testosterone gel \u201crestores sexual function, and muscle mass and strength and prevents bone loss.\u201d The plaintiff also filed two cases with the commission on human rights and opportunities in 2004, claiming, in part, that he suffers from \u201cVacuolar Myelopathy, Peripheral Neuropathy and HIV-[h]ypogonadism or erectile dysfunction,\u201d and that he \u201chas been denied diagnosis and treatment of impotence and/or HIV-[h]ypogonadism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On May 25, 2005, defendants NBC-30 and FOX-61 each aired a report regarding Governor M. Jodi Rell\u2019s order that the department of social services stop providing Viagra and other similar drugs to sexual offenders through the Medicaid program. They also discussed the plaintiffs complaints against the state during these reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In response, the plaintiff filed the present action against the defendants claiming, in relevant part,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> libel per se,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-237.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint alleged, inter alia: \u201c1. The plaintiff ... is currently an inmate incarcerated at the Connecticut correctional institution\u2014Osborne. [The] [p]laintiff files this action against the [defendants] with claims of libel per se and [other additional claims] ....</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201c6. . . . [The defendants] acted with actual malice and reckless disregard of the truth and negligence in their broadcast of false allegations [and] defamatory statements ....</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u201c12. During the ten o\u2019clock news . . . broadcast on Wednesday, May 25, 2005, [t]he defendants] . . . made individual and separate defamatory and slanderous statements [t]hat [the] plaintiff is suing . . . the [s]tate or the [department of [correction for Viagra, for treatment of [the] plaintiffs erectile dysfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u201c13. [The] [defendants Cosley and Henry [p]ublicly disclosed during their broadcasting the plaintiffs confidential HIV-related information .... A photograph of the plaintiff was also publicly displayed during the defendant[s\u2019] broadcast[s]. In addition to their television broadcastfs], the defendant[s] have published the defamatory and slanderous statements] through the Internet ....</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u201c14. . . . [T]he defendant[s\u2019] broadcast[s] [were] about or in response to Governor Jodi Rell\u2019s order to the state [department of [s]ociai [sjervices to make sure state medical assistance programs do not cover the cost of erectile dysfunction drugs for registered sex offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u201c15. In addition to their actual malice, defamatory and slanderous statements, the defendants placed the plaintiff in a false light as a registered sex offender and exposed the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or aversion and induced . . . unsavory opinions of the plaintiff in the minds of a substantial number of the general public and the prison community.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u201c16. . . . With malice in [public] broadcasting and publishing false accusations with defamatory and slanderous statements [the plaintiff] has [been] prejudiced ... in his reputation within the general public and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>prison community, and [the defendants have] placed the plaintiffs life ... in danger by intimidation and threat of physical harm by inmates of the prison population who perceive the plaintiff as a sex offender and/ or homosexual willing to infect other prisoners with HIV by engaging in sexual activities with the aid of [V]iagra, as well as harassment and intimidation of correctional officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u201c17. The plaintiff does not have, nor did the plaintiff ever have, any lawsuits against the state . . . for [V]iagra as a treatment for erectile dysfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u201c18. The plaintiff is not a sex offender or a registered sex offender, and is not a recipient of any state medical assistance programs. The plaintiff is a ward of the state [department of [c]orrection and receives all medical care from the [University of Connecticut] [c]orrectional [m]anaged [c]are contract. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u201c19. The plaintiff does have a pending lawsuit in [the] New Britain Superior Court, [Docket] No. CV-04-4000197-S against officials of the [department of correction] for discrimination based on disability . . . for their failure to diagnose and treat HIV-[h]ypogonadism and/or erectile dysfunction .... There is no allegation or request in the above mentioned complaint for [V]iagra. Rather, the treatment requested was testosterone gel and/or a urology consultation and appropriate therapy as would be prescribed by the urology consult.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u201c20. The plaintiff also has two pending complaints with the commission of [h]uman [r]ights and [opportunities, CHRO No. 0540397 and 0540398 against [the department of correction and the University of Connecticut Health Center/Correctional managed health care], respectively for discrimination based on disability . . . for their failure to diagnose and treat HIV-[h]ypogonadism and/or erectile dysfunction .... There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>allegation or request in the above mentioned . . . complaints] for Viagra. Rather, the treatment requested was testosterone gel and/or a urology consult.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u201c21. The defendants\u2019] reckless disregard of the truth, acts and omissions in their deliberate and negligent television broadcast and [I]ntemet publication of false accusations, defamatory and slanderous statements] and their disclosure of the plaintiffs confidential HIV-related information has violated the plaintiffs right[s] . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The complaint went on to allege: \u201cThird claim of relief\u2014Title 52-237 of the Connecticut [G]eneral [Statutes\u2014libel per se\u2014[General Statutes \u00a7] 19a-581 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u201c27. [The] defendants] acted with actual malice, reckless disregard [f]or the truth and negligence in their broadcast of false allegations, defamatory statements] and disclosure of the plaintiffs confidential HIV-related information, in violation of [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 52-237 and 19a-581.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The defendants filed an answer and two special defenses to the plaintiffs libel claim, namely, substantial truth and the fair reporting privilege. On September 1, 2006, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the court on June 5, 2007, after it concluded that there were no material issues of fact in dispute and that both special defenses were applicable. This appeal followed. We affirm the summary judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial judge improperly failed to recuse himself, sua sponte, after demonstrating judicial bias in violation of canon 3 (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the judge demonstrated bias when he became the defendants\u2019 \u201cadviser\u201d in drafting an order denying in part the defendants\u2019 motion to strike, which stated, in relevant part, that if the \u201cdefendants had filed a motion for summary judgment, the decision might well have been different.\u201d The plaintiff acknowledges that this issue was not presented to the trial court and, therefore, is unpreserved. He requests that we employ plain error review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Having reviewed the record, we are unable to find anything, \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; that rises to the level of plain error. Nothing in the record undermines our confidence in the court\u2019s fact-finding process or demonstrates judicial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u201cOrdinarily, we will not review a claim of judicial bias on appeal unless that claim was properly presented to the trial court through a motion for disqualification or a motion for mistrial. . . . Because an accusation of judicial bias or prejudice strikes at the very core of judicial integrity and tends to undermine public confidence in the established judiciary ... we nonetheless have reviewed unpreserved claims of judicial bias under the plain error doctrine.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doody </em>v. <em>Doody, </em>99 Conn. App. 512, 523, 914 A.2d 1058 (2007). \u201cThe plain error doctrine [however] is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. . . . The plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ... A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>275 Conn. 205, 239-40, 881 A.2d 160 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The standard to be employed when determining whether a judge should recuse herself or himself pursuant to canon 3 (c) is well established. \u201cThe standard ... is an objective one [meant to assess] whether [the judge] can be fair and impartial in hearing the case. . . . Any conduct that would lead a reasonable [person] knowing all the circumstances to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned is a basis for the judge\u2019s disqualification. Thus, an impropriety or the appearance of impropriety . . . that would reasonably lead one to question the judge\u2019s impartiality in a given proceeding clearly falls within the scope of the general standard. . . . The question is not whether the judge is impartial in fact. It is simply whether another, not knowing whether or not the judge is actually impartial, might reasonably question [the judge\u2019s] . . . impartiality, on the basis of all of the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sabatasso </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>91 Conn. App. 808, 825, 882 A.2d 719, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 923, 888 A.2d 91 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The following additional facts axe necessary to our analysis. The defendants had filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs complaint and had attached transcripts of the television reports to their motion. The plaintiff also attached exhibits to his opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion. On May 30, 2006, the court heard argument on the defendants\u2019 motion to strike. During the hearing, the defendants also asked the court to evaluate the difference between Viagra and testosterone gel in rendering its decision. The court explained that it thought the defendants were getting into a \u201cspeaking\u201d motion to strike in asking the court to look beyond the pleadings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants responded that, although arguable, they believed it was appropriate for the court to review the transcripts in this case and . to make a judgment concerning the use of the two medications. The defendants also argued that if the court took these things into consideration, it would find that their broadcast substantially was true but that if it did not make such a finding, they \u201ccertainly [would] be raising this again on a motion for summary judgment . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In an August 2, 2006 order, the court granted the motion to strike in part and denied it in part.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the memorandum of decision stated: \u201cThe court cannot look to facts\u2014even uncontested facts\u2014outside the allegations of the complaint as a basis for granting a motion to strike. [The] plaintiff has set forth sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>factual allegations in these counts to state viable causes of action against the defendants. If [the] defendants had filed a motion for summary judgment, the decision might well have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In the claim of judicial bias, the plaintiff argues in effect that the court\u2019s remark affected the defendants\u2019 handling of the case and, perhaps, instigated their filing of their motion for summary judgment. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the statements contained in the court\u2019s order merely served to explain the basis for the court\u2019s ruling and that they were not demonstrative of any bias. The court merely was pointing out the difference between a motion for summary judgment and a motion to strike in terms of the ability to look at exhibits and information outside allegations of the complaint. Unlike a motion for summary judgment, \u201ca motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>252 Conn. 641, 667, 748 A.2d 834 (2000). Furthermore, the transcript from the May 30,2006 hearing, three months before the court issued its ruling, revealed the defendants\u2019 statement that they would file a motion for summary judgment if the court denied in part the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Our thorough review of the record does not reveal anything that leads us to question the judge\u2019s impartiality in this case. Further, the plaintiff has not demonstrated that he suffered manifest injustice such that would warrant a finding of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The plaintiff next claims that the court\u2019s rendering of summary judgment on his claim of libel was improper because there existed disputed material facts related to the defendants\u2019 special defenses asserting substantial truth and the protection of the fair reporting privilege. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>We affirm the court\u2019s granting of summary judgment on the ground that the news broadcasts were true either substantially or literally. After setting forth the applicable standard of review and the law on defamation and libel, in particular, we will address the court\u2019s granting of the motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs claim. First, however, we briefly digress in order to note that the plaintiff repeatedly throughout his complaint states that his claim sounds in libel per se.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>on a claim that the libel was actionable per se, a plaintiff must show that the libel, on its face, either charged some impropriety in the plaintiffs business or profession or that it charged a crime of moral turpitude. See <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>11 Conn. App. 584, 601-602, 529 A.2d 199 (1987). Neither the parties nor the trial court discussed this aspect of the plaintiffs complaint. Likewise, the parties have not raised this as an issue on appeal. Accordingly, we do not consider whether the news broadcasts were actionable as per se libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . The test is whether the party moving for summary judgment would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Windswept Farm, LLC, </em>280 Conn. 153, 158, 905 A.2d 1156 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u201c[A] party opposing summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. . . . It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of [an issue of] material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court [in support of amotion for summary judgment].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Mellick &amp; Sexton, </em>263 Conn. 140, 151, 819 A.2d 216 (2003). \u201cA defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is properly granted if it raises at least one legally sufficient defense that would bar the plaintiffs claim and involves no triable issue of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co., </em>48 Conn. App. 699, 704, 711 A.2d 1202, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 923, 719 A.2d 1168 (1998). Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is plenary. See <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Windswept Farm, LLC, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The plaintiff claims that the court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on his libel count. \u201cA defamatory statement is defined as a communication that tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him. ... To establish a prima facie case of defamation, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>defendant published a defamatory statement; (2) the defamatory statement identified the plaintiff to a third person; (3) the defamatory statement was published to a third person; and (4) the plaintiffs reputation suffered injury as a result of the statement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>282 Conn. 821, 838, 925 A.2d 1030 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u201cDefamation is comprised of the torts of libel and slander. . . . Slander is oral defamation. . . . Libel ... is written defamation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gambardella </em>v. <em>Apple Health Care, Inc., </em>86 Conn. App. 842, 850, 863 A.2d 735 (2005). It has been held by our Supreme Court that \u201creading from a prepared manuscript in a radio address constitutes libel, even though the result is the spoken word, as the words have been reduced to permanent form in the manuscript.\u201d D. Wright, J. Fitzgerald &amp; W. Ankerman, Connecticut Law of Torts (3d Ed. 1991) \u00a7 146, p. 407, citing <em>Charles Parker Co. </em>v. <em>Silver City Crystal Co., </em>142 Conn. 605, 116 A.2d 440 (1955). In this case, involving televised news broadcasts, which certainly are reduced to permanent form in this day and age, we conclude that a claim of defamation properly could sound in libel as the plaintiff had alleged in his complaint. We continue our analysis by examining separately the content of both broadcasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Broadcast of FOX-61</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">A transcript of a May 25,2005 FOX-61 news broadcast was submitted to the trial court along with an affidavit attesting that it was a true, accurate and complete transcript of the relevant broadcast that forms the basis of the plaintiffs claim against Fox-61. The transcript is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">\u201cUnidentified woman: It\u2019s a complete outrage.

He argues that FOX-61\u2019s report was not substantially true because \u201cit erroneously reported that the plaintiff is seeking erectile dysfunction drugs in his suit against the department of correction\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and that, accordingly, summary judgment on behalf of the defendants was inappropriate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The relevant portion of FOX-61\u2019s broadcast stated that \u201c[f]orty-two year old Eugene Mercer, an inmate at the Osborne Correctional Facility for the last twenty years, is suing the medical services director for denying him erectile dysfunction drugs.\u201d Along with the plaintiffs opposition to FOX-61\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit and supporting documents. One of those documents was a copy of his July 13, 2004 complaint against, inter alia, Edward A. Blanchette, whom the complaint listed as the department of correction director of clinical services. In that 2004 complaint, which the plaintiff averred was docket number CV-04-4000197-S, the plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the state had discriminated against him in denying his \u201crequest for . . . testosterone gel in January, 2004, [when] the . . . request for testosterone gel was for the treatment of HIV-hypogonadism and <em>erectile dysfunction </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The 2004 complaint also alleged that the state \u201cknew or should have reasonably known that the plaintiffs medical record reflects multiple instances over the course of several years concerning his decreased spontaneous erections, <em>erectile dysfunction, </em>decreased muscle mass and strength . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Looking to the plain language on the face of the plaintiffs 2004 complaint, it is clear that he alleged that the department of correction\u2019s director of clinical services, as well as others, was discriminating against him by denying his request for testosterone gel for the treatment of <em>erectile dysfunction </em>and other symptoms related to HIV and AIDS. Additionally, in the complaint in the present action, the plaintiff admitted in paragraph nineteen: \u201cThe plaintiff does have a pending lawsuit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>[the] New Britain Superior Court, [Docket] No. CV-04-4000197-S against officials of the [department of correction] for discrimination based on disability ... for their failure to diagnose and treat HIV-[h]ypogonadism and/or erectile dysfunction . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u201c[T]he admission of the truth of an allegation in a pleading is a judicial admission conclusive on the pleader. ... A judicial admission dispenses with the production of evidence by the opposing party as to the fact admitted, and is conclusive upon the party making it. . . . <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>85 Conn.

It is axiomatic that the parties are bound by their pleadings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rudder </em>v. <em>Mamanasco Lake Park Assn., Inc., </em>93 Conn.

Sanford, Libel and Privacy (2d Ed. Sup. 1998) \u00a7 6.4.3.1, p. 6-46. On the basis of the record before us, we conclude that not only were FOX-6 l\u2019s statements substantially true, they literally were true when viewed in combination with the plaintiffs pleadings, which he had put in the public domain. Truth is an absolute defense to an allegation of libel. <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Waterbury Republican-American, Inc., </em>188 Conn. 107, 112, 448 A.2d 1317 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Broadcast of NBC-30</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">A transcript of a May 25,2005 NBC-30 news broadcast was submitted to the trial court along with an affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>attesting that it was a true, accurate and complete transcript of the relevant broadcast that forms the basis of the plaintiffs claim against NBC-30. That transcript is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201cLogan [Byrnes]: Governor Rell says enough is enough! She doesn\u2019t want one more sex offender getting prescription drugs like Viagra, especially when the state is footing the bill. NBC-30\u2019s Doug Greene is here with more. Doug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cDoug [Greene]: Governor Rell yesterday ordered the department of social services to stop providing Viagra and company to sex offenders on Medicaid. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201c[Governor] Rell: I believe that it is off the table, and this is like, hello? It\u2019s common sense. We don\u2019t give Viagra to sex offenders. Somehow, someone in the Medicaid program back in 1998 thought these little blue pills should be just like any other medication\u2014available without a prescription.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201cAmanda Pepin: I think that\u2019s disgusting, pretty much. I don\u2019t know why the government should be giving people Viagra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cTim Adkins: I just thought it was absurd, I mean why would they give sexual offenders Viagra? What would be the point for them to get more . . . more . . . healthy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201cStephen Schiopucie: I thought it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous. No medicinal value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201cLauren Wiser: I think it\u2019s inappropriate. I don\u2019t think they should be given Viagra. Actually, there\u2019s another side. This convicted sex offender wrote this book about inner battle against sexual terrorism. But he says, once an offender has served his time . . . [quote from Jake Goldenflame:] \u2018I think anybody who\u2019s completed their parole or probation successfully should have the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>to the medications like anybody else upon their doctor\u2019s recommendation.\u2019 But in Connecticut from now on, the only way convicted sex offenders can get Viagra is to pay for it themselves. When the federal rules allowed that we can simply eliminate that from Medicaid, I think it makes good sense to do so. You\u2019ve told [the department of social services] not to do it anymore? Not to do it anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201cDoug [Greene]: On another front, there is a prison inmate, Eugene Mercer, who is suing the state. He\u2019s not a sex offender. He\u2019s a convicted killer. But he wants his Viagra, and the state doesn\u2019t buy it for inmates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The plaintiff claims that the court improperly rendered summary judgment on the ground that this report was substantially true. He argues that there existed material issues of fact in dispute and that the court improperly weighed those facts when it found that the distinction between Viagra and testosterone gel \u201cis a distinction without substantial difference.\u201d He further argues that \u201cViagra versus testosterone gel presents a triable issue of fact .... The pleaded truth of [the] plaintiffs [complaint against the state] is that [the] plaintiff sought testosterone gel (an anabolic steroid) to treat HIV-hypogonadism, the symptoms of which include erectile dysfunction. The plaintiff did not seek Viagra or other impotence drugs as reported by the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Although \u201cthe determination of whether an allegedly libelous statement is substantially true [can be] one for the jury . . . both the common law and the First Amendment [to the United States constitution] submit the issue to \u2018close scrutiny\u2019 when appropriate. Summary judgment, therefore is often granted to defendants on the issue of substantial truth.\u201d B. Sanford, Libel and Privacy \u00a7 6.4.1 (2d Ed. Sup. 2007), pp. 6-26 through 6-27. \u201c[W]here minor inaccuracies [are] immaterial to the \u2018sting\u2019 or harm suffered by the plaintiff . . . [or] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>where the inaccuracies [are] of a technical nature that conveyed the same meaning as the true facts would have in the eyes of the average reader,\u201d summary judgment may be appropriate. Id., \u00a7 6.4.2, p. 6-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u201cIn a civil action for libel, where the protected interest is personal reputation, the rule in Connecticut is that the truth of an allegedly libelous statement of fact provides an absolute defense. . . . Contrary to the common law rule that required the defendant to establish the literal truth of the precise statement made, the modem rule is that only substantial tmth need be shown to constitute the justification. ... It is not necessary for the defendant to prove the tmth of every word of the libel. If he succeeds in proving that the main charge, or gist, of the libel is tme, he need not justify statements or comments which do not add to the sting of the charge or introduce any matter by itself actionable. . . . The issue is whether the libel, as published, would have a different effect on the reader than the pleaded tmth would have produced.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Waterbury Republican-American, Inc., </em>supra, 188 Conn. 112-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Clearly, the portion of the NBC-30 report that is relevant to the plaintiffs claim of libel would be the very last portion, which stated: \u201cOn another front, there is a prison inmate, Eugene Mercer, who is suing the state. He\u2019s not a sex offender. He\u2019s a convicted killer. But he wants his Viagra, and the state doesn\u2019t buy it for inmates.\u201d The plaintiff argues that he never requested Viagra and that this part of the broadcast \u201cwould have a different effect on the reader than the pleaded tmth would have produced.\u201d See <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Waterbury Republican-American, Inc., </em>supra, 188 Conn. 113. His argument is that he requested testosterone gel, not Viagra, and, had NBC-30 correctly reported that fact, the effect on the listener would have been different. Additionally, he argues that the court improperly rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>summary judgment when it determined that there was no substantive difference between Viagra and testosterone gel.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Although we agree, and NBC-30 concedes, that there is no evidence that the plaintiff ever sought Viagra, we conclude that the plaintiff clearly pleaded that one of the purposes for seeking testosterone gel was for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Accordingly, had the report said: \u201cBut he wants his testosterone gel,\u201d or, \u201cBut he wants his erectile dysfunction medication,\u201d instead of, \u201cBut he wants his Viagra,\u201d it would not have had a different effect on the reader or listener. See <em>Strada v. Connecticut Newspapers, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 313, 319-22, 477 A.2d 1005 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In conclusion, we affirm the court\u2019s rendering of summary judgment. On the basis of the record, including the plaintiffs pleadings and the documentary evidence submitted with his affidavit in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, we conclude that the statements were true, either substantially or literally. Having so concluded, we need not address whether the defendants\u2019 broadcasts were protected by the fair reporting privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> A copy of this complaint and the cases filed with the commission on human rights and opportunities is contained in the court\u2019s file.
