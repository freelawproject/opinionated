From the exhibits and stipulations entered at trial, the court reasonably could have found the following facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 17, 2006, the defendant was arrested by South Windsor police for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in violation of \u00a714-227a. At the time of her arrest, the defendant was the holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license. On October 27, 2006, the defendant applied to the court for entry into the program under \u00a7 54-56g. The court found her to be ineligible on November 30, 2006. The court determined that she was statutorily ineligible because she had invoked the program within the previous ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">On December 28, 2006, the defendant voluntarily caused the rescission of her commercial driver\u2019s license by returning it to the department of motor vehicles. On January 11, 2007, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of her admittance into the program. On March 15, 2007, the court denied the motion, finding that the defendant at the time of her arrest had possessed a commercial driver\u2019s license and was therefore not eligible for the program under the then applicable statute. That same day, the court found her guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs and imposed a sentence of six months incarceration, execution suspended, eighteen months probation and 100 hours of community service. This appeal followed. Further facts will be put forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>The defendant claims that the court improperly found her to be ineligible for the program because she was a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license at the time she was charged with violating \u00a7 14-227a. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">At the outset, we identify the standard of review and applicable legal principles that guide our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. In resolving the defendant\u2019s claim as to the court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 54-56g (f), we must interpret this provision in conjunction with other provisions of that statute to determine its proper application in the present case. See <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Milford Hunt Homeowners Assn., Inc., </em>110 Conn. App. 88, 94, 953 A.2d 951 (2008). \u201cIssues of statutory construction present questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>89 Conn. App. 324, 329, 873 A.2d 1017 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvord Investment, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>Board of </em>Appeals, 282 Conn. 393, 401-402, 920 A.2d 1000 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">We start by quoting the pertinent statutory text. \u201cThe provisions of [\u00a7 54-56g] shall not be applicable in the case of any person charged with a violation of section 14-227a while operating a commercial motor vehicle, as defined in section 14-1, or who is the holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license, as defined in section 14-1.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-56g (f). The only issue we must decide<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is whether the court misconstrued this subsection of the statute by finding the defendant to be ineligible for the program because she was a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license when charged with violating \u00a7 14-227a. We conclude that the court properly interpreted the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The defendant argues that when she appeared in court on March 15, 2007, and requested entry into the program by way of a motion for reconsideration of denial of entry into the program, she was not the holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license as a result of her voluntary relinquishment of her commercial driver\u2019s license on December 28,2006.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the plain meaning of the term \u201ccharged\u201d in the subsection at issue is distinct from arrest. She asserts that \u201ccharged\u201d has a dynamic meaning in that a person who is charged with a crime remains charged from arrest to disposition of the matter. The defendant contends that on March 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>2007, she stood before the court, charged with violating \u00a7 14-227a, but <em>not </em>as a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license. Consequently, she asserts, the court misconstrued the term \u201ccharged\u201d as it applied to her in those circumstances and wrongly found her to be ineligible for the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The defendant also disputes the court\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cwho is a holder\u201d in the subsection at issue. The defendant contends that this phrase is ambiguous in that it fails to delineate a specific time when this provision should apply. The defendant argues that the statute reasonably could be interpreted to refer to someone who is the holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license <em>at the time of application </em>for the program, a parameter, she contends, that was met on her March 15, 2007 reapplication. Moreover, the defendant contends that as a result of this alleged ambiguity in the language of the statute, the rule of lenity should apply, and, therefore, this provision should not serve as a bar to her admission into the program.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The first step in statutory analysis is to examine the relevant language of \u00a7 54-56g (f) to determine whether it is plain and unambiguous. In determining whether statutory language is plain and unambiguous, we look to the text itself and its relationship to other statutes. \u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 134 n.19, 848 A.2d 451 (2004). We conclude that \u00a7 54-56g (f) is not susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Therefore, neither branch of the defendant\u2019s argument of misconstruction bears fruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">First, the contention that \u201ccharged\u201d is a dynamic term and, therefore, that the defendant stood before the court at the time she reapplied for the program on March 15, 2007, charged with violating \u00a7 14-227a, but <em>not </em>a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license is unpersuasive. Resolution of this issue turns on the meaning of the statutory phrase \u201ccharged with a violation of section 14-227a . . . who is the holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-56g (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Although the word \u201ccharged\u201d is not defined in the statute, it is clear that \u201c[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language; and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). Accordingly, \u201c[i]f a statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 809, 640 A.2d 986 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">The word \u201ccharged\u201d is defined as an \u201c[accusation of crime by complaint, indictment or information.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). The fact that the defendant\u2019s status changed in regard to being a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license while her status as one charged remained static is of no moment here. It is not disputed that the defendant was the holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license at the time of her arrest and at the time the state filed its original information, formally charging her with a violation of \u00a7 14-227a. These facts were stipulated by the defendant. Tellingly, \u00a7 54-56g (f) speaks not at all to the timing of the application to the program but merely to whether or not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>defendant was the holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license when charged with a violation of \u00a7 14-227a. Moreover, it expressly states that the program \u201cshall not be applicable\u201d to defendants who hold commercial driver\u2019s licenses when charged with violating \u00a7 14-227a. General Statutes \u00a7 54-56g (f). This provision applies to the defendant. As a result, on the basis of the plain language of the statute, the court properly denied the defendant entry into the program.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">As it is clear from the plain and unambiguous language of the statute that the intent of the legislature was to preclude from the program those defendants who were holders of commercial driver\u2019s licenses, the defendant\u2019s second assertion, which is that the statute could reasonably be interpreted to refer to someone who is the holder of a commercial license <em>at the time of application </em>for the program, also has no merit. This is readily apparent when the portion of the statute in question is read in conjunction with the previous clause of the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This phrase fixes the time for determining preclusion from the program for operators of commercial vehicles, who under the law must be holders of commercial driver\u2019s licenses, not at the time of application to the program but at the time of the operation of the vehicle in question. To construe the statute to fix varying times for mere holders as opposed to operators would work an internal, illogical inconsistency in the statute that would lead to a patently uneven application. It would also serve to undermine the very purpose of the provision by allowing a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license to avoid preclusion from the program by merely surrendering their commercial driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>license. If the legislature intended this result, it would have explicitly provided for such.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">Last, the defendant\u2019s reliance on the rule of lenity is misplaced. \u201c[T]he touchstone of this rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity. . . . [W]e . . . [reserve] lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute\u2019s intended scope even after resort to the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the statute. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>248 Conn. 543, 555, 729 A.2d 760 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S. Ct. 406, 145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 687 n.47, 735 A.2d 267 (1999). Because we conclude that there is no ambiguity in the relevant statutory provision, the rule of lenity has no application here. In sum, the court properly construed the provision in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a714-227a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both.
