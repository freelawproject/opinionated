Somers, to collect an amount allegedly owed by the defendant, John M. Chan. In this appeal, we must decide whether the trial court correctly determined that the defendant was not liable for legal fees of $75,000 allegedly incurred by Lynn Chan, the defendant\u2019s former wife, and claimed by the plaintiff, her former attorney, to be due from the defendant by virtue of her assignment to the plaintiff of a lump sum alimony award. Exercising our supervisory power over the administration of justice, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">The tortured history of the present litigation is a tangled web. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It nevertheless requires substantial discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Dissolution Action</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In 1993, Lynn Chan commenced a dissolution action against the defendant. The plaintiff represented her throughout the course of that action. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the court noted when fashioning its financial orders, \u201cthe actions of the parties and [the plaintiff] in the court system took a rather simple case and made it a cause celebre. New issues of significance to the public were decided, and the parties and counsel all lost in the process. The court process did not function to minimize the contest, and the parties were allowed to follow through on the most trivial of pursuits. This was not a long-term marriage, and the parties had no children. They have simple assets, and the protracted dispute was well out of proportion to need or importance.\u201d The case was bifurcated, and, on April 11, 1997, the court, <em>Barall, J., </em>rendered judgment of dissolution. In the next two years, a series of motions, discovery contests and assignments for hearing followed, and a trial ultimately was held on the financial issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">After the court rendered the judgment of dissolution but prior to its resolution of the financial issues, the plaintiff prepared a promissory note (note) that Lynn Chan signed on September 3, 1997.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The note provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>in relevant part: \u201cFor value received [Lynn Chan] promises to pay [the plaintiff] the principal amount of $156,872, with interest previously accrued ... at the rate of 12 percent per annum for legal fees, costs and interest per the retainer agreement .... This debt shall be repaid in full by note maker upon judicial award, transfer, sale, refinancing or foreclosure of this note maker\u2019s interest in real estate [in Avon, Connecticut, and Phoenix, Arizona] .... This debt shall not be collected from the future income of [Lynn Chan] and is intended to be paid in lump sum from [her] dissolution of marriage proceedings against [the defendant] to final judgment.\u201d The note further provided that the plaintiff \u201cis providing <em>no legal advice or representation </em>to [Lynn Chan] as a part of this transaction.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Additionally, the plaintiff appended to the note copies of rules 1.7 and 1.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Likewise, the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>stated that Lynn Chan was \u201cadvised of and provided full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>and fair opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel\u201d and that she \u201cfully consents to this arrangement with [the plaintiff] . . . the terms of which are fully disclosed and understood, and which [she] considers to be fair and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">On May 14, 1999, the court, <em>Dranginis, J., </em>issued a memorandum of decision in the dissolution action, in which it found that \u201cthe cause of the breakdown of this marriage was the bigamous marriage of [Lynn Chan] to one Grady Bloodworth. . . . [H]er conduct was the principal cause of the breakdown of the marriage.\u201d The court also addressed the validity of the attorney\u2019s fees billed to Lynn Chan, on which she sought a court award against the defendant. The court found that the plaintiffs fees totaled roughly one quarter of a million dollars. The court continued: \u201c[T]he court is of the opinion that the fees far exceeded what was the reasonable value of the case, in light of the circumstances of the assets of the marriage. . . . [C]ounsel continued to engage in proceedings with the defendant, which had little if any practical or legal value for the ultimate issues which are at the core of this litigation. ... If the legal fees claimed are paid, there will be no marital assets for the parties. [Lynn Chan] has been absent for the bulk of this litigation, and it appears that [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>plaintiff] and the defendant developed a contested relationship of their own. The defendant examined [the plaintiff] on the validity of his bill at length. It was clear from the testimony that [the plaintiff] billed each and every interaction with [Lynn Chan] and the defendant, and it was also clear that the level of conflict in this action was high. What is incumbently [sic] clear, however, is that the matter was overly litigated, to the extent that the claim for attorney\u2019s fees, if paid, would diminish the value of the marital estate by more than one half. . . . The reasonableness of the bill to [Lynn Chan], for which [she] seeks reimbursement from the defendant as part of the distribution of marital assets, must be assessed with respect to the attorney-client relationship between [Lynn Chan] and counsel. For counsel to continue to engage the defendant, who was not willing to agree to very much in the matter, worked to the detriment of his client. This court cannot countenance or approve of a bill for services rendered in a case which asks for compensation which equals more than one half of the entire marital estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The court thereafter entered certain financial orders that provided, inter alia, that (1) \u201c[t]he defendant shall pay to [Lynn Chan] as lump sum alimony the sum of $75,000, in payments of no less than $15,000 per year for five (5) years. Nothing in this order should prevent the defendant from discharging this debt prior to the expiration of five (5) years\u201d; (2) the interest in the marital home in Avon (Avon property) was to be transferred by operation of law to the defendant, and the lis pendens placed thereon by the plaintiff was to be released in light of the finding that his \u201cfees charged are unconscionable and unenforceable\u201d; and (3) Lynn Chan \u201cshall be responsible for her own attorney\u2019s fees. She must bear some responsibility for the extent of litigation which spawned this huge bill, and it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>that [the defendant] copied the tactics of her counsel to keep the parties in court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Three months later, the plaintiff was disbarred from the practice of law in the state of Connecticut as a result of his conduct in unrelated proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The Plaintiffs Civil Action Against Lynn Chan</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">After enlisting the counsel of attorney Gary J. Greene, the plaintiff commenced a civil action against Lynn Chan to collect the attorney\u2019s fees allegedly due from the dissolution proceeding. Despite the fact that Judge Dranginis had declared his quarter of a million dollar fee unreasonable, unconscionable and unenforceable, the plaintiffs complaint sought to recover more than $250,000 in legal fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lynn Chan was not represented by counsel in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">A series of informal communications between Lynn Chan and Greene followed. On May 21, 2002, in a handwritten note, Lynn Chan stated: \u201cIf there is some debt, alimony never paid from [the defendant] is an avenue. I\u2019m disabled and have no assets.\u201d Greene then drafted a stipulation agreement, which he mailed to Lynn Chan in Arizona and requested her signature. Lynn Chan again replied by way of handwritten letter, in which she expressed confusion over the terms of the agreement and insisted that she be released from all liability irrespective of whether the stipulation ultimately was approved by the court. She stated: \u201cReleasing me of all legal liability if the court <em>did not approve </em>was also to be incorporated into the letter we discussed and signed by [the plaintiff] and yourself. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u201cMy signed release gives you the authority to proceed against [the defendant] as you stated in your August 16 letter and our September] 3, [20]02 discussion. If you want the opportunity to collect [payment] from [the defendant] do it! No more word games\u2014you\u2019ll have my signed release after I receive a signed letter from [the plaintiff] and yourself reflecting my needs indicated in my fax and this letter. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cSimplify this by doing these \u2018basics\u2019 so you can enter this into court and get your money from [the defendant]. Remember, I get nothing, Mr. Somers, <em>and forever </em>leave me alone.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) By letter dated October 29,2002, Greene assured Lynn Chan that the stipulation agreement would \u201crelieve you of all liability to [the plaintiff] in perpetuity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Greene repeated that assurance in his November 12, 2002 letter to Lynn Chan. He wrote: \u201cTo confirm our telephone conversation of September 3, 2002 as well as in regards to your letter which was received in this office on September 30, 2002, please accept this letter as an indication that David M. Somers &amp; Associates, P.C., its successors and/or assigns or any of its members and/or [the plaintiff] personally will not proceed against you for any of the funds that may be due and owing to David M. Somers &amp; Associates, P.C., once the stipulation is signed by yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u201cIt is the intention of this letter to indicate that under no circumstances will Lynn Chan be personally responsible for the outstanding debt due and owing to David M. Somers &amp; Associates, P.C., and that your signature on the stipulation will authorize David M. Somers &amp; Associates, P.C., to proceed against [the defendant] for the outstanding debt and to proceed against him for these funds out of the alimony that is owed to yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">\u201cIt is the intention of this letter to assure you that no further action will be taken on behalf of David M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Somers &amp; Associates, P.C., to collect any funds due and owing from yourself once the stipulation is signed by yourself and returned to this office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Lynn Chan eventually signed the stipulated agreement. It provided: \u201cThe parties in the above matter hereby stipulate that judgment shall enter in favor of the plaintiff ... in the principal amount of $156,872.00, plus interest from September 3, 1997 through September 3, 2002, in the amount of $94,115.25, plus attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1,000 plus costs in the amount of $261.45 for a total due and owing of $252,248.70. The parties stipulate that the sum shall be recoverable only from [the defendant] and the alimony that is due and owing from [the defendant] to [Lynn Chan]. \u201d Approximately one month later, Lynn Chan sent an additional communication to Greene. Stapled to that document was a small piece of paper that read, \u201cFor attorney Greene &amp; [the plaintiff]. Possibly this can help you with your upcoming case.\u201d The document itself stated: \u201cTo Whom it Concerns: Per this date I have never received any alimony [payments] from [the defendant] from the court order in the memorandum of decision re: dissolution financial orders dated May 14, 1999.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201c[The defendant] has been in default of this court order and other orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u201cLynn Chan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">\u201cDecember 4, 2002.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">On December 26, 2002, Greene filed with the court a \u201cmotion for judgment in accordance with stipulation.\u201d On January 13, 2003, the court, <em>Beach, J., </em>summarily granted the plaintiffs motion. As the court in the present case found, \u201c[t]here is no evidence that Judge Beach was advised of Judge Dranginis\u2019 decision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the legal fees were unenforceable. There is nothing in the file indicating that [the plaintiff] or his attorney . . . advised Judge Beach of Judge Dranginis\u2019 decision. Judge Beach\u2019s approving the stipulation in a collection matter was a nonarguable motion, which Judge Beach had no reason to question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The Plaintiffs First Civil Action Against The Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Armed with that stipulated judgment, the plaintiff filed a judgment lien on the defendant\u2019s Avon property. On August 19, 2003, the plaintiff filed a \u201cmotion for turnover order\u201d that stated: \u201cThe [p]laintiff obtained a judgment against [Lynn Chan] on January 13, 2003. . . . On or about May 29, 2003, [s]tate [m]arshal Abraham Glassman served a property execution upon [the defendant] who holds funds that belong to [Lynn Chan]. [The defendant] has refused and/or neglected to [torn over] the funds that are owed to [Lynn Chan] to the marshal. Wherefore, for the foregoing reasons it is requested that an order enter ordering [the defendant to turn over] any funds that are due and owing to [Lynn Chan] to the [s]tate [m]arshal.\u201d By memorandum of decision dated March 3, 2004, the court, <em>Sheldon, J., </em>concluded that the plaintiffs motion was legally deficient, as it did not comply with General Statutes \u00a7 52-356b. The court, therefore, denied the motion without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The Plaintiffs Second Civil Action Against The Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">On July 27, 2004, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant to foreclose the judgment lien and filed a notice of lis pendens against the Avon property. After two days of trial, the plaintiff moved to withdraw that action. The court, <em>KeUer, J., </em>granted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>conditional approval of that motion, stating that withdrawal was \u201capproved on April 18, 2006, during court trial, provided the plaintiff files releases of the judgment lien and lis pendens with the town clerk of Avon on or before Friday, April 21,2006, at 12 p.m., and the plaintiff must provide [the defendant] with a copy of such proof of recordation per order of the court.\u201d There is no indication in the record that the plaintiff failed to comply with that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The Plaintiffs Third and Present Civil Action Against The Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Undaunted, the plaintiff commenced another civil action against the defendant on April 17, 2006. His two page complaint averred that the defendant \u201cis indebted to the plaintiff in the amount of the alimony that is due and owing of $75,000.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response, the defendant, appearing pro se, filed a counterclaim<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> against the plaintiff. That pleading alleged that the plaintiffs action constituted vexatious litigation, as Judge Dranginis already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>had determined that he was not liable for the legal fees incurred by Lynn Chan during the dissolution proceeding. He emphasized that Judge Dranginis had found the plaintiffs legal fees to be unconscionable and unenforceable. The defendant further maintained that his alimony obligation \u201cwas satisfied and was terminated in the Superior Court at Hartford in the [f]amily [c]ourt as ordered by Judge Prestley on October 27, 2004.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He appended a copy of that court order to the counterclaim. As to the stipulated judgment entered into by the plaintiff and Lynn Chan, the defendant alleged that its procurement, as well as the resulting judgment hen placed on his Avon property by the plaintiff, violated his right to due process. In his answer to the counterclaim, the plaintiff denied all allegations. The matter proceeded to a trial held on May 3 and June 14 and 15, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In its July 11, 2007 memorandum of decision, the court, <em>Hon. Richard M. Rittenband, </em>judge trial referee, found the defendant to be a credible witness; he found the plaintiffs credibility \u201clacking . . . .\u201d The court stated that the plaintiff \u201cdemonstrated a surprising lack of memory of many of the facts and issues important to this case.\u201d The court\u2019s analysis centered on the determination made by Judge Dranginis that the plaintiffs legal fees billed to Lynn Chan in the dissolution action were unconscionable and unenforceable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because that determination never was presented to Judge Beach, the court concluded that the stipulated judgment between the plaintiff and Lynn Chan constituted a fraud on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>court. The court further found that the present action likewise constituted a fraud on the court in light of the fraudulent nature of the stipulated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The court also concluded that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel barred the plaintiffs action. It stated: \u201cThis court finds that the issue of the validity of . . . the attorney\u2019s fees allegedly due to the plaintiff . . . was fully litigated and decided by Judge Dranginis in the divorce action to be excessive and unenforceable. Her decision involved the same parties, namely, [the defendant], Lynn Chan and [the plaintiff].\u201d The court stated that the September 3, 1997 note executed by Lynn Chan in favor of the plaintiff provided that \u201c[t]his [debt] shall not be collected from the future income\u201d of Lynn Chan and, finding the alimony order to be future income, concluded that the plaintiff \u201cwas not entitled to an assignment of the future income, the alimony of $75,000.\u201d In addition, the court found that the plaintiff, in preparing the September 3, 1997 note for Lynn Chan, \u201cdid not conform to [rule] 1.8 of the . . . Rules of Professional Conduct . . . .\u201d Finally, the court found that the defendant \u201cmade payments of alimony totaling $45,000 to Lynn Chan before he received notice ... of the assignment of his obligation of alimony to [the plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Accordingly, the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant on the plaintiffs complaint. Because it found that the plaintiff brought that action without probable cause, the court ruled in favor of the defendant on his vexatious litigation counterclaim and awarded him $4410 in damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-568.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Additionally, the court issued an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>ordering the plaintiff \u201cto cease and desist from any and all claims against [the defendant].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Our analysis in the present case begins with the conclusions of the trial court concerning the plaintiffs complaint. In its memorandum of decision, the court (1) concluded that the present action was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel, (2) found that the plaintiff perpetrated a fraud on the court, (3) concluded that the terms of the note prohibited the assignment of Lynn Chan\u2019s award of alimony to the plaintiff, (4) concluded that in preparing the note, the plaintiff violated rule 1.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct and (5) found that the defendant made $45,000 in alimony payments to Lynn Chan. We briefly address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The applicability of the doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel presents a question of law, over which our review is plenary. <em>Testa v. Geressy, </em>286 Conn. 291, 306, 943 A.2d 1075 (2008). \u201cThe doctrine of res judicata holds that an existing final judgment rendered upon the merits without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, is conclusive of causes of action and of facts or issues thereby litigated as to the parties and their privies in all other actions in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction. ... If the same cause of action is again sued on, the judgment is a bar with respect to any claims relating to the cause of action which were actually made or which might have been made. . . . Claim preclusion (res judicata) and issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>have been described as related ideas on a continuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">. . . More specifically, collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion . . . prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action between the same parties or those in privity with them upon a different claim. . . . An issue is actually litigated if it is properly raised in the pleadings or otherwise, submitted for determination, and in fact determined.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Infinity Ins. Co., </em>282 Conn. 594, 600-601, 922 A.2d 1073 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The court incorrectly determined that the present action was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. The issue of Lynn Chan\u2019s legal fees was neither fully litigated nor decided by Judge Dranginis in that proceeding. To be sure, the issues of whether the defendant was liable to pay Lynn Chan\u2019s legal fees and whether the plaintiffs bill was reasonable were fully litigated. The court was presented with ample evidence concerning those issues, and the plaintiff testified thereon. Judge Dranginis concluded, as to the issue of an award of attorney\u2019s fees to be paid to Lynn Chan by the defendant, that the plaintiffs quarter of a million dollar bill was unreasonable, unconscionable and unenforceable. At the same time, the court ordered that Lynn Chan \u201cshall be responsible for her own attorney\u2019s fees. She must bear some responsibility for the extent of litigation which spawned this huge bill, and it appears that [the defendant] copied the tactics of her counsel to keep the parties in court.\u201d Reading the memorandum of decision as a whole, it is readily apparent that the issue of precisely what constituted a reasonable fee to be paid by Lynn Chan was not fully litigated or decided by Judge Dranginis. As such, the present action is not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel stemming from that judgment of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">We address together the court\u2019s determinations that the plaintiff committed a fraud on that court in securing the stipulated judgment, that the terms of the note prohibited the assignment of Lynn Chan\u2019s award of alimony to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff violated rule 1.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct in preparing the note. Those issues were not properly before the court in the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201cdue to the adversarial nature of our judicial system, \u2018[t]he court\u2019s function is generally limited to adjudicating the issues <em>raised by the parties </em>on the proof they have presented and applying appropriate procedural sanctions on motion of a party.\u2019 . . .

Leubsdorf, Civil Procedure (5th Ed. 2001) \u00a7 1.2, p. 4.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Vertex, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>278 Conn. 557, 564, 898 A.2d 178 (2006). Connecticut is a fact pleading jurisdiction. See Practice Book \u00a7 10-1; <em>Florian </em>v. <em>Lenge, </em>91 Conn. App. 268, 274, 880 A.2d 985 (2005). \u201cPleadings have an essential purpose in the judicial process. . . . The purpose of pleading is to apprise the court and opposing counsel of the issues to be tried . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thames River Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>50 Conn. App. 767, 782-83, 720 A.2d 242 (1998); see also 71 C.J.S. 38, Pleading \u00a7 3 (2000) (\u201cpurpose of pleadings is to frame, present, define, and narrow the issues, and to form the foundation of, and to limit, the proof to be submitted on the trial\u201d). For that reason, \u201c[i]t is imperative that the court and opposing counsel be able to rely on the statement of issues as set forth in the pleadings. ... As Justice Cardozo has written: justice, though due to the accused, is due to the accuser also. . . . Fairness is a double-edged sword and both sides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>are entitled to its benefits throughout the trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>64 Conn. App. 121, 125, 779 A.2d 789 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The pleadings contain no allegations that the plaintiff perpetrated a fraud on the court in securing the stipulated judgment, that the terms of the note prohibited the assignment of the award of alimony to the plaintiff or that the plaintiff violated rule 1.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct in preparing the note. The plaintiff never was apprised that those questions concerning the stipulated judgment were at issue in the present case. Rather, the court during trial made repeated comments to the contrary, opining that \u201cI can\u2019t overturn Judge Beach, not at this point,\u201d and stating that \u201cthe $252,248 is a judgment. Whether it should have been a judgment, I\u2019m not going to get into that. It\u2019s not my business.\u201d Nevertheless, the court sua sponte raised and decided the aforementioned issues in its memorandum of decision. The court neither acknowledged nor explained its departure from the well established principle that, at trial, the issues are limited to those alleged in the pleadings. As a result, the plaintiff was not afforded \u201cadequate notice of the issues the court intended to address . . . .\u201d <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Pritchard, </em>103 Conn.

Once I had the court order vacating the alimony payments and [indicating] full satisfaction of alimony payments, I didn\u2019t feel a need ... to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>keep any records.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court credited that testimony in its memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Apparently conceding that there exists evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s finding, the plaintiff maintains that this court \u201cshould reach the \u2018definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u2019 . . . .\u201d The plaintiff focuses primarily on the defendant\u2019s failure to produce documentation in support of his testimony regarding the alimony payments. The court, however, expressly acknowledged the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to produce evidence of payment\u201d but nevertheless stated that \u201con the whole, [it] still finds [the defendant\u2019s] testimony as to alimony payments credible.\u201d As the trier of fact, the court was free to credit the defendant\u2019s explanation for the purging of his records. It is not for this court, on appeal, to revisit that credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The plaintiff also alleges that the court improperly intervened on the defendant\u2019s behalf by \u201creading into the record testimony from an earlier hearing that was more favorable to the defendant than his testimony at trial and disregarding the hearsay rule.\u201d The plaintiff voiced no objection on this point at trial, nor did he otherwise preserve the issue for appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cWe have repeatedly held that this court will not consider claimed errors on the part of the trial court unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised at trial and was ruled upon and decided by the court adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>102 Conn.

Furthermore, a review of the transcript indicates that counsel for the plaintiff, and not the trial court, raised the issue of the defendant\u2019s testimony before Judge Keller at trial. At one point, the court specifically inquired whether counsel had \u201cany objection to my looking at [the transcript of the proceeding before Judge Keller],\u201d to which counsel for the plaintiff replied, \u201cnone whatsoever, Your Honor.\u201d The court subsequently questioned the defendant as to that testimony without objection by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We conclude that there was evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff made $45,000 in alimony payments.

For the reasons that follow, we invoke our supervisory power over the administration of justice in resolving the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">\u201cAppellate courts possess an inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice. . . . The standards that [are] set under this supervisory authority are not satisfied by observance of those minimal historic safeguards for securing trial by reason which are summarized as due process of law .... Rather, the standards are flexible and are to be determined in the interests of justice. . . . [0]ur supervisory authority [however] is not a form of free-floating justice, untethered to legal principle. . . . [T]he integrity of the judicial system serves as a unifying principle behind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>seemingly disparate use of our supervisory powers. . . . [0]ur supervisory powers are invoked only in the rare circumstance where [the] traditional protections are inadequate to ensure the fair and just administration of the courts . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 290 n.11, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000); see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 60-1 and 60-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Ordinarily, our supervisory powers are invoked \u201cto enunciate a rule that is not constitutionally required but that we think is preferable as a matter of policy.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 578, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006). As our Supreme Court explained, \u201c[supervisory powers are exercised to direct trial courts to adopt judicial procedures that will address matters that are of utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Valedon, </em>261 Conn. 381, 386, 802 A.2d 836 (2002). At the same time, \u201c[although [w]e previously have exercised our supervisory powers to direct trial courts to adopt judicial procedures . . . we also have exercised our authority to address the result in individual cases . . . because [certain] conduct, although not rising to the level of constitutional magnitude, is unduly offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>255 Conn. 425, 439, 773 A.2d 287 (2001). We conclude that the present case warrants the exercise of those powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The pleadings and the record in this case indicate that the present appeal is rooted in multiple related proceedings arising from a common nucleus of facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>which we previously detailed. The trial court took judicial notice of those proceedings. In unraveling this tangled web, we begin with the decision of the trial court in dissolving the marriage of the defendant and Lynn Chan.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In the dissolution action, Lynn Chan sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees from the defendant, which the defendant challenged at trial. The court was presented with ample evidence on that issue, and the plaintiff and attorney Jack Miller testified thereon. The court found that the plaintiff charged Lynn Chan roughly one quarter of a million dollars for his representation. In her memorandum of decision, Judge Dranginis concluded that the plaintiffs legal bill was unreasonable, unconscionable and unenforceable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, she declined to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the defendant to pay any attorney\u2019s fees. Although Judge Dranginis did not determine what constituted a reasonable fee, she ordered that Lynn Chan \u201cshall be responsible for her own attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The next significant development came when the plaintiff sued Lynn Chan to recover those fees. The plaintiff filed his complaint in the Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford on July 12, 2002. In that complaint, he averred that Lynn Chan owed him more than $250,000 in legal fees stemming from the dissolution action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Our rules of practice require all allegations of a complaint to be founded on a reasonable basis. See Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Book \u00a7 10-5; see also rule 3.3 (a) (1) of the Rules of Professional Conduct (prohibiting lawyer from knowingly making \u201ca false statement of fact or law to a tribunal\u201d). Although she did not articulate precisely what constituted a reasonable fee for the plaintiffs legal services in the dissolution action, Judge Dranginis did conclude that $245,000 was unreasonable. The plaintiff nevertheless alleged in his subsequent complaint that Lynn Chan owed him more than one quarter of a million dollars in legal fees and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Moreover, he repeated that allegation in the stipulation for judgment that he submitted to the court on December 26, 2002. There is no indication in the record that the plaintiff or his counsel at any time discussed with Lynn Chan, who was not represented by counsel, the fact that Judge Dranginis had concluded that his quarter of a million dollar legal fee was unreasonable, unconscionable and unenforceable or advised her to consider the assistance of an attorney. In addition, the trial court found that, in considering the plaintiffs motion for judgment in accordance with the stipulation, \u201c[t]here is no evidence that Judge Beach was advised of Judge Dranginis\u2019 decision that the legal fees were unenforceable. There is nothing in the file indicating that [the plaintiff] or his attorney . . . advised Judge Beach of Judge Dranginis\u2019 decision.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">As our Supreme Court has cautioned, \u201c[w]e do not take lightly, nor can we, any misrepresentation or concealment of essential information upon which the trial court must rely in fashioning a decree . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Masters </em>v. <em>Masters, </em>201 Conn. 50, 56, 513 A.2d 104 (1986). The stipulation prepared by counsel for the plaintiff and signed by the plaintiff and Lynn Chan provided in relevant part that \u201c[t]he parties in the above matter hereby stipulate that judgment shall enter in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>favor of the plaintiff ... in the principal amount of $156,872.00, plus interest from September 3, 1997 through September3, 2002, in the amount of $94,115.25, plus attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1,000 plus costs in the amount of $261.45 for a total due and owing of $252,248.70.\u201d That stipulation directly contravenes Judge Dranginis\u2019 determination that the quarter of a million dollar legal fee was unreasonable, unconscionable and unenforceable. Because the issue of the reasonableness of the plaintiffs legal fee in the dissolution action already had been litigated and decided by the court, as well as the defendant\u2019s liability therefor, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to apprise the court of that decision when submitting to the court his motion for judgment in accordance with the stipulation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In subsequently bringing suit against Lynn Chan to collect the very legal fees that Judge Dranginis had found to be unreasonable, unconscionable and unenforceable and submitting to the court a stipulation that stated a \u201ctotal due and owing of $252,248.70,\u201d the plaintiff subverted Judge Dranginis\u2019 decision. That conduct is offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Furthermore, \u00a7 39 of 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments (1982), precluded the plaintiff from proceeding against Lynn Chan to recover the more than $250,000 in legal fees stemming from the dissolution action, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>pleaded in his complaint. The issue of whether the plaintiffs quarter of a million dollar legal fee was reasonable was fully and fairly litigated in the prior dissolution proceeding. Section 39 provides: \u201cA person who is not a party to an action but who controls or substantially participates in the control of the presentation on behalf of a party is bound by the determination of issues decided as though he were a party.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 39 (1982). The commentary to that section explains the rationale underlying that rule: \u201cA person who assumes control of litigation on behalf of another has the opportunity to present proofs and argument on the issues litigated. Given this opportunity, he has had his day in court and should be concluded by the result.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Id., comment (a). We agree with that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The commentary further explains that \u201ccontrol,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 39, refers to the ability to exercise \u201ceffective choice as to the legal theories and proofs to be advanced,\u201d as well as \u201ccontrol over the opportunity to obtain review.\u201d Id., comment (c). In <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>122 F.3d 1309 (10th Cir. 1997), the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit addressed the question of whether an attorney who represented certain plaintiffs in a prior state court proceeding was in privity with them for purposes of collateral estoppel. Applying \u00a7 39 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, the court answered affirmatively: \u201c[I]n applying the definition of \u2018control\u2019 for purposes of finding privity, it is clear that Margie Phelps, as listed attorney for each of the plaintiffs, not only had input into the legal theories and arguments advanced, but could be said to be directly responsible, along with co-counsel, for \u2018controlling\u2019 the entire course of the state court proceedings. On this basis, we hold that privity exists between the parties in this action such that Margie Phelps may be bound by the state court determinations . . . .\u201d Id., 1319. Similarly, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has recognized that when a party demonstrates that an attorney in a prior proceeding \u201cexerted such control over the underlying litigation that he should be bound by a determination [in that proceeding] as though he himself were a party,\u201d that attorney is collaterally estopped from contesting that determination. <em>Aranson </em>v. <em>Schroeder, </em>140 N.H. 359, 369, 671 A.2d 1023 (1995); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>906 F.2d 829, 833 (2d Cir. 1990) (nonparty to action can be bound by determination of issues decided in that action if it \u201ccontrols or substantially participates in the control of the presentation on behalf of a party\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Application of \u00a7 39 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments seems particularly appropriate in the present case. Despite the fact that the dissolution action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>lasted six years, Lynn Chan did not once appear in court. Her testimony at trial was via deposition in Arizona with local counsel; the plaintiff never met Lynn Chan in person. See footnote 2. Judge Dranginis\u2019 findings further make clear that the plaintiff exercised substantial control in the 'underlying litigation. As she found in her memorandum of decision: \u201c[The plaintiff] continued to engage in proceedings with the defendant, which had little if any practical or legal value for the ultimate issues which are at the core of this litigation. Moreover, [Lynn Chan] has a variety of health concerns which militate against protracted litigation. . . . [Lynn Chan] has been absent for the bulk of this litigation, and it appears that [the plaintiff] and the defendant developed a contested relationship of their own.\u201d In such circumstances, like the attorneys in <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>supra, 122 F.3d 1319, and <em>Aranson </em>v. <em>Schroeder, </em>supra, 140 N.H. 369, the plaintiff would be bound by Judge Dranginis\u2019 determination in the prior proceeding as to the reasonableness, enforceability and conscionability of his charged legal fee. Had the plaintiff apprised Judge Beach of Judge Dranginis\u2019 prior decision on the issue of his legal fees billed to Lynn Chan in the dissolution proceeding when he filed his \u201cmotion for judgment in accordance with stipulation,\u201d the court well may have denied the motion on the grounds of res judicata or collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> His failure to do so undermined the ability of the trial court to consider and decide the motion before it properly and, by extension, the integrity of the judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Our supervisory powers \u201care an extraordinary remedy to be invoked only when circumstances are such that the issue at hand, while not rising to the level of a constitutional violation, is nonetheless of utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 815, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). Exercising those powers to ensure the fair and just administration of the courts, we vacate the judgment of January 13, 2003, granting the plaintiffs motion for judgment in accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\u201c[An appellate court] can sustain a right decision although it may have been placed on a wrong ground.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LaBow </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>69 Conn. App. 760, 761 n.2, 796 A.2d 592, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 903, 802 A.2d 853 (2002); see also <em>Flagg Energy Development Corp. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>244 Conn. 126, 151, 709 A.2d 1075 (1998). Because the present action was predicated entirely on the stipulated judgment, we conclude that the court properly rendered judgment in favor of the defendant on the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">VEXATIOUS LITIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">A final question remains. After ruling in favor of the defendant on the plaintiffs complaint, the court ruled in favor of the defendant on his vexatious litigation counterclaim and awarded him $4410 in damages pursuant to \u00a7 52-568. We agree with the plaintiff that this determination was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Section 52-568 provides: \u201cAny person who commences and prosecutes any civil action or complaint against another, in his own name or the name of others, or asserts a defense to any civil action or complaint commenced and prosecuted by another (1) without probable cause, shall pay such other person double damages, or (2) without probable cause, and with a malicious intent unjustly to vex and trouble such other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>person, shall pay him treble damages.\u201d To establish a statutory claim thereunder, it is necessary to prove, at a minimum, \u201cwant of probable cause . . . and a termination of suit in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Falls Church Group, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Tyler, Cooper &amp; Alcorn, LLP, </em>281 Conn. 84, 94, 912 A.2d 1019 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The counterclaim alleged, and the court found, that the plaintiff \u201cbrought the instant suit without probable cause. \u201d At the time of that pleading, an essential element was lacking, as the plaintiffs action had not been terminated in the defendant\u2019s favor. A condition precedent to the institution of an action for vexatious litigation is that the original action has terminated unsuccessfully. As our Supreme Court explained, \u201c[w]e have held that a claim for vexatious litigation requires a plaintiff to allege that the <em>previous lawsuit </em>was initiated maliciously, without probable cause, and terminated in the plaintiffs favor. ... In suits for vexatious litigation, it is recognized to be sound policy to require the plaintiff to allege that <em>prior litigation </em>terminated in his favor.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>191 Conn. 257, 263, 464 A.2d 52 (1983). Furthermore, in <em>Equality, Inc. </em>v. <em>I-Link Communications, Inc., </em>76 F. Sup. 2d 227, 229 (D. Conn. 1999), the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut held that under Connecticut law, a counterclaim alleging vexatious litigation may not be brought in the same action as that which the defendant claims is vexatious. We agree. Accordingly, the defendant in the present case could not prevail under \u00a7 52-568, as his action was premature. We conclude that the court improperly rendered judgment in favor of the defendant on his counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The judgment for the defendant on the counterclaim is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff on the counterclaim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The judgment for the defendant on the complaint is affirmed. The January 13, 2003 judgment (CV-02-0818041-S) granting the plaintiffs motion for judgment in accordance with the stipulation is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-12\"> Due to the complexity of the multiple proceedings pertinent to the present appeal, we briefly outline each at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">1. <em>Lynn Chan </em>v. <em>John Chan, </em>Docket No. FA-93-0525491-S, dissolution action decided by <em>Barall, J., </em>and <em>Dranginis, J. </em>The plaintiff represented Lynn Chan in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">2. <em>David M.

Despite the fact that the sole issue presented in that brief was \u201c[w]hat alimony payments, if any, did the defendant prove he paid to Lynn Chan before notice to him of her assignment of alimony to the plaintiff,\u201d the plaintiff did not raise any of the arguments he now advances on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\"> The salient portion of Judge Dranginis\u2019 memorandum of decision states: \u201cThe current bill is approximately . . . $245,000. The court allowed the defendant to inquire of [the plaintiff] under oath, who was asked why the bill was so high. [The plaintiff] responded that was occasioned by the defendant\u2019s misconduct. The fee agreement [the plaintiff] had with [Lynn Chan] was for attorney\u2019s fees of . . . $195 per hour and . . . $30 per hour for clerical help. The attorney-client relationship has spanned over five . . . years, or approximately . . . $49,000 . . . per year, including costs. The defendant went through a number of dates on the bill, including the times of two hours, one hour and the like for the preparation of repetitive subpoenas to the defendant. In response, [the plaintiff] indicated that there was a need for repetitive subpoenas in that the defendant would only partially comply with the subpoenas, and [there was] the need to review and revamp those subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\u201cThe court allowed the defendant to subpoena attorney Jack Miller, with whom [the plaintiff] claimed he had had two hours of consultations on September 20, 1994. Miller testified that he had only a vague recollection of any conversation with the defendant and that he had never opened a file or received any funds from him. If he had had documents, they had been destroyed. While there may have been a contact, there was no actual representation. The defendant claimed that he had never met attorney Miller and that [the plaintiff] was lying. The bill for those services does not appear to be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">\u201cThere were instances where the claim for fees was not sustained, and the court is of the opinion that the fees far exceeded what was the reasonable value of the case, in light of the circumstances of the assets of the marriage. As a concern, the court notes that counsel continued to engage in proceedings with the defendant, which had little if any practical or legal value for the ultimate issues which are at the core of this litigation. Moreover, [Lynn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Chan] has a variety of health concerns which militate against protracted litigation. If the legal fees claimed are paid, there will be no marital assets for the parties. [Lynn Chan] has been absent for the bulk of this litigation, and it appears that [the plaintiff] and the defendant developed a contested relationship of their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">\u201cThe defendant examined [the plaintiff] on the validity of his bill at length. It was clear from the testimony that [the plaintiff] billed each and every interaction with [Lynn Chan] and the defendant, and it was also clear that the level of conflict in this action was high. What is incumbently [sic] clear, however, is that the matter was overly litigated, to the extent that the claim for attorney\u2019s fees, if paid, would diminish the value of the marital estate by more than one half. The decision to carry on was blamed on the defendant by the plaintiff and on [the plaintiff] by the defendant. The reasonableness of the bill to [Lynn Chan], for which [she] seeks reimbursement from the defendant as part of the distribution of marital assets, must be assessed with respect to the attorney-client relationship between [Lynn Chan] and [the plaintiff]. For counsel to continue to engage the defendant, who was not willing to agree to very much in the matter, worked to the detriment of his client. This court cannot countenance or approve of a bill for services rendered in a case which asks for compensation which equals more than one half of the entire marital estate. The findings of the court on the issue of fault also belie the activity on this file.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"A94\"> The complaint sought to collect the balance, interest and late fees due under the terms of the note, which expressly provided that such moneys were for legal fees resulting from the plaintiffs representation of Lynn Chan in the dissolution proceeding. We repeat that prior to instituting the civil action against his former client, the plaintiff sent Lynn Chan a statement of \u201cpayments received and outstanding balance,\u201d which indicated that the outstanding balance as of May, 2000, was more than $330,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> The plaintiff does not contest that finding on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> Because neither party raised the issue at trial or on appeal, we do not consider the question of whether the assignment of alimony to an attorney as compensation for legal services violates public policy. We do note the following observation: \u201c[A]n assignment of lump sum alimony is particularly inappropriate where it runs to an attorney for the payment of legal fees incurred in a domestic case. ... In the instant case, the effect of the assignment is to render the attorney the real party in interest in the post-judgment contempt proceedings; the enforcement of the alimony order through the court\u2019s contempt powers [here] is not for the maintenance and support of the plaintiff but the collection of attorneys fees.\u201d <em>Emerick </em>v. Emerick, Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. FA-280232 (November 17, 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\"> The United States Supreme Court has stated that preclusion of nonparties who control litigation \u201cfalls under the rubric of collateral estoppel rather than res judicata because the latter doctrine presupposes identity between causes of action. And the cause of action which a nonparty has vicariously asserted differs by definition from that which he subsequently seeks to litigate in his own right.\u201d <em>Montana </em>v. <em>United States, 440 </em>U.S. 147, 154, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1979). Nevertheless, as the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has noted, \u201c[notwithstanding the <em>Montana </em>dictum, several courts, including this court, continue to apply res judicata to nonparties when the circumstances warrant. . . . [Cjourts continue routinely to formulate res judicata as a doctrine that bars parties \u2018or their privies\u2019 from relitigating claims. . . . The doctrine of res judicata serves many desirable ends, among them finality and efficiency. . . . Logic suggests that the doctrine can achieve its goals only if its preclusive effects occasionally can reach persons who, technically, were not parties to the original action. The pitfalls of a more mechanical rule are obvious; making party status a sine qua non for the operation of res judicata opens the door to countless varieties of manipulation, including claim-splitting, suits by proxy, and forum-shopping. . . . [Rjeading <em>Montana\u2019s </em>dictum as categorically eliminating res judicata whenever there are technically distinct parties is at loggerheads with the hoary concept of privity\u2014a concept long since integrated into the legal lexicon and routinely applied in analogous situations.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Banco Central Corp., </em>27 F.3d 751, 757 (1st Cir. 1994). As a result, the First Circuit held that \u201cres judicata can sometimes operate to bar the maintenance of an action by persons who, technically, were not parties to the initial action (to which preclusive effect is attributed).\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> Res judicata may be raised by the court sua sponte. <em>Legassey </em>v. <em>Shulansky, </em>28 Conn.
