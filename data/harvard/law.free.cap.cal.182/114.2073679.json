Code, sec. 995 et scq.), with a right to review of the action of the trial court on an appeal from the judgment. <bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The objections to the sufficiency of the information to state a public offense fall within the rule announced in <em>In' re Ruef, </em>150 Cal. 665, [89 Pac. 605]. We express no opinion on the merits of the claims made 'by petitioner in regard to these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The application for a writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Angellotti, C.
