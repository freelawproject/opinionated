It certainly could not be extended to allow supplemental awards for the purpose of correcting errors in the original award, as was attempted in <em>Georgia Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>177 Cal. 289, [170 Pac. 625], the case principally relied on by petitioner. The case just cited is not in point upon the question here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">The petition for a rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
