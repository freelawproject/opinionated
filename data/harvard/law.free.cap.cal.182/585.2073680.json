Findings were waived and there is no dispute as to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">On February 1, 1910, the plaintiff corporation entered into an agreement with defendant Sallie Owens for the sale to her of lot 10 in block 4 in the town of Moron, Kern County. The price agreed to be paid for the lot was four hundred dollars, and the vendee paid down one-third of the purchase price; the remainder was paid in two deferred payments. This contract contained a clause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">\u201cProvided, however, that this agreement is on and subject to condition that as a part of the consideration hereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>no wines, beers, or other spirituous, vinous, malt or alcoholic liquors or beverages of any description shall ever be sold or kept for sale or given away upon said premises upon penalty o\u00a3 forfeiture of all right, title and interest in and' to said premises and the immediate reversion thereof 'and the revesting of the title thereto in said Railroad Company, its successors and assigns ...\u201d And the contract further provided that: \u201cAll of the said foregoing exceptions, reservations, conditions, and limitations shall be written into the deed of said land, herein provided for, and shall run with the land, and all holdings by, through, or under purchaser are subject thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-3\">Subsequent to the execution of said contract, defendant Owens sold and assigned her interest therein to defendant A. I. Scott, who expended about two thousand five hundred dollars in the fitting up of a saloon upon the premises, the purchase of stock, the payment of rents, and of a license fee to the city of Taft. In February,- 1911, Scott 'opened up a retail liquor business on the place and has been conducting - it ever since. On September 20, 1911, plaintiff commenced this action against defendants to declare a forfeiture of the premises under and by virtue of the anti-liquor clause above quoted. The action proceeded to trial and the court adjudged that the defendants, by reason of the violation of the said condition in the contract, had lost and forfeited all right, title, and interest in and to the premises, and decreed that \u201cthe plaintiff is the owner in fee and entitled to the immediate possession of Lot 10 in Block 4 in the Town of Moron (now Taft) ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Appellants\u2019 contention is that the saloon was opened and conducted with the consent of plaintiff and there was a waiver of the condition in the contract of sale by B. A. McAllister, \u201cLand Commissioner, Southern Pacific Railroad Company.\u201d In support of this contention appellants attempted to prove by one Harry Hopkins, a trustee of the city of Taft, that, at a conference held in the city of San Francisco prior to the breach of the condition, McAllister .orally consented to the issuance of liquor licenses in Taft to conduct saloons. The following question was put to this witness: \u201cState the conversation that was had between you and Mr. McAllister with regard to the issuing of liquor licenses, that is, the\u2019city of Taft issuing liquor licenses at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that time.\u201d The objection was interposed that the question was irrelevant, incompetent, and immaterial, and that \u201cMr. McAllister had no authority ... to in any way bind the plaintiff in this action by any such declaration or conversation.\u201d The objection was sustained, and it is upon this ruling that the appellants rely for a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The testimony sought would not tend to prove that Mc-Allister, acting for the plaintiff, waived the breach of the condition in the contract or condoned the forfeiture, although appellants\u2019 argument seems to assume that such would be the effect. <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> We think the testimony was properly excluded. The question put to the witness was not answered, but appellants\u2019 counsel made the following statement as to what he intended to prove: \u201cI offer to show by this witness here that the licenses were issued by and with the consent of the plaintiff, acting through its land commissioner, and who . . . executed the very contract upon which it is now suing; that they [the plaintiff] consented to the issuing of liquor licenses on behalf of the city of Taft; that the same were issued in pursuance of their consent and with their knowledge.\u201d The issuance of liquor licenses in the city of Taft based upon such an understanding could not affect the plaintiff\u2019s right to claim a forfeiture in the event of a breach of the conditions contained in the contract of sale. Even if McAllister acquiesced in the issuance of saloon licenses in Taft, this would not constitute a consent to the defendants\u2019 opening a saloon on the particular lot involved here. Adopting this view, it is unnecessary to discuss whether plaintiff would have been estopped to insist upon a forfeiture if McAllister\u2014who, it appears, had acted as \u201cLand Commissioner, Southern Pacific Railroad Company,\u201d one year before, when the contract was executed\u2014had in fact informed the defendants that they might open a saloon on the premises and the defendants had acted in reliance thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Olney, J.,.and Shaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
