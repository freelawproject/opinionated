We can hardly conceive that a trial judge would sign a decision on controverted facts without knowledge that the same expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>exactly his conclusions thereon. <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Certainly he could not properly do so, and we have no doubt that for him to do so would constitute an irregularity in the proceedings of the court under subdivision 1 of section 657 of the Code of Civil Procedure, relative to motions for new trial. Of course, the party is entitled to the decision of the <em>judge. </em>But we are satisfied that, upon the matters alleged, the claim of the applicant in this behalf could be urged only on motion for new trial on this ground, and only on affidavits setting forth the alleged facts. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 658.) As said in <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>130 Cal. 205, [62 Pac. 474], \u201cit is quite evident that this ground for a new trial is intended to refer to matters which an appellant cannot fully present by exceptions taken during the progress of the trial, and which therefore must appear by affidavit.\u201d It is just as true here as it was in <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Torrance, </em>145 Cal. 144, [78 Pac. 540], that in the matter of the alleged departure from the due and orderly method of disposition of the action by which the substantial rights of a party have been materially affected, the \u201cdeparture is not evidenced by a ruling or order that may be made the subject of an exception,\u201d and the attempted statement is not within the proper scope of a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\">The application is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
