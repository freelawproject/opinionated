This court applies a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard when reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Liang asserts that her untimely filing should be excused because of changed country conditions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The time limit on the filing of a motion to reopen does not apply if, inter alia, the motion is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); \u00a7 1003,2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Liang makes no argument with respect to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that official documents submitted by her from the Peoples Republic of China were not authenticated properly. Liang has, therefore, waived review of that conclusion. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004). Liang\u2019s remaining submissions do not show that, if Liang returns to China, she will be subject to persecution because of changed country conditions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying her motion to reopen. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303. The petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
