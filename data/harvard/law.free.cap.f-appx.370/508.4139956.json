Hayes appeals the dismissal of the complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Hayes, who was convicted of indecency with a child in 1991, alleges that the Texas sex-offender registration laws violate the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Constitution; that he was improperly denied \u201cstreet time\u201d credits; that a 2004 conviction for failure to register was invalid; and that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the district court violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">A district court must sua sponte dismiss a prisoner\u2019s IFP \u00a7 1983 complaint if the action is malicious or frivolous, fails to state a claim, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). A claim may be dismissed as frivolous if it does not have an arguable basis in fact or law. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). This court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The district court determined that all of the defendants, but for Collier and Owens, were either immune from suit or were not personally involved in the alleged violations. Hayes did not challenge the district court\u2019s findings, and, as such, all claims against those defendants are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the remaining defendants on appeal are Collier (for the claim that conditions imposed on Hayes while on supervised release violated his constitutional rights) and Owens (for the claim that Hayes was denied \u201cstreet time\u201d credits).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Retroactive application of laws requiring sex-offender registration and notification do not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 103-04, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003). Moreover, Hayes has not set forth a viable double jeopardy claim because he has not established that he received \u201cmultiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>571 F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir.2009). Likewise, Hayes\u2019s claim that he was denied \u201cstreet time\u201d credit is meritless because prior to 2001 (when Hayes\u2019s supervision was revoked), Texas law required the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to disregard the street time a prisoner accumulated while released on parole, and, as such, Hayes had no liberty interest in those credits. <em>See </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.283 (Vernon 1998); <em>Thompson v. Cockrell, </em>263 F.3d 423, 425-28 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">The district court dismissed, pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), Hayes\u2019s claim that his 2004 conviction was invalid. Hayes failed to challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for the dismissal of this claim by failing to challenge the <em>Heck </em>bar. Because Hayes failed to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if he had not appealed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>issue. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), arguments must be briefed in order to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Hayes\u2019s claim is therefore deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Moreover, because Hayes failed to challenge the district court\u2019s finding that all defendants relevant to Hayes\u2019s 2004 conviction were either immune from suit or not personally involved, this claim is deemed abandoned for stronger reasons. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Hayes\u2019s conclusory allegations that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the district court violated his due process rights are insufficient to establish the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990). Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Hayes\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Hayes\u2019s appeal has no arguable merit, is frivolous, and is dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because Hayes was incarcerated at the time that he filed the instant complaint, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hayes\u2019s action as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Should Hayes be returned to prison and accumulate three strikes, he would not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Hayes is also warned that, as a non-prisoner, he is subject to sanctions if he makes any further frivolous filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Hayes\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNINGS ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
