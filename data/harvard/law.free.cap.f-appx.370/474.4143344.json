He contended that he was entitled to credit against his federal sentence for the time spent in state custody. The district court denied White\u2019s motion without assigning reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">White now appeals the denial of his pro se motion. He argues that a remand is required because the district court did not assign reasons for the denial of relief. Because the record conclusively shows that White is entitled to no relief, a statement of reasons was not required.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">White argues that he is entitled to credit on his federal sentence for the six-year period he spent in state custody following his sentencing by the district court. White\u2019s claim for credit on his federal sentence for the time he was incarcerated in state prison should be construed as seeking habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because he is challenging the manner in which his sentence is being executed rather than the legality of his conviction or the validity of his sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court \u201creviews de novo the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition on the pleadings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">\u201cTo entertain a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition, the district court must, upon the filing of the petition, have jurisdiction over the prisoner or his custodian.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> White filed his pleading in the Northern District of Texas while incarcerated in a federal prison facility in Arkansas. As a result, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the merits of White\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">We modify the judgment of the district court to explicitly reflect a dismissal for want of jurisdiction to entertain White\u2019s request. The judgment is affirmed as so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-17\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cik.
