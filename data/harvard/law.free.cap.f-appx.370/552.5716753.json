SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">Bertha Bloch appeals the rejection of a proof of claim filed in her son\u2019s involuntary bankruptcy ease. Because she has failed to establish a legally enforceable obligation by the debtor, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">On February 9, 2004, creditors placed Leonardo Reznick into involuntary chapter 7 bankruptcy. On August 20, 2004, the trustee, Ben Floyd, filed an adversary proceeding against Paul Ponte, one of Rez-nick\u2019s former business partners, alleging he owed Reznick $1,000,000 under a 1989 promissory note. The reference was withdrawn to the district court. Because the note was executed in Mexico, that court applied the applicable Mexican statute of limitations, which provides a ten-year period that is tolled and reset each time the debtor acknowledges the obligation. Under that provision, Ponte\u2019s obligation was still enforceable, because he had acknowledged the debt three times during the ten-year period. Ponte settled the claim for $400,000, providing the estate\u2019s only asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">Bloch is Reznick\u2019s mother. In light of the recovery from Ponte, Bloch on April 10, 2007, filed a proof of claim against Reznick for $770,000, plus interest, on alleged loans dating back to 1990. Bloch attached a one-page affidavit from Reznick in support of the claim. The trustee objected to the claim and testified at an evidentiary hearing before the bankruptcy court that Bloch had not put forth any evidence of a legally enforceable debt. According to the trustee, the documents Bloch supplied in response to its production request were mainly handwritten notes in Spanish, none of which supported her claim. The bankruptcy court agreed and disallowed Bloch\u2019s claim. The district court affirmed, finding \u201cno evidence of a legally enforceable debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. McGee v. O\u2019Connor (In re O\u2019Connor), </em>153 F.3d 258, 260 (5th Cir.1998). Bloch has not provided evidence that the alleged loans occurred in Mexico. She has also failed to establish any enforceable obligation on Reznick\u2019s part or even evidence of the transfer of more than $700,000 to her son. As Reznick\u2019s mother, Bloch is an insider within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(31)(A)(i). We subject such claims to strict scrutiny. <em>Pepper v. Litton, </em>308 U.S. 295, 306-07, 60 S.Ct. 238, 84 L.Ed. 281 (1939). Under such circumstances, Reznick\u2019s affidavit, standing alone, cannot create a pre-existing obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">Bloch argues that the district court acted inconsistently by applying Mexican law in the Ponte proceeding but Texas law as to her claim. This is unlike the situation in the Ponte dispute, in which the written promissory note, on its face, was executed in Mexico City. Bloch has put forth no evidence warranting the application of Mexican law to her claim. Even Reznick\u2019s affidavit failed to state where he incurred the alleged debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">The \u201cbasic rule in bankruptcy is that state law governs the substance of claims....\u201d <em>Raleigh v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>530 U.S. 15, 19, 120 S.Ct. 1951, 147 L.Ed.2d 13 (2000) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cWhen the parties have failed to conclusively establish foreign law, a court is entitled to look to its own forum\u2019s law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>order to fill any gaps.\u201d <em>Banco de Credito Indus., S.A. v. Tesoreria Gen., </em>990 F.2d 827, 836 (5th Cir.1993). Because Bloch failed to establish that Mexican law controlled, the district court properly applied Texas law. Absent a written, signed copy of the alleged agreement dating back to 1990, Bloch\u2019s claim is barred by the Texas Statute of Frauds. Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.Code \u00a7 26.01. Bloch did not put forth evidence of a legally enforceable debt, so her claim was properly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1031-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
