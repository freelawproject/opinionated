Wolfe appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to suppress. He argues that his detention following the initially valid traffic stop was unconstitutionally prolonged and that his consent to the search of his rental vehicle was not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-24\">We review findings of fact made by a district court on a motion to suppress for clear error' and the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusions on Fourth Amendment issues de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, in this case, the Government. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>328 F.3d 755, 758 (5th Cir.2003). We evaluate the legality of a traffic stop and a subsequent search under the familiar test of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). Wolfe contends that Trooper Dollar\u2019s suspicions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>were not reasonable and that after the decision was made to issue a warning, the continued detention was unreasonable. Contrary to Wolfe\u2019s assertion, Trooper Dollar had developed a reasonable and objective suspicion that Wolfe was engaged in illegal activity. At the time the computer checks came back clear, the emerging facts included (1) the observation in plain view of the torch lighter and butane canisters inside the vehicle and the large glass beaker in the trunk, items Trooper Dollar knew through his experience and training to be associated with methamphetamine; (2) the inconsistent statements of Wolfe and his passenger regarding the purpose of their trip and whom they visited in Phoenix; (3) the one-way rental of the vehicle; (4) the fact that Wolfe and his passenger were traveling from Phoenix, a known hub city for drug distribution; (5) Wolfe\u2019s increasing nervousness; and (6) the contradictory statements of Wolfe and his passenger regarding possession of the torch lighter. Trooper Dollar\u2019s actions were justified as a graduated response to emerging facts, were reasonable under the totality of the circumstances, and did not unconstitutionally extend Wolfe\u2019s detention. <em>See Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 506-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">With regard to Wolfe\u2019s consent to the search of the vehicle, we review the district court\u2019s finding that his consent was voluntary for clear error. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 436 (5th Cir.2002). The voluntariness inquiry turns on the evaluation of six factors. <em>United States v. Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d 431, 438 (5th Cir.1993). With regard to Wolfe\u2019s initial consent to the search, the district court found, inter alia, that Wolfe\u2019s custodial status was minimal, there was an absence of coercive police tactics, Wolfe had freely provided information to Trooper Dollar, Wolfe\u2019s subsequent withdrawal of consent evidenced his awareness that consent could be withdrawn, and Wolfe had an advanced education level; and that such factors weighed in favor of a finding that he voluntarily gave his consent to the search. Because no single factor is dispositive and because there were sufficient facts that together support the voluntariness of Wolfe\u2019s consent, there is no clear error. <em>See Solis, </em>299 F.3d at 436 &amp; n.21. Similarly, with regard to Wolfe\u2019s withdrawal of consent and subsequent reinstatement of consent, the district court found that such reinstatement was voluntary and not a product of coercion or threats given by Trooper Dollar. Given that the balance of the factor's tend to support the district court\u2019s finding of voluntariness of Wolfe\u2019s reinstatement of consent, there is no clear error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b575-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
