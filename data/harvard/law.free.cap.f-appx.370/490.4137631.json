Walters appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, arguing that prison officials (1) had failed to award all of the good-time credits to which he was entitled upon his completion of an education program in December 2003 and (2) had failed to backdate the award of those credits to his sentence-begin date, in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses and of the Fourteenth Amendment. We granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability on the first issue only. <em>Walters v. Quarterman, </em>No. 08-20599 (5th Cir. June 17, 2009) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">During the pendency of this appeal, Walters was released from prison to mandatory supervision. As a result, Walters\u2019s appeal has been rendered moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kenwa, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278-79 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the APPEAL is DISMISSED as MOOT. Walters\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cut. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
