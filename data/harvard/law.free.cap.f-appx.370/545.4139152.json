The Government moves for summary affir-mance or dismissal of the appeal, or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-26\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s \u25a0 sentence \u201cwhen it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion; the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in denying Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See id. </em>at 790. Further, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is not applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
