No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Johnson originally had a base offense level of 32 and a guidelines range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Johnson to 240 months. In his section 3582(c)(2) motion, Johnson requested a sentence reduction based on his post-sentencing rehabilitation and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He also contended that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny allowed the district court to resentence him below the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">The district court reduced Johnson\u2019s base offense level from 32 to 30, which resulted in a guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court sentenced Johnson to 168 months. But the court \u2014 citing binding precedent from our Court \u2014 refused Johnson\u2019s request to be sentenced below the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-13\">On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court erred in its application of section 3582(c)(2) because it refused to consider granting a reduction below his amended guidelines range despite the section 3553(a) factors, the advisory nature of the guidelines, and the policy of avoiding sentencing disparities. He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by our prior precedent and acknowledges that he raises it only to preserve it for later review. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">Here, the district court committed no error in denying Johnson\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion. We have made clear that neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), renders a guidelines range advisory in the context of a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). A district court is bound by the limitations imposed on its discretion by section 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (explaining that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under [section] 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b28-11\"> Amendment 706 retroactively reduced by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c).
