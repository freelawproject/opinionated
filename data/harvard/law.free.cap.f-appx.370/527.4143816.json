Hickman argues on appeal that the district court erred by determining \u2022that his claim that his federal sentence was intended to run concurrently with his state sentence was not cognizable under \u00a7 2241 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>or pursuant to the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and abused its discretion by failing to appoint counsel or hold an evi-dentiary hearing on his claim. He contends further that the district court abused its discretion by determining that he was not entitled to relief on his claim that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) erred by refusing to designate nunc pro tunc his state facility as the facility where he would serve his federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Because Hickman is proceeding under \u00a7 2241, he is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability to pursue his appeal. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). In reviewing the denial of habeas relief, the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and its legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Hickman\u2019s claims relating to promises made to him before sentencing or to his understanding of the plea agreement with regard to whether his federal sentence would run concurrently with or consecutively to his state sentence were challenges to the manner in which the sentence was determined. <em>See Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990). As such, the district court did not err by determining that those claims were not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding and were properly brought via a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Hickman also has not shown that the district court erred by determining that his claims could not be brought under \u00a7 2241 pursuant to the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. Hickman\u2019s claims are not being brought pursuant to a retroactive Supreme Court decision that establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense, and Hickman has not shown that his arguments were foreclosed by precedent at the time his original \u00a7 2255 motion was due. <em>See Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381-82 (5th Cir.2003). Therefore, he cannot show that the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>Id. </em>The fact that Hickman\u2019s claims are now time barred does not render the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>Pack v. Yusuff </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Because Hickman is unable to obtain relief on those claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing or appoint counsel. <em>Ellis v. Lynaugh, </em>873 F.2d 830, 840 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The BOP has wide discretion to designate a state correctional facility as the location in which an inmate can serve a federal sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b). The BOP elected not to exercise this discretion after reviewing the record in Hickman\u2019s case because there was no evidence therein that suggested that a concurrent sentence was agreed to or intended. <em>See Free v. Miles, </em>333 F.3d 550, 553 (5th Cir. 2003); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584. Because the BOP did not abuse its discretion, the district court did not err by denying Hickman\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as to this claim. <em>Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Incorporated in Hickman\u2019s brief is a motion for appointment of appellate counsel. Hickman has adequately briefed the issues on appeal. Therefore, his motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
