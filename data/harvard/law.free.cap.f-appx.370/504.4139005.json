This sentence was 12-months above the guidelines range of 63-78 months of imprisonment. \u25a0 We need not address Thomas\u2019s arguments that an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 was not appropriate because the sentence may be affirmed on the district court\u2019s alternate basis for the sentence as an upward variance justified by the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656-59 (5th Cir.2008)(affirming a non-guidelines alternative sentence despite that the district court had erroneously calculated the applicable guidelines range), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 904, 173 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-28\">Thomas argues that the above-guidelines sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not explain why it rejected his arguments that a lower sentence was warranted given that (1) most of his prior convictions were for misdemeanor offenses, (2) his past criminal activities were non-violent and were caused by his drug addiction, and (3) he had strong family ties. However, the district court was not required to engage in \u201crobotic incantations that each statutory factor has been considered.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, after listening to Thomas and his attorney\u2019s arguments as well as those of the Government, the district court explained that Thomas\u2019s extensive criminal history and his history of recidivism warranted a sentence above the guidelines. Thomas fails to show either that the district court failed to give adequate consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors or failed to offer an adequate explanation for the sentence imposed. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>445 (2007). Nor has he shown that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (5th Cir.2008)(affirming variance from the guideline maximum of 51 months to a sentence of 180 months); <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530-32 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming variance from the guideline maximum of 27 months to a sentence of 60 months); <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708-10 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
