Medina-Torres argues that the Guidelines range of imprisonment he faced was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that he should have been sentenced below the guidelines range. He cites <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and argues that this court should not accord the sentence a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal reentry Guideline is not supported by empirical data and national experience. Medina-Torres acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent but raises the issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The substantive reasonableness of Medina-Torres\u2019s sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Medina-Torres\u2019s argument that this court should not accord his within-Guidelines sentence a presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009); <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Further, Medina-Torres\u2019s suggestion that he is a reformed, mature family man does not rebut the presumption that his sentence was reasonable. However, he has an extensive criminal history and has been removed from the United States to Mexico on numerous occasions. Given the obvious need for deterrence and punishment, his sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Medina-Torres\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a term of supervised release is also unavailing. Even if he is deported from the United States, supervised release is an additional potential sanction that might deter him from attempting to reenter the United States unlawfully. Because \u201cadequate deterrence\u201d and protection of the public are valid considerations in determining whether to impose a term of supervised release, Medina-Torres has not shown an abuse of discretion in the imposition of a supervised release term. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>558 F.3d 408, 411 (5th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 394, 175 L.Ed.2d 268 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cik.
