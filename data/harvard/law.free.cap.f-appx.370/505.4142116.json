West presents four arguments: (1) that the district court erred at sentencing by enhancing his offense level by two pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.3 for abuse of a position of trust, (2) that the district court erred at sentencing by enhancing his offense level by two pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) for the use of sophisticated means in committing the offense, (3) that the district court erred by declining to award West a nonguideline sentence or a downward departure, and (4) that an alleged violation of the victim\u2019s statutory rights at sentencing violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Section 3B1.3 of the Guidelines provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust ... in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense, increase by 2 levels.\u201d Sava Care Corporation (Sava), West\u2019s employer, placed West in a position of trust that significantly facilitated the commission of the offense. West\u2019s employment gave him access to Sava\u2019s accounting and billing information and gave him a unique opportunity to alter those records without any immediate supervision under which the alterations were likely to be discovered before West received any money from them. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>7 F.3d 1155, 1161 (5th Cir.1993). The district court did not err in overruling West\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">Section 2B1.1(b)(9) of the Guidelines provides for a sentencing level increase if the offense involved \u201csophisticated means.\u201d \u201cConduct such as hiding-assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts ... ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 8. West\u2019s offense conduct involved (1) manipulation of a facility\u2019s computer system by altering patient records, financial information, and names and addresses, (2) directing others to send refund checks to alias identities, and (3) obtaining post office boxes in multiple locations, some of which were rented under aliases. The district court\u2019s determination that West used sophisticated means was not clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wright, </em>496 F.3d 371, 379 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Clements, </em>73 F.3d 1330, 1340 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">There is no merit in West\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a non-guideline sentence or a downward departure. The claim is conclusory. West has not shown that the sentence imposed is procedurally unsound or that the calculation of the advisory guidelines range is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>incorrect. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, a court of appeals is generally without jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure when its decision is based upon a determination that a departure was not warranted. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). Regarding the district court\u2019s refusal to impose a lesser, nonguideline sentence, the sentence is within the applicable guideline range of imprisonment and is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence within the applicable guideline range. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">West argues that because Sava was not identified as the victim until the morning of sentencing, it was not provided the rights afforded victims under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(b). West argues that his due process rights were violated in that he would have benefitted from knowing the identity of the alleged victim before he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">This argument is patently frivolous. Section \u00a7 3771 specifically provides that \u201c[a] person accused of the crime may not obtain any form of relief under this chapter.\u201d \u00a7 3771(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir.
