Maga-na-Bernal argues that he was entitled to a two-level reduction for his minor role in the conspiracy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The presentence investigation report stated that Magana-Bernal guarded one of several stash houses used by a large-scale drug organization that imported into Georgia more than 8000 kilograms of cocaine and exported to Mexico more than 155 million dollars in proceeds. The report attributed to Magana-Bernal the 70 kilograms of cocaine received at the stash house while he worked for the organization. The report listed a total offense level of 34 and, because Magana-Bernal had a criminal history of I, the report provided a sentencing range between 151 and 188 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Magana-Bernal objected to the report on two grounds. Magana-Bernal argued that he was entitled to a reduction for a minor role because he was a \u201ccaretaker\u201d instead of a guard of the stash house. Magana-Bernal also argued that he was responsible only for 46 kilograms of cocaine because he was incarcerated when 24 kilograms of cocaine were received at the stash house.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The district court overruled Magana-Bernal\u2019s objection about the minor role but sustained his objection about the amount of cocaine. The district court calculated Magana-Bernal\u2019s total offense level at 32 and a guideline range between 121 and 151 months of imprisonment. The district court imposed a sentence at the low end of the guideline range and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Magana-Bernal was not entitled to a minor role reduction. Although Magana-Bernal was not a leader of the conspiracy, his role was not minor. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5. Magana-Bernal willingly joined a large-scale conspiracy to distribute cocaine; he was responsible for guarding a stash house that received 70 kilograms of cocaine for distribution and processed approximately $818,500 in drug proceeds; and he participated in at least two transfers of drug proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Magana-Bernal argues the distinct court reduced the amount of drugs for which he was held responsible from 70 to 46 kilograms to \u201cfit a preconceived sentencing formula,\u201d but we disagree. The district court reduced the amount of drugs attributable to Magana-Bernal to reflect the actual quantity processed at the stash house while he was \u201cin charge.\u201d The district court did not clearly err by finding that Magana-Bernal did not qualify for a reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Magana-Bernal\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
