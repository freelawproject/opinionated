He contends that Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines provides a basis for a reduction of his sentence, even though he was sentenced as a career offender. Recognizing that this argument is squarely foreclosed by our opinion in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), Sapp requests that we overturn prior precedent in order to provide him his requested relief. We decline to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326. Once it is established that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir. 2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Here, however, the district court lacked such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">Any sentencing reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). \u201cThe effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction iri base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. Because Sapp\u2019s career offender status, not his base offense level, determined his sentencing range, he cannot show that Amendment 706 had the effect of lowering his applicable guidelines range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n.l(A) (stating that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u201cthe amendment ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d). As in <em>Moore, </em>although Amendment 706 would reduce his base offense level, it would not affect [his] guideline range because he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. 541 F.3d at 1330. Therefore, Amendment 706 provides no basis for a sentencing reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Moreover, Clark\u2019s argument that, irrespective of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements regarding sentencing reductions, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B), the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582 in light of <em>Booker </em>is unavailing. We have held that <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because they are not full resentencing hearings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In sum, because the record shows that Sapp\u2019s sentencing range was determined by application of the career-offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1 and not under \u00a7 2D1.1, the district court properly determined that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to modify Sapp\u2019s 360-month term of imprisonment in light of Amendment 706. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-11\">.
