Zaken\u2019s complaint alleged that Kelley used excessive force during his arrest for stealing a purse from Donna Hovanec by striking him in the head with a gun. On appeal, Zaken argues that: (1) Kelley violated discovery rules by failing to produce certain of Zaken\u2019s requests; (2) the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence and granting Kelley\u2019s untimely motion <em>in li-mine; </em>(3) the district court abused its discretion in permitting Kelley to wear his police uniform during the trial; (4) the district court abused its discretion by refusing to appoint counsel for Zaken; and (5) the jury decided the case incorrectly based on the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">We review the denial of a motion to compel discovery for abuse of discretion. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir.2006). Discovery rulings should not be overturned \u201cunless it is shown that [they] resulted in substantial harm to the appellant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Iraola &amp; CIA, S.A. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>325 F.3d 1274, 1286 (11th Cir.2003) (quotations omitted). We also review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion <em>in limine </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>Cabello v. Fernandez-Larios, </em>402 F.3d 1148, 1161 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, we review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, and will reverse only if the movant establishes that the ruling resulted in substantial prejudice. <em>Conroy v. Abraham Chevrolet-Tampa, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). In applying the standard, we will affirm \u201cunless the district court has made a clear error of judgment or has applied an incorrect legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). We also review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to appoint counsel for abuse of discretion. <em>Bass v. Perrin, </em>170 F.3d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">Finally, \u201c[t]he sufficiency of the evidence supporting a jury verdict is not renewable on appeal ... unless a motion for directed verdict was made at the close of all the evidence.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Attaway, </em>757 F.2d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.1985). \u201cIn the absence of such motion, our inquiry is limited to whether there was <em>any </em>evidence to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>port the jury\u2019s verdict, irrespective of its sufficiency, or whether plain error was noted which, if not noticed, would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">First, we are not persuaded that the district court abused its discretion by failing to find that Kelley violated the discovery rules. For starters, Zaken\u2019s allegations that Kelley violated the discovery rules by failing to produce either his booking photograph or jail dental records were not raised in the district court, and we therefore decline to consider these issues on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 1331. As for the alleged 26 color photographs Kelley faded to produce, Zaken likely did not raise this claim in the district court, but we will liberally construe his motion to compel the production of the digital camera and memory card that contained photographs of his injuries to conclude that Zaken was requesting more clear photographs of his injuries. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. 2006) <em>(\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d) (quotation omitted). However, his claim still lacks merit. During trial, Zaken described that it took 21 stitches to close his wound, which extended from his nose to his upper lip, and one of his front teeth was knocked out. Moreover, his booking photograph, which also would have shown his injuries, was introduced into evidence in addition to the 24 black and white photographs. Thus, the failure of Zaken to receive color as opposed to black and white photographs during discovery did not result in substantial harm to his case because the jury understood the severity of the injuries. <em>Iraola, </em>325 F.3d at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">We also reject Zaken\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence. Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-8\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">Overall, a two-part test governs the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence. <em>Lanham v. Whitfield, </em>805 F.2d 970, 972 (11th Cir. 1986). Under this test, it first must be determined whether evidence of other acts \u201cis relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). If so, \u201cthe evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must meet the other requirements of [Fed. R.Evid. 403].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of Kelley\u2019s alleged use of force against others. Zaken has not shown how the alleged similar facts of excessive force used by Kelley in prior incidents would be relevant to his cause of action except to show Kelley\u2019s bad character or propensity to use excessive force. <em>Id. </em>Further, while the district court acknowledged that the motion in limine was untimely, it also correctly acknowledged that Kelley could have raised the Rule 404(b) objection during trial if Zaken had attempted to introduce evidence of Kelley\u2019s prior use of excessive force. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1) (providing for contemporaneous objections during trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">We likewise reject Zaken\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in permitting Kelley to wear his police uniform during the trial. \u201cPersonal-capacity suits seek to impose personal liability upon a government official for ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>tions he takes under color of state law.\u201d <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 165, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). In <em>Doe v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., </em>394 F.3d 891, 918 n. 33 (11th Cir.2004), we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the plaintiff to wear her military uniform during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by permitting Kelley to attend the trial in his police uniform. This situation is somewhat analogous to the one in <em>Doe, </em>where we found no abuse of discretion in the plaintiff wearing a military uniform. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Zaken cannot show substantial prejudice because Kelley\u2019s employment as a police officer was an essential element that Zaken had to prove to succeed on his \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>Graham, </em>473 U.S. at 165, 105 S.Ct. 3099. Therefore, the jury would have been aware that Kelley was a police officer even if the district court had not permitted him to wear his police uniform.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Next, we disagree with Zaken\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to appoint counsel for Zaken who argued that his access to legal research was minimal and the case was complex. A plaintiff has no constitutional right to appointed counsel in a civil case. <em>Bass, </em>170 F.3d at 1320. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1), a court may appoint counsel for indigent plaintiffs, but only in exceptional circumstances. <em>Id. </em>These include cases featuring novel or complex facts or legal issues that require the assistance of a trained practitioner. <em>Dean v. Barber, </em>951 F.2d 1210, 1216 (11th Cir.1992). It is not dispositive that a plaintiff \u201cwould have been helped by the assistance of a lawyer\u201d; rather, counsel only may be appointed in exceptional circumstances. <em>Bass, </em>170 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Zaken fails to establish any exceptional circumstances. It may be true that his case would have been helped by lawyer assistance, but his case was not so unusual, novel, or complex to find that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request. <em>Id.; Dean, </em>951 F.2d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Finally, we find no merit in Zaken\u2019s argument that the jury decided the case incorrectly since one had to \u201cwonder\u201d whether Kelley had the \u201cright or reason\u201d to use such a high degree of force in arresting him. Under \u00a7 1983, a person may obtain relief if he was deprived of a constitutional right by an individual acting under the color of state law. <em>Lowe v. Aldridge, 958 F.2d 1565, </em>1569 (11th Cir. 1992). \u201cThe Fourth Amendment\u2019s freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures encompasses the plain right to be free from the use of excessive force in the course of an arrest.\u201d <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1197 (11th Cir.2002). A court should consider several factors in evaluating an excessive force claim, including: \u201c(1) the need for the application of force, (2) the relationship between the need and amount of force used, and (3) the extent of the injury inflicted.\u201d <em>Draper v. Reynolds, </em>369 F.3d 1270, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2004) (footnote and citation omitted). The ultimate issue \u201cis whether the officer\u2019s actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts confronting the officer, regardless of the officer\u2019s underlying intent or motivation.\u201d <em>St. George v. Pinellas County, </em>285 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">Because Zaken did not move for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence, we limit our inquiry to whether any evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Wilson, </em>757 F.2d at 1237. As the record shows, evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict because Kelley\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable. <em>St. George, </em>285 F.3d at 1337. Some factors point toward a finding that Kelley applied excessive force, including that: (1) purse snatching is a relatively minor crime; and (2) Zaken\u2019s injury, which required 21 stitches, was severe. <em>Draper, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>369 F.3d at 1277-78. However, evidence existed to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Kelley did not deprive Zaken of his constitutional rights by employing excessive force during the arrest. <em>Wilson, </em>757 F.2d at 1237. The trial testimony establishes that when Kelley ordered Zaken to stop running and get on the ground, Zaken failed to comply, and Kelley decided to use physical force to stop Zaken. Kelley chose to hit Zaken with his gun to avoid any harm to the public or himself. Kelley\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable under the above circumstances because Zaken had committed a crime, may have posed a danger to the public, and could have been armed. <em>St. George, </em>285 F.3d at 1337. In short, evidence existed to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Kelley did not deprive Zaken of his constitutional rights by employing excessive force during his arrest. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">. Zaken also argues that: (1) he was \"surprised\u201d when Kelley called Zaken's victim, Donna Hovanec, to testify, since Hovanec did not see the incident that led to the excessive force claim; and (2) Kelley failed to timely file his pretrial statement. However, Zaken did not object to the relevancy of Hovanec\u2019s testimony before the district court, and did not inform the district court at trial that Kelley had not met with him or that he needed more time to prepare for trial due to the late filing of Kelley's pretrial statement. Therefore, we decline to consider these issues on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that we generally will not consider an issue not raised in the district court).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
