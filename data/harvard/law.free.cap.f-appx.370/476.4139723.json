Douglas, Texas prisoner # 1004998, appeals the district court\u2019s dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>missal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. He argues that the defendants violated his constitutional rights by failing to address and rule on all of his state habeas claims. \u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. Portfolio Equities, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 333, 338 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Douglas argues that the defendants are not entitled to immunity from liability because they misused their power and acted contrary to federal and state law. Douglas has not shown that the defendants\u2019 actions or inactions were not judicial or prosecuto-rial in nature or that they were performed in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. <em>See Malina v. Gonzales, </em>994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 427-28, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Therefore, the district court did not err in holding that the defendants had absolute immunity from liability for actions taken in the scope of their judicial and prosecutorial duties. <em>See Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 27, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980); <em>see also Imbler, </em>424 U.S. at 427-28, 96 S.Ct. 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Douglas also argues that because he is not challenging the legality of his convictions or seeking damages for unconstitutional imprisonment, his action is not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Douglas fails to show that the district court erred in determining that his claims are barred by <em>Heck. See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Douglas\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Zarnow v. City of Wichita Falls, Tex., </em>500 F.3d 401, 407 (5th Cir.2007). Because at least three of his prior civil actions or appeals have been dismissed as frivolous and count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), Douglas is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see Douglas v. Folsom, </em>No. 9:01-CV-278 (E.D.Tex. Sept. 24, 2003); <em>In re Douglas, </em>No. H-03-1381 (S.D. Tex. June 13, 2003), <em>affd, </em>No. 04-20089 (5th Cir. June 22, 2004)(dismissing appeal as frivolous); <em>In re Douglas, </em>No. H-03-3955 (S.D.Tex. Oct. 20, 2003); <em>Douglas v. Cockrell, </em>No. 6:03-CV-102 (E.D.Tex. Dec. 3, 2003). Douglas is WARNED that any future frivolous filings will subject him to additional sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction, as will the failure to withdraw any pending matters that are frivolous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-34\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
