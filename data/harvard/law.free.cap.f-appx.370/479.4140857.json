Davis, Texas prisoner # 582332, has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of a motion he filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) challenging the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action. By filing such a motion, Davis is challenging the district court\u2019s certification, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(a), that any appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Davis also has filed a motion for the appointment of counsel to represent him on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-17\">A motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal filed in this court \u201cmust be directed, solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. A notice of appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in a civil proceeding does not bring up the underlying judgment for review. <em>Latham v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>987 F.2d 1199, 1203 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-20\">Although Davis raises several arguments pertaining to the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint, he has not addressed the district court\u2019s reasons for denying his Rule 60(b) motion. By failing to allege any abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Rule 60(b) relief, he has abandoned the only cognizable issue before this court. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, this court already has affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for a summary judgment in Davis\u2019s underlying civil action. <em>Davis v. Johnson, </em>353 Fed.Appx. 996, 997 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished). Davis has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-21\">Davis\u2019s motions for leave to proceed IFP and for the appointment of counsel are denied. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), it is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-22\">The dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous constitutes a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). As Davis has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is hereby put on notice that he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is in prison unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">IFP AND APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
