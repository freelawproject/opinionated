Villarreal asserts that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice \u2014 Correctional Institutions Division requires him to engage in prison labor or face disciplinary charges and punishment in violation of his constitutional rights. We review the dismissal as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). A complaint is \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it lacks \u201can arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cA complaint lacks an arguable basis in law if it is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory[.]\u201d <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">Villarreal argues that, because he was sentenced in 1994, when Texas law did not provide specifically for the imposition of labor on convicted inmates, compelling him to work violates the Thirteenth Amendment prohibition on involuntary servitude. The Thirteenth Amendment, however, excepts, from the general prohibition, compelled labor as punishment for a crime. <em>See Ali v. Johnson, </em>259 F.3d 317, 318 (5th Cir.2001). That exception applies even where the inmate, as in Villarreal\u2019s case, is not sentenced specifically to labor. <em>See id. </em>To the extent that Villarreal ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>gues that compulsory labor violates state law, he asserts a \u201cseparate, non-constitutional issue.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 318 n. 2. Villarreal\u2019s argument that he is compelled to work by the threat of disciplinary proceedings is similarly without merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Moreover, Villarreal has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing as frivolous his Tenth Amendment claim. The legal conclusion that compulsory labor for convicted inmates is constitutional does not contravene the Tenth Amendment\u2019s directive that \u201cpowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the legal conclusion supports the prerogative of the states to determine the appropriate punishment for violations of their laws. Villarreal\u2019s challenge that the state prison system, as part of the executive branch of state government, is acting as part of the judicial branch of government when it imposes labor as part of the punishment for a crime is equally without merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Villarreal argues that compelling him to work adds a further punishment to his sentence in violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy and his due process rights. The Double Jeopardy Clause \u201cprotects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense ... and then only when such occurs in successive proceedings.... \u201d <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 98-99, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997) (internal citations and emphasis omitted). The statutorily authorized labor in Texas is part of a convict\u2019s punishment in Texas, not an additional criminal punishment imposed in a separate proceeding. <em>See Ali, </em>259 F.3d at 317-18; <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 98-99,118 S.Ct. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Villarreal additionally contends that imposing labor on him pursuant to a statute enacted after he was sentenced violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Although application to Villarreal of the law specifically permitting compulsory labor was retrospective treatment, it neither altered the definition of criminal conduct nor increased his punishment. <em>See Lynce v. Mathis, </em>519 U.S. 433, 441, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997); <em>Ali, </em>259 F.3d at 318; <em>Mikeska, </em>900 F.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">Villarreal has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint as frivolous. <em>See Harper, </em>174 F.3d at 718. This appeal, likewise, is frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Both the district court\u2019s dismissal of Villarreal\u2019s complaint as frivolous and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Villarreal is warned that, if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal unless he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
