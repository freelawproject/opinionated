Kates, federal prisoner # 30428-077, is serving a 360-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. This court affirmed Kates\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Kates, </em>174 F.3d 580, 581-84 (5th Cir.1999). Kates filed a petition for habe-as corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 asserting that the Government had violated the prohibition against double jeopardy by using his prior convictions to enhance the penalty for the instant offense and that he was actually innocent of being a career offender. The district court determined that Kates could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claims did not satisfy the requirements of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\">If a prisoner can demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201c \u2018inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention,\u2019 \u201d he may be permitted to bring a habeas corpus claim pursuant to \u00a7 2241 under the \u201csavings clause.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting \u00a7 2255). \u201c[T]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904. Kates has not shown, that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
