In the instant 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint, May alleged that the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles violated his constitutional rights by determining that he is not eligible for parole or mandatory release. The district court determined that May had not stated a claim as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) and dismissed the complaint. May argues, inter alia, that he is eligible for good time credits, parole, and mandatory supervised release, and that it is unconstitutional to deprive him of these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">A prisoner\u2019s civil rights complaint should be dismissed if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915A(b)(l). This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915A dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, arguments that are inadequately briefed are considered abandoned. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). May\u2019s argument is conclusional and does not address the district court\u2019s decision that under Tex. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.134 (Vernon 2008), and Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 508.145(e), 508.149(a)(14) (Vernon 2008), May is not eligible for mandatory supervision and will not be eligible for parole consideration before serving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>sentence. Moreover, as the district court concluded, May is essentially challenging the terms of his sentence and his conviction under the Texas drug-free zone statutory scheme. He thus is seeking a speedier release from custody. No prisoner has a constitutional right to be released before the expiration of his sentence. <em>See Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). A challenge to the terms of imprisonment is properly brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 proceeding and is not cognizable in \u00a7 1983 proceedings. <em>See Allison v. Kyle, </em>66 F.3d 71, 73 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">May\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore dismissed as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the dismissal of this appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). May has one prior strike. <em>See May v. UTMB Medical Branch, </em>No. H-08-31062 (S.D.Tex.2008). Because May has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of seri- ' ous physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
