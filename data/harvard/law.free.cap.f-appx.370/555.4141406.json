Smith, appearing <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>appeals the decision of Respondent Railroad Retirement Board (\u201cRetirement Board\u201d) in which the Retirement Board rejected Petitioner\u2019s contention that his annual Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), which was applied to his monthly Railroad Retirement Annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act, was incorrectly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Petitioner was formerly employed by the Railroad Commission as a switchman and has received a monthly Railroad Retirement Annuity since at least 1985. In December 2008, Petitioner\u2019s annuity was adjusted according to the annual Cost of Living Adjustment authorized by 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 281b <em>et seq. </em>Shortly thereafter, Petitioner sent a letter to the Railroad Retirement Commission arguing that his COLA was incorrectly calculated and requesting a reconsideration of the calculation. In a letter dated February 24, 2009, a Reconsideration Specialist found that Petitioner\u2019s Tier I and Tier II annuity payments under the Railroad Retirement Act were correctly adjusted by applying the 2009 COLA of 5.8% to Tier I and 1.9% to Tier II. Petitioner appealed this decision to the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals. The hearings officer affirmed the findings of the Reconsideration Specialist. Petitioner filed a reconsideration appeal with a three member panel of the Retirement Board, again asserting that his COLA was incorrectly calculated. In a written decision dated June 29, 2009, the Retirement Board denied Petitioner\u2019s appeal. Petitioner timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">This Court will not set aside the Retirement Board\u2019s decision if its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence and its decision is not based on an error of law. <em>Kurka v. U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>615 F.2d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.1980). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">\n<em>B. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-15\">Petitioner appeals the Retirement Board\u2019s determination that his 2009 COLA was properly calculated. Retirement annuity consists of two tiers, Tier I and Tier II. The Tier I amount is \u201cequal to the amount ... of the old-age insurance benefit or disability insurance benefit to which such individual would have been entitled under the Social Security Act.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231b(a)(l). The Tier II amount is based on a statutory schedule based on \u201cyears of service\u201d and \u201caverage monthly compensation.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231b(b)(l). In the years that social security benefits are adjusted for changes in the cost of living, Tier I of the annuity is adjusted accordingly. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231b(a)(l). Tier II of the annuity is increased by 32.5% of the COLA percentage applied to Tier I of the annuity. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231b(g)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>In 2008, Petitioner\u2019s Tier I and Tier II monthly annuity payments totaled $1,404.80. The Tier I of that amount increased by 5.8% for the 2009 year, and, as a result, the Tier II amount increased by 1.9%. This increased Petitioner\u2019s 2009 monthly annuity payments to $1,486.75, an overall increase of $82.45 from 2008. The Retirement Board found that this was the proper COLA for Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Petitioner argues that his COLA should have increased by a total of $92.00, not $82.45, and that the Agency owes him the monthly difference of $9.55. Petitioner bases this contention on a United Transportation Union (UTU) Alumni Newsletter published in November 2008 which details the COLA percentages for the 2009 year and states that \u201cthe average regular Railroad Retirement employee annuity will increase $92 a month to $2,101....\u201d Petitioner misconstrues the definition of \u201caverage.\u201d Although each retiree\u2019s Tier I COLA percentage rate is the same, the actual dollar amount that each receives depends on the individual retiree\u2019s annuity amount. No evidence exists that Petitioner\u2019s 2009 COLA was incorrectly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the Retirement Board\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
