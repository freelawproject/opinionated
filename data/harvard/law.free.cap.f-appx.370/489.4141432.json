He was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute 50. or more grams of cocaine base and sentenced to 140 months. Jones argues that this court should review the substantive reasonableness of the district court\u2019s decision not to reduce his sentence. He contends that by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court essentially resentenced him to an above, the guidelines sentence without articulating the reasons for an upward departure and that the district court gave no weight to his unblemished disciplinary record with the Bureau of Prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-22\">This court reviews the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). The district court was not required to reduce Jones\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v, Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) &amp; cmt. n. 3. Nor was the court required to state findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674. The court did, however, state its reasons for denying Jones\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. At the original sentencing, the district court sentenced Jones based in part on his extensive criminal record and his propensity for violence. In denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the court stated that \u201c[h]aving reconsidered the factors set forth in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a), the sentence imposed is appropriate.\u201d Because the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 3, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to reduce Jones\u2019s sentence. Furthermore, Jones\u2019s substantive reasonableness argument is unavailing because reasonableness review, as outlined in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is not applicable to \u00a7 3582 proceedings. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674; <em>see also United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"Adq\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
