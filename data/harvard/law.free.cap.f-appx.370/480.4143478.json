Lawrence argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable and that a 60-month sentence would more adequately address the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2), and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-26\">The record shows that the district court based Lawrence\u2019s sentence on the advisory guidelines range, the information in the presentence report, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court considered Lawrence\u2019s arguments for a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range and the Government\u2019s arguments against such a sentence and determined that a 70-month sentence was appropriate. Lawrence is essentially asking this court to substitute his assessment of the appropriate sentence for that of the district court, which we will not do. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). He has not established that the district court abused its discretion in imposing his sentence, and he has not rebutted the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence was reasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
