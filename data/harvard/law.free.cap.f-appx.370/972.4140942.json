She alleges that during a meeting with Tara Mayes, her store manager, Mayes called Valdez \u201cnothing but an old bag\u201d. Valdez contacted Bob Noon from Staples\u2019s human resources department to report that Mayes had been loud and disruptive and had called her an \u201cold bag.\u201d Valdez admits that she did not expressly raise the issue of age discrimination in this conversation. Rebecca Ward, a colleague of Noon\u2019s from human resources, was sent to the Rome store to investigate Valdez\u2019s complaints about Mayes. Ward concluded that all of Valdez\u2019s claims about Mayes were unsubstantiated and that Valdez\u2019s behavior since the meeting had been disruptive and unprofessional. As a result, Ward recommended that Valdez be counseled for unprofessional behavior in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-19\">Sometime thereafter, one of Valdez\u2019s coworkers informed Mayes that she had seen Valdez filling out reward card applications using the phone book, in violation of Staples\u2019s policies. When Mayes asked Valdez if she had, in fact, filled out applications in this manner without customer consent, Valdez admitted that she had done so, but asserted that she was only doing what Mayes had previously instructed her to do. Mayes contacted Ward who, after another investigation, determined that Valdez should be terminated for falsifying documents in violation of Staples\u2019s ethics policy. Valdez was then terminated by Ward via telephone with Mayes and her assistant manager present.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-20\">We find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Valdez failed to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was terminated because of her complaint regarding Mayes. After Valdez complained about Mayes\u2019s \u201cold bag\u201d comment, Ward came to the Rome store and conducted an investigation, finding no merit to Valdez\u2019s complaint. Although Valdez may be dissatisfied with the results of Ward\u2019s investigation into Mayes\u2019s comment, the evidence shows that an independent investigation into her claims was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Further, after this investigation was completed, an independent report was made by one of Valdez\u2019s coworkers that she falsified documents in violation of company policies, a claim which Valdez does not dispute. Ward conducted another investigation into Valdez\u2019s claim that she had been instructed by Mayes to falsify documents and again found no merit in this claim Valdez\u2019s intervening act of misconduct and the intervening investigation by the corporate office were sufficient to erode any causal connection created by the close temporal proximity between Mayes\u2019 comment and the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-17\">. Valdez also brought a claim for age discrimination but later dismissed it voluntarily, with leave of the court. Accordingly, that claim is not presently before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
