Appellee was married to deceased on the 31st day of August, 1875. On June 17, 1872, Daniel Montague gave a mortgage, covering a portion of the land in controversy, to Celia Morrison, to secure the sum of $500, and on the 3d day of November, 1873, he gave a second mortgage to John Wood, covering a portion of said land, to secure an indebtedness of $852] and interest. These mortgages were executed in due form, and in each the said Montague released his homestead rights. . On October 20, 1876, Montague executed a third mortgage, his wife, the appellee, joining therein, covering another part of said land, to secure the principal sum of $1000, in which mortgage the appellee released her dower and homestead rights in said land. The first two mortgages were foreclosed at the March term, 1880, of the Madison county circuit court, upon a hill and cross-bill, and the premises were sold under the decree of said court on the 3d day of July, 1880, to J. H. Spence and John Sceclitig, for the sum of $1638. On the 7th day of August, 1880, all of the premises in controversy were sold by the administrator of the estate of Daniel Montague, by virtue of an order of the probate court, to appellants, for the sum of $3500, subject to all claims against it. After the sale to the appellants, the certificate of purchase held by Spence and Scechtig, and the note secured by the last mentioned mortgage, were transferred to appellants by the legal holders thereof, by a formal assignment on the backs of said instruments. The -only controversy about the facts is, that it will be claimed by appellee that when the administrator sold the land at public sale he announced that the purchasers .were to pay all the incumbrances, and that by virtue of that announcement they are legally bound to do so.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\" pgmap=\"448\">The question presented is, shall appellants be compelled to pay all of the above incumbrances, or must appellee contribute her proportionate share towards their payment before she can have dower in said premises.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-6\" pgmap=\"448\">Messrs.

Weiner v. Heintz et al. 17 Ill. 259.</p> <opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b449-11\" pgmap=\"449\">Mr. Justice Dickey</author> <p id=\"APD\" pgmap=\"449\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b449-12\" pgmap=\"449(43) 450(385) 451(81)\">In Washburn on Beal Estate it is correctly said, (vol. 1, p. 184,) that \u201cas the mortgagor, * * * if he discharge the mortgage, is not allowed to call upon another for contribution, having only paid his own debt, so, if the mortgaged estate is bought by a stranger, under such circumstances as to show that he only paid for the excess of its value over the mortgage, or so that one part of the estate satisfies the whole, the widow of the mortgagor will be let in to claim dower at law if 'such purchaser shall obtain discharge of the mortgage. \u201d This rule, however, applies only where \u201cthe mortgaged estate is bought by a stranger, \u201d by a purchase from the husband. In such case, the husband having by his contract of sale, made during coverture, provided for the discharge of the mortgage, the case in this regard stands as though he had himself paid off the mortgage during coverture. In case the husband, before marriage, had mortgaged his land, the wife, upon marriage, takes an inchoate right to dower only in the excess of the value of the land over the amount of the mortgage. If the husband in his life pays the mortgage, he acquires title to that interest in the land which at the time of marriage was in the mortgagee, and 'the wife\u2019s right to dower attaches to the same as to an interest in land bought by the husband during coverture. But if the mortgage be paid by the heir after the death of the husband, this is equivalent to a purchase by the heir of that interest in the estate which is in the mortgagee, and as the widow takes no dower in estates bought by the' heir, she acquires no right of dower in the new estate so bought by the heir. The right of the heir, however, having been acquired by removing an incumbrance upon an estate in which the heir and the widow each had an interest subordinate to the incumbrance, the widow, in such case, has the right, by a just contribution, to avail herself of the benefit of the purchase by the heir of the adverse title of the mortgagee. And so the same author says, (vol. 1, p. 187,) that \u201cif the mortgagee 'is in possession of the mortgaged premises for condition broken, or the purchaser of the equity of redemption who has redeemed the mortgage, the widow\u2019s remedy for the recovery of her dower is by bill in equity only, as she can not maintain a writ of dower until she has contributed her share of the redemption money. \u201d And so Kent says, (vol. 4, p. 48,) that \u201cthough the wife be dowable only of an equity of redemption when the mortgage was given prior to her marriage, or when she joined her husband in the mortgage, she is, after her husband\u2019s death, if she claims her dower, bound to contribute ratably towards the redemption of the mortgage. \u201d</p> <p id=\"b451-4\" pgmap=\"451\">A sale by the administrator, under our statute, of the real estate, is equivalent to a sale by the heir and an appropriation of the purchase money to the payment of the debts of the testator, the administrator being made, by statute, in substance the attorney in fact of the heir to make such sale. His power, where the land is mortgaged, is merely to sell the equity of redemption, for that is all that vests in the heir. The purchaser takes the right of the heir, no more, no less\u2014that is, the fee, subject to the mortgage. If the purchaser redeems from the mortgage, he holds as the heir would have held had he paid off the mortgage. The widow can have dower only by paying her ratable share of the money necessary to discharge the mortgage. The debt paid in discharging the mortgage, is not the debt of the heir. In paying that debt he is not \u201cpaying his own debt,\"\u201d as would be the case were the debt paid by the mortgagor in person. The case of Bank of Commerce v. Owens, 31 Md. 320, is directly in point on this question.</p> <p id=\"AkQ\" pgmap=\"451(90) 452(51)\">It is claimed that the administrator\u2019s sale was made on terms that the purchasers undertook to discharge not only the mortgages, but also the dower and homestead rights of the widow. The proofs are not satisfactory in support of the allegation. This, however, is not deemed material, for the administrator had no lawful authority to make any such terms. His agency arose from the statute. The bounds of his powers were therefore known to all. \u2022 He could sell just what the law authorized him to sell,\u2014that was, the rights of the heir,\u2014no more, no less. Had he in fact made such terms, his acts would have been inoperative. He had no power to divert from the use of the creditors a part of the value of the interest of the heir, and apply it to the use of the widow.</p> <p id=\"b452-6\" pgmap=\"452\">The reasoning applicable to the dower interest of the widow, is equally applicable to her claim of an estate of homestead. In the mortgages made by the husband before his marriage with appellee, he released his homestead right. In the mortgage made during coverture, her right of dower and his homestead right were duly relinquished by both husband and wife, as provided by statute. At the death of the mortgagor the rights of the mortgagees were all superior to the homestead right and the dower right. After the death of the husband the widow held both her right of dower and her estate of homestead, subject to the mortgagees, and they are still subject to the same rights in the hands of the purchasers at the administrator\u2019s sale, who have paid the mortgage debts.</p> <p id=\"b452-7\" pgmap=\"452\">The decree of the circuit court granting to the widow, unconditionally, dower and an estate of homestead, was therefore erroneous in not subjecting her rights each to the condition that she should, as to each right, contribute a ratable share, in regard to such right, of the redemption money paid by appellants for the discharge of the mortgages, before she should be permitted to avail herself of that right.</p> <p id=\"b452-8\" pgmap=\"452\">The decree is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded for other proceedings not incompatible to the views here expressed.</p> <p id=\"b452-9\" pgmap=\"452\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
