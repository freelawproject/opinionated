He explained that he had used the boys\u2019 bathroom in public places throughout Gloucester County and had never had a confrontation. He explained that he is a person worthy of dignity and privacy. He explained why it is humiliating to be segregated from the general population. He knew, intuitively, what the law has in recent decades acknowledged: the perpetuation of stereotypes is one of many forms of invidious discrimination. And so he hoped that his heartfelt explanation would help the powerful adults in his community come to understand what his adolescent peers already did. G.G. clearly and eloquently attested that he was not a predator, but a boy, despite the fact that he did not conform to some people\u2019s idea about who is a boy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Regrettably, a majority of the School Board was unpersuaded. And so we come to this moment. High school graduation looms and, by this court\u2019s order vacating the preliminary injunction, G.G.\u2019s banishment from the boys\u2019 restroom becomes an enduring feature of his high school experience. Would that courtesies extended to others had been extended to G.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">Our country has a long and ignominious history of discriminating against our most vulnerable and powerless. We have an equally long history, however, of brave individuals \u2014 Dred Scott, Fred Korematsu, Linda Brown, Mildred and Richard Loving, Edie Windsor, and Jim Obergefell, to name just a few \u2014 who refused to accept quietly the injustices that were perpetuated against them. It is unsurprising, of course, that the burden of confronting and remedying injustice falls on the shoulders of the oppressed. These individuals looked to the federal courts to vindicate their claims to human dignity, but as the names listed above make clear, the judiciary\u2019s response has been decidedly mixed. Today, G.G. adds his name to the list of plaintiffs whose struggle for justice has been delayed and rebuffed; as Dr. King reminded us, however, \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d G.G.\u2019s journey is delayed but not finished. \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">G.G.\u2019s case is about much more than bathrooms. It\u2019s about a boy asking his school to treat him just like any other boy. It\u2019s about protecting the rights of transgender people in public spaces and not forcing them to exist on the margins. It\u2019s about governmental validation of the existence and experiences of transgender people, as well as the simple recognition of their humanity. His case is part of a larger movement that is redefining and broadening the scope of civil and human rights so that they extend to a vulnerable group that has traditionally been unrecognized, unrepresented, and unprotected.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">G.G.\u2019s plight has shown us the inequities that arise when the government organizes society by outdated constructs like biological sex and gender. Fortunately, the law eventually catches up to the lived facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731-737\">*731-737</page-number>people; indeed, the record shows that the Commonwealth of Virginia has now recorded a birth certificate for G.G. that designates his sex as male.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">G.G.\u2019s lawsuit also has demonstrated that some entities will not protect the rights of others unless compelled to do so. Today, hatred, intolerance, and discrimination persist \u2014 and are sometimes even promoted \u2014 but by challenging unjust policies rooted in invidious discrimination, G.G. takes his place among other modern-day human rights leaders who strive to ensure that, one day, equality will prevail, and that the core dignity of every one of our brothers and sisters is respected by lawmakers and others who wield power over their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">G.G. is and will be famous, and justifiably so. But he is not \u201cfamous\u201d in the hollowed-out Hollywood sense of the term. He is famous for the reasons celebrated by the renowned Palestinian-American poet \u2022Naomi Shihab Nye, in her extraordinary poem, <em>Famous. </em>Despite his youth and the formidable power of those arrayed against him at every stage of these proceedings, \u201c[he] never forgot what [he] could do.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Judge Floyd has authorized me to state that he joins in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-10\">.
