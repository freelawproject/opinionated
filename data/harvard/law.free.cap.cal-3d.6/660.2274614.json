App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 889 [83 Cal.Rptr. 591, 464 P.2d 47].) On the initial appeal, we held that in determining an employee\u2019s \u201cearning capacity\u201d for purposes of computing his \u201caverage weekly earnings\u201d under Labor Code section 4453, subdivision (d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board is required to give \u201cdue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>consideration\u201d to an applicant\u2019s <em>post-injury earnings </em>insofar as such earnings shed light on the applicant\u2019s earning capacity at the time of his injury. Since the record before us on that initial appeal did not reveal either that the board had given such \u201cdue consideration\u201d to petitioner Goytia\u2019s post-injury earnings, or that there was any reason to conclude that such post-injury earnings were not relevant to the applicant\u2019s \u201cearning capacity,\u201d we remanded the matter to the WCAB for further action consistent with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">On remand, the board properly noted that under section 4453, subdivision (d) the relevant \u201cearning capacity\u201d is the \u201cearning capacity of the injured employee <em>at the time of his injury,\u201d </em>(italics added) and thus that an applicant\u2019s post-injury earnings are only significant in this context insofar as they illuminate the employee\u2019s earning capacity at this earlier date. Having made this valid observation, however, the board inexplicably refused to undertake any factual inquiry into the present applicant\u2019s circumstances or intentions \u201cat the time of the injury\u201d to determine if her post-injury earnings were in fact relevant to her \u201cearning capacity\u201d at that time; instead, the WCAB simply held, in effect as a matter of law, that it would only consider an applicant\u2019s post-injury earnings in cases in which there was \u201cspecific evidence of some actual steps taken by the employee ... to improve himself prior to the injury.\u201d Because the board found no such \u201cspecific evidence\u201d present in the instant case, it refused to consider the applicant\u2019s post-injury earnings and merely reinstated its initial award without modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The employee sought a writ of review from the board\u2019s determination, contending that this latest administrative decision conflicted with our earlier opinion in this matter. We granted a hearing and, for the reasons discussed below, have concluded that the employee\u2019s objections must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The facts giving rise to this litigation are fully set out in our initial opinion (1 Cal.3d at pp. 891-892); we briefly summarize only the most pertinent. Petitioner, Ruth Goytia, sustained a wrist injury on April 15, 1966, while employed by the California Packing Corporation; prior to her injury, she had worked for many years as a seasonal packer on a part-time basis, with sufficient earnings to entitle her only to a minimum compensation rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>of $20 per week. Subsequent to her injury, however, in July 1967, after her children had grown older and no longer needed her constant care, Mrs. Goytia obtained full-time, permanent employment as a cashier; her earnings on the full-time job would have sufficed to produce a compensation rate of $50.57 per week. In its initial decision in this matter, the board rejected the' referee\u2019s award of compensation at the full-time rate, and instead set Mrs. Goytia\u2019s permanent disability award only with reference to the minimum rate, noting in its decision that \u201c[a]t the time of her injury applicant\u2019s earnings were admittedly minimum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">In annulling this initial WCAB decision on the applicant\u2019s prior appeal, we held that the \u201cearning capacity\u201d concept of section 4453, subdivision (d) could not properly be equated with an employee\u2019s \u201cearnings\u201d at the time of the injury, and that in determining an employee\u2019s \u201cearning capacity\u201d under the section, the board was required to give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to an employee\u2019s post-injury earnings. In so holding, we recognized that since the \u201cearning capacity\u201d concept, as created by the statutory provision, was to be utilized to estimate the monetary effects of a disability on <em>future </em>earnings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cearning capacity\u201d could not be \u201clocked into ... the actual earnings of the worker at the date of injury, [but instead] the term contemplates [the employee\u2019s] general over-all capability and productivity; . . .\u201d (1 Cal.3d at p. 894.) We remanded Mrs. Goytia\u2019s claim to the board with directions to give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to the applicant\u2019s post-injury earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On remand the board, although purporting to give Mrs. Goytia\u2019s post-injury earnings the \u201cdue consideration\u201d required by our decision, in reality ignored such earnings completely, and instead indicated that it would only consider post-injury earnings in a limited class of cases, cases in which, in the board\u2019s language, there was \u201cspecific evidence of some actual steps taken by the employee himself to improve himself prior to the injury. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Although our original opinion contained no such limitation, and, on the contrary, indicated that \u201cdue consideration\u201d should be given to post-injury earnings in all cases, the WCAB apparently fashioned its own limitation, of this broad principle by narrowly focusing on the specific facts of several earlier decisions which had properly taken post-injury earnings into account in determining an employee\u2019s earning capacity. Thus, because the applicants in both <em>Jeffares </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 548 [86 Cal.Rptr. 288] and <em>Esparza </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California </em>(1966) 31 Cal.Comp.Cases 433<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were in fact attending school to augment their \u201cearning capacity\u201d at the time of their injuries, and thus had \u201ctaken . . . actual steps to improve\u201d themselves prior to the injury, the board transformed this element into a <em>legal prerequisite </em>for the consideration of post-injury earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Neither of the above precedents, however, contains the slightest indication that such \u201cspecific evidence\u201d of affirmative, \u201cself-improving\u201d action on the part of the applicant is <em>required </em>before post-injury earnings should be considered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, in our prior <em>Goytia </em>opinion we discussed with approval the decision of <em>Dole Corporation </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (Pargaz) </em>(1966) 31 Cal.Comp.Cases 41, in which post-injury earnings were properly considered even though absolutely no evidence indicated that any steps were taken by the applicant to \u201cimprove himself\u201d prior to the injury. (1 Cal.3d at pp. 896-897.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In light of the general rationale of our initial <em>Goytia </em>opinion, and our explicit approval in that opinion of the WCAB\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Dole, </em>we must agree with petitioner\u2019s contention that the limitation imposed by the board on the consideration of post-injury earnings is inconsistent with our prior decision in this matter. Moreover, the facts of the instant case clearly illustrate the arbitrariness of the board\u2019s proposed rule. Although there may be no \u201cspecific evidence ... of actual steps taken by [Mrs. Goytia] to improve [herself] prior to the injury,\u201d a trier of fact, in view of the explanation of her ultimate acceptance of full-time employment, i.e., the maturation of her children, could very reasonably conclude that, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>at the time of injury, the applicant intended to seek full-time employment when her children were grown. If this were the case, and petitioner offered to produce evidence before the board to support such a conclusion,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mrs. Goytia\u2019s post-injury, full-time earnings would certainly be a, significant indicant of her \u201cearning capacity ... at the time of [her] injury.\u201d (See <em>Goytia </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 889, 897-898 [83 Cal.Rptr. 591, 464 P.2d 47].)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">In sum, we conclude that the board, in refusing to consider the employee\u2019s post-injury earnings without inquiring into the applicant\u2019s actual intentions at the time of her injury, has failed to give the \u201cdue consideration\u201d to her post-injury earnings mandated by our initial decision in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board is annulled and the case is remanded to that board for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Peters, J., Mosk, J., Burke, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-12\"> Labor Code section 4453, subdivision (d), provides for the computation of \u201caverage weekly earnings\u201d as follows: \u201cWhere the employment is for less than 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>hours per week, or where for any reason the foregoing methods of arriving at the average weekly earnings cannot reasonably and fairly be applied, the average weekly earnings shall be taken at 95 percent of the sum which reasonably represents the average weekly earning capacity of the injured employee at the time of his injury, due consideration being given to his actual earnings from all sources and employments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Afu\">Hereafter all section references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\"> \u201cThe subdivision, in alluding to earning \u2018capacity\u2019 must necessarily refer to earning <em>potential </em>which may not, and probably will not, be reflected by prior part-time earnings.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Goytia </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 889, 895 [83 Cal.Rptr. 591, 464 P.2d 47]; see <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 589, 594-595 [21 Cal.Rptr. 545, 371 P.2d 281]. (\u201cAn estimate of earning capacity is a prediction of what an employee\u2019s earnings <em>would have been </em>had he not been injured. . . . [A]ll facts relevant and helpful to make the estimate must be considered. . . . The applicant\u2019s ability to work, his age and health, <em>his willingness and opportunities to work, </em>his skill and education, the general condition of the labor market, and employment opportunities for persons similarly situated are all revelant.\u201d) (Italics added.))</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\"> Although the board purported to qualify this limitation by indicating that it might not require evidence of \u201cactual steps\u201d of self-improvement if there were \u201cother convincing evidence not dependent upon the fact of the injury,\u201d the board\u2019s action in the instant case illustrates a total disregard for any such qualifying condition. As the board itself recognized, the explanation for Mrs. Goytia\u2019s acceptance of full-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>time employment\u2014the growth of her children\u2014was clearly not \u201cdependent upon the fact of the injury\u201d; nevertheless the board refused to give any consideration to her post-injury earnings, thus revealing that its decision actually rested simply on the absence of any \u201cspecific evidence of . . . actual steps taken by [Mrs. Goytia] to improve [herself] prior to the injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> The <em>Jeffares </em>decision was decided subsequent to our initial <em>Goytia </em>opinion, and explicitly relied upon that decision; the <em>Esparza </em>case was cited with approval in the first <em>Goytia </em>opinion (1 Cal.3d at p. 897).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\">The <em>Jeffares </em>decision states without qualification that \u201c[a]n intent by an injured part-time employee to work full time in the future is a factor which must be considered in determining earning capacity.\u201d (6 Cal.App.3d at p. 552.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\"> In her petition for reconsideration from the board\u2019s latest decision, Mrs. Goytia specifically requested a hearing on the issue of whether, at the time of her injury, she had already decided to seek full-time employment as soon as her children were old enough to care for themselves. Her petition also contained an offer of proof on this matter, supporting her contention that at the time of her injury she did intend to seek permanent employment in the near future. The WCAB refused reconsideration, indicating that whatever Mrs. Goytia\u2019s testimony might be, the board would not alter its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Although a trier of fact would, of course, not be obligated to believe Mrs. Goytia\u2019s testimony as to her intentions at the time of her injury, the board could not properly conclude that the proffered evidence was fallacious without even hearing the applicant\u2019s testimony. Indeed, inasmuch as Mrs. Goytia\u2019s reasons for obtaining full-time employment were fully consistent with her proposed testimony, the board\u2019s summary rejection of such evidence can only be described as arbitrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
