Mathews died on December 3, 1969. His widow\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>peition for review of the decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board (Board) denying compensation presents to us the deceptively simple question whether Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (g),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which bars an \u201cinitial physical aggressor\u201d from benefits, is consonant with section 21, article XX.of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have concluded that the state Constitution does not prohibit the Legislature from conditioning the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>to compensation upon the absence of wilful misconduct or other intentional wrongdoing. Consequently, we find that section 3600, subdivision (g), is constitutional and that the Board did not err in failing to award compensation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">The unfortunate facts which gave rise to this proceeding may quickly be summarized. Mathews was employed by Western Contractors, Inc. as a heavy-duty truck driver at the Castaic Dam site in Los Angeles County. On September 30, 1969, Mathews had just stopped his truck at the dam site when he was approached by Marcus Cedillo, who was in charge of directing incoming trucks to appropriate places for unloading. Cedillo told Mathews that his truck was blocking traffic and would have to be moved. Mathews replied with an obscene remark and gesture; Cedillo responded similarly.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Mathews climbed down out of the cab of his truck and began walking toward Cedillo with his fists clenched at his sides. Cedillo, who was shorter and lighter than Mathews, picked up two rocks and began backing away. Both men hesitated, and Cedillo drew a line in the dirt with his foot, warning Mathews not to cross it. This action apparently fueled Mathews\u2019 anger. He crossed the line and advanced toward Cedillo. Cedilk&gt; threw one rock past Mathews, who ducked, lost his hard hat, and lunged toward Cedillo to grab or strike him. Cedillo struck Mathews in the forehead with the second rock; Mathews fell and lay unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">As a result of the injuries thus received, Mathews died two months later without ever having regained consciousness. His widow, Jessie Mathews (applicant), sought workmen\u2019s compensation death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">After holding a hearing at which the foregoing evidence was adduced and legal argument was presented, the referee determined that \u201c[t]he evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that Halfred C. Mathews was involved in an altercation on September 30, 1969, in which he was the initial aggressor.\u201d Nevertheless, the referee awarded full death benefits, holding section 3600, subdivision (g), unconstitutional because it denied \u201ccompensation on the basis of the fault of the injured employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Upon reconsideration, the Board found that the injury fell within the terms of section 3600, subdivision (g). However, it held that the section was constitutional and ordered that \u201capplicant take nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Applicant petitioned for a writ of review annulling this decision. She contends that the Board erred in finding that her husband was the initial physical aggressor in the altercation which caused his death. She also argues that even if the Board\u2019s finding is proper, she is entitled to compensation because section 3600, subdivision (g), is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Section 3600, subdivision (g), bars recovery only when two conditions are present. First, the injury for which workmen\u2019s compensation is sought must \u201carise out of an altercation.\u201d Second, the injured employee must be the \u201cinitial physical aggressor\u201d in that altercation.  Section 3202 enjoins us to construe the workmen\u2019s compensation provisions of the Labor Code liberally \u201cwith the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d Consequently, the provisions of subdivision (g) of section 3600, which deny compensation to persons so injured, must be narrowly and strictly construed. (See <em>Fruehauf Corp. </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 569, 577 [68 Cal.Rptr. 164, 440 P.2d 236].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">To \u201carise out of an altercation,\u201d as required by section 3600, subdivision (g), an injury must result from an exchange between two or more persons characterized by an atmosphere of animosity and a willingness to inflict bodily harm. An altercation is distinguishable from \u201chorseplay\u201d or \u201cskylarking,\u201d neither of which involves such animosity, although either may result in bodily harm. <em>(Litzmann </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 203, 209-210 [71 Cal.Rptr. 731]; <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. (Helm) </em>(1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 669, 682-683 [55 Cal.Rptr. 810].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In this case, the record contains ample evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that Mathews\u2019 injuries arose out of an altercation. It clearly appears that Cedillo and Mathews were not engaged in a joint frolic. On the contrary, each obviously intended to inflict physical harm upon the other; Cedillo was successful. Mathews\u2019 death followed from the injury thus sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The second condition of section 3600, subdivision (g), presents more difficulty; it requires us to determine what type of conduct the Legislature intended to discourage when it denied compensation to an \u201cinitial physical aggressor.\u201d As Larson has pointed out, one of the practical difficulties in attempting to bar an aggressor from benefits is \u201cthe homely fact that, long after a quarrel is over, it is often almost impossible to determine who really started it.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1968 ed.) \u00a7 11.15(c), p. 159.) Section 3600, subdivision (g), \u201cimposes the necessity of selecting one overt act out of a series of hostile verbal, psychological, and physical acts as the one that, for compensation purposes, caused the quarrel and elicited the ultimate injury.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cphysical\u201d indicates that it was pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>marily concerned with the increased risk of injury which arises when a quarrel moves from an exchange of hostile words and nonviolent gestures to a trading of physical blows.  Thus, one is not an \u201cinitial physical aggressor\u201d so long as he confines his antagonism to arguments, epithets, obscenities or insults.  Instead, an \u201cinitial physical aggressor\u201d is one who first engages in physical conduct which a reasonable man would perceive to be a \u201c \u2018real, present and apparent threat of bodily harm. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Briglia </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission </em>(1962) 27 Cal.Comp.Cases 217, 218.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Although the issue is not free from difficulty, nevertheless the record discloses substantial evidence in support of the Board\u2019s conclusion that Mathews was the initial physical aggressor. In the context of his altercation with Cedillo, Mathews\u2019 conduct in leaving his truck and advancing upon Cedillo with clenched fists held at his sides definitely appeared menacing. Since Mathews was several inches taller and 30 pounds heavier than Cedillo, a reasonable man in Cedillo\u2019s position might have considered Mathews\u2019 acts to be a real, present and apparent threat of bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Applicant argues that Mathews could not have been the \u201cinitial physical aggressor\u201d because he did not \u201cthrow the first punch.\u201d  However, the Board has properly held that \u201c[i]t is not necessary that there be a battery before one can be deemed a physical aggressor\u201d <em>(Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Wong </em>(1964) 30 Cal.Comp.Cases 103, 104); \u201c \u2018bodily contact ... is not the significant factor.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Briglia </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, supra, </em>27 Cal.Comp.Cases 217, 218.) He who by physical conduct first places his opponent in reasonable fear of bodily harm is the \u201cinitial physical aggressor.\u201d His act need not actually cause physical harm; throwing a punch or shooting a gun is not necessary. Under appropriate circumstances, clenching a fist or aiming a gun may be sufficient to convey a real, present and apparent threat of physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Applicant also contends that even if Mathews became an \u201cinitial physical aggressor\u201d by advancing on Cedillo with clenched fists, Cedillo\u2019s later, unjustified use of excessive force in repelling the attack changed the situation, removing the bar to applicant\u2019s recovery. However, section 3600, subdivision (g), simply does not support applicant\u2019s thesis that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the label \u201cinitial physical aggressor\u201d automatically shifts from one disputant to the other whenever either uses excessive force. Rather the section bars compensation to the <em>\u201cinitial </em>physical aggressor,\u201d to him who <em>first </em>introduces an element of physical violence into the confrontation, thus creating the risk of injury. Later acts of his opponent, which unjustifiably increase the level of violence, do not absolve the <em>initial </em>aggressor. Consequently, even if Cedillo used excessive force in repelling Mathews\u2019 attack, Mathews was, and remained, the initial physical aggressor. Under these circumstances, the Board correctly concluded that section 3600, subdivision (g), precludes any award of death benefits to applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Her first argument having failed, applicant next asserts that she is entitled to compensation because section 3600, subdivision (g) is unconstitutional. She points out that section 21, article XX of the California Constitution gives the Legislature power to create a complete system of workmen\u2019s compensation providing benefits \u201cirrespective of the fault of any party.\u201d Applicant argues that \u201c \u2018fault\u2019 connotes volitional as well as negligent activity\u201d and that section 21 prohibits the Legislature from conditioning the right to compensation on the absence of fault. Since section 3600, subdivision (g), denies compensation to those who wilfully create violent confrontations, she contends that it implicitly involves a \u201cfault\u201d criterion prohibited by section 21. In support of her argument, she cites <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. (Hull) </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 659 [242 P.2d 311], in which we abolished the judicially created aggressor defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">While applicant\u2019s argument has a surface plausibility, an examination of the legislative history behind the workmen\u2019s compensation laws and section 21 of article XX demonstrates that the contention rests upon a basic misconstruction of the Constitution.  As the following discussion demonstrates, the use of the phrase \u201cirrespective of the fault of any party\u201d in section 21 was intended only to give the Legislature power to grant benefits unhampered by common law tort concepts of <em>negligence; </em>it has never been construed as prohibiting the Legislature from increasing, decreasing or even eliminating awards based upon the <em>wilful wrongdoing </em>of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">At the turn of the last century, a public clamor arose for reform of the laws relating to recovery for injuries received at work. By that time increasing industrialization in the United States had combined with an unfortunate development of common law tort doctrines<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>a large number of industrial injuries for which workmen were denied all recovery. (See 1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.20, pp. 37-39.) California\u2019s first response to this tide of public opinion was to make the fellow-servant rule and the assumption of risk defense inapplicable in certain types of accidents. (Stats. 1907, ch. 97, pp. 119-120; 2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation (2d ed. 1970) \u00a7 1.03[3][c], pp. 1-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Such minor revisions, however, proved insufficient. In 1911, California joined a rapidly growing number of states in adopting a true workmen\u2019s compensation act (Stats. 1911, ch. 399, p. 796), based on similar legislation enacted in Germany. (See 2 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.04, pp. 1-18\u20141-23; 1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.10, pp. 33-36.) The California legislation, commonly known as the Roseberry Act, abolished the assumption of risk defense and the fellow-servant rule in cases involving industrial injuries, and greatly modified the contributory negligence defense in such cases. (Stats. 1911, ch. 399, \u00a7 l,p. 796.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In addition, the Roseberry Act established a voluntary system of workmen\u2019s compensation. The liability of a participating employer for his employee\u2019s injuries was no longer governed by common law tort doctrines. Rather, the act imposed liability for compensation \u201cwithout regard to negligence\u201d for injuries accidentally sustained by an employee while \u201cperforming service growing out of and incidental to\u201d their employment. (Stats. 1911, ch. 399, \u00a7 3, pp. 796-797.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the employer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>not liable for compensation if the injury was caused by the employee\u2019s own wilful misconduct. <em>(Id.) </em>Where the injury resulted from the employer\u2019s personal gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or violation of any statute designed for the protection of the employee from bodily injury, the injured employee was permitted to choose between statutory compensation and a common law action for damages. <em>(Id.) </em>Under the voluntary plan, therefore, compensation was available without regard to negligence of either employer or employee, but was still denied to an employee guilty of wilful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">One month after the Roseberry Act became effective, section 21 of article XX was approved by the voters and added to the Constitution. The new section provided: \u201cThe legislature may by appropriate legislation create and enforce a liability on the part of all employers to compensate their employees for any injury incurred by said employees in the course of their employment <em>irrespective of the fault of either party.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Because few employers had chosen coverage under the voluntary plan established by the Roseberry Act, in 1913 the Legislature exercised the power conferred upon it by section 21 of article XX and enacted a compulsory scheme of workmen\u2019s compensation. (See 2 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.04[3], p. 1-23.) Officially titled the \u201cworkmen\u2019s compensation, insurance and safety act\u201d (Stats. 1913, ch. 176, \u00a7 1, p. 279), the new act was popularly known as the Boynton Act. Aside from changing workmen\u2019s compensation from a voluntary to a compulsory system, the Boynton Act strengthened the powers of the Industrial Accident Commission, extended greater control over compensation insurers, and gave the commission power to prescribe safety regulations for employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Section 12 of the Boynton Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> carried forward the provisions of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>3 of the Roseberry Act, imposing liability for compensation \u201cwithout regard to negligence.\u201d An employee injured by his own wilful misconduct was still denied compensation. As under the Roseberry Act, an employee was permitted to choose a damage action rather than statutory benefits if his injuries were caused by the employer\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct, indicating \u201ca wilful disregard of the life, limb, or bodily safety of employees.\u201d In addition, section 12 contained new language precluding from compensation those injured by their own intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">In 1917 the Legislature substantially revised the existing law to meet problems which had arisen under the Boynton Act. The \u201cworkmen\u2019s compensation, insurance and safety act of 1917\u201d (Stats, 1917, ch. 586, \u00a7 2, p. 833) represented the full evolution of the workmen\u2019s compensation system. The policy behind the statute and its goals were summarized in its first section which has been reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Section 6 of the 1917 act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> continued in amended form the provisions of section 12 of the Boynton Act and section 3 of the Roseberry Act. Again liability for compensation was imposed on employers \u201cwithout regard to negligence.\u201d Nevertheless, the 1917 act continued to deny compensation for injuries resulting from the employee\u2019s own intoxication and, for the first time, also barred statutory benefits where the injury was intentionally self-inflicted. Although an employee\u2019s wilful misconduct no longer totally precluded his recovery, it reduced his award by 50 percent. Similarly, an employee injured by his employer\u2019s serious and wilful misconduct was not permitted a damage action, but his award was increased by 50 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>The same month that the 1917 act was approved, the Legislature, by joint resolution, recommended to the voters an amendment of section 21 of article XX. The proposed amendment duplicated in large measure section 1 of the 1917 act,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and was intended to remove all doubts as to the constitutionality of then existing workmen\u2019s compensation laws.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On November 5, 1918, the amendment was approved by the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Section 21 of article XX has not been amended since 1918. Nor have the basic provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation law been changed in the intervening years. Section 3600 of the Labor Code (see fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>which is the codification of section 6 of the 1917 act, still imposes upon employers liability for compensation \u201cwithout regard to negligence.\u201d It still denies compensation where the injury was caused by the employee\u2019s intoxication or was intentionally self-inflicted. The only significant change has been the addition, in 1961, of subdivisions (f) and (g) which bar the payment of benefits where the employee has \u201cwillfully and deliberately caused his own death\u201d or where the injury arises \u201cout of an altercation in which the injured employee is the initial physical aggressor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The history detailed above convincingly demonstrates that the words \u201cirrespective.of the fault of any party\u201d were not inserted in section 21, article XX in order to forbid the Legislature from conditioning compensation on the' absence of intentional wrongdoing. Rather, they were used to enable the'Legislature to approach the problem free from the strictures of the common law. Since the passage of the Roseberry Act in 1911, employers have had to compensate their employees \u201cwithout regard to negligence.\u201d But at the same time, each successive workmen\u2019s compensation act has denied or reduced benefits where the employee engaged in wilful misconduct. Since 1913, compensation has been denied if a workman\u2019s injury resulted from his intoxication, and since 1917 if it was intentionally self-inflicted. Subdivisions (f) and (g), added in 1961, merely continue the pattern of excluding from coverage employees injured by their own intentional wrongdoing. It would be startling, indeed, if we were now to hold that each of these workmen\u2019s compensation acts was unconstitutional\" because it conditioned the right to compensation on the absence of intentional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Furthermore, our examination of the history behind section 21, article XX indicates that the section was added to the Constitution and then amended for; the sole purpose of removing all doubts as to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>stitutionality of the then existing workmen\u2019s compensation statutes. (See fn. 11, <em>ante.) </em>Thus, the section cannot be read as invalidating basic features of those laws as they have existed since 1911. (See Coats, <em>Liability for Fault </em>(1967) 42 State Bar J. 534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">In sum, the phrase \u201cirrespective of the fault of any party,\u201d which appears in section 21, article XX, must be equated with the phrase \u201cwithout regard to negligence,\u201d which appears in section 3600. The Legislature quite obviously felt that \u201cfault\u201d and \u201cnegligence\u201d were equivalent. From the Roseberry Act until the present day, each statute has imposed liability \u201cwithout regard to negligence,\u201d while for virtually all of that period the Constitution has contained the phrase \u201cirrespective of the fault of any party.\u201d Indeed, in the 1917 act both phrases were used in the same act \u2014the \u201cfault\u201d language in section 1 (see fn. 8, <em>ante) </em>which states the purposes of the act, and the \u201cnegligence\u201d language in section 6 (see fn. 9, <em>ante) </em>which lies at the core of the substantive provisions. When in the same year, 1917, the Legislature recommended the 1918 amendment to section 21, article XX, it likewise used the phrase \u201cirrespective of the fault of any party\u201d to mean that liability could be imposed without regard to negligence. \u201cIrrespective of fault,\u201d just as \u201cwithout regard to negligence,\u201d was used as a key phrase to indicate that compensation would no longer be ruled by common law tort doctrines. Both phrases became associated with workmen\u2019s compensation in much the same manner as \u201cno-fault\u201d has become attached to a broad range of recent proposed revisions of tort law relating to automobile accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Finally, to hold that section 21 of article XX prohibits the Legislature from taking into account the intentional wrongdoing of employer or employee in providing for compensation would cast doubt over a vast number of other Labor Code provisions which incorporate a notion of intentional fault. If subdivision (g) of section 3600 were to fall, so also should subdivisions (d), (e), and (f), which deny compensation where the injury is caused by intoxication, is wilfully self-inflicted, or is the product of \u201ca deliberate and wilful act of suicide.\u201d Similarly vulnerable would be section 4551, which reduces the award by one-half in most cases in which the injury results from the employee\u2019s serious and wilful misconduct, and section 4553, which increases the award by one-half where the injury is caused by the employer\u2019s serious and wilful misconduct. Doubt would also be cast upon section 4554, which augments the award by 10 percent where the employer wilfully fails to secure payment of compensation; section 4555, which permits an additional award of attorneys\u2019 fees under such circumstances; and section 4557, which increases compensation by 50 percent if the injured employee is under 16 years of age and illegally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>employed at the time of the injury. Other provisions adjusting the award according to the intentional fault of the parties are sections 4053, 4054, 4056, 5705, subdivisions (d) and (e), and 5814. (See generally, Coats, <em>supra, </em>42 State Bar J. 534.) We do not find that section 21 of article XX requires any such wholesale butchery of the existing workmen\u2019s compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Contrary to applicant\u2019s assertion, our decision in <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. (Hull), supra, </em>38 Cal.2d 659 does not compel the result for which she here contends. While certain broad language in that opinion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> might be construed as intimating that section 21, article XX forbids the legislative enactment of an aggressor defense, such language was unnecessary to- the opinion, and does not represent the considered view of this court on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In <em>Hull </em>we were concerned only with the <em>judicially created </em>aggressor defense which had evolved in the absence of a specific legislative directive. That judicial doctrine had relied upon the reasoning that by entering into an altercation, the aggressor was departing from his work duties and satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>fying a personal desire. Therefore, any injuries received during the altercation were said not to \u201carise out of and in the course of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">In <em>Hull, </em>we rejected this reasoning, recognizing \u201c \u2018that work places men under strains and fatigue from human and mechanical impacts, creating frictions which explode in myriads of ways, only some of which are immediately relevant to their tasks. Personal animosities are created by working together on the assembly or in traffic. Others initiated outside the job are magnified to the breaking point by its compelled contacts. No worker is immune to these pressures and impacts upon temperament. They accumulate and explode over incidents trivial and important, personal and official. But the explosion point is merely the culmination of the antecedent pressures.

Instead, injuries resulting from altercations clearly fell within the general provisions allowing awards for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment.

But the Constitution does not require uniform treatment, only a reasonable basis for legislative classification. <em>(Bilyeu </em>v. <em>State Employees' Retirement System </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 618, 623 [24 Cal.Rptr. 562, 375 P.2d 442].)  It is the duty of the Legislature to determine whether the facts justify such a classification and the burden of the challenger to show that the legislative conclusion is arbitrary. <em>(Professional Fire Fighters, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 276, 288-289 [32 Cal.Rptr. 830, 384 P.2d 158].)

However, the Legislature has excluded certain classes of persons from coverage under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (\u00a7 3352), and it has long been settled that such exclusions do not \u201cmake the law vulnerable as special legislation . . . provided the classification be based on some rational ground of differentiation.\u201d <em>(Western Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, supra, </em>170 Cal. 686, 702.)

In 1965, the Legislature provided in chapter 9 for the furnishing of compensation to enrollees in economic opportunity programs and their dependents for injury or death \u201csuffered within or without the state occurring in the course of his <em>duties </em>for a sponsoring agency within an economic opportunity program . . . .\u201d (\u00a74207.) In each instance the furnishing of compensation depends upon the concurrence of specified conditions which, except for an additional condition for disaster service workers (see \u00a7 4353, subd.

We think it clear that the Legislature might have recognized this difference and might have reasonably found that these two groups did not fall within the customary category of employees or at least that the conditions under which they performed their duties were so far different from those involved in the normal employer-employee relationship as to justify different conditions for furnishing compensation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>\n                   Upon an examination of the entire legislative scheme, therefore, we cannot say that these two separate classifications are arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"> We, therefore, conclude that section 3600, subdivision (g) is constitutional, and that the Board did not err in concluding that it precludes an award of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The decision of the Board following reconsideration is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Wright, C.

The Constitution confers upon the Legislature power to establish a system of workmen\u2019s compensation and create and enforce a liability on employers to compensate their workmen for injury sustained in the course of their employment <em>\u2018irrespective of the fault of any party.' </em>(Italics added.) (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 21.) The only requirements of the statute are, that to be compensable, an injury must \u2018arise out of\u2019 and \u2018occur in the course of\u2019 the employment. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600.)\u201d (38 Cal.2d 659, 660.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">\u201cThe crucial issue is whether it \u2018arose out of\u2019 the employment, and that poses the question of whether there is a causal connection between, the employment and the injury. That that is the only issue follows from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which excludes fault and contributory negligence of the employee and assumption of risk as defenses. That is the express declaration of the Constitution and statutes relating to workmen\u2019s compensation. Indeed the statute compels that result inasmuch as it declares that \u2018serious and wilful misconduct\u2019 on the part of the employee does not defeat his recovery; it merely cuts it in half, and not even that under certain conditions (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4551), thus indicating clearly that misconduct on his part is not a defense. Hence the charge of aggressor cannot be a defense, for it is nothing more than an assertion that the employee was at fault\u2014was to blame\u2014brought it on himself.\u201d (Italics omitted.) <em>(Id. </em>at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">\u201cThe contention is made that considerations of public policy require that recovery be denied in cases where the employee is injured while engaged in the violation of a penal statute, because, to allow recovery in such a case, would permit a person to benefit by his own wrong\". That appears to be the real basis of many of the decisions denying recovery. The effect of such a holding is to deny recovery because of the fault of the employee contrary to the express provisions of the Constitution and statutes relating to workmen\u2019s compensation. The question of policy is for the people and the Legislature in the first instance and here they have spoken in no uncertain language, saying that fault, serious and wilful misconduct, and contributory negligence do not bar recovery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 670.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">\u201cA11 laws of a general nature shall have a uniform application.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\"> Section 5904 provides: \u201cThe petitioner for reconsideration shall be deemed to have finally waived all objections, irregularities, and illegalities concerning the matter upon which the reconsideration is sought other than those set forth in the petition for reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\"> Section 4207 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cCompensation shall be furnished an enrollee for injury ... if the following conditions occur:</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">\u201c(a) Where at the time of injury, the enrollee is performing services and is acting within the scope of his duties as a recipient of aid within an economic opportunity program.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">\u201c(b) Where injury is proximately caused by his service as an enrollee within an economic opportunity program either with or without negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">\u201c(c) Where injury is not caused by the intoxication of the injured enrollee.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">\u201c(d) Where the injury is not intentionally self-inflicted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b810-14\"> Section 4353 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cCompensation shall be furnished to a disaster service worker for any injury suffered ... in those cases where the following conditions concur:</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">\u201c(a) Where, at the time of the injury the disaster service worker is performing services as a disaster service worker, and is acting within the course of his duties as a disaster service worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">\u201c(b) Where, at the time of the injury the disaster council with which the disaster service worker is registered is an accredited disaster council or the disaster service worker is an unregistered person impressed into service. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b810-17\">\u201c(c) Where the injury is proximately caused by his service as a disaster service worker, either with or without negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">\u201c(d) Where the injury is not caused by the intoxication of the injured worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-19\">\u201c(e) Where the injury is not intentionally self-inflicted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\"> Significantly these italicized terms are used instead of the term \u201cemployees,\u201d and the phrases \u201cin the course of his activities\u201d (\u00a7 4353, italics added) and \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>course of his <em>duties\" </em>(\u00a7 4207, italics added), instead of \u201cin the course of the <em>employment\" </em>(\u00a7 3600, italics added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b812-10\"> E.g., compare section 3600 (conditions essential to recovery, general provision) with section 4207 (conditions, economic opportunity program enrollees) and section 4353 (conditions, disaster service workers); section 4654 (temporary partial disability, general provision) with section 4364 (temporary partial disability, disaster service workers); section 4701 ($1,000 maximum burial benefit, general provision) with section 4214 ($600 maximum burial benefit, economic opportunity program enrollees) and section 4368 ($700 maximum burial benefit, disaster service workers).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b812-7\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ9\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">In 1952 Justice Carter wrote for this court: \u201c\u2018That there is a natural repugnancy to help a guilty party is no excuse for relieving industry of a liability and placing it on the worker or charity . . . . It is the character and nature of the assault which determines whether it arises out of his employment, not the culpability or the lack of culpability of the parties involved. It is the assault itself which arises out of the employment; and who initiates the altercation has no bearing on that question ....\u2019\u201d <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 659, 669 [242 P.2d 311].) (Italics omitted.) This was good law then and its logic is inescapable today in applying the facts of this case to the provisions of the state Constitution and the underlying intent of workmen\u2019s compensation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>The majority opinion cites with approval the Larson view: \u201cThe homely fact [is] that, long after a quarrel is over, it is often almost impossible to determine who really started it.\u201d (1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1968 ed.) \u00a7 11.15(c), p. 159.) Yet that is precisely what the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board attempted here: to determine who really started the altercation. The test, pursuant to the Constitution, should have been merely: \u201cDid the altercation arise out of and occur in the course of employment?\u201d That query must be answered in the affirmative, and an award of compensation necessarily follows. Indeed, the findings of fact of the referee confirmed that the deceased \u201csustained an injury arising out of and occurring in the course of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">There is no evidence that the victim, Mathews, or his assailant, Cedillo, knew each other or that their paths had ever crossed prior to the incident arising out of labor being performed at the Castaic Dam site in Los Angeles County. As part of his work in directing incoming trucks, Cedillo gave orders to Mathews and the latter apparently responded in a vehement and disagreeable manner. Whether Mathews, who struck no blow, nevertheless can be deemed the initial physical aggressor, is of no consequence, since the indisputable fact remains that the two participants in the altercation were present on the construction premises, became involved in a heated controversy and proceeded to act, all in connection with their employment. In that respect this case is factually stronger than compensable tragedies occurring as a result of grievances having their origin independent of the job. (E.g., <em>California Comp. &amp; Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. (Schick) </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 157 [65 Cal.Rptr. 155, 436 P.2d 67].)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The Court of Appeal saw the issue properly in <em>Litzmann </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 203 [71 Cal.Rptr. 731]. There the referee found that the employee\u2019s injury occurred in the course of his employment \u201cbut that the injury arose out of an altercation in which applicant was the initial physical aggressor and, therefore, he was not entitled to an award.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 204.) The court found that the evidence did not sustain the finding that the applicant was the aggressor \u201cand that, <em>even if it did, </em>compensation could not be denied on that ground.\u201d (Italics added; <em>id. </em>at p. 210.) The court adhered to the basic test of whether the injuries arose out of and in the course of the applicant\u2019s employment. This was the correct approach, for once a court concedes that an assault, malicious or otherwise, arises out of the employment for the nonaggressor, the same assault necessarily arises out of the employment for the aggressor. It is the assault which is related to the employment, and who initiates it has no bearing on the issue, unless we are to revert to common law culpability considerations. (See Horovitz, <em>Assaults and Horseplay Under Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws </em>(1946) 41 Ill. L. Rev. 311, 346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Recognition of an aggressor defense is anachronistic and contrary to the unmistakable trend in the law. Larson points out: \u201cThe abolition of the aggressor defense is one of the most rapid doctrinal reversals in the volatile history of compensation law. Before 1947 the aggressor defense had the entire field to itself. Then New Hampshire, in 1947, and Massachusetts, in 1949, handed down the cogently reasoned opinions in <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Moreau </em>[94 N.H. 439 (55 A.2d 476)] and <em>Dillon\u2019s Case </em>[324 Mass. 102 (85 N.E. 2d 69)], flatly rejecting the entire concept of aggression as a defense. Although a few cases asserting the defense have subsequently appeared, the most impressive feature of the new trend is the number of major compensation jurisdictions that have deliberately abolished the defense in spite of earlier decisions supporting it. These jurisdictions include California, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York.\u201d (Fns. omitted; 1 Larson, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>p. 154.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The question then arises as to how Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (g), is to be interpreted. If it involves a weighing of the facts in order to ascertain whether the injured employee Was at fault, then the code section clearly runs afoul of section 21 of article XX of the California Constitution. When the people adopted that constitutional amendment authorizing the Legislature to create \u201ca complete system of workmen\u2019s compensation\u201d they provided as the cornerstone of the complete system the principle that compensation be provided for workmen, and their dependents for death of the workman in the course of his employment, <em>irrespective of the fault of any party. </em>Hence, as Justice Carter wrote, \u201cthe charge of aggressor cannot be a defense, for it is nothing more than an assertion that the employee was at fault\u2014was to blame\u2014brought it on himself.\u201d <em>(State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The history recited by the majority in support of their strained conclusion is helpful only if one ascribes to the Legislature some consistently strange design, circumlocution, or repeated inadvertence in drafting. As the majority point out, the earlier Roseberry Act referred to liability for compensation \u201cwithout regard to negligence.\u201d Thus the Legislature was familiar with and knew how to utilize that expression when it accurately reflected the legislative intent. Having previously adopted legislation speak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ing in terms of negligence, however, in presenting section 21 of article XX to the voters for approval the Legislature rephrased the provisions to call for a system of compensation \u201cirrespective of the fault of either party.\u201d Then the Boynton Act, adopted after the effective date of the constitutional amendment, reverted back to the Roseberry Act expression of providing compensation \u201cwithout regard to negligence.\u201d And finally, to complete this perplexing historical saga, those who proposed a further constitutional amendment in 1918 employed the phrase \u201cirrespective of fault\u201d once again. However academically intriguing this semantic mystery may be, the issue is not what the Legislature had in mind, but what the Constitution provides. The rule is clear that constitutional language must be read according to its expressed rather than possible intended meaning. <em>(Los Angeles Met. Transit Authority </em>v. <em>Public Util. Com. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 863, 869 [31 Cal.Rptr. 463, 382 P.2d 583].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">In this' case the position of the Board and the majority can be sustained only if the terms \u201cirrespective of the fault of any party\u201d and \u201cwithout regard to negligence\u201d are entirely synonymous. While concededly some judicial definitions of \u201cfault\u201d restrict its meaning to \u201cnegligence,\u201d lexicographers deem \u201cfault\u201d to be a broad generic term which includes the lesser word negligence but also many others, such as wilful misconduct, gross negligence, misbehavior, transgression, dereliction, offense, culpability, wrongdoing, deviation from rectitude, and in general \u201ca failure to do what is right.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1961), p. 829.) <em>Compania Trasatlantica Espanola, S.A. </em>v. <em>Melendez Torres </em>(1st Cir. 1966) 358 F.2d 209, 213, discusses a statute which refers to \u201cfault or negligence\u201d and holds the terms do not mean the same; fault was found there to include a breach of obligation or warranty. (Also see <em>Lashley </em>v. <em>Koerber </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 83, 91 [156 P.2d 441]; <em>United Canneries </em>v. <em>Seelye </em>(1920) 48 Cal.App. 747, 751 [192 P. 341].) A number of code sections refer to \u201cfault\u201d and clearly are not limited to negligence. (E.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 1689, subd. (b) (2); Com. Code, \u00a7 2613, and comment thereto.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The majority resort to the <em>argumentum ad horrendum </em>if we were \u201cto hold that section 21 of article XX prohibits the Legislature from taking into account the intentional wrongdoing of employer or employee in providing for compensation.\u201d They assert that doubt would be cast over the validity of subdivisions (d), (e), and (f) of Labor Code section 3600, as well as section 4551, which reduces the award by one-half if the injury results from the employee\u2019s serious and wilful misconduct, and section 4553, which increases the award by one-half if the injury is caused by the employer\u2019s serious and wilful misconduct, and also other sections providing for various increases and decreases in awards. I suggest that these fears are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>groundless and that the point is irrelevant. Recovery in the. event of intoxication, self-inflicted injury or suicide (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600, subds. (d), (e), and (f)) can be prevented if the act was not work-related, or if the employment relationship is established, then limited by invoking the wilful misconduct statute. As to sections 4551 and 4553, I point out that nowhere in the constitutional authorization for legislative establishment of a workmen\u2019s compensation system is there reference to any specific <em>amount </em>of compensation to be awarded. Indeed, as we noted in our recent case of <em>State Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 885 [97 Cal.Rptr. 786, 489 P.2d 818], the injured employee is seldom, if ever, made whole by virtue of a compensation award. The amount to be given to the petitioner, and the percentage thereof to be provided by the employer, may be prescribed by the Legislature, The only constitutional mandate is that a system of compensation be provided and that an award cannot be withheld on the basis of fault. How much should be awarded in terms of dollars or percentages under specified circumstances is within the legislative prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Here there has been no exercise of the legislative prerogative to direct that the sum awarded an \u201cinitial aggressor\u201d shall be ratably increased or reduced; there is a total prohibition against an award being made when the defense of \u201cinitial aggressor\u201d is sustained. Yet an award in an appropriate amount, I submit, cannot be denied without violating section 21 of the article XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In supporting the Board amicus curiae cavalierly denigrate the expression \u201cirrespective of fault\u201d as a species of \u201ccatch-phrase\u201d that has served variously as \u201ca battle cry, a campaign slogan, a figure of speech, a shibboleth.\u201d In short, the position of the Board, the amicus curiae, and now the majority of this court, is that the constitutional provision is as meaningless as yesterday\u2019s political oratory; that the Legislature cannot be inhibited in passing statutes which deny compensation when the injured workman is found to be at fault. I cannot be that casual in application of our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Justice Rutledge, while on the circuit court, wrote a landmark opinion which expresses the philosophy behind elimination of the physical aggressor defense. In <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Cardillo </em>(1940) 112 F.2d 11, 17, footnote 17 [72 App.D.C. 52], he said; \u201cNatural repulsion toward rewarding intentional misconduct accounts largely for the [problem], though it ignores the fact that one purpose of the statute is sustenance of the misbehaving employee\u2019s family during his disability and their dependence is not the less because the misconduct is his rather than another\u2019s.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>quotation is particularly apt in the instant case in which the workman is deceased and his dependent widow is the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Then, writing of the concept which concerns itself not with whether the claimant was the aggressor, but with whether the dispute arose immediately over the work, Justice Rutledge said (at p. 17): \u201cThis view recognizes that work places men under strains and fatigue from human and mechanical impacts, creating frictions which explode in myriads of ways, only some of which are immediately relevant to their tasks. Personal animosities are created by working together on the assembly line or in traffic. Others initiated outside the job are magnified to the breaking point by its compelled contacts. No worker is immune to these pressures and impacts upon temperament. They accumulate and explode over incidents trivial and important, personal and official. But the explosion point is merely the culmination of the antecedent pressures. That it is not relevant to the immediate task, involves a lapse from duty, or contains an element of volition or illegality does not disconnect it from them nor nullify their causal effect in producing its injurious consequences. Any other view would reintroduce the conceptions of contributory fault, action in the line of duty, nonaccidental character of voluntary conduct, and independent, intervening cause as applied in tort law, which it was the purpose of the statute to discard.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) Of the same philosophical bent, though not expressed in a workmen\u2019s compensation case, was Justice Traynor\u2019s opinion for this court in <em>Carr v. Wm. C. Crowell Co. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 652, 656 [171 P.2d 5].</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">I am convinced that <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>is still sound law and that its concept of the constitutional provision \u201cirrespective of fault\u201d is binding upon us under the doctrine of stare decisis. That the Legislature may have reached a conflicting interpretation of the constitutional provision, as evidenced by its adoption of Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (g), is unfortunate but not controlling. \u201cWe cannot push back the limits of the Constitution merely to accommodate challenged legislation.\u201d (Warren, C. J., in <em>Trop </em>v. <em>Dulles </em>(1958) 356 U.S. 86, 104 [2 L.Ed.2d 630, 644, 78 S.Ct. 590].)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">I would annul the decision of the Board and remand the matter for appropriate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Peters, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied March 30, 1972.
