J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMh\">C. J. On February 3, 1971, petitioners Thomas and Rebecca Halpin, husband and wife, and Martin Silva were charged by indictment with conspiracy to transport marijuana (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. 1; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11531), transportation of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11531) and possession of marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11530.5). The trial court denied their motions to set aside the indictment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995) and to suppress evidence (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5) which consisted of over 500 pounds of marijuana seized pursuant to an allegedly invalid search warrant and an incriminating tape recording made by police officers who eavesdropped on a conversation initiated by Halpin to his wife from a telephone located within' the jail facility. Petitioners now seek a statutory writ of mandate (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (i)) to compel the trial court to suppress the aforementioned evidence. For reasons hereinafter set forth, we hold that the marijuana and the tape recording must be suppressed as evidence and that a peremptory writ of mandate must issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">At the outset we deem it appropriate to state that we are compelled to declare invalid the warrant which was issued in connection with the search of the vehicle and the subsequent seizure of the marijuana since the magistrate failed to follow the basic requirements for the issuance of such a warrant enunciated in 1964 by the Supreme Court in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 [12 L.Ed.2d 723, 84 S.Ct. 1509], The two-pronged test spelled out in that decision is not difficult to comprehend or follow.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Magistrates and law enforcement agencies, however, continue to manifest confusion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Some, while expressing a threshold knowledge of the requirements of <em>Aguilar, </em>treat them with unwarranted perfunctoriness. An example of such is illustrated by the colloquy between the magistrate who issued the search warrant and the deputy district attorney in the instant case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Courts do not require that an affidavit in support of a search warrant be drafted with the precision of a model legal instrument nor interpreted in a hypertechnical manner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, once it is determined that a search without a warrant cannot be conducted under any of the well-recognized exceptions, <em>Aguilar </em>must be followed. \u201c[T]he court must still insist that the magistrate perform his \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police.\u201d <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>378 U.S. 108, 111 [12 L.Ed.2d 723, 727].)</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">On December 14, 1970, between 2:30 and 3 p.m., police officers, including Detective Cole of the Ontario Police Department, stopped a white and green 1971 Ford Sport Custom camper truck in the City of Ontario. Previously Cole had received information that a camper of the same description contained marijuana reputedly worth $100,000. After the truck pulled over to the curb the driver \u201cjumped out of the truck, and as he did so he locked [it].\u201d He was immediately placed under arrest and a search of his person produced a driver\u2019s license bearing the name of \u201cThomas Allon Halpin.\u201d Halpin declined to permit a search of the camper.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Cole then left the truck and Halpin in the custody of the other officers and proceeded to the chambers of the local magistrate to testify in support of an oral application for a search warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cole testified before the magistrate 'that \u201cCaptain Mooney [of the Pomona Police Department] called me [at 8:05 a.m. this morning], informing me that at a Havasu Trailer Company at 1515 West Holt I would find a 1971 Ford Sport Custom truck, white color with a dark green roof, and on this truck would be a ten and a half foot Havasu camper, cream color, with a darker wood\u2014simulated wood\u2014panel. He informed me that the truck would have a temporary license in the rear window, giving me a number of 1291208. He stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>this camper body would have a false type body and contained approximately $100,000 worth of marijuana. He stated that a white male known to him only as Tom [who apparently would be driving the camper] would be arriving in San Bernardino on a flight from San Diego-. He described this male as being approximately six foot and weighing 160 to 170 pounds. He stated he had sandy hair, a mustache and wore horn-rimmed glasses. . . . At this time he did state that this truck would be parked next to a blue Chevrolet. ... I asked him about [the informant\u2019s] reliability, and he stated that on November 30 he had received similar information from this informant which he gave to the San Francisco Police Department, which resulted in an arrest. At this time a Havasu camper was loaded similar to the one he described here and contained [a very large haul] of marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">Cole further testified before the magistrate that after receiving this information he drove to the Havasu Trailer Company and, about 8:40 a.m., observed in the company\u2019s lot the truck which Captain Mooney had described to him. Cole called the sheriff\u2019s narcotic division for assistance and the officers began a surveillance of the truck about 9:30 a.m. At 11:30 a Volkswagen automobile drove into the parking lot. The frame around the license plate bore the name of a San Diego car dealer and the man (petitioner Halpin) in the car fit the description earlier given to Cole. Halpin left the automobile and went into the trailer company office. He remained there a short while then returned to the Volkswagen and drove away. Officers followed Halpin for a while but determined that if they continued they might breach the integrity of their surveillance and they thereupon returned to their positions near the Havasu Trailer Company. About 2:30 p.m. the Volkswagen returned to the camper lot. Halpin went into the company office, remained there a short while, and thereafter entered the camper and drove off. Cole and other officers followed for a short distance before Cole pulled up alongside, showed Halpin his badge and motioned to him to pull over to the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The search warrant was issued solely on- the foregoing testimony. The subsequent search of the camper produced over 500 pounds of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Halpin was removed to the San Bernardino County jail and, after being booked, was granted permission to make a telephone call using the telephone within the custodial facilities. Halpin informed Deputy Sheriff Warren Hockanson of the number\u2014but not of the name\u2014of the party he wished to call, and Hockanson dialed it for him. (It was later determined that Halpin was calling his wife in San Diego.) Hockanson apparently left the room shortly after -the conversation began and before incriminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>statements were made by Halpin and his wife.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Unknown to either of them, their conversation\u2014in which they incriminated themselves and petitioner Silva\u2014was monitored and tape recorded and later replayed before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">I. The Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Petitioners initially contend that the testimony offered by Cole in support of the search warrant was constitutionally inadequate since it failed to reflect the underlying circumstances from which the issuing judge could conclude that the informant had personal knowledge of the information which he supplied to the police and that the informant was credible or his information reliable. Petitioners thus argue that the testimony failed to satisfy the test which the Supreme Court announced in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>378 U.S. 108, 114 [12 L.Ed.2d 723, 728-729], for the determination of the sufficiency of affidavits based upon the hearsay statements of an informant. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">The first prong of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>two-pronged test requires that the magistrate be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the items to be seized were where he claimed they were. In accordance with <em>Aguilar, </em>this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 176, 179-180 [77 Cal.Rptr. 785, 454 P.2d 681] required that \u201cthe affidavit . . . allege the informant\u2019s statement in language that is factual rather than conclusionary and must establish that the informant spoke with personal knowledge of the matters contained in such statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">In <em>Hamilton </em>the affidavit offered in support of the search warrant contained in relevant part the following allegations : \u201c \u2018That said affiant was informed on July 13, 1967, by confidential reliable informant that Jane Doe Nora also known as Nora Mae Hamilton and John Doe Tony have in their possession at a white single story, one family dwelling located at 822 W. Alpine Street, Upland, Calif, approximately three hundred (300) rolls of dangerous drugs wrapped in tin foil in groups of ten pills per roll. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>[\u00b6] That further your affiant reviewed San Bernardino County Sheriff Office report No. D.R. 112302 which indicated Nora Mae Hamilton, and Raymond David Padilla were arrested at 822 W. Alpine Street, Upland, California, on April 14, 1967 for Possession of Marijuana and Possession of dangerous drugs found there. The pills found in the April 14, 1967 arrest were amphetamine, wrapped in tin foil in groups of 10. [H] That said confidential reliable informant has furnished information in the past which has lead [szc] to eight (8) arrest[s] and convictions for narcotic and dangerous drug offense[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 179.) We held that the affidavit failed to set forth allegations sufficient to enable the issuing magistrate to determine whether the informant had <em>personal knowledge </em>of the circumstances which he described. Moreover, we concluded that the information so provided was not sufficiently detailed to permit even the inference that the informant had personal knowledge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">The testimony offered in support of the search warrant in the instant case contains information of a general nature similar to that in the affidavit in <em>Hamilton. </em>The tip in this case merely indicated that Cole would find a certain, well-described truck containing marijuana at a particular location and that a person described with particularity would take possession of it. The magistrate was not provided with a sufficient statement of the underlying circumstances from which he could evaluate the validity of the informer\u2019s conclusion that \u201cTom\u201d was handling, transporting or selling marijuana. For example, it is not alleged that the informant personally observed Halpin or others handling or transporting the marijuana, or that the informant had had dealings with \u201cTom\u201d or any other person in connection with the camper, and it cannot be inferred that the informant gained his knowledge in any reliable way. <em>(Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 393 U.S. at p. 417 [21 L.Ed.2d at p. 644].) It is thus apparent that Mooney\u2019s informant could as likely have obtained the information from an \u201coffhand remark heard at a neighborhood bar,\u201d as from personal observations or some other reliable source.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>\u201cIn the absence of a statement detailing the manner in which the information was gathered, it is especially important that the tip describe the accused\u2019s criminal activity in sufficient detail that the magistrate may know that he is relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation.\u201d <em>(Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>393 U.S. 410, 416 [21 L.Ed.2d 637, 644].) Although the camper and Halpin were described in detail, the circumstances related by Cole did not describe any activity by Halpin or others which might be deemed as. sufficiently criminal to warrant a belief on the part of the magistrate that Mooney\u2019s informant relied \u201con something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Benjamin </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 296, 302-303 [78 Cal.Rptr. 510, 455 P.2d 438], the People alternatively argue that even if the hearsay statements of Mooney\u2019s informant were not sufficient in themselves to justify the issuance of the warrant, when combined with the officers\u2019 observations the issuing magistrate could reasonably be led to believe that Halpin was transporting and selling marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">The affidavit in support of the warrant in <em>Benjamin </em>was \u201cquite extensive and reflected an investigation of defendant\u2019s activities which had taken place over a period of more than two months.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benjamin, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 299.) The information there provided by the informant, which appeared in the affidavit, was to the effect that the officer-affiant had received information from a confidential reliable informant that defendant was accepting wagers from bettors at a specifically described location and, three months later, at a specified telephone number. The content of the remaining allegations concerned the officer\u2019s already existing knowledge as to the same type of illegal activity and their subsequent investigation and observations over a two-month period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although we there concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>\u201cwithout hesitation that the hearsay statements of the informant were not sufficient <em>in themselves </em>to justify issuance of the warrant,\u201d we held that \u201cthe combination of that information with the officers\u2019 own observations produced a state of facts sufficient to lead the magistrate, as one of ordinary caution or prudence, to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion that defendant was engaged in [illegal activities].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benjamin, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 296, 301, 303 (italics in original); see also <em>Spinelli v. United States, supra, </em>393 U.S. 410, 415 [21 L.Ed.2d 637, 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">In the instant case, Cole\u2019s observations were not of the same character as those of the officers in <em>Benjamin. </em>Those officers already had knowledge of some of the illegal bookmaking activity described by their informant, and their investigation and observations thereafter continued over a period of more than two months. During that period of time they kept the suspected location under surveillance, saw the defendant meet with known bettors and conduct transactions from which the experienced officers could conclude that bookmaking activities were being carried on. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benjamin, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at pp. 299-300.) Here, Cole observed only the seemingly innocent activity of Halpin as he entered and left the Havasu Trailer Company office and subsequently drove the camper away. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Madden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1017, 1023-1024 [88 Cal.Rptr. 171, 471 P.2d 971]; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 836, 842 [83 Cal.Rptr. 369, 463 P.2d 721].) Unquestionably, the inferences to be drawn from the account of the observations presented to the issuing magistrate in <em>Benjamin </em>were significantly conclusive of illegal activity. The account of the observations presented to the issuing magistrate in the instant case instead of corroborating claims of illegal activity suggested no criminal activity whatsoever and were entirely consistent with innocent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">It should also be noted that although Cole testified that on November 30 Mooney had received similar information from the same informant which resulted in an arrest, such information is relevant only for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number><em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>second prong. (See fns. 1, 7, <em>supra.) </em>Since we conclude that the affidavit consisting of the transcription of Cole\u2019s testimony before the magistrate fails to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test, we need not reach the issue whether the informant, by virtue of the information he previously supplied to Mooney, could be deemed reliable within the meaning of the second prong of that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\">II. The Electronic Surveillance</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Petitioners contend that the electronically monitored and tape-recorded conversation between Halpin and his wife is inadmissible because it violated their rights under title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520), the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the California Invasion of Privacy Act (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 630-637.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Petitioners argue that Congress, in enacting title III, intended to preempt state legislation in the field of wiretapping and electronic surveillance and that since prior judicial approval was thus required but was not obtained for the tap, the telephone conversation between Halpin and his wife is inadmissible.  The People maintain that title III is unconstitutional as applied because it constitutes an unreasonable infringement upon California\u2019s right, reserved to it by the Tenth Amendment, to regulate and administer the internal affairs of its penal institutions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Section 2511 of title 18 of the United States Code makes it a crime, subject to the exceptions contained in subdivisions (2)(a) through (3) of that section, to wilfully intercept or disclose any wire or oral communication.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>\u201cWire communication\u201d is defined by section 2510(1) as \u201cany communication made . . . through the use of facilities for -the transmission of communications by the aid of wire ... or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception furnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign communications.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[O]ral communication\u201d is defined by section 2510(2) as \u201cany oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation.\u201d Section 2515 makes inadmissible any evidence, and the fruits thereof,, obtained in violation of sections 2510-2520.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The other sections are not here relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-3\">Sections 2510-2520 were drafted to meet the standards of <em>Berger </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>v. <em>New York </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 41 [18 L.Ed.2d 1040, 87 S.Ct. 1873] and <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S.Ct. 507].<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Sen Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 66.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The legislation \u201chas as its dual purpose (1) protecting the privacy of wire and oral communications, and (2) delineating on a uniform basis the circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized.\u201d (Sen. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 66.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\n                   An intent to have certain provisions of the law completely occupy the field of wiretapping and electronic surveillance is evidenced by their plain and all-inclusive wording. <em>(See Allen B. Dumont Laboratories </em>v. <em>Carroll </em>(3d Cir. 1950) 184 F.2d 153, 155.) Section 2511(1)(a) provides penal sanctions for \u201cany person who willfully intercepts . . . <em>any </em>wire or oral communication,\u201d and section 2510(1) defines \u201cwire communication\u201d as <em>\u201cany </em>communication made . . . through the use of facilities . . . furnished or operated by ... a common carrier . . . for the transmission of interstate or foreign communications.\u201d (Italics added.) That Congress intended to enact comprehensive national legislation, against which all then existing federal and state legislation was to be measured, is also illustrated by the comments of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At the same time, however, Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>gress left room, for the states to supplement the law in certain areas,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> provided the regulations are not more permissive. (See, e.g., Sen. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 98-99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Congress\u2019 authority in enacting legislation to accomplish its asserted purpose is said to emanate from its plenary power under the commerce clause (see, e.g., <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Benjamin </em>(1946) 328 U.S. 408, 423 [90 L.Ed. 1342, 1356-1357, 66 S.Ct. 1142, 164 A.L.R. 476]; see also <em>Atlanta Motel </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 379 U.S. 241 [13 L.Ed.2d 258, 85 S.Ct. 348]; <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1939) 308 U.S. 321 [84 L.Ed. 298, 60 S.Ct. 269]; cf. <em>American Power Co. </em>v. <em>S.E.C. </em>(1946) 329 U.S. 90 [91 L.Ed. 103, 67 S.Ct. 133]) to regulate telegraph and telephone lines as instrumentalities of interstate commerce <em>(Western Union </em>v. <em>Lenroot </em>(1945) 323 U.S. 490, 502 [89 L.Ed. 414, 423, 65 S.Ct. 335])<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the right of privacy \u201carising under certain provisions of the Bill of Rights and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Since title III is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 power under particular provisions of the Constitution, we reject the People\u2019s contention that it is unconstitutional as applied because it infringes upon the police power of the state, reserved to it by the Tenth Amendment, to regulate the internal discipline of its penal institutions. \u201c[T]he [Tenth] amendment has been construed as not depriving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Darby </em>(1941) 312 U.S, 100, 124 [85 L.Ed. 609, 622, 61 S.Ct. 451, 132 A.L.R. 1430].) \u201cIt is no objection to the assertion of the power to regulate interstate commerce that its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 114 [85 L.Ed. at p. 617]; cf. <em>Benanti </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 355 U.S. 96, 104 [2 L.Ed.2d 126, 132, 78 S.Ct. 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Unquestionably the conversation between Halpin and his wife was a wire communication within the meaning of section 2510(1) since it was carried over wires between Ontario and San Diego and operated by a common carrier engaged in interstate communications. Moreover, the conversation was intercepted within the meaning of section 2510 (4)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the interception was not authorized in accordance with section 2516. The contents of the conversation are therefore inadmissible. (\u00a7 2515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Since we hold that title III has preempted particular fields of wiretapping and electronic surveillance, we need not reach the issue whether the Halpins\u2019 right of privacy was invaded by monitoring and tape recording the phone call.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the respondent superior court to suppress the evidence obtained in the execution of the search warrant and from the interception of petitioner\u2019s call to his wife from the telephone at the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">McComb, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., Burke, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-11\"><em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 108 [12 L.Ed.2d 723, 84 S.Ct. 1509], the Supreme Court stated that \u201can affidavit [in support of a search warrant] may be based on hearsay information and need not reflect the direct personal observations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>of the affiant . . .

(b)) the deputy district attorney and the magistrate engaged in the following conversation:</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">\u201cThe Court: I am satisfied with the search warrant if you are satisfied that you have completely complied in the following respects, sir: We have in the law several cases where the officer received information by radio by the dispatcher or another officer, which imparts information that then gives probable cause. Are you prepared to call the officer who transmitted the information to him to supplement your probable cause? In other words, how did that man who sent the information over the radio get his information, and is that reliable? If you are satisfied on that aspect I will go along with this.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">\u201cMr. [Deputy \u00a1District Attorney]: I believe, your Honor, the state of the record before the Court is that information from a reliable source, the Captain of the Pomona Police Department, was furnished to the Ontario Police Department, that this particular office in Pomona had prior experience with this particular defendant\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">\u201cThe Court: That could be hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">\u201cMr. [Deputy District Attorney]:\u2014and that the information furnished by the Pomona Police Captain in every particularity, and the information furnished by the informant to the police captain, and then to the Ontario Police Department, was found to be true. And under these circumstances I believe there was a basis for showing through the conduct and information furnished by the reliable informant there is a basis for the search of the truck presently in custody and under the control of the officials\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">\u201cThe Court: This will almost beyond a doubt be contested. Now, let me ask you this, sir, are you allowed in anyway [sic] to supplement the showing up at this point on 1538.5 motion or a motion to suppress or any of the numerous ways it could be attacked by bringing in Captain Mooney to testify directly?</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">\u201cMr. [Deputy District Attorney]: I suppose this should be off the record. I don\u2019t think there would be anything further to add to the record unless the Court has anything particular in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">\u201cThe Court: No, I have nothing in mind, except I just wondered if you could present additional testimony if you deemed it advisable at the time of a hearing on a 1538.5 and supplementing what you have on the record so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">\u201cMr. [Deputy IDistrict Attorney]: As a general state of law, I believe there are two ways such additional information could be presented, and if the Court feels there is need for it I will bring those people here now.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">\u201cThe Court: I would rather not cause any delay here unless it is absolutely essential because that truck is under surveillance. Anything can happen out there, and the quicker you get there with a search warrant I think the quicker the interests of justice can be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">\u201cMr. [Deputy District Attorney]: I assume from that the Court is satisfied with the People\u2019s showing of\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">\u201cThe Court: I am satisfied. I can see trouble coming up on that point at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>hands of a skillful defense attorney who is now going to strike at the very vitality of the information over the radio and how Captain Mooney had his probable cause and how he acquired his information. That is why I raised the query, if this could be supplemented with further testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">\u201cMr. [Deputy District Attorney]: Of course the Court is raising an issue that I have to deal with on the record, that is, are you personally satisfied with the probable cause shown here today?</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, but with some reluctance because I can see some loose parts of the dike, and somebody is going to- have to act like the Dutch boy with his finger in the hole at some future time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b962-9\">We include oral testimony in support of search warrants.

A [Hockanson]: Yes, sir, I was. Q: Did you participate in the placing of that call? A: Yes, sir, I placed the call.\u201d Hockanson was not asked whether he was present during a part of or the entire conversation. However, in view of the incriminating statements Halpin made, and an admonition by his wife to \u201cRemember your rights and don\u2019t say anything,\u201d it is unlikely that Hockanson was present. The factual issue might be important on a claim that Halpin had consented to the monitoring.

Paragraph (1) sets out several prohibitions. Subparagraph (a) prohibits the interception itself. This eliminates the requirement under existing law that an \u2018interception\u2019 and a \u2018divulgence\u2019 must take place. See <em>Massicot </em>v. <em>United States </em>[(5th Cir. 1958) 254 F.2d 58, certiorari denied (1958) 358 U.S. 816 (3 L.Ed.2d 58, 79 S.Ct. 23)]; <em>Benanti v.

Since the facilities used to transmit wire communications form part of the interstate or foreign communications network, Congress has plenary power under the commerce clause to prohibit all interception of such communications, whether by wiretapping or otherwise. <em>(Weiss </em>v. <em>United States </em>[(1939) 308 U.S. 321 (84 L.Ed. 298, 60 S.Ct. 269)].)\u201d (Sen.

[11] Section 801.\u2014Section 801 [Pub. L. 90-351] contains the findings relating to the conditions with which the proposed legislation is designed to deal, and of the actions necessary to cope with those conditions. . . . Paragraph (b) recognizes that to protect the privacy of wire and oral communications, to protect the integrity of court and administrative proceeding^] and to prevent the obstruction of interstate commerce, it is necessary for Congress to define on a uniform basis the circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire or oral communications may be authorized. It also finds that all unauthorized interception of such communications should be prohibited, as well as the use of the contents of unauthorized interceptions as evidence in courts and administrative hearings.\u201d (Sen. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 88-89.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b970-8\">The following comments in the Senate Report indicate that intent: \u201cBoth proponents and opponents of wiretapping and electronic surveillance agree that the present state of the law in this area is extremely unsatisfactory and that the Congress should act to clarify the resulting confusion.\u201d (Sen. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 67.) \u201cOn the State level, there is little uniformity. . . . Only a few States have enacted statutes dealing with other forms of electronic surveillance. . . . Even those existing statutes, however, must now be reformed in light of the standards for constitutional electronic surveillance laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York </em>[(1967) 388 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>U.S. 41 (18 L.Ed.2d 1040, 87 S.Ct. 1873)] and <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>[(1967) 389 U.S. 347 (19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S.Ct. 507)].\u201d (It should be noted at this point that the California Invasion of Privacy Act became effective on November 7, 1967; <em>Berger </em>was decided on June 6, 1967 and <em>Katz </em>was decided on December 18, 1967.) \u201c[11] . . . The need for comprehensive, fair and effective reform setting uniform standards is obvious. New protections for privacy must be enacted. Guidance and supervision must be given to State and Federal law enforcement officers. This can only be accomplished through national legislation.\u201d (Sen. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 69.)

With relatively simple effort and a minimum of cerebration, issuing judges can prevent the embarrassment that is theirs, and the potential injustice to society, when a faulty warrant prevents evidence from being introduced at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">On the other hand, there are also two-pronged mitigating considerations for reviewing courts. First, the exigent circumstances under which search warrants are originally sought often preclude careful preparation and thoughtful consideration by the magistrate; the motor vehicle in transit here is a typical example of the necessity for haste. Second, the lay character of those who generally prepare affidavits for warrants suggests the documents will seldom be drafted with consummate legal skill.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The manner in which warrants should be interpreted has divided courts from <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1959) 358 U.S. 307 [3 L.Ed.2d 327, 79 S.Ct. 329], through <em>Aguilar </em>and its progeny, down to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 573 [29 L.Ed.2d 723, 91 S.Ct. 2075]. Often as a last refuge, reliance upon an illusory test of \u201ccommon sense\u201d has been employed in a wide variety of search and seizure contexts. For example, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 102, 109 [13 L.Ed.2d 684, 689, 85 S.Ct. 741], Justice Goldberg wrote that the affidavit should be \u201cread in a commonsense way.\u201d In the same opinion he insisted that \u201caffidavits for search warrants, such as the one involved here, must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion.\u201d Justice Black, dissenting in <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347, 366 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 591, 88 S.Ct. 507], stated that \u201ccommon sense requires ... a liberal construction.\u201d Conflicting views in <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 393 U.S. 410 [21 L.Ed.2d 637, 89 S.Ct. 584], invoked the same doctrine: Justice Harlan, for the majority, wrote, \u201c[Ijssuing magistrates are not to be confined ... by restrictions on the use of their common sense\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 419 [21 L.Ed.2d at p. 645]); Justice Fortas, disagreeing in the same case, maintained that \u201ca policeman\u2019s affidavit is entitled to common-sense evaluation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 439 [21 L.Ed.2d at p. 657].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Justice Black, dissenting in <em>Vale v. Louisiana </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 30, 36 [26 L.Ed.2d 409, 415, 90 S.Ct. 1969], repeated his earlier opinion for the majority in <em>Preston </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 364 [11 L.Ed.2d 777, 84 S.Ct. 881], that \u201ccommon sense dictates that reasonableness varies with the circumstances of the search.\u201d In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>at page 583 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 734], Chief Justice Burger wrote that \u201cCommon sense . . . would induce a prudent and disinterested observer to credit these statements.\u201d And even a majority of this court spoke of \u201ca commonsense interpretation\u201d in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Johnson) (1972) <em>ante, </em>pp. 704, 711 [100 Cal.Rptr. 319, 493 P.2d 1183].</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Whatever may be the appropriate test, I have urged numerous times that this court must give law enforcement officers every encouragement to seek warrants, rather than to compel them to depend upon their hasty and competitive judgment in the field. (See my dissents in <em>People </em>v. <em>Scoma </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 332, 340 [78 Cal.Rptr. 491, 455 P.2d 419]; <em>P\u00e9ople </em>V. <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>at p. 183; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sesslin </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 418, 431 [67 Cal.Rptr. 409, 439 P.2d 321].) An excessively restrictive interpretation of affidavits, or as the high court in <em>Ventre sea, supra, </em>put it, a \u201cgrudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward warrants\u201d will in the long run \u201ctend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before aoting.\u201d (380 U.S. at p. 108 [13 L.Ed.2d at p. 689].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">It is of vital importance to society, to suspects, and for the protection of law enforcement officers themselves, that probable cause be determined by a \u201cneutral and detached magistrate.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 10, 14 [92 L.Ed. 436, 440, 68 S.Ct. 367].) To this end. \u201cit obviously is not desirable to place unnecessary burdens\u201d upon the use of warrants. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Keener </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 714, 723 [12 Cal.Rptr. 859, 361 P.2d 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Were it not for <em>Hamilton </em>and if we were writing on a clean slate, I would be inclined to treat the instant warrant\u2014though certainly it is no model\u2014 somewhat more tolerantly, and to find it does not offend the Fourth Amendment, or article I, section 19, of the Constitution of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">The petition of the real party in interest for a rehearing was denied May 23, 1972.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Here more expertise could have been expected, since a deputy district attorney personally appeared before the magistrate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
