Defendant (respondent herein) declined to provide funds for such care on the ground that the expenditure was not authorized by Medi-Cal regulations. Petitioner brought mandate in the superior court; that court held that the pertinent Medi-Cal regulations were unconstitutional as applied to petitioner, and directed respondent to vacate his decision denying him aid. Respondent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">On examining the present Medi-Cal regulations, we conclude that petitioner is entitled to individualized nursing care either in a nursing home, if financially feasible, or in a hospital. Since petitioner can receive the care he requires under the present regulations, we need not, and do not, decide the constitutional issue he raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We therefore agree with the trial court that the ruling of respondent should be vacated and the matter remanded. We do not affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, however, since that judgment (a) unnecessarily finds that the Medi-Cal regulations are unconstitutional as applied to petitioner, and (b) impliedly orders respondent to provide the needed services in a manner inconsistent with present Medi-Cal regulations. We therefore reverse the judgment of the superior court, and remand the cause to that court to amend its findings and judgment to conform to our views.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Petitioner suffers from a rare or unique disease characterized as \u201cmyoclonic epilepsy.\u201d He has frequent seizures and little control over his body. Strong light, loud noises, high temperatures, and similar nervous stress can cause a severe seizure during which petitioner, if unassisted, could choke to death. Since he lacks sufficient muscle control to summon help during a seizure, his physician has prescribed that he have a personal attendant to assist him during his waking hours, about 15 hours a day. Petitioner is 42 years old and has suffered from this disability for about 17 years; although he has experienced periods of remission, his physician cannot predict when or whether further remissions will occur, nor is there any presently known cure for his disease. Totally disabled, petitioner receives state aid under chapter 6 of division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code; he is also eligible for, and receives, medical assistance under chapter 7 of that division, commonly referred to as the Medi-Cal program.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Since 1968, except for a brief hospitalization, petitioner has resided at the Superior Convalescent Hospital, a nursing home which provides routine nursing care. Medi-Cal reimburses the nursing home for this expense. The nursing home does not provide the personal attendants which petitioner\u2019s condition requires; in 1968 and 1969 those attendants were paid with funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>advanced by petitioner\u2019s sister. On September 10, 1969, the Department of Health Care Services discontinued Medi-Cal benefits to petitioner, apparently on the ground that the sums advanced by his sister constituted income which made him liable for a share of the nursing home fee. Petitioner requested a hearing, contending both that the sister\u2019s payments did not constitute income to him, and that Medi-Cal should assume the burden of paying the needed personal attendants. On December 10 the hearing examiner submitted a proposed decision finding for petitioner on his first contention and recommending restoration of Medi-Cal benefits. He also found, however, that \u201cthere are no provisions under the Medi-Cal program which permit payment for attendant care for a patient in a hospital or in a convalescent nursing home.\u201d Respondent approved the proposed decision on December 31, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Petitioner then sought mandate in the superior court. The court found \u201cthat Petitioner . . . suffers from a unique form of illness and condition of disability which is such that personal and individual nursing care is constantly required for him for a period of not less than 15 hours per day.\u201d Respondent does not challenge the accuracy of this finding. The trial court further found that respondent provides persons with \u201cunique forms of illness and conditions of disability, the medical facilities of the . . . pulmonary respirator and renal dialysis machine\u201d; and that \u201cindividualized nursing care ... is, to Petitioner . . ., a medical facility to him in the same manner and sense as the said pulmonary respirator and the said renal dialysis machine.\u201d The court therefore concluded that respondent\u2019s denial of individualized nursing care to petitioner violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On January 11, 1971, the superior court entered judgment vacating the respondent\u2019s decision of December 31, 1969, remanding the matter to respondent for further proceedings, and awarding petitioner $500 in attorney\u2019s fees. The judgment further decrees that respondent\u2019s refusal of individualized nursing services to petitioner violated the Medi-Cal Act and denied him equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The Medi-Cal program was enacted in 1965 to provide \u201chealth care and related remedial or preventive services to recipients of public assistance and to medically indigent aged or other persons.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14000.) It is partially supported by federal grants under Title 42, United States Code section 1396.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 14001.1 declares that \u201cIt is the intention of the Legislature, whenever feasible, that the needs of recipients of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>public assistance for health care and related remedial or preventive services be met under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Section 14053 defines \u201chealth care\u201d; the definition includes \u201cinpatient hospital services,\u201d \u201cskilled nursing home services,\u201d and \u201cprivate duty nursing services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">The Medi-Cal program is administered by respondent Director of Health Care Services. Welfare and Institutions Code section 14105 provides that \u201cThe director shall prescribe the policies to be followed in the administration of this chapter and the scope of the services to be provided, and may limit the rates of payment for such services, and shall adopt such rules and regulations as are necessary for carrying out, not inconsistent with, the provisions thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Petitioner observes that under this program the director has provided for patients suffering from rare and life-threatening disabilities pulmonary respirators (iron lungs) and renal dialysis machines (artificial kidneys). He contends that individualized nursing care is, to him, a \u201cmedical facility\u201d fully comparable to such machines, and that to deny him such care is to deprive him of the equal protection of the laws. Respondent answers that the Medi-Cal program commands limited funds, which are insufficient to meet all medical needs of the eligible recipients; he must therefore choose to fulfill some needs but fail to do so for others. (Cf. <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 471, 487 [25 L.Ed.2d 491, 503, 90 S.Ct. 1153].) Respondent does not argue that aid to petitioner is financially infeasible, but simply that he has issued no regulation providing for such care.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">As we understand respondent\u2019s position, he contends that he and former directors in issuing Medi-Cal regulations have created a series of classifications for medical treatment, and that an eligible patient can receive only such medical treatment as comes within one or another of these categories. Since petitioner suffers from a unique illness, with abnormal requirements, his claim does not quite fit within any of the pigeon holes. Respondent could, of course, issue new regulations taking account of petitioner\u2019s plight, but he has not done so. Respondent\u2019s argument stops here, but the inevitable, if unspoken, conclusion is that petitioner will not receive the nursing care he needs and, regrettably, will die.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Fortunately, neither the statutes nor regulations compel so horrific a result. Instead, as we shall point out, present Medi-Cal regulations establish petitioner\u2019s right to receive the individualized nursing care he needs in a nursing home, if suitable financial arrangements can be made, or in a hospital. We need not, therefore, resolve the constitutional issue petitioner presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">In title 22 California Administrative Code section 51215 the director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>has established standards for nursing homes seeking to qualify for MediCal payments. Standards (C), (E), and (H) are pertinent to this case. They require that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">\u201c(C) The facility employs staff sufficient in number and qualifications to meet the requirements of the patients accepted for care. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201c(E) Patient care is provided in accordance with written policies formulated with the advice of one or more physicians and one or more registered professional nurses. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201c(H) The facility provides 24-hour nursing services adequate in quality and amount to meet the needs of the patients who are admitted to, and remain in, the facility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Petitioner contends, and we agree, that under these standards a nursing home which accepts him as a Medi-Cal patient must provide him with the nursing services that he needs and his physician prescribes. Respondent argues that a nursing home need only provide adequate general nursing services, and not the exceptional services required for petitioner. Respondent\u2019s regulation, however, does not speak in terms of meeting the prescribed needs of an average or typical patient, but clearly ordains that services meet the prescribed personal needs of the specific patients accepted for care.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The federal statutes authorizing payments to support state medical assistance programs likewise prescribe that nursing home services be adequate to meet the individual needs of their patients. Title 42 of the United States Code, section 1396a, states that \u201cA state plan for medical assistance must . . . (26) . . . provide . . . (B) for periodic inspections to be made in all skilled nursing homes . . . of (i) the care being provided in such nursing homes ... to persons receiving assistance under the State plan, (ii) with respect to each of the patients receiving such care, the adequacy of the services available in particular nursing homes ... to meet the current health needs and promote the maximum physical well-being of patients receiving care in such homes.\u201d  Although this statute nominally establishes standards for inspection of homes, it clearly assumes that the state will not continue to make payments to nursing homes which do not provide services adequate in view of the medical needs of each of its patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">We cannot, however, ignore the practical difficulties which may flow from a ruling that a nursing home that accepts petitioner must provide him with personal attendants.  Since a nursing home is not a common carrier or a public utility, it is presently under no compulsion to accept a patient. <em>(California Assn. of Nursing Homes etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>4 Cal.App.3d 800, 817 [84 Cal.Rptr. 590, 85 Cal.Rptr. 735].) Consequently, if Medi-Cal payments to nursing homes do not suffice to pay for petitioner\u2019s attendants, the practical effect of insisting that any nursing home that accepts him must provide such attendants may be that no nursing home will accept him.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\">We inquire, therefore, into the basis for payments to nursing homes under the Medi-Cal regulations. The parties assume that such payments are governed by title 22 California Administrative Code section 51511,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">\u201c(a) Reimbursement to nursing and convalescent homes shall be made in accordance with the Schedule of Maximum Allowances, Section II, Part C, Long-Term Care Facilities, which is in effect at the time nursing and convalescent home services are provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">\u201c(b) The per diem rate paid under this section shall not exceed $14.00, except that the director may negotiate all-inclusive per diem rates which provide for additional medically indicated covered services and provided that such negotiated rates do not increase over-all program costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The parties agree that the specified per diem of $14 will not pay for the nursing services that petitioner requires. Section 51511, however, permits the director <em>to negotiate a higher per diem rate </em>if by so doing he does not increase overall program costs. Having determined that petitioner is- entitled to individual nursing care, we do not believe that a rate sufficient to compensate the additional attendants at a nursing home would increase overall costs. If no nursing home would accept petitioner the only alternative would be hospitalization at even greater expense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hospitalization, whether with special duty nurses or in intensive care, obviously would cost far more than the approximately $33 a day required to provide petitioner with special attendants at a nursing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Respondent contends that petitioner does not qualify for hospitalization because his condition cannot be successfully treated.  Hospital \u201ctreatment,\u201d however, is not limited to the curing of a disease; persons with incurable diseases such as petitioner are often hospitalized to facili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tate procedures which will alleviate their distress and prolong their lives.  The Medi-Cal regulations do not limit hospitalization to cases of curable illnesses, but provide that the need for hospital care be determined \u201cin accordance with the usual standards of medical practice in the community\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 51110). If petitioner could survive only with hospitalization, we are confident that the medical standards of the comr munity would sanction it. Once hospitalized, petitioner could receive the individualized nursing care required either through placement in an intensive care unit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or through authorization under California Administrative Code, title 22, section 51339.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">To summarize the present regulations: (1) If petitioner is accepted by a nursing home, that institution must provide the <em>individualized </em>nursing care he requires (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 51215); (2) if he is not accepted at a nursing home, he is entitled to the more expensive hospitalization, and at the hospital will receive the required care (see Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 51110, 51339); (3) to facilitate petitioner\u2019s acceptance by a nursing home, respondent can negotiate a per diem rate to compensate the institution for the additional nursing services petitioner requires (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 51511). We therefore conclude that the director erred in his determination that existing regulations provide no means by which petitioner can obtain the needed individualized nursing care.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">We have not overlooked the fact that the Court of Appeal has declared regulation 51511, which has been referred to above, to be invalid but we note that the regulation has in any event been continued in effect by stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>lation and court order. In <em>California Assn. of Nursing Homes etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 800 [84 Cal.Rptr. 590, 85 Cal.Rptr. 735], the Court of Appeal stated that respondent adopted that regulation without complying with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act on notice, hearing, and preparation of an evidentiary record (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11423-11425, 11440), and concluded that \u201cthe administrator has as yet failed to comply with the statutory mandate to adopt a regulation establishing rates of payment for nursing homes services.\u201d (4 Cal.App.3d at p. 816). The Court of Appeal then directed the superior court to issue a mandate to require the director to adopt a new regulation, following proper notice and hearing, which will establish rates both prospectively and retroactively to the inception of Medi-Cal in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Respondent has begun hearings, but has not yet issued a new regulation. In the meantime, the parties to <em>California Assn. of Nursing Homes etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams </em>stipulated, and the superior court ordered, that payments may continue under the provisions of regulation 51511, but without prejudice to the rights of the parties to take such legal action as they deem appropriate. Thus at present the nursing home that accepts petitioner may claim payment under section 51511 as provided in the superior court stipulation and judgment, and seek to negotiate with the respondent for higher per diem rates, or may pursue any other appropriate legal remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The record clearly shows that respondent did not formulate the present regulations with petitioner\u2019s needs and disability in mind; nor are we certain that these regulations, even assuming their validity, establish the most efficacious way of providing the needed services for petitioner. For example, regulation 51215 requires the nursing home to employ sufficient attendants to meet a patient\u2019s needs; yet it may well be more efficient for the respondent to employ the attendants directly, or give petitioner a grant sufficient to enable petitioner to hire them. Regulation 51511, providing compensation to nursing homes at rates which may discourage such institutions from accepting petitioner, could result in petitioner\u2019s unnecessary hospitalization at much greater taxpayer expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Since respondent is in the process of holding hearings and formulating new regulations, we assume that the new regulations, taking account of the severe predicament facing victims of myoclonic epilepsy, will provide for the needed assistance in the manner that respondent finds to be the most efficient and least costly. Pending the issuance of the new regulations, respondent has adequate means under present statutes and regulations to provide petitioner with the needed care.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">We turn finally to the matter of the specific judgment rendered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>superior court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with paragraphs one, three, and five of the trial court judgment, which paragraphs vacate the decision of the director denying petitioner individualized nursing care, and award attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Paragraph two of that judgment, which held that the director\u2019s decision violated state statutes and denied petitioner the equal protection of the laws, is unnecessary to that judgment; it should be deleted. Paragraph four remands this cause to the director and requires him to proceed in conformity with the superior court\u2019s findings, conclusions and judgment. Those findings and conclusions, however, contain unnecessary language holding the director\u2019s actions unconstitutional. The findings and conclusions also improperly imply that respondent should provide petitioner with attendants, but the Medi-Cal regulations made it clear that the institution in which petitioner resides must supply the attendants with the department\u2019s role limited to compensating that institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\">In conclusion, despite the declared legislative intent to meet the health needs of recipients of public assistance whenever feasible, and despite the absence of any reason to believe aid to petitioner unfeasible, petitioner faces the horrible fate of being consigned to death because his unique disease does not fit within any of the pigeon holes of the Medi-Cal regulations. We have analyzed these regulations in the hope of finding a way to prevent this result, and have concluded that although the regulations were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>promulgated with petitioner\u2019s requirements in mind, nonetheless they do provide a means by which petitioner\u2019s medical needs can be met and his life prolonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court with directions to modify its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment to conform to the views expressed in this opinion. The trial court shall retain jurisdiction over the cause after remand to the director to ensure that petitioner receives the necessary nursing care during the pendency of further administrative proceedings. Petitioner shall recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Wright, C.
