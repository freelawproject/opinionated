The complaint in the slander suit alleged not only that the defendant in that suit had said that the plaintiff was \u201c a bigamist \u201d and \u201c an indecent woman,\u201d but that she had said that she was \u201ca thief\u201d and \u201ca common prostitute.\u201d The defendant by her answer denied having uttered the slanderous words charged in the two counts of the complaint. The jury by a general verdict found this issue against her, and in favor of the then plaintiff. Whether their verdict was based upon a finding that the defendant in that case uttered all the slanderous words charged in the complaint, or only a part of them, and if only a part of them, what part of them, we are not informed. Certainly we cannot assume that the jury found that the only slanderous words uttered by the defendant in that suit were that the plaintiff was a bigamist, or that she was an indecent women. But these are the only alleged utterances the truth of which, it can be said, would be proved by the alleged newly-discovered evidence. Proof that the plaintiff in the slander suit had knowingly married a man who had another wife living would not prove that she was a thief or a common prostitute. It is apparent, therefore., that if the defendant in the slander suit should be permitted to change her answer and plead the truth of all the words which she is alleged to have uttered, that her plea of justification could not be sustained by the alleged newly-discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">But it is argued that a new trial ought to he granted to enable the defendant in the slander suit to prove, under the new answer she desires to file, the truth of certain of her alleged utterances, and, under the denial already filed, to show that she did not utter the alleged words the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>of which would not be proved by the newly-discovered evidence. But it does not appear that upon another trial the defendant in the slander suit could disprove the other alleged utterances any more successfully than she did at the first trial. It is not alleged that she has discovered any new evidence bearing upon that issue, nor is any ground whatever alleged for a retrial of the issue upon which the jury have rendered a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The complaint is insufficient because it fails to show that a different result would be produced if a new trial were granted. <em>Parsons </em>v. Platt, 37 Conn. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
