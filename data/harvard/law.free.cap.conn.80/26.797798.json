J., Hamersley, Hall, Prentice and Thayer, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b38-11\">In an action at law to recover rent, the sole issue between the parties was as to whether the written lease at the time of its execution described certain rooms, as well as a store, as part of the leased premises, as contended by the defendant, or whether the clause including those rooms was afterward inserted in the lease without the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or consent, as alleged by him; and this issue was found in favor of the defendant. <em>Held </em>that thereupon the defendant was entitled to judgment; and that the fact that the plaintiff did not know or realize at the time he signed the lease that it referred to these rooms as part of the leased premises, did not justify the trial court in rendering judgment in his favor, in the absence not only of any allegation that he had been induced to sign the lease by any fraud or improper conduct on the part of the defendant, but also of any prayer for a cancellation or correction of the lease or for other equitable relief.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b38-12\">Submitted on briefs May 9th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A4h\">decided June 5th, 1907.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-13\">Action to recover rent, brought to and tried by the City Court of Hartford, Bullard, <em>J.; </em>facts.found and judgment rendered for the plaintiff, and appeal by the defendants.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A3x\">\n<em>Error and judgment reversed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-14\"><em>John T.

The court also found from something which appeared in the evidence, that the plaintiff is a poor reader of English and did not notice or comprehend that the quoted words were in the instrument, and that he did not knowingly agree that they should be included in it, and that he understood that the lease was a lease of the store alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The plaintiff, after the trial, at the suggestion of the court, amended his reply by adding \u201cor if said words appeared in said lease when it was signed it was without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff, who never knowingly agreed that said words should be included in said lease and never knowingly agreed that the rental of said three rooms in the rear of the store to be used as .a tenement should be included in .said sum of $25, which, according to the plaintiff\u2019s understanding, was to he the monthly rent for said grocery store only.\u201d The defendants having declined to offer further evidence upon the issue thus attempted to be raised, although given an opportunity to do so; the court ruled that the lease was invalid upon the ground that there was no meeting of the minds of the parties, that it furnished no defense to the action, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">After proof that he executed the lease set up in the answer the plaintiff was estopped to deny that he was bound by its terms. No fraud or improper conduct or act on th'e part of the defendants inducing the plaintiff to sign the lease is alleged, and if he signed it without knowing its terms, it would appear to have been through negligence so gross that a court of equity upon proper pleadings would refuse to cancel or correct the lease. It is unnecessary to determine this question however. This is an action at law for rent, and no such relief is asked for. The defendants proved that they occupied the premises in question under a written lease under seal, and that they had paid in full the rent reserved in the lease. They were therefore entitled to judgment. The court erred in ruling that the lease afforded no defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">There is error and the judgment of the City Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred-.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
