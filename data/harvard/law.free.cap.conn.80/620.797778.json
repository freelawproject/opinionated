The only inventory ever filed by the administrator was rendered August 21st, 1900, within two months after his appointment, and was made up of the following items:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">\u201c One wood lot........... $250.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-14\">\u201c stove............ 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-15\">\u201c A certain claim against the Estate of John G.

To cash from Estate of John G. Spicer representing accrued interest on Savings Bank books, $16,870.51.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The heirs at law of the intestate appealed from a decree allowing this account, on the sole ground that the account was not in proper form by reason of the fact that this item was described without sufficient particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In 1900 the law in respect to inventories of estates of deceased persons was that \u201c an inventory of all the property, including choses in action, of the estate of every deceased person and every insolvent debtor, shall be made by the executor, administrator, or trustee, which property, except the choses in action, shall be appraised by two or more disinterested persons, under oath, appointed by the court, and said inventory shall be sworn to by such execur tor, administrator, or trustee, and deposited with the court within two months after the acceptance of his bond.\u201d Revision of 1888, \u00a7 578. In the Revision of 1902, the words \u201c except the choses in action \u201d were dropped from this statute. General Statutes, \u00a7 323. In 1905 they were restored. Public Acts of 1905, p. 247, Chap. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The inventory of the estate of Clarissa Spicer was filed, therefore, at a time when no appraisal was made of choses in action. With respect to the claim which it included against the estate of John G. Spicer, the administrator was accountable for whatever he might collect or-ought reasonably to have collected. He has so accounted, and his inventory and account, taken together, as they should be, sufficiently exhibit the condition of the estate. <em>Atwater </em>v. Barnes, 21 Conn. 237. It does not appear from the record whether the amount with which he debited himself represents a lump sum, accepted by way of settlement, or is made up of a number of specific items ; nor was it, as matter of law,' necessary that it should; so appear, when the source from which it was derived, arid' its' general' nature, were1 so clearly described. - - \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The Superior Court corrected certain errors lu the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>count, but found none in respect to tbe particular entry now in question. This being so, it is unnecessary to inquire whether, in view of General Statutes, \u00a7 323, an additional inventory and appraisal should have been filed, upon the collection of the claim. The way to raise that question would be by quite a different proceeding. <em>Moore </em>v. Holmes, 32 Conn. 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
