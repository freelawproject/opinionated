J., Hamersley, Hall, Prentice and Roraback, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-12\">In an action to recover for work and materials furnished, the complaint alleged that the plaintiffs had agreed to sell and deliver to the defendants McMullen &amp; Company, who were bridge contractors, all rock-faced granite ashlar which they were required to use in the piers and abutments of a bridge over the Connecticut River which they had contracted to build for the other defendant, The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District; that as soon as the plaintiffs began to supply the granite, the defendants\u2014while admitting that it complied with the specifications\u2014nevertheless insisted and continued to insist that stone of a larger size and with a finer dressing and finish than that \u25a0called for by the contract should be provided, although they were informed by the plaintiffs that for such stone an extra price would be charged; and that the stones so required were furnished by the plaintiffs at an increased cost and expense. The contract which the plaintiffs made with McMullen &amp; Company (Exhibit <em>A) </em>referred to and incorporated such portions of the contract (Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>hibit B) made by McMullen &amp; Company with the Bridge and Highway District, as were applicable to the rock-faced granite ashlar; and by reference these contracts were made part of the complaint. The defendants, claiming that it appeared from these exhibits that the work and material in question were only such as the plaintiffs had originally contracted to provide, demurred to the complaint upon that ground. Held:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-6\">1. That inasmuch as the action was not brought upon the written agreement between the plaintiffs and McMullen &amp; Company, but to secure compensation for labor and materials furnished which were not embraced therein, it was unnecessary for the plaintiffs to allege that these \u201cextras\u201d were inspected and approved by the chief engineer of the Bridge and Highway District\u2014a requirement of the written agreement.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-8\">2. That this court could not undertake to say, as matter of law, upon the complaint and contracts, that none of the items in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of particulars were extras; but would leave that ques-*' tion, which to some extent at least was one of fact, to be determined upon the filing of an answer or further pleading.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-10\">3. That the provision in Exhibit <em>B, </em>to the effect that McMullen &amp; Company should have no claim against the Bridge and Highway District for extra work, unless such work was ordered in writing by the latter\u2019s engineer and unless the claim therefor was presented before the first day of the following month, formed no part of the plaintiffs\u2019 contract with McMullen &amp; Company, and therefore was not available as a ground of demurrer to the complaint.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b173-12\">4. That in view of the situation of the parties and their different contract relations, it was apparent that whatever extra work or labor was ordered or demanded by the Bridge and Highway District, was required of McMullen &amp; Company and not of the plaintiffs, and that the latter in furnishing such extra work and material looked for payment to McMullen &amp; Company and not to the District; and therefore the complaint, in so far as it was directed against the Bridge and Highway District, was demurrable, in that it failed to set out any facts from which the law would imply a promise upon the part of the District to pay the plaintiffs.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b173-14\">Argued June 11th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Acq\">decided July 30th, 1907.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-15\">Action by a contractor to recover for alleged extra work and material furnished, brought to and tried by the Superior Court in New Haven County, Skumivay, ./., upon demurrers to the complaint; the court sustained the demurrers and rendered judgment for the defendants, and the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ADq2\">\n<em>Error in part.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>William H.

The defendants, McMullen, Weand and McDermott, are contractors in bridge building. The defendant, The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District, is a public corporation composed of certain towns of this State, organized under a special act of legislature for the purpose of constructing and maintaining a public bridge across the Connecticut River at Hartford, and- acting by a board of commissioners. 12 Special Laws, p. 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The substituted complaint, as afterward amended, contains these allegations:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">\u201c 3. On the 7th day of November, 1903, the plaintiffs and the defendants, McMullen, Weand and McDermott, with the full knowledge, consent and acquiescence of the defendant, The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District, entered into a contract, a copy of which is attached to the original complaint and marked Exhibit <em>A, </em>and made a part of this complaint, and a copy of the contract and specifications entered into by the parties of the second part to said contract, Exhibit <em>A, </em>with The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District, to which reference is made in Exhibit <em>A, </em>is filed with this complaint, and marked Exhibit <em>B, </em>and in so far as said contract and specifications are applicable in regard to the rock-faced granite ashlar referred to in said Exhibit <em>A </em>are made a part of this complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">\u201c But the interlineations in writing and the writing on the margin of said Exhibit <em>B </em>in regard to rock-faced granite ashlar were not in said contract and specifications, Exhibit <em>B, </em>at the time said Exhibit <em>A </em>was executed, but were added thereto thereafter, as more particularly set forth in this complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201c 4. Immediately after the execution of said contract, Exhibit <em>A, </em>the plaintiffs commenced to and undertook to perform and fulfill all the promises and undertakings on their part made, as set forth in said contract, Exhibit A, and always have been ready and willing to and have fully performed all of the undertakings and promises. on their part made, as set forth in said Exhibit A, and have always been ready and willing to and have fully performed all of the undertakings and promises in regard to rock-faced granite ashlar made by the defendants, McMullen, Weand and McDermott, with the defendant, The Connecticut Biver Bridge and Highway District, as set forth in the contract referred to in said Exhibit A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u201c5. After the contract, Exhibit A,was entered into by the parties thereto, the contract and specifications, Exhibit <em>B, </em>were changed by the defendant, The Connecticut Biver Bridge and Highway District, by and with the consent of McMullen, Weand and McDermott, and without the consent of the plaintiffs, and additional requirements were made in regard to the rock-faced granite ashlar, and there was inserted the following provisions :\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\u201c First. \u2018 Especially to avoid plug holes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">\u201c Second. In regard to the angles and joints the following provision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">\u201c 1\" at point of nose inc. to 3\" at angle, &amp; turning the corner at 3\" inc. to 5\".</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">\u201c Said contract, Exhibit <em>B, </em>was otherwise changed, without the consent of the plaintiffs, in regard to the rock-faced granite ashlar, and other particulars, as is shown by interlineations and writings on the margin, and was further changed by the demand of both of the defendants requiring a finer class of work, and a larger size of stone, as is more particularly hereafter set forth in this complaint; and neither of said defendants paid the plaintiffs the money due them at the time when it became due in accordance with the terms of the contract, Exhibit A, but withheld the same until long after it was due, and until the plaintiffs had brought suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201c 6. Immediately after the plaintiffs commenced to fulfill their contract and undertakings, as set forth in Exhibit <em>A, </em>said McMullen, Weand and McDermott and said Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District demanded and insisted that said stone should be cut above and beyond the requirements set forth in Exhibit B, and above and beyond the agreement and undertaking of the plaintiffs, and demanded and required another and much finer class of cutting, dressing, and trimming, and also required a larger size of stone than that specified in said Exhibit <em>B.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201c 7. Thereupon said plaintiffs notified both of said defendants that they were demanding a cutting, dressing, and size of stone which was not required by said specifications, and a finer class of cutting and dressing than was required by said specifications, and notified said defendants that if they demanded such cutting and dressing and such a class of cutting and dressing as they then and there demanded, and stone of the size they then demanded, that an extra price would have to be and would be charged for the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201c 8. After the notice so given by said plaintiffs, Harry Fuller, the inspector of The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District, and Edwin D. Graves, the engineer of said corporation, by and with the knowledge and consent of the defendants, McMullen, Weand and McDermott, inspected the stone cut by the plaintiffs in accordance with the specifications set forth in Exhibit <em>B, </em>and thereafter both of said defendants, The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District and said McMullen, Weand and McDermott, still ordered and directed the plaintiffs to cut the stone with a class of cutting and dressing and a fineness of cutting and dressing not required by said speck fications, and demanded a larger size of stone than required by Exhibit <em>B.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">\u201c 9. Thereupon, upon the demand of these defendants, the plaintiffs continued to prepare, cut, and furnish said ashlar far in excess of the fineness of cutting and dressing which was called for by said specifications, and a larger size <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of stone; and on the-day of August, 1904, and thereafter, before the first day of the month following, the plaintiffs presented and handed to the defendants, McMullen, Weand and McDermott, a bill for the extra services, and expense connected with the furnishing of said ashlar, and notified the defendant, The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District, of such claim, and of the presentation of said bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u201c10. Neither of said defendants nor any of their officers or agents have ever claimed to the plaintiffs that the specifications referred to in said contract, Exhibit <em>B, </em>required the degree of fineness in the cutting and dressing of the ashlar that was demanded of the plaintiffs, and which was furnished by the plaintiffs after the notification given by the plaintiffs that there would be an extra charge for the same, but have repeatedly admitted the same; and after said notification and after the presentation of said bills all the defendants continued to demand and did demand and require of the plaintiffs that they furnish an ashlar in fineness of cutting and dressing far in excess of that required by the specifications set forth in Exhibit <em>B, </em>and far in excess of that required by the specifications set forth in Exhibit <em>B, </em>even after the changes therein, and also stone of a larger size than required by said specifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\u201c11. The plaintiffs have furnished to said defendants, McMullen, Weand and McDermott, and the said Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District, all rock-faced granite ashlar required to be used by them in the construction of the piers and abutments of said bridge below the belt course at the springing line, and have in accordance with the orders of said McMullen, Weand and McDermott and said Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District, cut and delivered stone of a much finer degree of cutting, dressing, and trimming, and of a larger size than required by said specifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\u201c 12. The stone so cut and furnished to the defendants cost the plaintiffs for cutting and dressing the same largely in excess of what said stone would have cost them had they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>been required simply to deliver stone dressed and cut as-described in said specifications; and said plaintiffs were obliged to and did furnish dressed stone of a larger size than required in the specifications, which stone are specifically mentioned in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of particulars, and for the extra size of stone and the extra cost and expense for cutting and dressing, all of which is more specifically set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of particulars, and the statement made in explanation thereof, now on file, all of which are made a part of this complaint, there is due the plaintiffs the sum of $26,396.14, in addition to which sum the plaintiffs claim thirty per cent. (30$) of the sum for the use of the plaintiffs\u2019 plant and fixtures, including the services of their employees connected with the plant in the extra handling of said stone, and for the services of the blacksmiths employed in sharpening and repairing broken tools, which services it is impossible to specify in detail, but the plaintiffs claim that said thirty per cent, is a usual and reasonable sum to be charged for such use of the plaintiffs\u2019 plant and fixtures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201c13. The defendants have never paid the plaintiffs any part of the sum due them as claimed in the last paragraph; although demand has been made upon them for the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\u201cThe plaintiffs claim fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) damages.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Exhibit <em>A, </em>referred to in the complaint, contains these provisions:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">\u201cEXHIBIT A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">\u201c. . .

These charges amount to something over $25,000, and there is added the further charge of thirty per cent, of that amount for the use of the plaintiffs\u2019 plant and fixtures.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">To the complaint thus framed the defendants McMullen, Weand and McDermott demurred, upon the grounds, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>substance : (1) that by the terms of Exhibit <em>A </em>the materials to be furnished by the plaintiffs were to be subject to the inspection and approval of the chief engineer of the Bridge and Highway District, before they were to be accepted and paid for, and that it appeared that the alleged extra work was required by said chief engineer to be furnished under the contract, Exhibit <em>A, </em>and Exhibit <em>B </em>as a part of it, in order to obtain such approval; (2) that it did not appear that the alleged changes made in Exhibit <em>B </em>required a finer class of cutting and trimming than was required by Exhibit <em>A, </em>but that it did appear that they required less work and a lower class of cutting and dressing; (3) that it appeared that the chief engineer decided that the alleged extra work was not extra work but was required by Exhibits <em>A </em>and <em>B ; </em>(4) that it appeared that the plaintiffs had acquiesced in such decision; (5) that by the terms of Exhibit <em>B, </em>made part of Exhibit <em>A , </em>it was provided that no claim for extra work or materials should be made unless such work or materials should be ordered in writing by the chief engineer, and unless the claim therefor should be presented to the board of commissioners before the first day of the month following that in which the order was complied with, and that it was not alleged that said extra materials and work were so ordered, nor that the claim therefor was so presented; (6) that The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District was a public corporation which could only contract by its board of commissioners, and that it was not alleged that the claimed changes in Exhibit <em>B </em>were made by their authority, and that it appeared that the alleged changes in Exhibit <em>B </em>and the alleged requirements of the engineer were provided for and contemplated in Exhibit <em>B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The defendant District demurred to the complaint upon the same grounds as McMullen, Weand and McDermott, and upon the additional grounds that it appeared that the District was not a party to the contract, Exhibit <em>A, </em>and that it did not appear that it had liad any contract relations with the plaintiffs in respect to the subject-matter of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The trial court, while expressing the opinion that the pleadings in their present form left the real issue somewhat uncertain, and that it might be made clearer by an amendment or an answer, sustained both demurrers upon the ground, as indicated by the memorandum of decision, that the complaint in effect alleged that the first ashlars, offered by the plaintiffs as finished according to specifications, were rejected as not complying with the requirements of the written contract, and that the complaint contained no allegation that any ashlar or stone cut and finished as required by the written contract was inspected and approved by the engineer. Although not expressly so stated in the memorandum filed under \u00a7 765 of the General Statutes, this decision is apparently based upon the first and third grounds of McMullen, Weand and McDermott\u2019s demurrer, and the third and fifth of the Bridge and Highway District\u2019s demurrer. The trial judge says in his memorandum of decision, that if the fact were and had been alleged, that the plaintiffs had furnished stone approved by the chief engineer, as in accordance with their contract, and that thereafter the defendants liad required stone to be furnished cut and finished above the requirements of the contract, a different case would be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In our view the allegations of the complaint are sufficient to permit proof of the facts suggested by the trial court. This is not an action upon the written contract between the plaintiffs and McMullen, Weand and McDermott. The plaintiffs are not by this suit seeking to obtain payment for work and materials furnished in accordance with the requirements of the written contract, and which the chief engineer has either approved or refused to approve, nor to recover damages for any claimed breach of that contract, but to secure compensation for labor and materials furnished, which were not embraced in it. There is no allegation that the contract prices have not been paid in full. It was unnecessary for the plaintiffs to expressly aver whether such extra work and materials, alleged to have been ordered after the execution of the written con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>tract, and to have been received and used by the defendants, did or did not pass the inspection of the engineer and have his approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">As we read the complaint, it does not allege that the plaintiffs were required to furnish the work and materials for which they are now seeking to obtain payment, because the engineer improperly rejected, as not complying with the terms of the written contract, work and materials which in fact met the requirements of the contract. It is true that the plaintiffs allege in their complaint and \u201c more specific statement \u201d that the defendants required them to cut stone, and dress surfaces, beyond the requirements of the written contract, and refused to accept stone of the size required by that contract, but it is not only not alleged that such rejection was upon the ground that the work and materials failed to meet the requirements of the written contract, but it is expressly .alleged that neither of the defendants, nor any of their officers or agents, have ever claimed that the specifications of Exhibit <em>B </em>required the degree of fineness in the cutting and dressing of ashlar which was demanded and furnished, but have repeatedly admitted that they did not. By agreeing that the work and materials furnished under the contract should be subject to the inspection of the chief engineer of the board of commissioners, the plaintiffs did not consent that the engineer, while admitting that work furnished complied with the contract, could compel them to furnish other and more costly work at contract prices. The demurrers were erroneously sustained upon the grounds stated by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">None of the other grounds of the demurrer of McMullen, Weand and McDermott can be sustained. Evidently the principal dispute between the parties is whether or not the materials and work in question are extras. The defendants by their demurrers, and particularly by the second and sixth grounds of McMullen, Weand and McDermott\u2019s demurrer, ask to have that question decided in their favor as one of law. The complaint, bill of particulars, contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and specifications, with their numerous technical terms, abbreviated items and descriptions by letters and numbers, are not calculated to furnish and do not afford sufficient information to enable a court to fully and intelligently determine as a question of law whether or not any of the work and materials in question are extras, and if any\u00b0 are, to point out which items are and which are not. The question whether the materials and work described in the complaint and bill of particulars are embraced in the written contract is, under the present allegations of the complaint, to some extent at least, one of fact, the proper determination of which requires the filing of an answer or further pleading. Upon the present pleadings we can only say that the allegations of the complaint are sufficient \u2022 to permit proof that extra work and materials were furnished, and that it does not appear that none of the items of the bill of particulars and more specific statement could be shown to have been extras.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The provisions of Sections H, X and Y, above set forth, of the contract and specifications, Exhibit <em>B, </em>between McMullen, Weand and McDermott, and The Bridge and Highway District\u2014that the former shall have no claim against the latter for compensation for extra work, unless ordered in writing by the engineer and unless presented on the first day of the following month\u2014are not parts of the contract, Exhibit <em>A, </em>between the plaintiffs and McMullen, Weand and McDermott. Exhibit <em>A </em>does not make all of Exhibit <em>B </em>a part of it, but only such parts as may be applicable. Exhibit <em>A </em>describes the rock-faced granite ashlar which the plaintiffs agreed to furnish, as that required and specified by Exhibit <em>B, </em>and provides that it must comply with the requirements of Exhibit <em>B. </em>Exhibit <em>B </em>was made a part of Exhibit <em>A </em>to make the provisions of the latter clearer. Exhibit <em>A </em>expressly states that Exhibit <em>B </em>is referred to \u201c for greater particularity.\u201d Evidently the principal, if not the sole, purpose of so referring to it, was that it contained a particular description of the kind, character and quality of the work and materials to be furnished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>by the plaintiffs, which were only generally described in Exhibit <em>A. </em>But Exhibit <em>A </em>contains no provision whatever regarding extra work. The different character of the work to be performed under Exhibit <em>B, </em>the fact that Exhibit <em>B </em>is a municipal contract requiring the expenditure of public money, and other considerations, may well have furnished reasons for making these provisions in Exhibit <em>B </em>regarding extra work which were not reasons for making them in Exhibit <em>A, </em>and which render such provisions wholly inapplicable to Exhibit <em>A.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The allegation of the complaint that the provisions of Exhibit <em>B </em>were changed by the defendant is sufficient to meet the test of a demurrer, without an averment that the changes were made by the authority of the board of commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The demurrer of The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District was properly sustained. It clearly appears that the District was not a party to the contract, Exhibit <em>A, </em>and the facts alleged fail to show any express or implied promise of the District to pay the plaintiffs for the alleged extra work.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The principal allegations, relied upon by the plaintiffs as raising an implied promise by the District, are that McMullen, Weand and McDermott and the District demanded and required the alleged extra work to be done; and ordered and direpted the plaintiffs to cut stone, and to furnish stone beyond the requirements of Exhibit <em>B </em>after they were informed of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that such work and materials were extras. Ordinarily when goods are furnished or work performed by one person at the request of another, the law implies a promise upon the part of the latter to pay the former for them. But no such promise upon the part of the District can properly be implied from the demand alleged in the complaint. The allegation that the District demanded and required the extra work to be done must be read in connection with the other facts alleged in this case, and the acts of the three parties, the plaintiffs, McMullen, Weand and McDermott, and The Bridge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Highway District, in ordering, furnishing and receiving the alleged extra work, must be interpreted in the light of the fact that each of them fully understood the different contract relations created by the two agreements Exhibit <em>A </em>and Exhibit <em>B. </em>The plaintiffs knew that the District looked to McMullen, Weand and McDermott to furnish the stone in question, and that the District understood that the plaintiffs were to furnish them to McMullen, Weand and McDermott, and to receive their pay from them, and that no one but the original contractors McMullen, Weand and McDermott had any right to look to the District for payment. The bills for the extra work were presented monthly to McMullen, Weand and McDermott, and not to the District, and the District was informed of that fact. Prom all the facts alleged it is apparent that the plaintiffs understood that any requirement of the District that the stone in question be furnished, was a requirement that McMullen, Weand and McDermott must furnish them; and it is equally apparent that the plaintiffs furnished the extra stone to McMullen, Weand and McDermott as they alleged they did, and that they did not understand they were furnishing them, and did not furnish them, upon the credit of the Bridge and Highway District.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">There was no error in sustaining the demurrer of the defendant The Connecticut River Bridge and Highway District.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">There was error in. sustaining the demurrer of the defendants, McMullen, Weand and McDermott.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The case is remanded with direction to overrule the demurrer of the defendants McMullen, Weand and McDermott, and to proceed with the case according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
