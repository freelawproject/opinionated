A deputy-sheriff, in the absence of the clerk of the court but in the presence, of a judge of the court and the assistant clerk, and by direction of the latter, put his hand in the boxes and drew the slips marked with the jurors\u2019 names and handed the same to the assistant clerk. <em>Held </em>that the drawing of the slips containing the names of the jurors is an official duty and must be performed either by the clerk, or, in his absence, by the assistant clerk personally, and cannot be delegated; and that the jury as drawn was illegal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b627-13\">General Statutes, \u00a7 664, providing that \u201cno verdict shall be set aside on account of any irregularity in summoning the jury,\u201d applies to cases where, without taking exception to the panel or members of it as improperly summoned, a party proceeds to trial, and, after verdict, seeks to have it set aside; and does not apply to an appeal from the ruling of the court disallowing a challenge duly taken to an illegal panel.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b627-14\">Peremptory challenges are allowed (General Statutes, \u00a7 1507) upon the arraignment of an accused, and not upon the several counts or for the several crimes charged.

The accused did not demur to the information, or move in arrest of judgment after verdict, but now claims that the information does not charge an offense under the statute. The gist of the offense created by the statute is the threatening or following, etc., with the purpose or intent to intimidate, and it is not necessary, to constitute the crime, that the person who is threatened shall in fact be intimidated, provided the threats are such as are calculated to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>timidate or put in fear an ordinarily firm and prudent man. The information does not directly charge the accused with threatening, but it does so argumentatively when it charges that he intimidated by threatening. The information is bad in form, but the accused did not take advantage of the defect in the proper way. No question appears to have been raised upon the trial that an offense under the statute was not chaxged in the informatioxx. Both the paxties and the court treated it as a prosecutioxx under \u00a7 1296. It is not an offense at common law to threaten another with ixxtent, by ixxtixnidating him, to conxpel him to refrain from working for another, and unless an offense under the statute is charged, no offense is chaxged. The defendant cannot now obtain a new trial for amendable defects ixi the information of which he did xxot seasonably take advantage, and upon a question not raised by his reasons of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">As already stated, it was xxot necessary that the parties threatened should have been actually ixxtinxidated. .The court, therefore, correctly refused to charge, as x\u2019equested, that actual intimidation was necessaxy, and committed no error in charging, as it did, that \u201c it is not ixecessaxy in order to prove a crime under this statute, that the person to whoxn the threats are made, or whom it is sought to ixxtimidate, should be ixx fact nxade to fear or be in fact intimidated. It is oxxly necessary to prove that the threats and acts are such as would be calculated to cause the ordinary maxx to fear or to affect his mixxd ixx such a way that he could not voluntarily act or assexxt. It is necessary, however, under this statute, that the threat or means of intimidation should be understood by the person at whom of against whom they are directed, as intexxded to frighten or intimidate him. . . . They should be of such nature that he understands them to be threats and iixtinxidatioxx.\u201d This precluded the juxy from finding a verdict against the accused, if they fouxxd \u201c that the words claimed to have beexx uttered by the accused were ixx fact uttered ixx a friendly spii'it or baxxterixxg way, as by way of a joke,\u201d and was a sufficient response to the defexxdant\u2019s request upoxx that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>subject. It also, in connection with the language used in other parts of the charge, sufficiently answers the defendant\u2019s request to charge as to the meaning of intimidation as used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Before proceeding to trial, the accused filed a challenge to the array of jurors then present and attending the October criminal term in which the case was pending, because (1) the names of the jurors, when they were summoned for the September criminal term, were not drawn from the boxes by the clerk of the court, as the statute provides, and because (2) the October criminal term was not the term next succeeding the September criminal term for which they were summoned, a September civil term having intervened. He also, at the proper time, moved that he be allowed to challenge peremptorily two jurors for each count of the information, and that he be allowed to examine each juror individually before he should be sworn or accepted, in order to ascertain whether, for any cause, the juror was unfit or incompetent to try the case. The challenge to the array was disallowed, and the motion overruled, and these rulings are made grounds of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">General Statutes, \u00a7 1507, provides that an accused, when arraigned for any offense before the Criminal Court of Common Pleas, may peremptorily challenge two jurors. In the Superior Court he may challenge the same number, except in three classes of cases, wherein a greater number of such challenges is allowed, graduated according to the punishment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Neuner, </em>49 Conn. 232, 233. As regards the number of challenges permitted, the class of the case is fixed by the maximum punishment to which the accused is liable if convicted of any offense charged in the indictment or information, no matter how many counts may be contained therein. The challenges are allowed upon his arraignment, and not upon the several counts or for the several crimes charged. He cannot multiply his challenges by the number of counts contained in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Under our practice the accused was not entitled, as a matter of strict right, to examine each juror individually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>as to his qualifications. It was within the discretion of the trial court,- and unless it appears that the discretion was improperly exercised, or that the defendant was injured by the refusal, it is not ground for a new trial. <em>State </em>v. Lee, 69 Conn. 186, 194, 195, 37 Atl. 75. It does not appear in the-present case that the accused was injured by the disallowance of his motion, or that the court\u2019s discretion was unfairly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The challenge to the array should have been allowed. It appears from the record that the assistant clerk, one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas, and a deputy-sheriff went to the clerk\u2019s office for the purpose of drawing the jury, and that, in the absence of the clerk, the deputy-sheriff, by direction of the assistant clerk, put his hand in the boxes and drew the slips with the jurors\u2019 names and handed the same to the assistant clerk, who noted the names down on a piece of paper and returned the slips to the deputy-sheriff, who replaced them in the compartments of the -boxes provided for the slips containing the names of the -drawn jurors. The statute (General Statutes, \u00a7 660, as amended by the Public Acts of 1905, p. 409, Chap. 212) prescribes that the clerk, who is an appointee and sworn officer-of -the-court, shall publicly, and in the presence of a judge of a court and the.sheriff of the county, or one of his deputies, draw the names of the jurors from the boxes. It is thus one of the sworn duties of the clerk, and is not to be delegated by him to another. The law provides for an assistant \u25a0 clerk, appointed and sworn in the same manner as the clerk and with the same duties. He, in case of the absence or inability of the clerk, is himself the clerk, and can, without delegation by the clerk, draw the jurors under the authority of the statute. But the duties of the sheriff and his deputies are different. If they draw the jurors, they do an act which is not imposed Upon them by law and'to the faithful performance of which they-are not bound by oath or bond. The clerk could as well delegate his duties to any bystander as to one of these. The Taw provides, carefully, the-way in which the jurors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>names shall be selected from the various towns, and the way in which they shall be placed in the various boxes, so that, if fairly drawn, it cannot be known what name will be selected. It provides that the boxes shall be kept by the clerk in his own custody. In providing that he shall draw the jurors from the boxes thus carefully guarded, it intends that he shall do so by his own hand. It is mandatory. The jury drawn by the deputy-sheriff was an illegal panel, and the challenge to the array was improperly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The State claims that, if the jury were not properly drawn, the irregularity was one in summoning the jury, and falls within the provisions of \u00a7 664 of the General Statutes. That section provides that \u201c no verdict shall be set aside on account of any irregularity in summoning the- jury.\u201d The statute applies to cases where, without taking exception to the panel or members of it as improperly summoned, a party proceeds to trial, and, after verdict, seeks to have it set aside. It does not apply to a case like this, which is not an attempt to set the verdict aside, but is an appeal from the ruling of the court disallowing a' challenge duly taken to an illegal panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">It becomes unnecessary to inquire whether the challenge should also have been allowed upon the second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
