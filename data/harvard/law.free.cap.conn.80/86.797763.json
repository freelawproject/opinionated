The assignment is clearly inadequate to raise the point, urged by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that payments made upon a disputed claim within six years before the bringing of the action would not suspend the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The second assignment raises no question for consideration, because the record does not show that any evidence of an accord and satisfaction was offered upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The third assignment of error does not comply with \u00a7 802 of the General Statutes, which requires that the precise error claimed shall be specifically stated in the reason of appeal. A mere general statement, as that the court erred in charging as it did, or in refusing to charge as requested, where, as in this case, there were numerous requests covering a number of different subjects, is insufficient. This court has repeatedly refused to consider claimed errors which were attempted to be raised by such general assignments of errors. <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Troup, </em>60 Conn. 485, 490, 28 Atl. 157; <em>New England Merchandise Co. </em>v. <em>Miner, </em>76 Conn. 674, 675, 58 Atl. 4; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Waterbury Savings Bank, </em>77 Conn. 295, 299, 59 Atl. <em>37; McAllin </em>v. <em>McAllin, </em>77 Conn. 398, 401, 59 Atl. <em>413; Farrell </em>v. <em>Eastern Machinery Co., </em>77 Conn. 484, 493, 59 Atl. 611.
