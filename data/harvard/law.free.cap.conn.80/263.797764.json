October, 1906, between the parties, Simons then being in possession- as- the Trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Company\u2019s tenant, whereby it was agreed that Simons should continue to occupy said premises until March 1st, 1907, at a monthly rent of $110, and after that date he should continue to occupy said premises and store-house and barn in the rear, for the monthly rental of $133.33, until June 1st, 1910, with the proviso that in case the premises should be wanted for occupancy by the Trust Company for its own purposes during said term, Simons was to be given two months\u2019 notice.

During his argument counsel for Simons asked the court to instruct the jury (1) that said letters, taken in connection with his client\u2019s verbal acceptance thereof made to the landlord\u2019s agent, constituted a lease of said premises until June, 1910 ; (2) \u201c that in order to constitute an agreement relative to real estate under the statute of frauds, it was not necessary that there should be one memorandum containing all the terms of said agreement, but that the jury was at liberty to find said agreement from separate letters containing different propositions and their verbal acceptance thereof, provided that, by combining said letters, said agreement could be made up; \u201d (3) \u201c that if the jury should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>find, from; said letters? and the- acceptance of the terms therein contained by Simons that there was- an! agreement for the leasing of said property, that the execution of a formal lease, was not- necessary to- entitle him to- the use and occupancy of said premises- so long as he was in possession thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">The court did not- eharge as-thus requested. This-action of the court was assigned as error, as was also its instructions- as- to the burden of proof, and certain rulings as to the order in which; certain testimony offered by the Trust Company was admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-7\">It was not claimed by Simons that the summary process proceedings against him were not- properly pursued if the terms, of the original letting had not been superseded by-others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-8\">Other facts recited in the bill of- exceptions are unnecessary to- an understanding of the conclusions- reached-.,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-9\"><em>Milton </em>Baohameh, for the appellant (plaintiff)..</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-10\"><em>John R.

Trust Company, sought to-defeat the latter\u2019s recovery of possession of the leased premises, by imposing upon it the obligations of a lease for an unexpired terms of years, given, to Simons during his tenancy under a. prior letting, which prior letting- was- the only one which the Trust Company recognized. Such a long term lease,, or agreement therefor, made in October,-1906-, he set up in his answer^ and attempted, to establish by evidence. The evidence submitted rested entirely- in parol, excepting only three letters sent by the. Trust Company to Simons. Whether these letters be- read independently or construed together, there can be found in them no statement of the term, of the letting proposed or referred to, and no sugges<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tion of a term extending beyond March 1st, 1907. If, therefore, it be conceded that they have reference to- a transaction had or consummated at the time stated, nothing can be learned from them which supports the contention of Simons, and he is driven to parol evidence to supply the omission in the writings of a sufficient statement of the all-important matter of length of term. The requirements of the statute of frauds were therefore not satisfied. <em>Nichols </em>v. Johnson, 10 Conn. 192, 198; <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>76 Conn. 229, 233, 56 Atl. 562. It is immaterial that Simons set up the alleged long term lease by way of defense and not as the foundation of an action. A contract upon which the legislature says that no action may be maintained cannot be used to defeat a demand otherwise legal and just. <em>Comes </em>v. <em>Damson, </em>16 Conn. 246, 251; <em>King </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>5 Gray (Mass.) 41; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>181 Mass. 122, 63 N. E. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">It is true that there is a recognized right in courts of equity to relax the strict application of the statute for the prevention of fraud. It is also generally held that part performance of an oral agreement may under proper conditions justify such relaxation. But the limits of this equitable power have been defined with care and precision. <em>Andrew </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>63 Conn. 109, 119, 26 Atl. 715; <em>Van Epps </em>v. <em>Redfield, </em>69 Conn. 104, 109, 36 Atl. <em>1011; Verzie</em>r v. <em>Convard, </em>75 Conn. 1, 6, 52 Atl. 255. The present case was one before a tribunal having no equity jurisdiction, and it presented none of the conditions which are recognized as justifying equitable relaxation. Simons was in possession as the Trust Company\u2019s tenant when the alleged new letting was agreed upon, and no subsequent conduct of either of the parties appears which in any way suggests a new arrangement. <em>Eaton </em>v. Whitaker, 18 Conn. 222, 230; <em>Andrew </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>63 Conn. 109, 122, 26 Atl. 715; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>63 Conn. 530, 539, 29 Atl. 15; <em>Van Epps </em>v. Bedfield. 69 Conn. 104, 109, 36 Atl. 1011; <em>Verzier </em>v. <em>Qonvard, </em>75 Conn. 1, 7, 52 Atl. 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Such being the case, the questions presented by the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>peal are purely academic. Whether the court\u2019s failure to charge as requested, or its charge and rulings, were or were not justified in law, the plaintiff in error could not have been harmed thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
