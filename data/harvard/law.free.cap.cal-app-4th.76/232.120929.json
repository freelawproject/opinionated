J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asb\">A jury convicted defendant Paul O. Chong of crimes relating to his participation in an insurance fraud scheme in which luxury cars were purchased in the United States, shipped to Hong Kong for sale in China, and then reported stolen here to collect insurance proceeds. Defendant was granted probation on the condition, among others, that he serve a period of confinement in the county jail. On appeal, he raises a variety of contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In the published portion of this opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court committed prejudicial error by repeatedly admonishing defense counsel, Maureen Kallins, in the presence of the jury. Defendant does not try to justify Kallins\u2019s actions which led to the admonitions. Instead, he argues the \u201ctrial judge committed misconduct by rendering undiluted accusations and condemnations in the jury\u2019s presence\u201d instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u201csimply excusing the jury when [the court] felt the necessity of admonishing or citing [Kallins\u2019s] conduct . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As we shall explain, due to the many instances of unprofessional conduct in which Kallins made disparaging comments to the court, violated court rulings, and repeatedly interrupted the court and witnesses, it was appropriate for the court to immediately admonish Kallins in public rather than continuously disrupt the trial by excusing the jurors and admonishing her outside their presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In the unpublished parts of this opinion, we find no merit in defendant\u2019s remaining contentions. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Facts and Procedure<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Citing 10 instances of allegedly \u201chostile comments\u201d that the trial court made to defense counsel, Maureen Kallins, in the jury\u2019s presence, defendant claims the comments constituted judicial misconduct which interfered with his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">Our review of the record reveals the 10 incidents involved the court responding to Kallins\u2019s disrespectful attitude toward the judge or opposing counsel, her disobedience to court rulings, her inappropriate comments in front of the jury, and her repeated interruptions of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">The record further shows these incidents were representative of Kallins\u2019s unprofessional conduct throughout the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">For example, at one point outside the presence of the jury, Kallins accused the trial judge of being intellectually dishonest. This comment occurred during the following exchange after Kallins interrupted the court\u2019s explanation of the factual basis for its ruling permitting a copy of a business record to be introduced in evidence. \u201cThe Court:\u2014you\u2019re interrupting. Don\u2019t do that, please. [1\u00a1] Ms. Kallins: You\u2019re just making up facts. There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>testimony. [IQ The Court: Ms. Kallins, Ms. Kallins, don\u2019t interrupt, please. That was the way I recall the testimony. HQ Is that the way you recall the testimony, Mr. Hengel [the prosecutor]? HQ [The Prosecutor]: Yes, your Honor. HO Ms. Kallins: How convenient. HO The Court: Ms. Kallins, those types of comments are\u2014are rude and uncalled for. And I really appreciate it if you would desist. I realize there\u2019s no jury here. But that type of\u2014you must realize that that type of conduct is uncalled for. HQ Ms. Kallins: And you must realize that intellectual dishonesty is appalling to me. . . . And to hear the Court paraphrasing the testimony in a way that is less than complete, and is a complete aberration of what was testified to. . . . [1Q The Court: All right. We\u2019re not\u2014I\u2019m just telling you please try and maintain some modicum of civility here. [IQ Ms. Kallins: Well, I would\u2014 [1Q The Court: I would appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Although Kallins responded that she wanted to be civil, she again accused the judge of being dishonest. When Kallins explained why she thought the evidence did not support the judge\u2019s factual finding, the following exchange occurred: \u201cThe Court: All right. I appreciate ... the fact that you\u2019re trying to assist the Court. HQ I would also . . . appreciate [it] if you would just abide by the rules of decorum, . . . without which [we] just can\u2019t function. [10 The classic example is, as I explained to the jury from the first day . . . is that the job of the court reporter is to try and write down everything that\u2019s said. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re not to interrupt. And you\u2014yet you continue to do that in front of the jury, which has been very embarrassing to the Court. [10 I [would] appreciate it if you would desist from that type of conduct in front of the jury. HO Ms. Kallins: Are you\u2014are you done, your Honor, because I want to say something about that [whereupon Kallins complained that the prosecutor had interrupted her questioning of witnesses].\u201d Then, when the court began ruling that a copy of the original document would be admitted into evidence, Kallins again interrupted, leading to the following exchange: \u201cThe Court: Ms. Kallins, please, I was making a ruling and you interrupted me again. [IQ Ms. Kallins: But you\u2019re wrong. ... [10 The Court: HQ Ms. Kallins, Ms. Kallins, can you please just [abide] by my request\u2014 [][] Ms. Kallins: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. [10 The Court:\u2014 and not interrupt? HQ Ms. Kallins: Absolutely. I am sorry, your Honor. Excuse me. HO The Court: Somehow I do not detect that that apology is sincere, Ms. Kallins[,] [b]ased upon the tone of voice which you\u2019re using, which is very facetious and demeaning. [IQ Ms. Kallins: And I would\u2014I would join that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Kallins\u2019s derogatory comments during trial were directed at the prosecutor and witnesses as well. At one point in front of the jury, Kallins suggested, without basis, that the prosecutor had \u201ctampered\u201d with evidence. On another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>occasion, Kallins subjected a witness to a difficult and sometimes sarcastic cross-examination. After the witness, a records keeper for a shipping company, broke down and cried outside the jury\u2019s presence during a recess, Kallins accused the prosecutor of \u201cparad[ing]\u201d the crying witness down the hallway in front of jurors. In Kallins\u2019s words: \u201cIt was done intentionally, and it was clearly done with the intent to influence the jury that I was the big, bad lawyer who had impeached and made cry the sad, little keeper of the records . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Near the end of trial, outside the presence of the jury, the court ultimately cited counsel for contempt for violating court orders not to argue with the court\u2019s rulings and not to make \u201csnide remarks and asides . . . that are obviously designed to influence the jury in response to the Court\u2019s rulings.\u201d The court explained: \u201cI\u2019ve given you a chance to make any kind of . . . apology. And you not only refuse, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. [^Q And you have absolutely no insight into the error of your ways as to what is appropriate conduct and what is inappropriate conduct. You\u2019ve been boisterous and disrespectful and blatantly rude to the Court throughout this trial. [ID And the main concern that I have is not my own dignity, so to speak, it\u2019s the dignity of the Court which is at stake. RD But it\u2019s my concern . .' . that [at] some point the People are not going to get a fair trial if you keep making these asides . . . . [^D . . . Forcing the opponent to continuously object to improper questions, it\u2019s unfair and unethical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In response, Kallins stated, \u201cYour Honor, listen, I\u2019m 50 years old. I don\u2019t want to have my behavior decided like I\u2019m an eight year old. [f] You show respect for me as well.\u201d She then accused the court of being a \u201cbald-face li[ar],\u201d whereupon the court again held her in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\n<em>The Incidents of Which Defendant Complains</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Having illustrated the general nature of Kallins\u2019s attitude during trial, we turn to the 10 incidents of which defendant complains, in the order they occurred during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">1. The first was a rather innocuous exchange near the beginning of trial involving the automobile dealership\u2019s documents relating to defendant\u2019s purchase of a BMW. Because the original documents were in the possession of the United States District Court as evidence in a federal action against others involved in the insurance fraud scheme, the prosecutor sought to admit copies of the documents. When Kallins objected, the trial court held a hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence. The court concluded the copies would be admissible if a proper foundation were laid in accordance with Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Code section 1550. In the interest of judicial economy, the court allowed the prosecution to mark the documents for identification and to have the dealership\u2019s business manager testify that the exhibits were records of defendant\u2019s purchase of the BMW. To accommodate Kallins\u2019s request to examine the original documents, the prosecutor indicated that he had arranged for the United States Attorney\u2019s Office to obtain a federal court order permitting Kallins to see the originals.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">When, on cross-examination of the business manager, Kallins asked what documents had been given to the investigator that \u201cwe so far have not been able to see,\u201d the court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection that the question was \u201cirrelevant and misleading\u201d and ordered \u201cthe question be stricken.\u201d Despite the court\u2019s ruling, Kallins again asked the witness about an original document which \u201cso far the jury hasn\u2019t been able to see\u201d and noted that, \u201cfor whatever reason, that original is a carbon, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d When the prosecutor objected, the court admonished Kallins that her statement \u201cthe jury has not been able to see [the original document] is gratuitous and irrelevant. And in my opinion, it tends to inject extraneous matters into these proceedings, which we\u2019ve discussed extensively outside the presence of the jury. And as you know, the Court has been spending some time addressing that very issue. [50 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [I]t will be my decision to make as to whether . . . [the jurors must] see the originals or whether . . . the copies are [admissible] as a legal matter. ... [50 So that\u2019s the issue that\u2019s pending outside their knowledge . . . [50 . . . [and] why you shouldn\u2019t be bringing it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The following colloquy then occurred: \u201cMs. Kallins: Look, Judge, this witness testified he gave the originals to [the investigator]. [50 The Court: I don\u2019t want to argue\u2014 [50 Ms. Kallins: That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. [50 The Court: \u2014Ms. Kallins. [50 Ms. Kallins: I\u2019m not arguing. [50 The Court: Yes, you are. I just sustained the [objection]. [50 Ask your next question. [50 Ms. Kallins: Okay. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s absolutely fine. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">2. When Kallins later disregarded the court\u2019s direction to \u201cnot argue with the Court in front of the jury\u201d and demanded that the court explain a ruling, the following exchange occurred: \u201cThe Court: . . . Ms. Kallins, it\u2019s not your position to interrogate me in front of the jury. [50 Ms. Kallins: Well, I don\u2019t mean to interrogate you, your Honor. [50 The Court: Well, don\u2019t do it. [50 Ms. Kallins: Well\u2014 [50 The Court: Listen to me, I\u2019m making a ruling. You do not argue with the Court in front of the jury. You know that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">3. Kallins objected to the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to use an overhead projector to show to the jury a document which had been marked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>identification but not yet received in evidence. Overruling the objection, the court explained that, based upon its earlier discussion with counsel, it was satisfied the document ultimately would be admitted and that, if the court was wrong, Kallins could move for a mistrial. Kallins stated: \u201cSo in other words, you can put anything you want on the [overhead projector] and later you ask to admit it, is that the ruling?\u201d The court replied: \u201cNow, Ms. Kallins, you\u2019re being factitious [we assume the court meant facetious or the court reporter misreported the comment].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">4. When the prosecutor objected to the lack of foundation for introduction of a defense exhibit, Kallins stated: \u201cMaybe [the prosecutor] will stipulate that [the exhibit] was sent to me as 122 in discovery . . . and this can be entered into evidence so the jury can take a look at it at this time.\u201d The prosecutor again objected, and the following exchange occurred: \u201cThe Court: Remember, Ms. Kallins, we [had an] agreement before court that we weren\u2019t supposed to ask each other about stipulations in front of the jury[.] HD Do you remember that? HD Ms. Kallins: Yes, your Honor, I remember a lot of what we talked about before the Court, but this was given to me in discovery. I don\u2019t see why the jury shouldn\u2019t be able to see it\u2014wait a minute, your Honor. [ID The Court: Wait. This is an agreement that you agreed to\u2014 [ID Ms. Kallins: Right. [ID The Court: \u2014that neither side would ask for a stipulation in front of the jury. So let\u2019s try to abide by the agreement that we\u2019ve made. HD ... Q (By Ms. Kallins) This is Defense B, without talking about what\u2019s on it, because we know it\u2019s not in evidence because it seems like my things can\u2019t come into evidence. HD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HD The Court: Stop for just a second. Ms. Kallins, please do not make gratuitous comments such as you just did\u2014 HD Ms. Kallins: I\u2019m not. HD The Court: \u2014that some of my things can\u2019t come [in]. HD Ms. Kallins: None of my things. It\u2019s not some, it\u2019s none. [HO The Court: Would you please listen to what I\u2019m telling you? [ID Ms. Kallins: Yes. [HO The Court: When the Court admonishes you to do something, it is your job, as an officer of the Court, to follow that admonition. HQ Ms. Kallins: Okay. Now\u2014 [HQ The Court: And not persist in defiance of the Court\u2019s ruling. [10 Ms. Kallins: I am. [HO The Court: So ask the next question. [HD Ms. Kallins: I am. HQ The Court: Abide by the rulings. When the jury leaves, you can put your objections more particularly on the record\u2014 HD Ms. Kallins: Thank you. [HO The Court: \u2014in as much detail as you [would] like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">5. Testimony was received from the export documentation supervisor for the shipping company which transported defendant\u2019s BMW to Hong Kong. She traveled from Southern California to appear as a prosecution witness. Although the witness had a return flight that evening, Kallins asked to continue cross-examination the following morning because she needed time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>to compare the original documents with the copies she had received from the prosecution. Noting \u201cwe were I suppose hoping that this witness could be allowed to go home,\u201d the court asked Kallins if it was \u201cfeasible\u201d for her to review the documents and then cross-examine the witness before the court recessed for the evening. When Kallins replied, \u201cNo. I have to look through the documents. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the court told the witness the district attorney\u2019s office had a \u201cvictim witness unit\u201d that would assist her in making new flight arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">During cross-examination the following day, Kallins asked the witness whether, if the United States Customs had validated a shipping document, the company was required to keep a copy of the validation. When the witness answered, \u201cNot necessarily, no,\u201d Kallins retorted, \u201cSo Customs is sort of irrelevant to you?\u201d The court sustained an objection the question was argumentative, but Kallins persisted by asking: \u201cWell, is Customs irrelevant to the process?\u201d Again, the prosecutor objected. As the court began to comment on the objection, Kallins repeatedly interrupted. After asking Kallins to \u201c[p]lease eliminate the asides when the Court makes a ruling,\u201d the judge asked Kallins to explain the relevance of the question. The following exchange then occurred. \u201cMs. Kallins: Well, I\u2019ll pass. HQ The Court: I don\u2019t appreciate the [facetious] remark on your part. HQ Ms. Kallins: Well, I didn\u2019t appreciate the Court\u2019s comments on my questioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">6. The agent from whom defendant purchased an insurance policy for the BMW and the company\u2019s claims representative who authorized payment after defendant reported the car stolen both acknowledged they had not seen the BMW before payment on the claim was made. During cross-examination of the claims representative, Kallins asked, \u201cunder what circumstances [does an insurer pay a claim without having seen the car]?\u201d The prosecutor objected that the question was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">When the court asked Kallins to explain the relevance, the following occurred: \u201cMs. Kallins: Well, your Honor, this witness is from the insurance company. You\u2019re gonna tell me you\u2019re going to put my client in prison for insurance fraud, you\u2019re not going to have the insurance company explain how they paid a claim on something they never saw? HQ The Court: Ms. Kallins\u2014Ms. Kallins\u2014 HQ [The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, I have to object. HQ At this point, there\u2019s been no contention that her client is going to prison . . . [1Q or anything of that nature. HQ The Court: Miss Kallins, that is really a\u2014 [IQ Ms. Kallins: Oh, but\u2014 HQ The Court: \u2014a situation\u2014will you let me finish, please, of gross misconduct on your part. HQ Ms. Kallins: But saying that my client\u2019s not going to prison is not gross misconduct on [the prosecutor\u2019s] part? HQ The Court: Will you quit interrupting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>please? HQ Ms. Kallins: Excuse me. HQ The Court: I am going to cite you for misconduct for that comment. HQ I explained to the [j]ury when they took their oath not to consider penalty or punishment, each one of them. And you\u2019re attempting to interject that and have them violate the very oath that they took. HQ Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time I do want to admonish you once again that statements of [counsel] are not evidence, and they are not to be considered by you as evidence. HQ And I again want to remind you of the law, which I\u2019ve already read to you. The question of penalty or punishment [is] solely for the Court to decide, and [is] not relevant to your areas of inquiry in this matter. . . . HQ I am going to have that stricken from the record, [Ms. Kallins\u2019s] comment about prison and\u2014 as well as [the prosecutor\u2019s] comment and reply. HQ Ms. Kallins: Thank you. [1Q The Court: Please stick to the issues, Ms. Kallins. HQ Ms. Kallins . . . I sincerely think I am sticking to the issues. HQ The Court: Not when you interject that type of gross prejudice into the\u2014 HQ Ms. Kallins: Well, I think it\u2019s very difficult to\u2014to\u2014to work in an atmosphere where everything is considered not an issue by the Court. HQ So I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m really trying to stick to the issues, if I could. Only I\u2019m just trying\u2014having trouble seeing what they are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">7. Later, during the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination of the claims representative, Kallins interjected a comment suggesting the prosecutor had \u201ctampered with the evidence^]\u201d The court responded: \u201cWell now, Ms. Kallins, that is [an] absolutely improper comment to make, and I\u2019m going to cite you for misconduct again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">8. During cross-examination of a participant in the insurance fraud scheme who testified against defendant, Kallins apparently stood close to the witness. The following exchange occurred: \u201c[The Prosecutor]: I request that Counsel distance herself from the witness, please. HQ Ms. Kallins: Gladly. [IQ The Court: . . . Ms. Kallins your comment will be stricken from the record. You\u2019re admonished to cease and desist from these aside comments. HQ Normally speaking, although I haven\u2019t been enforcing it, the attorneys ask permission to approach the witness. And with this particular witness, I suggest that\u2019s the best way to proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">9. During examination of the Department of Insurance investigator, Kallins persisted in asking irrelevant and argumentative questions to which objections were sustained. After its fifth ruling on the objections, the following exchange occurred: \u201cThe Court: . . . The objection\u2019s sustained to\u2014 the question you asked is irrelevant. Move on. [IQ Ms. Kallins: Oh, okay. All right. I\u2019m moving on. All right. Don\u2019t get upset or annoyed. HQ The Court: All right. Miss Kallins\u2014 HQ Ms. Kallins: Yes, your Honor. HQ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The Court: \u2014no further asides like that. Don\u2019t tell the Court what attitudes to take. You be more concerned about your own behavior in this case. [1Q Ms. Kallins: Yes, your Honor. [10 The Court: Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? [10 Ms. Kallins: Yes, your Honor. But you seem to be so upset about the ruling. [1Q The Court: I\u2019m not upset. [10 Ms. Kallins: Okay. [10 The Court: I\u2019m just telling you if you persist in this demeanor, I\u2019m going to excuse the jury. [10 Ms. Kallins: Well\u2014 [10 The Court: So it\u2019s up to you. I\u2019ve tried\u2014[brief interruption by Kallins]\u2014to be as patient as I can. [10 Ms. Kallins: Yes, your Honor. [10 The Court: But you are trying the Court\u2019s patience. [10 Ms. Kallins: Yes, your Honor. [10 The Court: Now, I ask you respectfully to abide by the Court\u2019s rulings. [10 Ms. Kallins: Yes. [10 The Court: And not argue with me when I make a ruling. [10 Ms. Kallins: Yes, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">10. Near the close of trial, during a discussion concerning whether Kallins was seeking to introduce defense exhibit O into evidence, the following exchange occurred: \u201cMs. Kallins: . . . \u00cd only was offering it if \u2018N\u2019 could come in to show what a real PIERS Report looks like. [10 Now that the real PIERS Report has been eliminated, the government] will have to remark [Exhibit O] and offer it themselves. [10 Does the Court think that that\u2019s funny? [10 The Court: Pardon me? [10 Ms. Kallins: Does the Court think that\u2019s funny? I saw you laugh. [10 The Court: Ms. Kallins, once again, pursuant to the previous order, I\u2019m going to admonish you please desist from disrespectful comments to the Court. [10 Ms. Kallins: I didn\u2019t mean disrespect, your Honor. [10 The Court: Yes, you did. [10 Ms. Kallins: No, that\u2019s my analysis. [10 The Court: You\u2019ve been around long enough to know what\u2019s proper [courtroom] behavior and what is improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Defendant wisely <em>does </em>not attempt to defend Kallins\u2019s actions; in the words of his appellate attorney, defendant \u201cdoes not excuse his trial counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d He also concedes the trial court had a duty to control the proceedings. However, he believes the court committed misconduct by repeatedly admonishing Kallins in the jury\u2019s presence. According to defendant, the court could have avoided this problem by simply excusing the jury when it needed to admonish Kallins.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Kallins never requested that, if the court intended to admonish her, it do so outside the jury\u2019s presence. Nor did she ask the court to advise the jurors that the judge\u2019s comments to Kallins were not intended to imply any judgment by the court as to the merits of defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Perhaps Kallins did not make such requests because of her misguided trial tactics, which seemed to include alienating the witnesses, the prosecutor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the court, and baiting them to snap at her, thereby apparently attempting to create an impression that \u201cthe system\u201d was against the defendant. In any event, because the trial court was not asked to so admonish the jury, defendant\u2019s claim of judicial misconduct is waived. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fudge </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1075, 1108 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 321, 875 P.2d 36]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 453, 467-468 [276 Cal.Rptr. 356, 801 P.2d 1107]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 367, 411 [276 Cal.Rptr. 731, 802 P.2d 221].)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Nevertheless, because defendant contends that Kallins\u2019s failure to object and seek curative jury admonitions constituted ineffective assistance of counsel <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-689 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-694]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 425 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1]), we address the merits of his claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">As we shall explain, in light of the nature and extent of Kallins\u2019s insolent and contemptuous conduct, the trial court\u2019s admonishments of Kallins in front of the jury were necessary and did not constitute misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Our legal system, indeed the social compact of a civilized society, is predicated upon respect for, and adherence to, the rule of law. And \u201cethical considerations can no more be excluded from the administration of justice, which is the end and purpose of all civil laws, than one can exclude the vital air from his room and live.\u201d (Dillon, The Laws and Jurisprudence of England and America, Lecture I (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1894), p. 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In other words, it is vital to the integrity of our adversary legal process that attorneys strive to maintain the highest standards of ethics, civility, and professionalism in the practice of law. In order to instill public confidence in the legal profession and our judicial system, an attorney must be an example of lawfulness, not lawlessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Accordingly, an attorney, \u201chowever zealous in his Ghent\u2019s behalf, has, as an officer of the court, a paramount obligation to the due and orderly administration of justice . . . .\u201d <em>(Chula </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 24, 39 [240 P.2d 398].) An attorney must not willfully disobey a court\u2019s order and must maintain a respectful attitude toward the court. <em>(Ibid.; </em>Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6068, 6103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">When, during the course of trial, an attorney violates his or her obligations as an officer of the court, the judge may control the proceedings and protect the integrity of the court and the judicial process by reprimanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>attorney. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fudge, supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1108; <em>DeGeorge </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 305, 312 [114 Cal.Rptr. 860].)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Because \u201cevents happen rapidly during the course of a trial . . . it is not always feasible to excuse the jury in order that counsel may be reprimanded\u201d; and, \u201cwhen counsel defies the authority of the court in the presence of the jury, it is sometimes necessary to reprimand counsel in the presence of the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dickenson </em>(1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 127, 140 [26 Cal.Rptr. 601].)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In fact, to allow an attorney to engage in unprofessional conduct before the jury without a prompt and strong response from the court undermines the judicial process. If, without rebuke, an attorney does not show proper respect for the judge and the proceedings, how can a juror be expected to do so? If an attorney is permitted to flout a court\u2019s ruling, how can a juror be expected to adhere to the rule of law as instructed by the court?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">By mocking the court\u2019s authority, an attorney in effect sends a message to the jurors that they, too, may disregard the court\u2019s directives and ignore its authority. This type of attorney misconduct must be dealt with in the jury\u2019s presence in order to dispel any misperception regarding the credence that jurors must give the court\u2019s instructions. Furthermore, when an attorney engages in repetitious misconduct, it is too disruptive to the proceedings to repeatedly excuse the jury to admonish counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">For these reasons, the court may act swiftly and strongly in the presence of the jury to admonish an attorney if necessary to preserve the integrity of the judicial process. The court commits misconduct only \u201cif it persistently makes discourteous and disparaging remarks to defense counsel so as to discredit the defense or create the impression [that the court] is allying itself with the prosecution.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 353 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fudge, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 1107; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 143-144 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561].)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Viewed singularly or collectively, the judge\u2019s comments in this case did not constitute judicial misconduct because they were appropriate responses to Kallins\u2019s inappropriate actions and remarks (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Fatone </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 1164, 1170-1181 [211 Cal.Rptr. 288]), and because the comments did not discredit the defense theory or create an impression that the court was allying itself with the prosecution. Moreover, the jury was instructed in accordance with CALJIC No. 17.30 that the court had not intended by anything it had said or done to intimate or suggest what the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>should find to be the facts on any questions submitted and, if the court had said or done anything that would seem to so indicate, the jury was instructed to disregard it and form its own opinion. We presume the jury followed these instructions and did not penalize defendant because of the court\u2019s response to Kallins\u2019s egregious misconduct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harbolt </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 140, 158 [253 Cal.Rptr. 390]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dickenson, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.2d at pp. 138-139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Given the numerous occasions in which Kallins challenged the court\u2019s authority in the presence of the jury, made disparaging comments toward the court, opposing counsel and a witness, and violated court rulings, it would have been unreasonable for the court to continuously disrupt the trial and excuse the jury in order to admonish Kallins in private.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In a fit of diatribe after the court held Kallins in contempt outside the presence of the jury and directed her to stop disobeying court orders and acting in a rude and disrespectful manner, Kallins blurted out: \u201cYou show respect for me as well. I\u2019ve shown unbelievable respect for this Court in the fashion of [the] most unfair trial I\u2019ve ever experienced in 22 years of practicing law. [f] This place is unbelievable. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Kallins is flatly wrong in her assessment of the fairness of the trial. Our review of the record reveals that the trial court did not commit any prejudicial error in its rulings and that it was remarkably courteous and restrained when dealing with Kallins\u2019s gross misconduct, which created what could be described as a \u201ctrial from hell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Kallins also is flatly wrong in the self-assessment of her conduct. In our collective 97 years in the legal profession, we have seldom seen such unprofessional, offensive and contemptuous conduct by an attorney in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The trial judge acted appropriately and commendably in attempting to restrain an attorney who was out of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">II-VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Blease, J., and Morrison, J., concurred</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 23, 2000.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-15\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 232.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 232.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
