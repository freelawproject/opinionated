On appeal, Banda argues the district court failed to properly consider his age and infirmities at sentencing, as his sentence essentially equates to life without parole. After review, we affirm Banda\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Banda does not meet his burden of demonstrating his sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court explicitly mentioned its consideration of Banda\u2019s age, along with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the statements of the parties, and the PSI. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d). Further, the weight to be given to Banda\u2019s age was within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). Finally, the court\u2019s sentence of 235 months represented the lowest end of the applicable guideline range, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787-88. Banda was caught with nearly 2 pounds of methamphetamine; his 235-month sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">.
