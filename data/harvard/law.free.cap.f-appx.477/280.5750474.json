We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The fine must be paid in $50 monthly installments beginning 60 days after his release from prison. According to Morin, the Government failed to show that he has the ability to pay a fine. The district court implicitly found that, while Morin has no present ability to pay, he has the future earning capacity to satisfy the fine. Defense counsel admitted that there is no reason why Morin cannot work, and the presentence report (PSR) described him as a 21-year-old United States citizen who lives with his parents and has no physical impediments, health problems, substance abuse issues, or dependents. The finding on Morin\u2019s ability to pay is plausible in light of the record as a whole and is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>1 F.3d 341, 342 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Next Morin contends that the district court incorrectly assumed that he would become able to pay the fine so long as he was motivated to get a job. The burden was on Morin to prove his inability to pay, and he made \u201cno showing that [he would] be unemployable after his prison term.\u201d <em>United States v. Matovsky, </em>935 F.2d 719, 723 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">Morin also contends that the district court failed to make, required findings on his ability to pay. However, because the PSR did not recommend against imposing a fine, the district court was not required to make express findings on Morin\u2019s ability to pay. <em>See United States v. Voda, </em>994 F.2d 149, 155 n. 14 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Matovsky, </em>935 F.2d at 722. Morin fails to show error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">According to Morin, the district court relied on improper factors to determine the amount of the fine, including the court\u2019s perception that he needed a shock or an incentive to get a job because it was time for him to grow up. The district court clearly indicated that the purpose of the sentence, including the fine, was to deter Morin from committing future crimes. The need for deterrence was a proper consideration in determining the amount of the fine. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d)(l). While the district court discussed its opinion that Morin needed to get a job and \u201cgrow up,\u201d it was in the context of encouraging him to avoid trouble in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-18\">Morin also notes that he has no prior convictions and contends the $1,000 fine was not required to punish him, deter him, or promote respect for the law. The district court considered Morin\u2019s history and characteristics and the need for deterrence. Morin\u2019s disagreement with the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>trict court\u2019s weighing of the sentencing factors does not show that the court committed error, plain or otherwise, in imposing the below-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d 370, 375-76 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 3006, 180 L.Ed.2d 832 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Citing a Tenth Circuit case, Morin further contends that the district court was required to indicate th\u00e1t it considered all of the relevant factors prior to imposing the f\u00edne. We do not require such an indication on the record. <em>See Matovsky, </em>935 F.2d at 722. Morin also cites \u00a7 5E1.2(d)(3) for the proposition that \u201cthe district court should have considered alternative punishments\u201d because of his family\u2019s \u201cdire economic situation.\u201d Section 5E1.2(d)(3) states that the court \u201cshall consider ... the burden that the f\u00edne places on the defendant and his dependents relative to alternative punishments.\u201d Morin has no dependents, and the district court expressly found that the burden on him would not be too great. He also contends that the district court improperly considered his employment history in imposing the fine, citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.5 (p.s.). The policy statement provides that an employment record \u201cis not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted.\u201d \u00a7 5H1.5 (p.s.). By its own wording, it does not apply here because Morin\u2019s fine was not the result of a departure. <em>See id. </em>We find no plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009),</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Finally, for the first time in his reply brief, Morin asserts that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court imposed the fine at the end of the sentencing hearing without first asking the parties for their positions. We will not consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>50 F.3d 1335, 1340 n. 7 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
