For substantially the same reasons provided by the District Court, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-25\">Millbrook filed a complaint pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-2680, naming as defendant the United States of America. According to the complaint, Mill brook was subjected to sexual assault while housed in the Special Management Unit (SMU) at USP-Lewisburg on or about March 5, 2010. On that date, Mill brook alleged that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>taken to the basement of the SMU and forced to perform oral sex on Correctional Officer Pealer while Correctional Officer Edinger held his neck and Correctional Officer Gimberling stood watch by the door. He also claimed that he was verbally assaulted during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment, which the District Court granted. According to the defendant, Millbrook was involved in an altercation with his cell mate on the morning of March 4, 2010. As a result, both prisoners were placed in restraints and removed from their cell. They were then transferred to separate holding cells pending injury assessment and photographs. Millbrook claims that he was assaulted the next day by correctional staff. Following an internal investigation, which included a medical assessment, Millbrook\u2019s claim was found to be unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">After reviewing Millbrook\u2019s response to defendant\u2019s motion, the District Court concluded that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment because Millbrook\u2019s FTCA claim is precluded by <em>Pooler v. United States, </em>787 F.2d 868, 872 (3d Cir.1986). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Kaucher v. County of Bucks, </em>455 F.3d 418, 422 (3d Cir.2006). The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment will be affirmed if the record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). An issue is material if \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We may summarily affirm if Millbrook\u2019s appeal presents' no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">Millbrook contends that the defendant is hable under the FTCA for the alleged assault on March 5, 2010. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h), the United States is generally not liable for intentional torts of its employees except for certain intentional torts committed by investigative or law enforcement officers. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680. We have limited claims that arise under \u00a7 2680(h) to cases in which an intentional tort is committed by a law enforcement or investigative officer while executing a search, seizing evidence, or making arrests for violations of federal law. <em>Pooler, </em>787 F.2d at 872. Defendant argued that because the alleged assault did not arise out of conduct during an arrest, search, or seizure, Millbrook\u2019s tort claim is not cognizable.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-12\">Defendant did not dispute that correctional officers may be deemed law enforcement officers for purposes of the FTCA. Assuming arguendo that they are, to the extent that Mill brook alleges that handcuffing and taking him to the basement of the SMU amounts to an unconstitutional seizure, we agree with the District Court that <em>Pooler </em>limits the term \u201cseizure\u201d to the seizure of evidence. <em>Id. </em>Further, Mill-brook did not allege that the alleged conduct occurred in the course of an arrest for a violation of federal law, or during the course of a search. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). Thus, we agree with the District Court that while the alleged conduct is troubling, Millbrook has not shown that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>he is entitled to relief under the FTCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">As Millbrook\u2019s appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. Mill-brook\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-14\">. We also agree with the District Court that although Millbrook raises assertions of negligent behavior on the part of the correctional officers, it is clear that the alleged actions were intentional. Indeed, Millbrook stated in his complaint that he was \"sexually assaulted and battered maliciously with evil intent by officers Pealer, Edinger and Gimberling.\u201d <em>See </em>Complaint at 5. Therefore, we agree that he did not state a' negligence claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
