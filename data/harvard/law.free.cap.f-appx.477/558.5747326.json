No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Figueroa co-owned property that was subject to a mortgage held by Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\u201cMERS\u201d). After Figueroa failed to make his mortgage payments, his mortgage went into default; and IndyMac Federal Bank FSB (\u201cIndyMac\u201d) filed a foreclosure action in state court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Figueroa failed to respond to the complaint. The state court granted IndyMac\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered a judgment of foreclosure. Figueroa then filed two motions to vacate the judgment in which he raised various fraud claims and stated that he intended to file a counterclaim for damages under the federal RICO statute. The state court denied the motions, and Figueroa\u2019s property was sold at auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Three months after the auction, Figueroa initiated this federal lawsuit. His third amended complaint raised 8 counts of RICO violations against 27 defendants, including MERS\u2019s parent company, MERS\u2019s law firm, and MERS\u2019s shareholders (\u201cDefendants\u201d). Figueroa contended that, but for Defendants\u2019 fraudulent scheme, his property would not have been foreclosed upon and asserted that he was injured by Defendants\u2019 acts because \u201che lost his one-half interest in his property and home.\u201d Figueroa sought damages equal to three times the value of his lost property interest as determined by the amount alleged in IndyMac\u2019s foreclosure complaint. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 consolidated motion to dismiss, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Figueroa\u2019s claims pursuant to the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that it \u2014 in the light of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine \u2014 lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a plaintiffs claim. <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precludes federal courts \u2014 other than the United States Supreme Court\u2014 from reviewing final judgments of state courts. <em>Id. </em>(explaining that the doctrine applies to federal claims previously raised and ruled on by a state court and to those claims \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court\u2019s judgment). <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>bars lower federal court jurisdiction in \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1261 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">We conclude, as did the district court, that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>criteria are satisfied. Figueroa was a state-court loser in his state court foreclosure proceeding. The state court judgment formed the basis of or was intertwined with the injury complained of in Figueroa\u2019s instant compliant: that \u201che lost his one-half interest in his property and home\u201d because of an improper foreclosure proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state court proceedings had ended before Figueroa instituted the present federal lawsuit in the district court. Figueroa also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>sought, in effect, to have the district court \u201creview and reject\u201d the state court proceedings because his federal RICO claims could only succeed if the state court\u2019s foreclosure judgment was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Figueroa argues that the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine is inapplicable because he lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate his federal RICO claims in state court. <em>See id. </em>at 1260 (stating that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply \u201cwhere a party did not have a \u2018reasonable opportunity to raise his federal claim in state proceedings\u2019 \u201d). We disagree. Federal RICO claims may be raised in Florida courts. <em>See, e.g., TransPetrol, Ltd. v. Radulovic, </em>764 So.2d 878 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000). In his motions to vacate, Figueroa raised many of the same fraud claims that now underlie his federal RICO claims and asserted that he intended to file a counterclaim for damages under the federal RICO statute. Although Figueroa failed to litigate his RICO claims in state court, he had a reasonable opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\">.
