For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The record shows that Matthews and other individuals executed a scheme to defraud several banks by opening accounts, depositing stolen checks into those accounts, and then withdrawing the funds. Matthews participated in this enterprise by depositing numerous stolen checks into various bank accounts opened by her accomplices. She did so on multiple occasions over a period of several months, but withdrew only a fraction of the stolen money herself. The total amount of intended loss from Matthews\u2019s activities was calculated at approximately $475,000, while the amount of actual loss suffered by the banks reached nearly $330,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">In compiling the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the probation officer described Matthews\u2019s personal history and noted that she had provided several conflicting or misleading statements to various officers after her arrest. Specifically, she gave inconsistent statements regarding her place of birth, whether her parents were deceased, how many siblings she had, where she had lived growing up, whether she had traveled outside the United States, and whether she had been married. The probation officer also outlined Matthews\u2019s criminal history, which showed that she had been convicted on seven different occasions for various crimes, including financial transaction fraud, theft, burglary, and possession of illegal drugs with intent to distribute. With regard to several of these crimes, Matthews had used false names or violated her probation. Moreover, Matthews had a charge pending for identity fraud, and two charges pending for drug offenses for which she had failed to appear in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">In calculating Matthews\u2019s applicable guideline range, the probation officer assigned her a base offense level of 7, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(a)(1), and added 14 levels under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H) because the amount of intended loss exceeded $400,000. Due to Matthews\u2019s prior drug convictions, and because she committed the current offense while on probation, she was placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>into a criminal history category of III. Ultimately, the district court gave her a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, yielding a guideline range of 33 to 41 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court determined that Matthews\u2019s guideline range did not provide for a sufficient punishment and, following the government\u2019s recommendation, sentenced her to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court explained that financial crimes such as Matthews\u2019s were \u201cparticularly troubling\u201d because individuals who committed those crimes did so knowingly, with \u201ccareful calculation and deliberation and malice aforethought.\u201d The court also stressed that Matthews\u2019s offense involved nearly $500,000 in intended loss; that she had made inconsistent statements to pretrial and probation officers; and that she had a \u201cvery substantial\u201d criminal history. On appeal, Matthews argues that her sentence of 60 months was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-diseretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">If the district court determines that a sentence outside the guideline range is appropriate, \u201cit must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). However, we will only reverse due to a variance \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">In challenging the substantive reasonableness of her sentence, Matthews makes several specific arguments, which we address in turn. First, she contends that, by emphasizing the gravity of financial crimes in general, the district court erroneously failed to focus on her individual characteristics. However, a district court is permitted to consider the general seriousness of a statutory offense when the defendant has been convicted of that offense. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1240 (11th Cir.2006) (discussing the general negative characteristics of white collar crimes in assessing the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s sentence); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1195-99 (11th Cir.2008) (discussing the harms caused generally by child pornography in analyzing the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ableness of a sentence). Thus, we discern no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Second, Matthews argues that her guideline range already accounted for the seriousness of her offense, given that she received a 14-level enhancement based on the amount of loss exceeding $400,000. While that may be so, the district court could still consider the loss amount as a factor warranting a variance under \u00a7 3558(a). <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2010) (stating that a district court can impose a variance based on factors that it had already considered in applying a guideline enhancement), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2166, 179 L.Ed.2d 946 (2011). Moreover, besides resulting in substantial monetary loss, Matthews\u2019s offense involved repeated deposits of stolen checks over a prolonged period of time, and, as the district court noted, such conduct required \u201ccareful calculation and deliberation.\u201d The court could rightly view this as an aggravating factor in determining the length of the sentence. <em>See Martin, </em>455 F.3d at 1240 (\u201cBecause economic and fraud-based crimes are more rational, cool, and calculated than sudden crimes of passion or opportunity, these crimes are prime candidates for general deterrence.\u201d (quotation and alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Third, Matthews argues that the inconsistencies in her post-arrest statements were not made intentionally and, thus, did not warrant a sentence above the guideline range. However, given that persons generally have firm knowledge about their basic personal histories, such as where they were born or grew up, the district court could reasonably conclude that Matthews\u2019s inconsistent statements in this regard were made deliberately and not simply as a result of misunderstanding or forgetfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Fourth, Matthews contends that the district court could have accounted for her criminal history by imposing a guideline departure rather than a \u00a7 3553(a) variance. Matthews\u2019s criminal record is indeed substantial, involving seven separate convictions and several charges for which she had failed to appear in court, and this may well have warranted an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. However, the court\u2019s ability to depart upwards under the Guidelines did not preclude it from imposing an upward variance instead. <em>See Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1240 (affirming an upward variance under \u00a7 3553(a), even though the district court had discretion to apply an upward departure under the Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Finally, Matthews asserts that the district court\u2019s variance of 19 months beyond the upper end of the guideline range resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity. However, she points to no comparators \u201cwith similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). An upward variance by itself does not indicate an unwarranted sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">In sum, the district court did not commit a clear error of judgment in determining that an above-guideline, 60-month sentence was appropriate for Matthews under \u00a7 3553(a), given the seriousness of her offense, her mendacity, and, most importantly, her substantial criminal history. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 (2); <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237-41 (upholding as reasonable a 120-month sentence that significantly exceeded the guideline range of 30 to 37 months, in large part due to the defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history); <em>see also United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d (quotation omitted)). We also note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Matthews\u2019s 5-year sentence fell far below the statutory maximum of 80 years for each count. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344; <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (concluding that a sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum). Because Matthews\u2019s sentence of 60 months was substantively reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-12\">. Only some of Matthews's criminal activity constituted the offense of conviction. The rest qualified as \"relevant conduct\u201d to be considered only for sentencing purposes. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">.

Other factors to be considered in imposing the sentence include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the available sentences, the Guidelines\u2019 policy and applicable range, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
