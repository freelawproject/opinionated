As his sole argument on appeal, Serano argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and reversibly erred when it imposed the sixteen-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (Nov. 2009), based on his 2008 Texas conviction for attempted deadly conduct. We review this issue de novo. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>667 F.3d 555, 560 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">As he did in the district court, Serano argues that his conviction for attempted deadly conduct does not qualify as a crime of violence because the Texas concept of attempt is broader than the generic, contemporary meaning of attempt. He further argues that the Texas has not adopted the \u201csubstantial step\u201d test of the Model Penal Code and that Texas\u2019s approach instead provides for a more broad test.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Serano\u2019s arguments have been specifically rejected by this court in <em>Sanchez, </em>667 F.3d at 563-66. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
