The dismissal is reviewed <em>de novo. Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-20\">Singleton was convicted in 1996 in the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois for possession with intent to distribute, and conspiracy to distribute, cocaine base. His conviction was affirmed. <em>United States v. Singleton, </em>125 F.3d 1097 (7th Cir.1997). He subsequently moved to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. (The record lacks information regarding the disposition of that proceeding.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-21\">Singleton filed the \u00a7 2241 petition at issue in the Northern District of Texas, where he is currently incarcerated. He maintained, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court in Illinois had lacked jurisdiction over the charges for which he had been convicted. The district court under review <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction, concluding: Singleton sought to raise claims challenging the validity of his criminal conviction that were more properly raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion; because Singleton had been sentenced in the Southern District of Illinois, the Northern District of Texas lacked jurisdiction over Singleton\u2019s claims or to construe his \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion; and Singleton had not shown that the \u00a7 2255 remedies were inadequate or ineffective or that he had received permission from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-22\">Singleton contends that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>1996 (AEDPA) unconstitutionally suspends the writ of habeas corpus and, thus, his claim that his conviction violates the Tenth Amendment is cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. This suspension-of-the-writ contention, however, is meritless. <em>Felker v. Turpin, </em>518 U.S. 651, 663-65, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Singleton also maintains the convicting court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the section of the Controlled Substances Act under which he was convicted violates the Tenth Amendment. Singleton\u2019s lack-of-jurisdiction assertion implies the invalidity of his conviction and sentence. A \u00a7 2241 petition that challenges errors at trial or sentencing is properly construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-01 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Under \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d, however, if a prisoner can demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention\u201d, he may be permitted to pursue a claim under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>at 901. The petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u00a7 2255 relief would be ineffective or inadequate. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). A prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion, or the inability to meet the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, does not make the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000). Rather, \u201cthe savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">To establish that the \u00a7 2255 \u201csavings clause\u201d applies, Singleton relies on <em>Bond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2355, 2366-67, 180 L.Ed.2d 269 (2011). <em>Bond, </em>a direct criminal appeal, has not been found, however, to apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. Moreover, <em>Bond\u2019s </em>holding, which expressed no view on the merits of defendant\u2019s Tenth Amendment claim, <em>id. </em>at 2367, does not establish that Singleton may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. As such, Singleton cannot show that the \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
