In 2007, the district court sentenced Clayton as a career offender to 150 months\u2019 imprisonment, which included a 20% reduction based upon his substantial assistance. In his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Clayton had argued that, despite being a career offender, he was entitled to a reduction under Amendment 750 and the Fan-Sentencing Act, which was comparably less than the amended guideline range sentence in order to reflect his substantial assistance to authorities. On appeal, Clayton acknowledges that he was sentenced as a career offender, but argues for the first time that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because, in light of <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), (plurality opinion) his sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the crack guidelines that were later amended by the U.S. Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Objections or arguments that are not raised at the district court are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>478 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.2007) (reviewing a claim that there was an insufficient factual basis for a guilty plea for plain error). To prove plain error, a defendant must show: \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). If all three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to recognize the error, if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA plain error is an error that is obvious and is clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">Federal courts have the authority to consider reducing the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the court \u201cshall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time that the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). Under the second step, as a matter of discretion, the court must decide whether to retain the original sentence or to re-sentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">A career offender\u2019s base offense level is determined by using either the offense level that would ordinarily apply under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Chapters 2 and 3 or, if it results in a higher offense level, the table in \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. A \u201creduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u2018the amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>because of the operation of another guideline </em>....\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A))) (emphasis added). In <em>Moore, </em>we held that defendants who originally were sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1(b)\u2019s career-offender table were not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because their guideline ranges were not based on the drug-quantity offense levels that had been lowered by Amendment 706. <em>Id, </em>at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">If a defendant designated as a career offender commits an offense that carries a statutory maximum of 25 years or more of imprisonment and less than life imprisonment, the applicable offense level is 34. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B). Part A of Amendment 750 amended \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and reducing offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 750, Pt. A, <em>cross referencing </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 748 (2011). Amendment 750 became effective on November 1, 2011. U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court considered the question of \u201cwhether defendants who enter into plea agreements that recommend a particular sentence as a condition of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. A plurality of the Supreme Court determined that a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence may be based upon the Sentencing Guidelines, even if the defendant pleads guilty under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C). <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the plurality opinion concluded, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief may be available if the sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d a guideline range that was ultimately lowered by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>In a concurring opinion, Justice Sotomayor agreed with the plurality that the prisoner was eligible for a sentencing reduction, but held that a term of imprisonment that was imposed pursuant to a Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement is \u201cbased on\u201d the plea agreement itself, and not the Sentencing Guidelines. 564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2695 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). However, Justice Sotoma-yor\u2019s concurring opinion also determined that, when a plea agreement \u201cexpressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to establish the term of imprisonment,\u201d and the U.S. Sentencing Commission subsequently lowers that range, the term of imprisonment is \u201cbased on\u201d the range used and the defendant is eligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>(Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Because the record demonstrates that Clayton was sentenced as a career offender, we conclude that Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines does not change his offense level or his guideline range. In addition, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in not applying <em>Freeman </em>to his case because (1) both the plurality opinion and Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion in that case were limited to the context of a defendant who was sentenced pursuant to a plea agreement under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C), and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>there is no binding authority applying the reasoning of <em>Freeman </em>to the context of a career offender seeking \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Freeman\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
