Chinwoh entered a conditional guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud. Prior to the plea, Chinwoh sought to suppress all items seized in a search pursuant to a warrant of the premises of Medical Supplies of Baton Rouge (MSBR). Chinwoh argued that the evidence should be suppressed because the search was conducted pursuant to an invalid general search warrant. The district court denied the motion and found \u201cthat the warrant was not a general warrant and was sufficiently specific and particularized.\u201d In entering his plea, Chinwoh reserved his right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">When a search has been conducted in accordance with a warrant, we use a two-part test to review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Froman, </em>355 F.3d 882, 888 (5th Cir.2004). If the good-faith exception applies, no further analysis is necessary unless the case involves \u201ca \u2018novel question of law,\u2019 resolution of which is \u2018necessary to guide future action by law enforcement officers and magistrates.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Payne, </em>341 F.3d 393, 399 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Pena-Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 1120, 1129-30 (5th Cir.1997)). We review de novo whether the exception applies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">An officer\u2019s reliance on a warrant is not objectively reasonable and, therefore, he is not entitled to invoke the good-faith exception if, among other things, the warrant authorizing the officer\u2019s actions is so \u201cfacially deficient\u201d in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized that the executing officers \u201ccannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\u201d <em>United States v. Mays, </em>466 F.3d 335, 343 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>421 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir.2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Evidence should be suppressed \u201conly if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had knowledge, or may properly be charged with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 143, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Krull, </em>480 U.S. 340, 348-49, 107 S.Ct. 1160, 94 L.Ed.2d 364 (1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">Chinwoh argues that the officers executing the search could not have relied on the warrant in good faith because the warrant was so lacking in particularity that it was a \u201cgeneral\u201d warrant. In reviewing whether a search warrant was sufficiently particular, we must determine whether the warrant would permit no discretion to the executing officer in seizing evidence pursuant to the warrant. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>625 F.3d 830, 834-35 (5th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1632, 182 L.Ed.2d 232 (2012). In this case, the warrant delineated twenty-one specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>types of evidence to be seized from the business premises of MSBR. Items one through three specifically stated that the patient records and other documents be related to supplying durable medical equipment. All of the items were described as records related to MSBR, the insurers and federal programs that were the objects of the fraud, or the named defendants. Although the specific listing was comprehensive and allowed the seizure of a broad range of evidence, that specific listing did not leave anything to the discretion of the executing officers. Chinwoh has failed to show, under the precedent of this circuit, that the warrant was so lacking in specificity that the executing officers had discretion to determine which items were to be seized. <em>See Allen, </em>625 F.3d at 834-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Chinwoh also argues that the officers could not have relied on the warrant to seize patient files because those records were outside the scope of the warrant. This issue has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
