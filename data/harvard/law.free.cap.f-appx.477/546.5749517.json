No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">As an initial matter \u2014 because the timely filing of a notice of appeal is a mandatory prerequisite for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction \u2014 we must address whether Carrillo\u2019s notice of appeal was timely filed. <em>See Rinaldo v. Corbett, </em>256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). Carrillo was required to file a notice of appeal \u201cwithin 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from [was] entered.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(A). Although the district court entered an order denying Carrillo\u2019s petition on 23 July 2010, it failed to set forth its judgment in a separate document, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a). <em>See Jackson v. Crosby, </em>375 F.3d 1291, 1293 n. 5 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that Rule 58(a)(1) requires a district court to set out its judgment in a separate document when denying a petition for habeas corpus). As a result, the court\u2019s judgment was not deemed \u201centered\u201d for purposes of Rule 4(a) until 150 days later \u2014 on 20 December 2010. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App. P. 4(a)(7)(A)(ii). Because Carrillo\u2019s notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>appeal was filed before the judgment was entered, we treat it as having been filed on the date of entry. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(2). Thus, Carrillo\u2019s notice of appeal was timely and we have jurisdiction to consider his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In his section 2254 petition, Carrillo argued that the trial court erred in denying his Batson<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenge to the government\u2019s use of a peremptory strike against a male venire member, Paul Soule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response to Carrillo\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge, the trial court stated that males were not a suspect class requiring a <em>Batson-type </em>inquiry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite this error,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the prosecutor set forth neutral explanations for the strike, stating that Soule had asked why the state was not seeking the death penalty and had expressed doubt about the credibility of witnesses who were convicted felons. After some discussion about Soule\u2019s responses, the trial court granted the strike over Carrillo\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">On direct appeal, the state appellate court affirmed Carrillo\u2019s conviction. In doing so, it concluded that \u2014 \u201c[bjecause the trial court heard the state\u2019s gender-neutral explanation, allowed defense counsel to argue its position, and then granted the peremptory strike\u201d \u2014 the court \u201cimplicitly underwent a genuineness inquiry.\u201d' The court also determined that the strike was proper because the state\u2019s gender-neutral reasons were supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Carrillo raised his <em>Batson </em>claim again in his section 2254 petition, and the district court denied it. But the court granted Carrillo a certificate of appealability on \u201cwhether the state appellate court unreasonably applied federal law in (1) its determination that the trial court implicitly performed the third step under <em>Batson ... </em>and (2) its determination that no violation of <em>Batson </em>and its progeny occurred, in affirming Petitioner\u2019s conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">To obtain habeas relief, Carrillo must demonstrate that the state appellate court\u2019s ruling was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law if \u201cthe state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than th[e] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We may not grant habeas relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>based solely on our conclusion that the state court \u201capplied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1522. Instead, the state court\u2019s application of federal law \u201cmust also be unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision about whether the state court\u2019s ruling was contrary to federal law, involved an unreasonable application of federal law, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>Smith v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>572 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><em>Batson </em>requires courts to use a three-part test to analyze equal protection challenges to the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges. <em>Batson, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1723-24. First, the defendant must make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of purposeful discrimination based on a prohibited ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1723. The burden then shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a neutral explanation for the challenge. <em>Id. </em>Third, the trial court has the duty to determine whether the defendant has established purposeful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 1724. At this stage, \u201cthe defendant bears the burden of convincing the ... court that the proffered reasons are pretextual by introducing evidence of comparability.\u201d <em>Atwater v. Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 799, 807 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[T]he ultimate burden of persuasion regarding [discriminatory] motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Based on our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the state appellate court applied <em>Batson </em>unreasonably in this case. That the trial court erred in stating that men were not a protected class is undisputed. But that alone is not enough to warrant relief. <em>See Williams, </em>120 S.Ct. at 1522. Moreover, the exchange between the court and the parties did not end there. Instead, the prosecutor proffered that she struck Soule based on his questions about the death penalty and his response about the credibility of convicted felons. Although brief, the trial court and the parties engaged in some discussion of the substance of Soule\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>responses during which defense counsel attempted to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s proffered reasons. After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court granted the strike. We conclude that the trial court indeed touched on the third step of <em>Batson </em>and, thus, that the state appellate court\u2019s application of <em>Batson </em>was reasonable. <em>See Atwater, </em>451 F.3d at 807 (concluding that the trial court\u2019s application of <em>Batson </em>was reasonable where the trial court \u201ctouched\u201d on <em>Batson\u2019s </em>third step by agreeing with the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of a juror\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>response).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">We also are unconvinced that the state appellate court erred in concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory strike was not the product of intentional discrimination. \u201cThe evaluation of a prosecutor\u2019s [gender]-neutral explanations under <em>Bat-son </em>is a \u2018pure issue of fact ... peculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGahee v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>560 F.3d 1252, 1255 (11th Cir.2009). Thus, we will grant habe-as relief on a <em>Batson </em>claim only \u201cif it was unreasonable to credit the prosecutor\u2019s [genderj-neutral explanations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256. Soule was the only juror to question the trial court about the death penalty and it was not unreasonable for the trial court to credit the prosecutor\u2019s concern about a juror\u2019s focus on the death penalty in a non-capital case. Carrillo also failed to compare Soule\u2019s responses to the responses of other venire members and, thus, failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the prosecutor\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual. <em>See Atwater, </em>451 F.3d at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\">. <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\">. On appeal, the state argues that Carrillo\u2019s section 2254 petition should be dismissed for failure to exhaust his state administrative remedies. In the district court, however, the state represented that Carrillo had \"exhausted all of his claims in state court.\u201d Because we conclude that the state explicitly waived its exhaustion defense in the district court, we will not consider this defense on appeal. <em>See Dorsey v. Chapman, </em>262 F.3d 1181, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2001) (determining that the state waived its exhaustion defense when it expressly declined to raise it in its answer to a habeas petition).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\">. Although the trial court did not address <em>Batson </em>itself, it referred to a <em>Neil/Slappy Melbourne </em>inquiry, which is Florida\u2019s equivalent of an inquiry under <em>Batson. See Melbourne v. State, </em>679 So.2d 759 (Fla.1996); <em>State v. Slappy, </em>522 So.2d 18 (Fla.1988); <em>State v.
