Holder, </em>628 F.3d 151, 155-57 (5th Cir.2010) <em>(Hakim </em>I). On remand, the BIA concluded that Hakim had not shown willful blindness. Hakim has filed a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">As Hakim is removable for having committed an aggravated felony, we have jurisdiction only to determine whether the BIA applied the proper legal standard or to consider other legal or constitutional issues. <em>See Hakim I, </em>628 F.3d at 154-55. Although Hakim purports to challenge the BIA\u2019s standard of review, he is merely attempting to couch in legal terms his factual contentions that he adequately established the requisite likelihood of torture. The BIA applied the correct legal standard, and Hakim fails to identify any other legal or constitutional issue over which we have jurisdiction. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
