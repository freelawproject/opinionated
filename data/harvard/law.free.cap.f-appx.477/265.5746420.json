He contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>that he has established a clear probability of persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group, specifically, his family. Aquimir-Maldonado relies on evidence that his cousin, Alfonso Arias, killed Aquimir-Maldonado\u2019s father, who was a successful rancher, and that Arias has also made threats against Aquimir-Maldonado\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien \u201cmust demonstrate a \u2018clear probability\u2019 of persecution upon return.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cA \u2018clear probability\u2019 means that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of either his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The alien must prove some nexus between the persecution and one of the five enumerated statutory grounds. <em>See Tamara-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 343, 345 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We will uphold the BIA\u2019s factual findings if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Silwany-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>975 F.2d 1157, 1160 (5th Cir.1992). \u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s resolution of questions of law de novo, giving \u201cconsiderable deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the legislative scheme it is entrusted to administer.\u201d <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Where the BIA\u2019s decision depends on the factual findings of the IJ, we will review the IJ\u2019s findings to the extent that they influenced or were relied on by the BIA. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). The question whether an alien has demonstrated the requisite nexus between persecution and one of the enumerated grounds is an issue of fact reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350-51 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Arias acted out of jealousy over the success and wealth of Aqui-mir-Maldonado\u2019s father, or because he wanted to obtain that wealth. Indeed, Aquimir-Maldonado testified before the IJ that Arias had killed his father out of a desire to obtain his things and that Arias wanted to kill his mother in order to obtain her things. Such motivations, which involve purely personal matters, rather than persecution on account of one of the statutorily enumerated grounds, are insufficient to support a claim for relief. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 190 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
