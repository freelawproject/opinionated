Ad\u00edele was previously deported from the United States pursuant to Section 241(a)(ll) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(ll) (now 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227), based on a 1980 state conviction for possession of marijuana. Ad-\u00edele reentered the United States in \u25a0 1984 and was again ordered deported. The instant proceedings stem from his most recent attempt, in 2009, to reenter the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a notice to appear (NTA) charging Ad\u00edele with being inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense, and under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), for attempting to obtain admission to the United States by fraud. The DHS later charged Ad\u00edele with being inadmissible as an alien not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or entry document pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), and as an alien seeking admission less than 20 years after previously having been removed from the United States pursuant to INA \u00a7 241 (a)(9)(A)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii). Ad\u00edele denied the allegations set forth in the NTA and requested relief from inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) and former INA \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The IJ concluded that Adiele\u2019s 1980 Illinois conviction for possession of marijuana was a crime relating to a controlled substance and rendered Ad\u00edele removable as charged under \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). The IJ also concluded that Ad\u00edele was removable under \u00a7 212(a) (7) (A) (i) (I) and \u00a7 212(a)(9)(A)(ii) and that Ad\u00edele was not eligible for any waivers from inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The BIA noted that Ad\u00edele did not dispute his removability and determined that Ad\u00edele was \u201cnot <em>prima facie </em>eligible for any relief that would waive his inadmissibility under\u201d \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), for being an immigrant not in possession of a valid visa. The BIA concluded that because Ad\u00edele was removable on that basis, it did not need to decide whether Ad\u00edele qualified for or merited any relief that would overcome the other grounds for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Our jurisdiction over an immigration proceeding is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Section 1252(a)(2)(C) generally prohibits judicial review of any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed certain designated criminal offenses, including a controlled substance offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 277-78 (5th Cir.2001). However, we have jurisdiction to determine whether a petitioner is an alien who is deportable, or inadmissible, for committing an offense that bars our review. <em>See Balogun, </em>270 F.3d at 278 &amp; n. 11. Further, \u00a7 1252 does not bar judicial review of \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 461 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law associated with a claim for discretionary relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Although Ad\u00edele asserts that his state conviction for possession of marijuana should not render him inadmissible, he has failed to demonstrate any error in the determination that he is inadmissable under \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), as an alien who has been convicted of a controlled sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>stance offense, and therefore removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Adiele further asserts that because the IJ erred in determining that his drug offense involved more than 30 grams of marijuana, he was wrongfully denied a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(h). He also argues that he was entitled to relief under \u00a7 212(c), but he has failed to exhaust that issue by failing to raise it before the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cAn alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the BIA \u2014 either on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In any event, Adiele has failed to raise a colorable constitutional claim or a question of law regarding his eligibility for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(h). Section 212(h) gives the Attorney General the discretion to \u201cwaive the application of [\u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)] insofar as it relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less or marijuana\u201d under certain enumerated circumstances. \u00a7 1182(h). Although the IJ determined that Adiele was ineligible for a waiver under \u00a7 212(h) because his drug offense involved more than 30 grams, the BIA did not rely on that determination or adopt the IJ\u2019s findings regarding the drug amount or Adiele\u2019s eligibility for a waiver under \u00a7 212(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Because the BIA engaged in its own analysis and affirmed the removal order without adopting the IJ\u2019s decision and analysis, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). Thus, because Adiele is removable as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense, and because Adiele raises no colorable constitutional claim or question of law pertaining to the BIA\u2019s decision, we lack jurisdiction over his petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Balogun, </em>270 F.3d at 277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Accordingly, Adiele\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
