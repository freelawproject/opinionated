Cigna Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 07-CV-06039-SRC). In that consolidated action, they allege improper reductions of assigned claims for healthcare benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">In response to that lawsuit, Cigna filed motions in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida \u2014 the court handling <em>In Re Managed Care Litig., </em>MDL No. 1334\u2014seeking an order to compel the <em>Franco </em>plaintiffs to withdraw their RICO and antitrust claims. On November 30, 2009, the District Court for the Southern District of Florida found that the RICO and antitrust claims asserted in <em>Franco </em>were covered by an injunction entered earlier in the MDL 1334 matter and ordered that they be withdrawn. That order was appealed to us, and we dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Ex. A attached. As we explained, injunctions are tested through civil contempt procedures and the district court did not include a finding of contempt or impose sanctions. <em>Id. See also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>Thomas v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>594 F.3d 823, 830 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Rather than follow the procedure set forth in our earlier ruling, appellants filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that <em>Franco </em>was not covered by the injunction entered in the multi-district litigation. The district court dismissed that action, stating that it had already ruled on that question. This appeal attacks that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">We review this dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., </em>515 U.S. 277, 289-90, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995); <em>Ameritas Variable Life Ins. Co. v. Roach, </em>411 F.3d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Manuel v. Convergys Corp., </em>430 F.3d 1132, 1134-35 (11th Cir.2005). Clearly, there is none. A declaratory judgment action is no substitute for following the established procedure for testing injunctions, to wit: contempt and sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">Exhibit A</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">No. 09-16261</p>\n<p id=\"b566-18\">D.C.

The district court\u2019s November 30, 2009, order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s November 5, 2009, report and recommendation is not a final order because the district court did not include a finding of contempt or impose sanctions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>Thomas v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>594 F.3d 823, 830-31 (11th Cir.2010). Additionally, the district court\u2019s order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) because the court did not so blatantly misinterpret the settlement injunctions as to constitute a modification of the injunctions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1); <em>Thomas v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>594 F.3d 814, 819-20 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Thomas, </em>594 F.3d at 821-22; <em>Birmingham Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n 117 v. Jefferson County, </em>280 F.3d 1289, 1292-95 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\">.
