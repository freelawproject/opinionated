He contends the within-Guidelines sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>tence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The sentence now contested by Jimenez was imposed on remand, after our court vacated his first sentence on grounds the district court, in imposing that first sentence, had committed procedural error by relying on a clearly erroneous fact: namely, that Jimenez had profited from transporting illegal aliens. <em>United States v. Jimenez-Espinoza, </em>408 Fed.Appx. 823 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">For the appeal at hand, we first examine whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as ... failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u201d. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If procedurally sound, we will then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard ... tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Jimenez maintains his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because, at resen-tencing in August 2011, the district court failed to adequately explain the sentence. Specifically, he contends the district court failed to explain: why it rejected his request for a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range based on a proposed amendment to Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (amendment became effective approximately three months later (on 1 November 2011), reducing 16-level enhancement, which Jimenez received, to 12 levels when prior conviction too old to qualify for criminal history points); and why correction of the clearly erroneous fact, which resulted in his first sentence being vacated, did not warrant a different sentence (vacated sentence was same as the sentence at hand, <em>i.e., </em>50-months\u2019 imprisonment). The parties disagree on whether Jimenez\u2019 contention was adequately preserved in district court. Although Jimenez generally objected to the reasonableness of his sentence, he did not object specifically to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons. Our court need not determine the appropriate standard of review, however, because Jimenez is not entitled to relief under either standard. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">At resentencing, the district court listened to the contentions for a sentence both below and within the advisory Guidelines range before imposing the sentence. The court stated it had sentenced Jimenez pursuant to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and noted that the sentence reflected Jimenez\u2019 criminal history, the need to deter future criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public. And, as Jimenez concedes, correction of the clearly erroneous fact from the first sentencing, which resulted in his first sentence being vacated, did not prevent the district court from reimposing the same sentence on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">Regarding the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, Jimenez first asserts, solely for purposes of preserving the issue for possible further review, that the presumption of reasonableness afforded within-Guidelines sentences should not apply to sentences calculated under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 because it is flawed. In other words, he concedes that this contention is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>E.g., United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009). Also unavailing is Jimenez\u2019 assertion that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his sentence because the then-pending amendment to Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) drastically revises the advisory Guidelines sentencing range applicable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">Otherwise, Jimenez contends his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the proposed (and now effective) amendment to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the offense underlying his \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) enhancement is stale. In addition, Jimenez asserts the district court ignored the effect of the proposed amendment when sentencing him and, as a result, the sentence does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight. Jimenez\u2019 having preserved a substantive reasonableness challenge by objecting on that basis, review is for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). In order to rebut the presumption, defendant must show \u201cthat the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors\u201d. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Jimenez cites no legal precedent supporting his assertion that the district court\u2019s disregarding the effect of the then-pending amendment rendered his sentence substantively unreasonable. Further, this court has recognized that \u201cthe staleness of a prior conviction used in the proper calculation of a guidelines-range sentence does not render a sentence substantively unreasonable\u201d. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir.2011). The subsequent amendment of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) does not undermine that reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b216-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
