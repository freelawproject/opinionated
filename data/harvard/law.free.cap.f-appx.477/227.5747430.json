Garcia argues that his sentence is unreasonable based on the particular facts of his case and as measured by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 double counts criminal history and produces a sentencing range that overstates the seriousness of the offense, which is by nature a trespass offense. He also argues that the Guidelines range failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics, including the fact that he had lived in the United States since he was 16, was the father of three young children, and that his motive for returning was to be with his family and to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Although Garcia did not expressly object at sentencing to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, he did assert specific arguments in favor of a variance; his arguments then are substantively identical to his assertions on appeal. He also repeated the request for a variance after the district court imposed the sentence. We do not need to decide whether Garcia\u2019s objection was sufficient to preserve the issue because Garcia has not shown that the district court\u2019s imposition of a within-Guidelines sentence of 57 months was improper under either the deferential <em>Gall </em>standard of review or the plain-error review of <em>Peltier. See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The Guidelines provide for consideration of a prior conviction for both criminal history and the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 6. Such double-counting does not necessarily render a sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, Garcia\u2019s argument that his Guideline range was greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals as a result of \u201cdouble counting\u201d of criminal history fails. We have previously rejected the argument that illegal reentry is a trespass offense that is treated too harshly under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Likewise, Garcia\u2019s contention that his sentence failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics \u2014 that he came to this country as a teenager and returned to be with his family \u2014 does not show that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming the denial of a downward variance where the defendant argued that he had lived in the United States from infancy until age 51 and that he returned to see his dying father).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The district court heard the arguments of Garcia and his counsel for a variance before imposing a sentence within the advisory guideline range. The district court considered Garcia\u2019s personal history and characteristics noted above and the other statutory sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), in particular Garcia\u2019s serious criminal history, prior to imposing a sentence within the Guidelines. Garcia\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Garcia has not overcome this presumption and has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>shown that the district court\u2019s imposition of a within-guidelines sentence of 57 months was an abuse of discretion under the deferential <em>Gall </em>standard of review, or plain error under <em>Peltier. See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
