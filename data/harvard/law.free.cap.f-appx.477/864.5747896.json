Hawk-Bey alleged that the federal district court had jurisdiction, pursuant to the Emancipation Proclamation of 1862 and the Fifth Amendment, to hear his complaint that President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had denied \u201cthe effort he was making for his actual freedom through his Job Creation and Restoration Plan ... and through his Emergency Colonization Request ... and through his Tax Exempt Request.\u201d Hawk-Bey requested \u201c$41 billion in tax free monetary compensation.\u201d The Government moved to dismiss the complaint, and, in an order entered on November 15, 2011, the District Court granted the motion as unopposed. In the margin, the court also determined that the complaint failed to comply with Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a)(2) and <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and that the allegations in the complaint concerned only nonjusticiable political questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-17\">Hawk-Bey appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After Hawk-Bey filed his informal brief, the Government moved to summarily affirm the order of District Court dismissing Hawk-Bey\u2019s complaint. We have considered Hawk-Bey\u2019s informal brief and his response in opposition to the Government\u2019s motion to summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>We will grant the Government\u2019s motion and summarily affirm the order of the District Court because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. We exercise plenary review over Rule 12(b)(1) and (6) dismissals. <em>See In re: Kaiser Group International Inc., </em>399 F.3d 558, 560 (3d Cir.2005) (Rule 12(b)(1)); <em>Weston v. Pennsylvania, </em>251 F.3d 420, 425 (3d Cir.2001) (Rule 12(b)(6)). We \u201care free\u201d to affirm the judgment \u201con any basis which finds support in the record.\u201d <em>Bernitsky v. United States, </em>620 F.2d 948, 950 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">According to items he submitted in the District Court and again on appeal, Hawk-Bey wrote to President Obama with his idea for injecting $9 billion into the economy by paying that same amount of money to the descendants of Africans who were held as slaves in the nineteenth century. In addition, he noted his consent, given to President Obama and Attorney General Holder, to be \u201ccolonized,\u201d as discussed in the Emancipation Proclamation, which has yet to be executed in accordance with his wishes, and he noted his request for tax exempt status under the Emancipation Proclamation. We conclude that, to the extent that Hawk-Bey refers to President Obama, reparations, and the Job Creation and Restoration Plan, to Attorney General Holder and an Emergency Colonization Request, and to Secretary Geithner and a Tax Exemption Request, his complaint presents political questions which the federal courts do not address.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Under Article III, \u00a7 2 of the United States Constitution, a federal court cannot adjudicate a constitutional matter except \u201cas it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.\u201d <em>See Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962) <em>(quoting Liverpool Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, </em>113 U.S. 33, 39, 5 S.Ct. 352, 28 L.Ed. 899 (1885)). The Constitution recognizes a separation of powers with respect to the three branches of government such that political questions are not justifiable. The Supreme Court has explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-7\">[I]t is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government, ... which gives rise to the \u201cpolitical question.\u201d We have said that in determining whether a question falls within the political question category, the appropriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfying criteria for a judicial determination are dominant considerations. The nonjusti-ciability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWa\">369 U.S. at 210, 82 S.Ct. 691 (internal quotation marks, parentheses, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Accordingly, Hawk-Bey lacks standing to bring his claims because the matters he raises have \u201cin any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 82 S.Ct. 691. To the extent that his complaint does not present only political questions, the District Court properly dismissed it under Rule 8(a)(2) because Hawk-Bey failed to comply with the requirement of \u201ca short and plain statement ... showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court, dismissing the complaint. Appellant\u2019s motion to suspend court rules, etc. is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
