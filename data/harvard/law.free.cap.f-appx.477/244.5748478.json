He maintains the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Chavez-Marquez contends: the guidelines range was too severe because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 (providing, inter alia, a 12-level enhancement for illegal reentry following a drug trafficking offense) double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal record; the advisory guidelines sentencing range overstated the seriousness of his criminal history and nonviolent reentry offense; and the range failed to account for his motive for reentering \u2014 to seek treatment for his thyroid cancer. Chavez-Marquez further argues that the advisory guidelines sentencing range was excessive because it failed to consider the disparity between defendants who, like him, cannot avail themselves of a \u201cfast track\u201d program and defendants in other districts who can avail themselves of such a program. As he acknowledges, the latter argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-63 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness' in the light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Our court first determines whether the district court committed any significant procedural error; and, if not, the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>is reviewed for substantive unreasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 221, 233 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The district court considered Chavez-Marquez\u2019s arguments for a lower sentence but determined a 46-month within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Chavez-Marquez\u2019s contentions \u2014 the double-counting of his prior drug conviction, the nonviolent nature of his offense, and his medical condition and motive for reentry all justified a lower sentence \u2014 are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
