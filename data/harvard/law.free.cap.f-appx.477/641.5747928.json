Because Hogan\u2019s petition was not permissible under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Hogan was convicted in 2006 of various federal conspiracy, robbery, carjacking, and firearm offenses, and his convictions became final on March 8, 2008. <em>See United States v. Hogan, </em>253 Fed.Appx. 889 (11th Cir.2007) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 1249, 128 S.Ct. 1488, 170 L.Ed.2d 308 (2008). Hogan had one year from that date to file a \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). On March 31, 2010, Hogan filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that his motion was timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(2) because, even though it was filed more than a year after his judgment of conviction became final, \u201cgovernmental action\u201d prevented him from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion within the limitations period. Specifically, he asserted that he was in state custody on state charges from October 31, 2006 until March 12, 2009, where he was unable to pursue federal post-conviction remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">The district court dismissed Hogan\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred because the alleged governmental action was not \u201cin violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States\u201d as required by \u00a7 2255(f)(2). Further, even if the statute of limitations began to run on March 12, 2009, Hogan\u2019s motion, filed more than a year thereafter, was time-barred. Hogan appealed, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the district court and this court declined to issue a certificate of appealability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hogan then sought leave of this court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We denied his request.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In June 2011, Hogan filed a \u00a7 2241 petition, raising the same arguments he raised in his previous \u00a7 2255 motion. He argued that the court should consider his arguments because he was prevented from filing a timely \u00a7 2255 motion while he was in state custody awaiting and undergoing trial. And he contended that he was entitled to_ relief under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e) because \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention and because he was actually innocent. The district court dismissed the petition, finding that Hogan\u2019s history of \u00a7 2255 motions made him unable to pursue relief under \u00a7 2241, and that Hogan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was not proper under the \u00a7 2255 savings clause. This is Hogan\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). Generally, a prisoner must collaterally attack his conviction or sentence under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). If, however, a remedy under \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention,\u201d a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e). A petitioner is not entitled to take advantage of this \u201csavings clause\u201d when he is \u201cattempting to use \u00a7 2241 simply to escape the restrictions on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Hogan contends that his \u00a7 2241 petition should proceed because the statute of limitations on his original \u00a7 2255 motion expired while he was in state custody, where he did not know about post-conviction relief and did not have access to research resources. Thus, he argues, \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. But Hogan previously made these same arguments about the timeliness of his petition, and we denied relief. And we have denied his request to file a second or successive petition based, again, on these same arguments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is therefore evident that Hogan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is an attempt to circumscribe our restrictions on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions. This is not a valid reason to employ the savings clause. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">Further, to the extent Hogan argues that he must be permitted to file a \u00a7 2241 petition because of his actual innocence, his contention is foreclosed by <em>Wof-ford, </em>in which we stated that a petitioner may not argue actual innocence until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies. 177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">Because we find that the district court correctly dismissed Hogan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">. <em>See Hogan v.
