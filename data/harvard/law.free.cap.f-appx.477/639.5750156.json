(\u201cRissman Firm\u201d) and David Popper appeal the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment to defendant Westport Insurance Corp. (\u201cWestport\u201d). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-25\">The essential facts of this case are not in dispute. Popper is a an attorney licensed in Florida, and at all relevant times, he was employed by the Rissman Firm. The firm was the named insured of a lawyers professional liability insurance policy issued by Westport. Insuring Agreement I.A. of the policy provides that Westport \u201cshall pay on behalf of any INSURED all LOSS in excess of the deductible which any INSURED becomes legally obligated to pay as a result of CLAIMS first made against any INSURED ... by reason of any WRONGFUL ACT....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-26\">The policy defines the term \u201cWRONGFUL ACT\u201d as \u201cany act, error, omission, circumstance, PERSONAL INJURY or breach of duty in the rendition of PRO<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>FESSIONAL SERVICES for others.\u201d In turn, the policy defines the term \u201cPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\u201d as \u201cservices rendered to others in the INSURED\u2019s capacity as a lawyer, and arising out of the conduct of the .INSURED\u2019s profession as a lawyer.... \u201d The policy provides that Westport \u201cshall have the right and duty to defend any CLAIM for LOSS against any INSURED covered by Insuring Agreement I.A., even if such claim is groundless, false or fraudulent....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">In July 2009, Kingsland Land Holdings, LLC (\u201cKingsland\u201d) filed a civil complaint against Popper in Florida state court. The complaint addressed Popper\u2019s participation in the sale of a piece of real property to Kingsland. Specifically, in Count II of the complaint, Kingsland alleged that Popper \u201cwas acting as a real estate broker at a time when [he] was not licensed to so act\u201d and that he \u201cstated that there were no significant defects on the property and that entitlement to the property for residential purposes could easily be achieved.\u201d Kingsland alleged that Popper \u201cknew or should have known that this statement was false.\u201d Kingsland sought damages for this alleged misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In August 2009, the Rissman Firm notified Westport of this lawsuit. In September 2009, Westport informed the Rissman Firm of its decision to decline coverage. In March 2010, the firm asked Westport to reconsider, but in May 2010, Westport refused to do so. In June 2010, the Rissman Firm and Popper (collectively \u201cthe insureds\u201d) filed this suit, seeking damages for breach of contract, as well as declaratory relief. On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held that there was no coverage for the underlying lawsuit and no duty to defend. The district court therefore granted summary judgment to Westport.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, </em>366 F.3d 1214, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The insureds argue that summary judgment in favor of Westport was not proper \u201cbecause the allegations of the underlying complaint ... fall within the scope of coverage under the policy.\u201d As a result, according to the insureds, the complaint triggered Westport\u2019s duty to defend. This argument fails. \u201cFlorida law provides that insurance contracts are construed in accordance with the plain language of the policies as bargained for by the parties.\u201d <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>756 So.2d 29, 34 (Fla.2000). Also, an insurer\u2019s \u201cduty to defend depends <em>solely </em>on the facts and legal theories alleged in the pleadings and claims against the insured.\u201d <em>James River Co. v. Ground Down Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.2008) (emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">As set out above, the policy here provides coverage for wrongs committed \u201cin the rendition of PROFESSIONAL SERVICES for others.\u201d The policy specifically defines the term \u201cPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\u201d as \u201cservices rendered to others in the INSURED\u2019s capacity <em>as a lawyer, </em>and arising out of the conduct of the INSURED\u2019s profession <em>as a lawyer....\u201d </em>(Emphases added.) We agree with the district court that the allegations in the underlying complaint do not \u201cfairly and potentially bring the suit within [this] policy coverage.\u201d <em>Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. JDC (Am.) Corp., </em>52 F.3d 1575, 1580 (11th Cir.1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">As the district court observed, Count II of the complaint repeatedly identifies Pop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>per as an unlicensed real estate broker. Specifically, Count II states that Popper</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADp\">was acting as a real estate broker at a time when [he] was not licensed to so act. [He] stated that there were no significant defects on the property and that entitlement to the property for residential purposes could easily be achieved. [He] knew or should have known that this statement was false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay2X\">Count II also alleges, by reference, that Popper received a commission for the sale of the property and that at the time that he received the commission, he \u201cwas not acting in his professional role as an attorney at law.\u201d Count II does not otherwise contain any allegation that Popper acted as an attorney. Thus, the underlying complaint is squarely focused on Popper\u2019s purported decision to act as an unlicensed real estate broker and the misrepresentations he made in the course of that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The insureds argue that the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Westport Insurance Corp. v. Bayer, </em>284 F.3d 489 (3d Cir.2002), supports their position. There, the Third Circuit construed a similar policy and found that there was coverage. <em>See id. </em>at 496-98. We find <em>Bayer </em>to be distinguishable, however. In the underlying lawsuit in that case, the court found that the insured was \u201cholding himself out as an attorney\u201d when he promoted a fraudulent investment scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 497. Here, the underlying complaint contains no such allegation. The insureds\u2019 reliance on <em>Bayer </em>is therefore misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-6\">. In the district court and on appeal, the insureds have relied solely on the allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>in Count II of the underlying complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
