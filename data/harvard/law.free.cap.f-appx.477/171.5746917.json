A claim is frivolous if it does not have an arguable basis in fact or law. <em>Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-24\">Walker claimed that Defendants intentionally altered the transcript of. the 1994 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>guilty plea hearing involving his convictions for possession of cocaine and aggravated battery. To the extent that his claim would implicate the validity of his criminal convictions, which have not been invalidated, the district court did not err by dismissing Walker\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and therefore frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In the alternative, the district court did not err by dismissing Walker\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as time barred and therefore frivolous. \u201cIn \u00a7 1983 claims, the applicable statute of limitations is that which the state would apply in an analogous action in its courts. In accordance with applicable Louisiana law, we apply a one-year libera-tive prescriptive period to these claims.\u201d <em>Bourdais v. New Orleans City, </em>485 <em>F.3d </em>294, 298 (5th Cir.2007) (internal citation omitted) (citing La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 3492). Therefore, contrary to Walker\u2019s argument, the district court correctly applied the one-year prescriptive period in Louisiana Civil Code article 3492.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">A \u00a7 1983 claim accrues \u201cwhen a plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\u201d <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 157 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Walker concedes that his claim accrued in 2004. He has failed to establish that he was entitled to tolling of the prescriptive period for the time period during which he was exhausting administrative remedies. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 157-58. Therefore, Walker\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint was time barred as he did not file suit until 2010, well after the one-year prescriptive period expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b193-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
