On April 1, 2011, a Southern District of Alabama jury found John Hyland, Jr. guilty of failing to register as a sex offender under SORNA, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250. On July 29, 2011, the district court sentenced Hy-land to a prison term of 33 months and a life term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">Hyland now appeals his conviction, raising one issue: whether the district court abused its discretion in allowing the prosecutor to question him on cross-examination regarding the details of his 1993 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Hyland\u2019s 1993 conviction was established at trial via stipulation during the Government\u2019s case in chief. The jury heard nothing about the facts underlying that conviction until Hyland took the stand in his own defense and referred to the conviction moments after the prosecutor began his cross-examination. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-12\">Q: Good morning, Mr. Hyland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-13\">A: How are you doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-14\">Q: You\u2019re a convicted criminal sex offender, aren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-15\">A: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-16\">Q: You\u2019re a convicted criminal sex offender, aren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-17\">A: I got crooked judges and crooked cops.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-18\">Q: You got crooked judges and crooked cops?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-19\">A: Michigan Supreme Court, 436, page 417, says where the hymen is intact, there is reasonable doubt that criminal sexual conduct occurred. That was 1986. My conviction was 1992. My attorney was a skunk. Alabama\u2019s registration is 1996, which means they don\u2019t have jurisdiction over me because I was arrested in 1992. You can\u2019t have ex post facto. The Feds, the United States constitution says there shall not be ex post facto legislation. You can\u2019t take the '96 rules and say we\u2019re going to put somebody in here from '95 or '92 like me. It doesn\u2019t hold. It\u2019s not jurisdictional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-20\">Q: I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-21\">A: Thank you for letting me speak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-22\">Q: Since you brought it up, you were convicted ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-23\">At this point, defense counsel objected and a side-bar was held. Counsel argued that Hyland remarks were insufficient to open the door to the prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning. The court overruled the objection and allowed the questioning to proceed. The prosecutor asked: \u201cThe fact of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the matter is, the two victims in your case were your two daughters; isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d To this, Hyland gave several responses, each having a similar gist. For example, \u201cDrop dead. I never touched my daughters.\u201d Then, referring to the prosecutor, \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t know how a man like that can ... sleep at night.\u201d Or \u2014 speaking to the judge \u2014 \u201cIf I die today, it doesn\u2019t make any damn difference,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll speak up when I can, and you can throw me out if you want.\u201d Hyland eventually admitted that his two daughters were the victims of the 1993 offense and that, following his conviction, the daughters were removed from his custody and placed in the care of an Alabama relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s ruling. Hyland did open the door to the challenged examination. It was a risk he took when he launched an attack on the integrity of the Michigan conviction and thereby called into question the essential element of the SORNA offense, his duty to register</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
