The presentence investigation report (PSR) calculated a Guidelines range of 24 to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment; however, as suggested in the PSR, the district court departed upward pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3, based on the inadequacy of the criminal-history category, to a sentence of 45-months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">Hernandez contends the district court procedurally erred in departing upward because: it did not consider each intermediate step in the process before selecting his sentence; and, to determine his sentence, it used the reasonableness standard employed by appellate courts. Because Hernandez failed to preserve either of these issues in district court, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009). To establish reversible plain error, Hernandez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If such showing is made, our court retains the discretion to correct the error and generally will do so only if the reversible plain error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">As our court has stated, \u201cit is well settled that a district court does not need to go through a ritualistic exercise in which it mechanically discusses each criminal history category it rejects en route to the category that it selects, and that the court\u2019s reasons for rejecting intermediate categories will be quite apparent in its stated reasons for departure\u201d. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 348 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). At sentencing, the district court stated that it determined the extent of the departure by moving \u201cincrementally\u201d through the Guidelines sentencing table as required by \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4). In addition, the district court\u2019s adoption of the PSR and its statements at sentencing explain that it found an upward departure was warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>and the intermediate categories and levels were insufficient, because of Hernandez\u2019 continued disregard of immigration procedures and his continuing criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(C). The district court\u2019s explanation for the departure implicitly established the rationale for rejecting the intervening levels. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 348 n. 2. Therefore, Hernandez has not shown error.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Hernandez also contends the district court erred by using an appellate-\u201creasonableness\u201d standard in determining his sentence; he maintains the court was required instead to impose a sentence that was sufficient but not greater than necessary to meet the objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (including, <em>inter alia, </em>nature of offense, history of defendant, and need for sentence imposed to protect the public and promote respect for law). It is correct that, at sentencing, the district court stated it had concluded the sentence was \u201creasonable\u201d. However, the court also stated that the sentence was based on both the advisory Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. In particular, immediately before referring to the sentence as \u201creasonable\u201d, the district court stated that the sentence was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary\u201d to achieve the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing objectives. The district court\u2019s subsequent conclusion that the sentence also was reasonable was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
