Reversible error has been shown; we vacate John\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">While working as a bank employee, John accepted $1000 from a bank customer named Ali Hassan Hammoud who \u2014 as it turned out \u2014 was involved in transferring fraudulently $5.7 million from the Florida state treasury into his own bank account. As part of an investigation of Hammoud\u2019s wire fraud scheme, which was being prosecuted in the Northern District of Florida, an FBI agent interviewed John to determine the nature of her involvement in the fraud<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to assess her credibility as a potential government witness. During that interview, which took place at John\u2019s home in Miami, John denied having received money from Hammoud. But John later admitted in Miami that she had received money from Hammoud and signed in Miami a written statement describing her acceptance of the money. Despite her connection to the Southern District, John was then indicted and tried in the Northern District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">On appeal, John asserts that venue was improper in the Northern District of Florida because she made her false statement to the FBI agent \u2014 all her pre-indictment statements, really \u2014 while she was in the Southern District of Florida. From this record, John \u2014 for all we know \u2014 had never been in the Northern District of Florida, placed a call to anyone in the Northern District of Florida, or mailed or sent anything to the Northern District of Florida before she was indicted. When venue is challenged, we must determine \u201c \u2018whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government ... the Government proved by a preponderance of the evidence\u2019 that the crimes occurred in the district in which the defendant was prosecuted.\u201d <em>United States v. Breitweiser, </em>357 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">The United States Constitution, in two different places, guarantees a defendant the right to be prosecuted in the district where the alleged offense was committed. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 3; U.S. Const, amend. VI. We believe this right to be tried where one allegedly did wrong is an important one for defendants. The right is restated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 18. For offenses that are \u201cbegun in one district and completed in another,\u201d venue is proper in \u201cany district in which such offense was begun, continued, or completed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237. But for crimes that \u201cbegan, continued, and were completed\u201d within one district, venue is proper only in that district. <em>See United States v. Cabrales, </em>524 U.S. 1, 118 S.Ct. 1772, 1776, 141 L.Ed.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">. \u201cThe <em>locus delicti </em>must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, to determine where an offense was committed, \u201ca court must initially identify the conduct constituting the offense (the nature of the crime) and then discern the location of the commission of the criminal acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno, </em>526 U.S. 275, 119 S.Ct. 1239, 1242-43, 143 L.Ed.2d 388 (1999). The \u201cessential conduct elements\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>offense are determined from the statutory language. <em>Id. </em>at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The Tenth Circuit has concluded recently that, for purposes of venue under section 1001(a), \u201cthe <em>locus delecti </em>is where the defendant makes the false statement.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>641 F.3d 1200, 1207 (10th Cir.2011). We agree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 1001(a) prohibits \u201cknowingly and willfully ... mak[ing] any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\u201d in a matter within the jurisdiction of the United States government. The statute contains no separate venue provision, and the only \u201cessential conduct\u201d prohibited by the statute is the making of-a false statement. Thus, venue is proper only in the district or districts where the defendant made the false statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Here, John\u2019s false statement was made and received by an FBI agent entirely inside the Southern District of Florida. Even if we assume \u2014 without deciding\u2014 that John\u2019s statement was material to a government investigation in the Northern District of Florida, John\u2019s own offense conduct began, continued, and was completed in the Southern District of Florida. Thus, venue was proper only in the Southern District of Florida, and we vacate John\u2019s conviction for lack of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We reject John\u2019s argument that insufficient evidence existed to sustain a conviction under section 1001(a) because her statement to the FBI agent was \u201cliterally true.\u201d She contends that, when asked if she ever received anything of value from Hammoud \u201cin exchange for\u201d handling the fraudulent banking transactions, she responded \u201cno\u201d because the money was not \u201cin exchange\u201d for her assistance with the banking transactions. This argument is sufficiently contradicted, however, by John\u2019s own written statement in which she admitted that the money was \u201cfor helping [Hammoud] with his account.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">. Nothing evidences that John was involved in the fraud, and she was not charged with conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\">. In determining that venue was proper in the Northern District of Florida, the district court relied on the Seventh Circuit's decision in <em>United States v. Ringer, </em>300 F.3d 788 (7th Cir.2002), which concluded that venue under section 1001(a) was proper both in the district where the false statement was made and in the district where events took place \"which were critical to proving the elements of the false statement case against Ringer.\u201d <em>Ringer </em>at 791. The facts in <em>Ringer </em>\u2014 where Ringer (and his tale from beginning to end) had considerable pertinent personal contact with the district in which he was tried \u2014 are materially different from those in John\u2019s case; we decline to use the Seventh Circuit\u2019s supposed wider rule to affirm in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-22\">. Because we vacate John\u2019s conviction for lack of venue, we need not reach her three remaining arguments: (1) that the district court erred in denying her motion to <em>dismiss </em>the indictment based on lack of venue; (2) that the district court\u2019s jury instruction on venue misstated the law; and (3) that the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
