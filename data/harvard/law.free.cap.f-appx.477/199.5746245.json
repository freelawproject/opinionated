Citing <em>Bond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 181 S.Ct. 2355, 180 L.Ed.2d 269 (2011), and <em>Ex parte Siebold, </em>100 U.S. 371, 376, 25 L.Ed. 717 (1880), he claims that he is entitled to immediate release from prison because Congress exceeded its powers under the Constitution in enacting the federal child pornography statutes. He also asserts that the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition violates the Suspension Clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">McDearmon\u2019s statement that he is not challenging his convictions and sentence is inaccurate because he challenged his incarceration, and he is incarcerated under the authority of a judgment of conviction and sentence. Accordingly, he must show that his claim falls under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 for it to be cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">As McDearmon has not shown that a previously unavailable Supreme Court case has decriminalized his offense conduct, he cannot challenge his convictions in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir.2003). Moreover, the restrictions on federal prisoners\u2019 entitlement to obtain relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 do not violate the' Suspension Clause. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 n. 19 (5th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
