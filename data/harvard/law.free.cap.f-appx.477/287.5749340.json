The judgment of conviction was affirmed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">After filing an unsuccessful 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, Garland filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition arguing that he was entitled to release on all of his money-laundering convictions in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 509, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). The district court dismissed Garland\u2019s petition, finding that he had not met the requirements for challenging his money-laundering convictions under \u00a7 2241. We addressed Garland\u2019s \u00a7 1956 convictions and concluded that, in light of <em>Santos, </em>he was entitled to challenge the validity of those convictions via \u00a7 2241. <em>See Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 394-404 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, we reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Garland\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and remanded the case to the district court \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with\u201d our opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 404. On remand, the district court vacated all of Garland\u2019s \u00a7 1956 convictions, stating that the other convictions remained in effect and subject to resentencing. That is the judgment now being appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Garland argues that the district court on remand erroneously limited its consideration of his claims to those pertaining to his convictions under \u00a7 1956. He maintains that <em>Santos </em>applied with equal force to his convictions under \u00a7 1957 and that the district court should have vacated those convictions as well. The district court\u2019s interpretation of the scope of our remand order is a legal question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 320 (5th Cir.2004). The district court did not err in finding that our prior opinion implicitly rejected Garland\u2019s argument that he could use \u00a7 2241 to raise his -Sawios-based challenge to the validity of his transactional-money-laundering convictions under \u00a7 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">Contrary to Garland\u2019s assertion, subjecting him to resentencing on the remaining counts of conviction does not give rise to a double jeopardy violation. \u201cA petitioner can attack the validity of his conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition only if he can meet the requirements of the \u2018savings clause\u2019 of \u00a7 2255(e).\u201d <em>Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 434-35 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1062, 181 L.Ed.2d 779 (2012). Garland\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition thus effectively acted as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Garland\u2019s offenses had to be grouped for purposes of determining the applicable guidelines sentencing range such that he received one aggregate sentence that accounted for all of his interdependent individual sentences. Once any portion of that aggregate sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>vacated, the validity of the entire sentence was put at issue. <em>See United States v. Benbrook, </em>119 F.3d 338, 340-41 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Garland has filed a motion for release on bail pending appeal. That motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set fordi in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
