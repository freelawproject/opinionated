Sandoval now appeals his sentence. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo; its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-03 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Sandoval\u2019s appeal concerns the application of an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) for maintaining a premises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance and the denial of a mitigating role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. He primarily argues that the district court erred by basing these sentencing determinations on the prosecuting attorney\u2019s understanding of the facts. A brief factual summary is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-16\">The offense involved bundles of marijuana, which were found at a residence in McAllen, Texas. Cellophane wrapping material and digital scales were found in the bedroom closet. The Presentence Report (PSR) indicated that, according to information supplied to the probation officer by the case agent, the residence was being rented to Sandoval and his brother for $1,000 per month. This portion of the PSR is relevant to application of the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) enhancement, as whether the defendant held a possessory interest is a factor the district court should consider in determining whether the defendant \u201cmaintained\u201d the premises. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-17\">Sandoval objected in writing to the application of the enhancement; he likewise objected to the denial of a mitigating role adjustment. At the sentencing hearing, he specifically denied having rented the residence. The matter was discussed at some length, and, in the course of that discussion, the attorney for the Government expressed that, according to his recollection of Sandoval\u2019s original statement, Sandoval and his brother had obtained the residence for the purposes of storing and wrapping the marijuana. Sandoval introduced no evidence in rebuttal of the information set forth in the PSR. The district court ultimately adopted the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>\u201cGenerally, a PSR bears sufficient indi-cia of reliability to permit the sentencing court to rely on it at sentencing. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the PSR is inaccurate; in the absence of rebuttal evidence, the sentencing court may properly rely on the PSR and adopt it.\u201d <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>47 F.3d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1995) (internal citation omitted). Objections to the PSR that are \u201cmerely in the form of unsworn assertions ... are unreliable and should not be considered.\u201d <em>United States v. Lghodaro, </em>967 F.2d 1028, 1030 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Here, because no rebuttal evidence was presented, the district court was entitled to rely on the PSR and to adopt it without further inquiry. <em>See Ayala, </em>47 F.3d at 690; <em>United States v. Mir, </em>919 F.2d 940, 943 (5th Cir.1990). Insofar as the district court may have considered the prosecuting attorney\u2019s unsworn assertion that Sandoval and his brother obtained the home, this was not error given that other evidence supported the district court\u2019s sentencing determination. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>11 F.3d 505, 515 (5th Cir.1993), <em>reinstated in relevant part on rehearing en banc, </em>37 F.3d 160, 165 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">To the extent that Sandoval argues that application of the enhancement was erroneous because there were unresolved issues concerning the amount of time he spent at the residence and his activities there, he fails to establish error. It is apparent from the sentencing transcript that the district court credited the PSR\u2019s account of the probation officer\u2019s interview of Sandoval, in which Sandoval explained that he did not reside at the house where the maryuana was stored. Consistent with that explanation, Sandoval admitted at sentencing that there was no furniture in the house. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s determination that the residence was being used exclusively as a stash house is plausible in light of the record as a whole, and that determination supports the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 28. Sandoval has not shown reversible error in the application of the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Concerning the denial of a mitigating role adjustment, Sandoval argues that the district court erred by relying on the prosecuting attorney\u2019s unsworn assertions to determine that he managed the stash-house operation and that he rented the residence. He also asserts that the district court erred by making assumptions that went beyond the evidence as to his role in the offense. As discussed below, there is no merit to these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">It was Sandoval\u2019s burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995). Sandoval introduced no evidence to rebut the information in the PSR that showed that he rented the residence, transported marijuana to the residence, unloaded and safeguarded the contraband, and brought his brother into the operation of the stash house. To the extent that the district court made determinations about Sandoval\u2019s role that went beyond the specific evidence set forth in the PSR, its determinations were reasonable inferences drawn from the facts, and were not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b177-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
