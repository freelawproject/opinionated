Among other things, she alleges that the defendants conspired to divert her father\u2019s royalty earnings from \u201chis successors\u201d and that they breached \u201csongwriters contracts\u201d to avoid paying the royalties to the successors. She claims that the defendants engaged in copyright infringement and that they \u201cconspired against her so that she would not be able to recover her inheritance.\u201d She seeks $350,000,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss contending that Tennyson lacked standing to pursue any claims on behalf of her father\u2019s estate and that she failed to state a claim for relief. The district court determined that Tennyson\u2019s amended complaint alleged injury only to Bill Tennyson\u2019s estate. The court noted that Tennyson did not claim that she was the estate\u2019s personal representative or that she had any standing to represent the estate in court. As a result she had no standing to assert claims on the estate\u2019s behalf. The court also ruled that she lacked standing to assert a civil claim against the defendants for violating federal antitrust laws. Finally, the district court held under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) that Tennyson\u2019s amended complaint failed to state any claims, and her vague and conclusory antitrust and fraud allegations failed to comply with Rule (9)(b). This is Tennyson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for either lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) or for failure to state a claim under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Christian Coal. of Fla., Inc. v. United States, </em>662 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir.2011); <em>Catron v. City of St. Petersburg, </em>658 F.3d 1260, 1264 (11th Cir.2011). We also review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, <em>Keeton v. Anderson-Wiley, </em>664 F.3d 865, 868 (11th Cir.2011), and issues of constitutional standing, <em>Florida ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. U.S. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>648 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007), and <em>pro se </em>briefs, <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>2008). But a <em>pro se </em>party must \u201cfollow the rules of procedure and evidence, and the district court has no duty to act as [her] lawyer.\u201d <em>United States v. Ly, </em>646 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2011) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In her brief to this Court Tennyson contends that her family members, who are not parties to this appeal, have mishandled her father\u2019s estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">The Plaintiff was further shocked to find that her brother who had been given power of attorney as proxy administrator of her father, Bill Tennyson\u2019s estate, by agreement of her other brother, her sister and her mother, had proceeded to represent the \u201cTennyson family\u201d without notifying her, keeping all information secret from the Plaintiff. Decisions were made by the Plaintiffs brother and the rest of the \u201cTennyson Family\u201d that adversely affected the Plaintiff, Tanya Tennyson because they had reached some type of satisfactory agreement amongst themselves, but refused to discuss Bill Tennyson\u2019s music with the Plaintiff Tanya Tennyson at all, while the Plaintiffs mother and brother shared information about Bill Tennyson and his music with the Plaintiffs daughter instead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Appellant Br. at 2. Tennyson argues that she has standing to bring this lawsuit because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">The Plaintiffs Father\u2019s musical \u201cproperties\u201d are partially owned by Plaintiff through inheritance. If the \u201cadministrator (Plaintiffs mother) and her proxy (Plaintiffs brother) failed or did not want to act in behalf of Bill Tennyson\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d, and/or excluded Plaintiff, it is the Plaintiffs responsibility and right to claim compensation for personal damages caused by the defendants, and to act in my own behalf in a separate case to collect my share of my Father\u2019s income, which is what I have done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 6. The allegations that Tennyson makes on her own behalf are based on her dispute with her family members over how the estate should be administered and divided, but none of her family members are defendants. Her claims against the defendants are based on the allegation that the defendants caused the estate of her father to suffer damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">Only a real party in interest has the capacity to bring a lawsuit. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 17(a), (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The purpose of that rule \u201cis to enable the defendant to avail himself of evidence and defenses that the defendant has against the real party in interest, and to assure him finality of the judgment, and that he will be protected against another suit brought by the real party at interest on the same matter.\u201d <em>Celanese Corp. of Am. v. John Clark Indus., </em>214 F.2d 551, 556 (5th Cir.1954).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe capacity doctrine relates to the issue of a party\u2019s personal right to litigate in a federal court,\u201d <em>Glickstein v. Sun </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>Bank/Miami, N.A., </em>922 F.2d 666, 670 (11th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Saxton v. ACF Indus., Inc., </em>254 F.3d 959, 963 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">To determine whether Tennyson has the capacity to bring this lawsuit, we look to the law of the state where the federal district court sits, which is Florida. <em>See id. </em>Under Florida law the only party who has the capacity to sue on behalf of an estate is the duly appointed legal representative of the estate. <em>See Brake v. Murphy, </em>687 So.2d 842, 843 (Fla. 3d DCA 1996); <em>see also </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 733.607(1). Tennyson concedes in her brief to this Court that she is not the personal representative of her father\u2019s estate. Instead, she refers to her mother as the administrator, Appellant Br. at 6, and to her brother as the \u201cproxy administrator\u201d of the estate, <em>id. </em>at 2. She also she asserts that her brother \u201cfailed to perform the responsibilities of executorship, and sought to manage the music domain of Bill Tennyson without regard to her\u201d as a beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Tennyson claims that the def\u00e9ndants caused damages to her father\u2019s estate, but she cannot assert that claim because she is not the real party in interest. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(a). Tennyson lacks the capacity to bring a lawsuit against the defendants on behalf of the estate, and for that reason her claims were properly dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\">.
