State, </em>the Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed Anthony Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>son\u2019s convictions for \u201cattempted first degree murder and burglary with a battery while armed with a knife, in connection with the stabbing of Antron Pope inside Pope\u2019s home.\u201d 880 So.2d 1287 (Fla.3d D.C.A.2004). After exhausting his state remedies, Wilson petitioned the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied relief. Wilson appealed, and we issued a certif\u00edcate of appealability on one issue, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">Whether the district court erroneously applied the deference standard under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) to Wilson\u2019s claim, and, if so, whether the district court erred in finding that the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments, regarding whether Wilson believed that the other witnesses were lying and conspiring against him, did not constitute a violation of Wilson\u2019s constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">As the district court stated in denying habeas relief, the \u201cclaim\u201d Wilson presented was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">whether Wilson was denied a fundamentally fair trial due to alleged prosecutorial misconduct during cross-examination and closing arguments. Wilson allege[d] that the prosecutor was permitted to ask him ... whether the prosecution\u2019s witnesses were lied during their testimony and were conspiring against him. The prosecutor later made reference to Wilson\u2019s belief in the conspiracy against him during summation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Order, March 30, 2011, at 1-2, 2011 WL 1233279. The relevant portion of the challenged cross-examination was this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">Q: Now you sat there the whole time and listened to what everybody said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azz\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">Q: You heard what Kia said. That you were harassing Shirley, you were were coming by constantly and wouldn\u2019t go away?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-11\">A: I heard everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-12\">Q: You heard what Dakeidra said, you were coming to the house and you were harassing Shirley and wanted Shirley back. You heard that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-14\">Q: You heard Antron\u2019s testimony, yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFZ\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-15\">Q: And you heard today, Shirley\u2019s own mother come in here and testify about how you were threatening her daughter and how you were threatening Antron. But they\u2019re all lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-16\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection. He has to be here during trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-17\">THE COURT: No speaking objection. Objection overruled. Talk about it sidebar. Continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-18\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: May I have a sidebar? It is improper to ask one witness\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-19\">THE COURT: Stop, stop. That is a speaking objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-20\">Q: Do you believe that all these witnesses are conspiring against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-21\">A: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-22\">Q: That\u2019s what you think, this is a big conspiracy? You\u2019ve got the officer. You\u2019ve got Shirley\u2019s mother. You\u2019ve got Shirley\u2019s friend. You got Antron, the exboyfriend. You got everybody coming in here saying the same thing, but it is because they are conspiring against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKZ\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7qI\">That is argumentative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-24\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-25\">Q: Yes or no, are they conspiring against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-26\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-27\"><em>Id. </em>at 2. And the relevant portion of the challenged jury argument was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>You have heard from a lot of witnesses. [Wilson] yesterday tells you that its a conspiracy. Now, we\u2019ve heard a lot of preposterous things, but that is the ultimate. To say that Shirley\u2019s mother and Antron Pope, his family, his own friend, Dakeidra and Kia all came in here to conspire against him, because of what? Because it is not true. There is no conspiracy. The only thing we\u2019re trying to do is achieve the truth, get to justice, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision rejecting Wilson\u2019s due process claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Pursuant to the AEDPA, a district court must deny habeas relief to a state prisoner on claims that were previously adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless the state court\u2019s adjudication: \u201c(1) ... was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) ... was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). In this case, the questions we must decide are whether the Florida District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision rejecting the claim the district court set out above \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The district court of appeal found that the prosecutor\u2019s questions on cross-examination \u201cwere improper\u201d under Florida law, as announced in <em>Whitfield v. State, </em>549 So.2d 1202 (Fla.3d DCA 1989), but that the conduct constituted \u201charmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>880 So.2d at 1289. The court did not pass on the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cconspiracy\u201d comments to the jury because, in the court\u2019s reading of the trial transcript, the \u201cconspiracy of witnesses against Wilson was not mentioned during the State\u2019s closing argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court was mistaken; as indicated in the district court\u2019s order at 3, the conspiracy was mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Neither the district court of appeal\u2019s decision affirming Wilson\u2019s conviction nor the district court\u2019s order denying habeas relief cited a Supreme Court decision holding, or even intimating, that asking a defendant on cross-examination whether a prosecution witness lied constitutes a denial of due process of law. The same goes for the prosecutor\u2019s conspiracy references closing argument; neither Wilson nor the district court in its Order cites a Supreme Court decision anywhere in point. Nonetheless, we will assume for sake of argument that the Supreme Court would treat the prosecutorial conduct complained of as presenting <em>prima facie </em>a due process claim. Further, because the district court of appeal did not pass on the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cconspiracy\u201d comments in closing argument, we consider the propriety of the comments <em>de novo. </em>And doing so, we ask whether the trial court error \u2014 in overruling defense counsel\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning on cross-examination and (we assume) to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cconspiracy\u201d reference in closing argument\u2014 \u201c \u2018had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1722, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 766, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">We conclude that the error was harmless. As the district court of appeal remarked, \u201c[t]he questions [put to Wilson on cross-examination] cannot possibly vitiate the entire eight-day trial, and they did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>change the physical evidence of multiple stab wounds suffered by Pope. 880 So.2d at 1289. The same is true with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision denying Wilson habeas corpus relief is,</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
