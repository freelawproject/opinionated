After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">In March 1996, Williams pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>318 Fed.Appx. 859, 860 (11th Cir.2009). At sentencing in May 1996, the district court found that the guideline range was 360 months to life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>The court imposed a sentence of 360 months. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed. <em>Id. </em>In December 2007, following the adoption of Amendment 706 to the guidelines, Williams filed a motion for sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>In accordance with the amendment, the district court lowered Williams\u2019s offense level and imposed a sentence at the bottom of the recalculated guideline range of 324 to 405 months imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed that ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">In October 2011, in anticipation of Amendment 750 to the guidelines, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered the parties to respond to its proposal that Williams\u2019s sentence be further reduced to 262 months imprisonment, based upon the probation officer\u2019s determination that the recalculated guidelines range is 262 to 327 months imprisonment. The government did not object to the district court\u2019s proposed reduction. Williams, however, urged the district court to instead impose a sentence of 240 months imprisonment. On November 15, 2011, the district court rejected that request and, pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2), reduced Williams\u2019s sentence to 262 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">On appeal, Williams argues that the district court erred by not further reducing his sentence to 240 months. Williams emphasizes that under U.S.S.G <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u00a7 1B1.1, after a district court determines the guideline range that would apply in light of the offense level and criminal history category, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(a)(l)-(7), it must then identify the sentencing options available in light of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 lBl.l(a)(8). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1, \u201c[w]here the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5Gl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">According to Williams, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), compels the conclusion that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a), the statutory maximum for his offense is 240 months. Williams suggests that because this statutory maximum is below the guideline range of 262 to 327 months, the district court, in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a), was required to reduce his sentence to 240 months. We are not persuaded by this argument because it reflects the erroneous assumption that, in a Section 3582(c)(2) proceeding, a district court is free to revisit the statutory maximum for the purpose of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aryd\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ..., the court may reduce the term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission has promulgated a policy statement to govern such sentence reductions. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is warranted, the court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the guidelines ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced. In making such determination, <em>the court shall substitute only the amendments ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (2011) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">As this provision makes clear, and as the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement further confirms, \u201cproceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ... do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 IB 1.10(a)(3); <em>accord Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (\u201cBy its terms, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentencing proceeding.\u201d). The directive that the district court \u201cleave <em>all other </em>guideline application decisions unaffected,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (emphasis added), means that the district court here was required to adhere to its prior determination that the statutory maximum is life imprisonment. <em>See also id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 2 (\u201cAll other guideline application decisions remain unaffected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">It is true that, in order to \u201cdetermine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l), a district court must be mindful of any applicable statutory maximum. \u201cThe term \u2018guideline range\u2019 reflects the scope of sentences available,\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.2008), and just as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>a statutory minimum can effectively displace an otherwise applicable guideline range, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b); <em>see also Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340-41 (noting that in certain cases involving statutory minimums, the \u201cguideline range\u201d can involve \u201conly one number\u201d), so can a statutory maximum, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">However, it is clear that, in the context of Section 3582(c)(2), this is only a theoretical concern for a defendant like Williams. Section 3582(c)(2) applies only when the Sentencing Commission adopts a retroactively applicable amendment that lowers an otherwise applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.- \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1331.10(a)(1). After substituting the amendment for the guideline provision originally applied to the defendant, a district court must \u201cleave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). Thus, in the case of a defendant, like Williams, whose original sentence did not involve the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a), it is simply not possible for the statutory maximum to be lower than the now, even lower guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Williams attempts to avoid the limitations of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) by insisting that \u201cthe Constitution still applies.\u201d Williams thus appears to suggest that in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>the limitations in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) must be treated as nonbinding or otherwise cast aside. We reject this argument as well. Both the Supreme Court and this Court have held that, in a Section 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not require a district court to treat the limitations in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b) as nonbinding. <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2687; <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190 (11th Cir.2009). Given that <em>Booker </em>was an application of <em>Apprendi, see Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 243-44, 125 S.Ct. at 755-56, we see no reason why <em>Apprendi </em>itself requires a district court to disregard the limitations of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
