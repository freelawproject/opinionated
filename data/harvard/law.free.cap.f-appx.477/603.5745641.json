After a thorough review of the record, we affirm the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Johnson was charged along with numerous others with a drug conspiracy. He pleaded guilty and admitted that he distributed at least 200 grams but less than 300 grams of cocaine over a period of about eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The probation officer determined Johnson\u2019s adjusted offense level to be 17 based on the amount of drugs involved and Johnson\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. Calculating Johnson\u2019s criminal history, the probation officer assigned one point under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c) for a 2006 state-court conviction for possession of marijuana. With a total of 12 criminal history points, Johnson\u2019s criminal history category was V, which yielded a sentencing range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Johnson objected to the criminal history point for his marijuana possession, arguing that the offense was similar to public intoxication, which would not receive any criminal history points. The court overruled the objection, finding that the offenses exempt from points under \u00a7 4A1.2(c) did not include drug possession. After considering the arguments, the guideline range, and the sentencing factors, the court sentenced Johnson to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. Johnson now appeals, challenging the criminal history calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. McQueen, </em>670 F.3d 1168, 1169 (11th Cir.2012). Any error that does not affect substantial rights, however, may be disregarded as harmless. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The sentencing guidelines assign criminal history points for certain prior convictions. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2. Sentences for misdemeanors and petty offenses are counted, with certain exceptions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(c). Public intoxication is one of the crimes that is not counted, along with \u201coffenses similar to them, by whatever name they are known.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Although this circuit has not yet considered, in a published opinion, whether marijuana possession is similar to public intoxication for purposes of criminal history calculations, we need not address it here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the sentencing guidelines, the calculation of ten, eleven, or twelve points falls in category V. The court determined that Johnson had twelve points. Thus, even if we agreed that the court erred in its calculations, Johnson\u2019s eleven points would still yield a category V and any error by the district court was harmless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. At least two circuits have concluded that drug possession and public intoxication are not similar for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.2(c). <em>United States v. Russell, </em>564 F.3d 200, 206-07 (3d Cir.2009) (concluding, under plain error review, that marijuana possession was not similar to public intoxication); <em>United States v. Roy, </em>126 F.3d 953, 954-55 (7th Cir.1997) (concluding, under <em>de novo </em>and plain error review, that marijuana possession was not similar to public intoxication).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-13\">. We note that Johnson raised other objections to the criminal history calculations which, if sustained, could have reduced his criminal history category to III. Although he preserved his objections before the district court, he does not raise them on appeal, and in fact he concedes that the court did not err. Thus, these objections do not impact our harmless-error analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
