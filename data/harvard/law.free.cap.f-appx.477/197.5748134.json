Nathan, Mississippi prisoner #38465, proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis (IFP), appeals the dismissal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action. Nathan contends that prison officials violated his rights under the Due Process Clause by basing a disciplinary conviction on an incomplete urine test that gave a positive result for THC and because the hearing officer conducted an investigation by contacting the prison nurse to determine whether Nathan was on any medications that might give a false positive result.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">We review the dismissal as frivolous of a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1999). Section 1915(e) (2) (B) (i) provides that a district court shall dismiss an IFP complaint if the district court determines that the complaint is frivolous. A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact. <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). A complaint lacks an arguable basis in law if it is based on an \u201cindisputably meritless legal theory.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-16\">Nathan does not assert the Eighth Amendment claim raised in his complaint, nor does he challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his request for class certification. Although filings of pro se prisoners are to be liberally construed, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), a prisoner must provide arguments for this court\u2019s consideration. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524-25 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, these claims are not adequately briefed and are abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-17\">The punishment received for the disciplinary infraction was a reduction in line class. A reduction in line class or a change in custody status does not implicate a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause because the effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>those classifications on a prisoner\u2019s ultimate release date is too speculative. <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 958-59 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995). Likewise, a prisoner\u2019s change in custody status, including his placement in disciplinary segregation or lock-down; the loss of recreation and commissary privileges; and the imposition of cell restrictions, does not implicate a liberty interest because those punishments do not represent \u201cthe type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 768 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Luken, </em>71 F.3d at 193. The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Nathan\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action had no basis in law and was frivolous. <em>See Siglar, </em>112 F.3d at 193. Likewise, his appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Nathan\u2019s complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Because Nathan\u2019s prior appeal in <em>Nathan v. Smith, </em>73 Fed.Appx. 58, 59 (5th Cir.2003), was dismissed as frivolous, he now has accumulated three strikes. \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, Nathan is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
