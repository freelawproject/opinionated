After she was released, Pearson was arrested for shoplifting. The district court found that she had violated the conditions of her supervised release, revoked it, and sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>her to 11 months in prison. On appeal, Pearson contends that (1) the district court abused its discretion by revoking her supervised release without granting her request for a continuance to receive a mental health evaluation, and (2) her 11-month sentence is plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We review the revocation of a term of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Minnitt, </em>617 F.3d 327, 332 (5th Cir.2010). We also review a denial of a request for a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 439 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s denial of Pearson\u2019s last-minute request for a continuance so that she could obtain suggestions for treatment of her kleptomania was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and Pearson cannot demonstrate substantial prejudice because she admitted to violating the conditions of her supervised release. <em>See United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 439 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Barnett, </em>197 F.3d 138, 144 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Peden, </em>891 F.2d 514, 519-20 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Sentences imposed following revocation of supervised release are reviewed under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.) (suggesting similarity to \u201cplain error\u201d review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). Pearson\u2019s contention that the district court erred by sentencing her to 11 months in prison because the shoplifting violation carried only a six-month maximum sentence is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"Afq\">The district court did not commit any procedural errors when calculating Pearson\u2019s sentence because it considered the appropriate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, as well as the nonbinding policy statements of Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>520 F.3d 425, 427-28 (5th Cir.2008). As Pearson\u2019s underlying offense of conspiracy to possess and pass counterfeit money was a Class D felony, the maximum statutory sentence that could be imposed on revocation of her supervised release was two years. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). As her shoplifting offense was a Class C violation and her criminal history category was III at the time of her original sentence, Pearson\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment on revocation of her supervised release was five to 11 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(3), 7B1.4. The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Pearson to a within-statutory, within-guidelines sentence of 11-months in prison. <em>See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843; <em>McKinney, </em>520 F.3d at 427-28. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b171-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
