Council, proceeding pro <em>se, </em>appeals following the entry of final judgment in favor of his former employer, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cthe VA\u201d), on his discrimination and retaliation claims under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-26\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b671-27\">Council, a black male, filed several Title VII suits against the VA based on events that occurred while he was employed at its medical centers in Houston, Texas, and Orlando, Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although he raised numerous claims against the VA, only three are relevant to this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>alleged that the VA engaged in retaliation by improperly demoting him while he was in Houston. His second and third claims, respectively, alleged gender discrimination and retaliation in connection with the VA\u2019s termination of his employment in Orlando.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The VA denied liability, and moved for summary judgment following discovery. Evidence that the VA submitted in support of this motion showed that Council began working at its medical center in Houston in 2006 as an intern in the Technical Career Field (\u201cTCF\u201d) program, which trained candidates to effectively manage a pros-thetics service. Angela Bishop, the chief of the VA\u2019s Prosthetics Service in Houston and a white female, was Council\u2019s supervisor. She proposed removing him from the TCF program in April 2007, and his removal became effective on May 3, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Council complained to the VA\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity office (\u201cEEO\u201d) alleging race discrimination, gender discrimination, and retaliation following his removal from the TCF program and accompanying demotion. At one point, he mailed certain documents to a VA attorney in connection with the administrative complaint which contained \u201cpatient identifiable information,\u201d including names and social security numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Council subsequently transferred to a VA medical center in Orlando. However, the VA attorney in Houston informed Timothy Liezert, the director of that center, about Council\u2019s possession of documents containing this sensitive information, which led to an investigation and, according to the VA, Council\u2019s ultimate termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In the meantime, Council filed a second complaint with EEO officials, this time concerning his employment in Orlando. He alleged gender discrimination and retaliation in relation to the denial of a promotion; the receipt of a disciplinary letter; and the refusal to transfer him. An administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Council\u2019s March 2008 EEO claims. In doing so, the ALJ observed that Council did not contest his termination, choosing instead to pursue that dispute before the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Council did in fact contest his termination with the MSPB, but an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) upheld that decision as well. The ALJ, summarizing Council\u2019s claims, observed that he alleged \u201cthat he was subjected to discrimination based upon race, and that the VA\u2019s action was taken in retaliation for his prior EEO activity,\u201d and did not reference gender in denying these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">The district court granted summary judgment to the VA in part, but denied it in part. The court found that issues of material fact existed with respect to Council\u2019s retaliatory demotion claim. Turning to Council\u2019s employment in Orlando, the court found that Council failed to exhaust his claim that the VA terminated him as a result of gender discrimination because the termination-related claims he raised before the MSPB concerned only race discrimination and retaliation. The court did not expressly address whether Council\u2019s retaliatory firing claim was unexhausted, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>did find that claim to be without merit. In sum, in relevant part, the court denied the VA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Council\u2019s race retaliatory demotion claim, but granted summary judgment to the VA on his other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Council\u2019s retaliatory demotion claim proceeded to a jury trial in May 2011. During his case-in-chief, Council introduced a letter from VA officials articulating seven grounds for removing him from the TCF program and demoting him to the position of purchasing agent: (1) improperly delegating to Prosthetics Service administrative staff an assignment that he was instructed to perform personally; (2) \u201cinappropriately authorizing] the installation of unapproved software\u201d onto the Houston computer system; (3) failing to appear for a meeting with an instructor to discuss an assignment, or explain that absence; (4) refusing to receive training from the Prosthetics Program Support Assistant, telling her that he \u201cdid not need to know anything because [he] would surround [him]self with employees that knew what they were doing\u201d; (5) refusing to be trained by another staff member and making derogatory comments about her; (6) taking unapproved leave; and (7) failing to follow his supervisor\u2019s instructions to provide certain information for a human resources request.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Council questioned two witnesses about his termination in Orlando, but the district court reminded him that his trial was only about his demotion in Houston. It permitted Council to call Orlando witnesses only to show the VA\u2019s continued retaliatory intent by trying to affect his termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Council declined an opportunity to testify on his own behalf. He did, however, call Bishop, who testified that she hired him as a TCF intern in October 2006. She served as a preceptor in the TCF program, and in that capacity, assumed \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for his training.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Bishop recalled that, around January 2007, Council asked to be transferred to another location. While the VA\u2019s central office was open to a transfer as of February 2007, by March 19, 2007 it had advised Bishop that Council had to be \u201cdropped from the TC program.\u201d On April 12, 2007, Bishop sent an official response to Council\u2019s request for a transfer in which she acknowledged that he wanted a transfer because he believed he was not in \u201ca conducive learning environment,\u201d and advised him that she would \u201cremain actively involved and engaged in the oversight of [his] remaining internship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Bishop believed that she became aware that Council filed an EEO complaint against her by some point in April. The official reported notification date for his contact with the EEO office was April 23, 2007. Council\u2019s removal from the TCF program occurred on May 3, 2007. She denied that there was a relationship between the two events.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">According to Bishop, the VA\u2019s human resources department drafted the May 2007 demotion letter using information that Bishop provided. She believed that the performance-related allegations contained therein were true, and, when asked, explained the incidents that gave rise to these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">On cross-examination, Bishop explained that when Council began his internship in October 2006, work was light due to the holidays, and his performance declined as the work became more difficult.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>tionally, when Council found out that he would not be transferred, he \u201cshut down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Bishop and the VA\u2019s central office began contemplating Council\u2019s removal prior to April 10, 2007. She sent the April 12 letter so that there was closure on his transfer request, even though she knew that his removal was being contemplated. Although she could not recall the particular date that she learned that Council had filed an EEO complaint, she admitted to commenting that Council \u201chad a history of filing sexual harassment charges\u201d as of April 18, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Bishop denied ever discussing Council or his behavior with Orlando officials. She also denied that she recommended demoting Council as a result of either his race or his EEO activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Thereafter, the parties rested. At that time, Council did not make any motion, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), for judgment as a matter of law with respect to his retaliatory demotion claim. The jury ultimately returned a verdict for the VA, and, accordingly, the district court entered judgment in its favor. Council timely filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">A. Discriminatory Termination</p>\n<p id=\"Aal\">In his <em>pro se </em>brief on appeal, Council argues that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment to the VA on his claim that the VA terminated him because of his gender. He asserts that he exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Where appropriate, we review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de <em>novo, </em>viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Moton v. Cowart, </em>681 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2011). Generally, a party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of fact. <em>Burger King Corp. v. E-Z Eating, 41 Corp., </em>572 F.3d 1306, 1313 (2009). If the movant succeeds, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to show that issues of material fact exist. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">As a prerequisite to a Title VII action, a federal employee must pursue and exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>Brown v. Snow, </em>440 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2006); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) <em>(cross-referencing </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5). To successfully exhaust administrative remedies, the information that a claimant provides to the agency must \u201cenable the agency to determine what complaint of discrimination was made and when it had occurred.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Bergland, </em>614 F.2d 415, 418 (5th Cir.1980). \u201cEach incident of discrimination and each retaliatory adverse employment decision constitutes a <em>separate actionable </em>\u2018unlawful employment practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 114, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 2073, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">A federal employee with a \u201cmixed case,\u201d that is, a case alleging that a federal government agency terminated him as a result of unlawful race or gender discrimination, has the option of raising that issue before the agency\u2019s EEO office or the MSPB, but not both simultaneously. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.302(a)-(b); <em>Chappell v. Chao, </em>388 F.3d 1373, 1375 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512 (specifying the MSPB\u2019s ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>risdiction). An employee who chooses to bring a mixed case to the MSPB has three options following the MSPB\u2019s disposition of the claims, or lack of disposition within 120 days: (1) appeal the discrimination claim, on its own, to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; (2) drop the discrimination claims and appeal the other actions directly to the Federal Circuit; or (3) raise the action in district court. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7702(b)(1), (e)(1)(B); 7703(b). For those who take the third option, \u201ca final decision from the MSPB exhausts an employee\u2019s administrative remedies and allows him to seek judicial review.\u201d <em>Chappell, </em>388 F.3d at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Council may contest the district court\u2019s exhaustion ruling despite his failure to dispute it in response to the VA\u2019s motion for summary judgment, <em>see Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., </em>43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir.1995) (en banc), the record contradicts Council\u2019s assertions. As a federal employee, Council was entitled to raise his claim that the VA terminated him based on gender before either: (1) the VA\u2019s EEO office; or (2) the MSPB. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.302(b). According to the VA\u2019s evidence, however, his MSPB claims did not allege gender discrimination. Council did not submit any evidence to discharge his burden to rebut this showing. <em>See Burger King, </em>572 F.3d at 1313. Thus, the uncon-troverted evidence demonstrated that his proceedings before the MSPB would not entitle him to judicial review of this claim. <em>See Chappell, </em>388 F.3d at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Similarly, while Council\u2019s EEO complaint alleged that gender discrimination motivated a number of the VA\u2019s actions against him in Orlando, the ALJ who resolved that complaint\u2019s claims explicitly noted that Council did not contest his termination in his EEO complaint. The fact that Council articulated a gender discrimination theory in general did not entitle him to use that theory to challenge different actions in federal court once the EEO office issued its decision. <em>See Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>536 U.S. at 114, 122 S.Ct. at 2073. Because Council did not allege before either the EEO officials or the MSPB that the VA terminated him based on gender, that claim was unexhausted, and the district court properly granted summary judgment to the VA in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">B. Retaliatory Termination</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Council further asserts that the district court improperly found that his retaliatory termination claim was unexhausted because he raised that claim before the MSPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Contrary to Council\u2019s assertion, the district court\u2019s order reflects that it did not resolve this claim on exhaustion grounds, but rather, found it to be without merit. Aside from his exhaustion-based argument, Council raises no other challenge to the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on this claim. As we cannot consider the merits of the ultimate ruling without constructing arguments for him, he has necessarily failed to demonstrate any entitlement to relief. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008); <em>GJR Invs. v. Escambia Cnty., Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that the leniency afforded to <em>pro se </em>litigants \u201cdoes not give a court license to ... rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action\u201d) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm the entry of summary judgment on Council\u2019s retaliatory termination claim without considering its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">C. Retaliatory Demotion</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">Council\u2019s final argument is that the jury verdict in favor of the VA on his retaliatory demotion claim was flawed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>He asserts that the VA demoted him merely ten days after his contact with EEO officials, which he asserts was a striking contrast to its April 12, 2007 memorandum notifying him that he would remain in the TCF program. He further asserts that the evidence rebutted the VA\u2019s articulated reasons for his demotion, because it showed that he: (i) never installed unapproved software; (ii) performed work assignments adequately; (iii) did not refuse training; and (iv) was never absent without approval. He also maintains that the VA\u2019s evidence was either inconsistent or false.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">We ordinarily review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence to support a verdict at a civil trial, inquiring whether, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, \u201cno legally sufficient evi-dentiary basis exists for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.\u201d <em>Rossbach v. City of Miami, </em>371 F.3d 1354, 1356 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted); <em>but see Wilson v. Attaway, </em>757 F.2d 1227, 1237 &amp; n. 3 (11th Cir.1985) (holding that, absent a Rule 50(a) motion before the close of all evidence, and irrespective of whether the plaintiff in a civil case subsequently files a post-judgment motion, review of the evidence supporting a verdict will be \u201climited to whether there was <em>any </em>evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, irrespective of its sufficiency, or whether plain error was noted which, if not noticed, would result in a \u2018manifest miscarriage of justice\u2019 \u201d); <em>Rand v. Nat\u2019l Fin. Ins. Co., </em>304 F.3d 1049, 1051 (11th Cir.2002) (observing that in some cases, we have declined altogether to review a challenge to the evidence supporting a jury verdict absent a Rule 50(a) motion prior to the verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Here, we need not decide whether Council can challenge the jury\u2019s verdict against him or whether the \u201cany evidence\u201d standard should apply to resolve that issue, because ample evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Title VII prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who oppose unlawful employment practices, including racial discrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a) (extending Title VII protection to federal employees); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.101(b). An employee bears the burden of proving a Title VII violation by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Burns v. Gadsden State Cmty. Coll., </em>908 F.2d 1512, 1517 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">When a retaliation claim is fully tried, the burden-shifting framework set out in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), will cease to apply. <em>St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 510-11, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2749, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). But an employer\u2019s intent is likely to remain circumstantial. <em>US Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 716, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 1482, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">At trial, a court may give credence to undisputed evidence, but otherwise, credibility determinations, are left to the jury. <em>Akouri v. State of Fla. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>408 F.3d 1338, 1348 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to disturb a jury\u2019s finding that discrimination occurred when the employer\u2019s challenge to that finding rested on a manager\u2019s denial that he made a discriminatory statement, as this created a credibility issue). Likewise, the jury\u2019s disbelief of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons for taking allegedly retaliatory action may permit it to find that an intentional Title VII violation occurred, but will not necessarily require such a finding. <em>St. Mary, </em>509 U.S. at 511, 113 S.Ct. at 2749. Still, even jury verdicts must be supported by more than a tenuous connection between a materially adverse action and a protected ground. <em>See Brown v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>1181-88 (11th Cir.2010) (reversing jury verdict on retaliation claims based entirely on \u201cwholly generalized\u201d evidence concerning her reactions with a manager, which occurred months prior to the alleged adverse employment actions); <em>Sullivan v. Nat\u2019l RR Passenger Corp., </em>170 F.3d 1056, 1061 (11th Cir.1999) (reversing jury verdict in favor of employee because evidence relating to his qualifications for promotion was too \u201cspeculative\u201d to call into question evidence relating to the employer\u2019s explanation for promoting someone else).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Here, ample evidence supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that Council did not meet his burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the VA engaged in unlawful retaliation by removing him from the TCF program and demoting him. <em>See Burns, </em>908 F.2d at 1517. To the extent the jury credited the VA\u2019s explanations for demoting Council, its decision was well-supported. <em>See St. Mary, </em>509 U.S. at 511, 113 S.Ct. at 2749. Specifically, Bishop testified that she could not recall when she became aware of his EEO charge, and denied demoting him in retaliation for it. Although she commented about Council\u2019s \u201chistory\u201d of filing sexual harassment claims on April 18, 2007, VA officials had resolved to remove him from the TCF program by at least April 10, 2007, and as early as March 19, 2007. <em>See Sullivan, </em>170 F.3d at 1061. Although Bishop was aware that Council requested a transfer out of Houston at some point in February, the available evidence shows that the reason for his request was simply that Houston was not \u201ca conducive learning environment.\u201d Thus, we need not speculate that Bishop was aware prior to April that Council opposed discrimination. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Furthermore, Bishop provided detailed explanations as to each of the seven grounds for choosing to demote Council, all of which tended to show that, as the workplace grew busier, Council performance worsened and he adopted an attitude toward others that was both defiant and hostile. Council\u2019s evidence relating to the amount of time that had passed between his complaints and demotion could not, without more, overcome these explanations. <em>See Brown, </em>597 F.3d at 1181-83. In large part, the VA made its case through Bishop, who both parties were able to examine in full. The jury, after hearing questioning intended to imply that the grounds upon which the VA based Council\u2019s demotion was a cover-up for retaliation, was entitled to believe Bishop\u2019s more benign justifications. <em>See Akouri, </em>408 F.3d at 1348. As such, the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the VA not only existed, but existed in abundance.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the entry of judgment for the VA on Council\u2019s Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-18\">. The district court later consolidated these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-28\">. We hold that Council\u2019s remaining claims, as well as his claims against other defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>are abandoned due to his failure to challenge their disposition in his initial appellate brief. <em>Timson </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\"While we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a pro se litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d) (citation omitted). To the extent we construe his brief to challenge to the disposition of any other claims, they are supported by arguments raised for the first time on appeal, which we likewise decline to consider. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 828 n. 1 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that a <em>pro se </em>litigant waived arguments that he did not pursue before the district court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">.
