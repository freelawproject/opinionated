After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b651-28\">After his first trial ended in a mistrial, Sims was convicted in his second trial. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>understand the issue on appeal, we review what happened at both trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">A. First State Court Trial and Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In 2001, Sims was charged with two counts of driving under the influence, causing serious bodily injury, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 SIG.IDBIS).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sims stopped his pickup truck in the middle of the highway at night. Another vehicle then struck Sims\u2019s stopped truck, resulting in injuries to the other vehicle\u2019s occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">During the 2003 trial, Roy Welch, a truck driver, testified that on the night of July 27, 2001, he encountered a pickup truck stopped in the middle of the road with its lights on. As Welch maneuvered his 18-wheeler around the pickup truck, he could not see anyone inside the pickup truck or on the side of the road. Welch drove to his nearby home and called 911 to advise authorities of the stopped pickup truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Within about fifteen minutes, Welch returned to the stopped pickup truck to place flashers around it. By that time, another vehicle already had struck the pickup truck from behind. Welch found Defendant Sims walking around the crash site and saw beer cans scattered across the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Ronald Allen, the driver of the other vehicle, testified that he was driving with his four-year-old son sleeping next to him. Allen looked down at his son and then up and saw the pickup truck stopped in the middle of the road, with the driver slumped over the wheel. Allen applied his brakes, but collided with the rear of the pickup truck. Allen went through the front windshield, landed in the road and broke his sternum. His son had a broken leg. A helicopter flew Allen and his son to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Trooper Richard Gill, a Florida Highway Patrolman, responded to the crash and testified about his investigation. After smelling alcohol on Defendant Sims\u2019s breath, Trooper Gill administered field sobriety tests, which indicated that Sims was impaired. Although Trooper Gill did not personally observe Sims driving, Sims admitted he was driving the truck. Trooper Gill did not observe any visible injuries on Sims, and Sims told Trooper Gill he was not hurt. Sims also told Trooper Gill he was a diabetic, but Sims did not appear to be affected by his diabetes at the time, only intoxicated. When Trooper Gill asked Sims whether he needed medical assistance, Sims initially indicated he did not need to go to the hospital. When Trooper Gill explained that Sims could either be arrested at the scene or transported to the hospital, Sims elected to go to the hospital. A later blood test indicated that Sims\u2019s blood alcohol level was .113 or .114, above the legal limit of .08.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">Sims\u2019s defense was that he had not been driving the truck. Sims\u2019s defense counsel elicited testimony from several witnesses to the aftermath of the crash \u2014 including Welch, Trooper Gill, another trooper and a paramedic \u2014 that Sims was outside the truck and appeared uninjured.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">The State sought to introduce Sims\u2019s hospital records indicating that Sims was injured when he struck his head on the windshield of his pickup truck. The State subpoened the hospital records to complete its file. Neither the State nor Sims\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>counsel saw the contents of the hospitals records until the records custodian produced them in court the day of trial. Sims\u2019s counsel objected because the government had not produced the records during discovery and had not followed Florida law in obtaining them. However, Sims\u2019s counsel added that he did \u201cnot in any way mean[ ] to suggest that the State was trying to ambush the defense....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The state trial court found that allowing the records to come in \u201cat the last minute\u201d was \u201chighly prejudicial.\u201d The state trial court refused to admit the records because they \u201cshould have been disclosed\u201d during discovery, and both parties \u201cshould have known about them way before now.\u201d The State asked to \u201creserve the right to call it for rebuttal if the defendant puts on evidence that he [was] not in the vehicle.\u201d The trial court ruled that the records could not be admitted on rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The State then indicated that it intended to recall Trooper Gill to testify that, after the crash, Sims said he was wearing the driver-side seatbelt and was injured in the crash. The trial court expressed concern about the prosecutor recalling Trooper Gill to ask questions about injuries documented in the excluded hospital records. Sims\u2019s counsel objected to Trooper Gill being recalled, stating, \u201c[I]f they\u2019re inclined to go into that, then I would move for a mistrial. I don\u2019t want to move for a mistrial at this point in time based on the state of the record. However, you know, I mean it\u2019s real difficult when you get certain questions and answers out of witnesses and you proceed along and then all of a sudden there\u2019s going to be a change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The trial court stressed that the hospital records \u201cbring[] out things that are not even close to what\u2019s coming out here on the testimony.\u201d After further discussion, the trial court stated that it was going to declare a mistrial. The State requested permission to speak with Sims\u2019s counsel before the trial court declared a mistrial. The State\u2019s and Sims\u2019s counsel then had a brief, off-the-record discussion in the hallway. When they returned, Sims\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cJudge, we\u2019ll abide by the Court\u2019s ruling I think is the consensus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The state trial court then declared a mistrial and discharged the jury. The trial court agreed to defense counsel\u2019s request to place the case on a sixty-day calendar so Sims could take depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">B. Second State Court Trial</p>\n<p id=\"Am_\">In October 2003, prior to the second trial, Sims\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. The motion argued that the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial barred retrial because Sims did not adopt the mistrial ruling and jeopardy attached. The State responded that trial counsel\u2019s statement that Sims would \u201cabide\u201d by the trial court\u2019s ruling amounted to a consent to the mistrial under Florida law, citing <em>Adkins v. Smith, </em>205 So.2d 530, 531 (Fla.1967) (finding defense counsel\u2019s statement that he had \u201cnothing to say\u201d on the state\u2019s proposed motion for a mistrial was consent).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The state trial court denied the motion to dismiss. The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-12\">I have gone over this and go back looking at the record and remembering what took place. I just felt at that time that the problem with the record \u2014 the records would have led in if I said they were coming in, then the defense would have been highly prejudiced. If I didn\u2019t let them in the state was going to be prejudiced and I felt like using the language they used here with the totality of the situation and all it was going on at that particular point in order for justice to be served that a mistrial needed to be declared and get that discovery and deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>with it and then come back and try the case. So I am going to deny the motion, Mr. Taylor, and go to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In the second trial, the jury found Sims guilty on both counts. Sims was sentenced to consecutive terms of 60 months\u2019 and 43 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Sims appealed the convictions, arguing that the trial court had erred in denying his motion to dismiss because Sims did not consent to the mistrial and the mistrial was not supported by manifest necessity. The First District Court of Appeal (\u201cFirst DCA\u201d) summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Sims then filed a <em>pro se </em>state petition for habeas corpus relief with the First DCA, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial counsel was ineffective for consenting to the mistrial. The First DCA denied Sims\u2019s state habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">C. Rule 3.850 Motion for Post-conviction Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In April 2006, Sims filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 in the Circuit Court of the Third Judicial Circuit of Florida (\u201c3.850 court\u201d). Relevant to this appeal, Sims argued that his trial counsel was ineffective in consenting to the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial because there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial and counsel\u2019s consent deprived Sims of his double jeopardy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The 3.850 court initially denied relief on Sims\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, but then granted Sims\u2019s motion for rehearing and scheduled an evidentiary hearing. At the hearing, Sims\u2019s 3.850 counsel stated that trial counsel was unable to attend. Instead, Sims submitted two letters by trial counsel, which were admitted in lieu of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Trial counsel\u2019s first letter, dated October 31, 2003, advised Sims, <em>inter alia, </em>that he might have an ineffective assistance claim that he may raise in a 3.850 motion. Trial counsel\u2019s letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">That motion would allege, if the facts bear out, that I should have specifically renewed my objection to a mistrial in the first trial. That renewal or filing of an objection should have been done once the court indicated on its own that it was going to declare a mistrial. I knew I had told the court that I did not want a mistrial, but the record reflects that it was done before the court entered its order and not after. That issue may be significant down the road, and in that regard, you would need another attorney to handle that portion of your case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2E\">The letter also stated that trial counsel was \u201cupset that the jury did not agree with [Sims\u2019s] version of events,\u201d and admitted that \u201cas is always the case when there is an unsuccessful trial verdict, this lawyer rehashes and rethinks and second guesses questions that should have been asked, others that should not have been asked, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Trial counsel\u2019s second letter, dated September 18, 2007, was sent to the State prosecutor and enclosed the first, October 31, 2003 letter. In the second letter, trial counsel stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that the October 31, 2003 letter was an accurate statement of trial counsel\u2019s recollection of what occurred during the first trial and that trial counsel believed he had \u201cfailed\u201d Sims by stating to the trial court that Sims \u201cwould \u2018abide\u2019 by the ruling re the mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">D. Denial of 3.850 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">The 3.850 court denied Sims\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. At the outset, the 3.850 court clarified that it need not determine whether Sims\u2019s counsel had consented to the mistrial because that question was al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>ready decided when Florida\u2019s First DCA on direct appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Sims\u2019s motion to dismiss. Therefore, the only issue before the 3.850 court was whether, under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), trial counsel\u2019s consent constituted deficient performance that prejudiced Sims. The 3.850 court concluded that Sims had not shown deficient performance or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">As to performance, the 3.850 court found that Sims had not carried his burden to show that his trial counsel\u2019s \u201cconsent to a mistrial was deficient and not the product of a sound trial strategy.\u201d The 3.850 court found that trial counsel\u2019s letter was a second-guessing of himself through hindsight, that Sims had presented no evidence as to whether the first trial was going favorably or unfavorably at that point in time and that Sims had not overcome the presumption that trial counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">This letter serves only to prove that Trial Counsel has rehashed, rethought, and second guessed his decisions stemming from an unfavorable trial, which is consistent with his practice after all unsuccessful trial verdicts. As stated by the Florida Supreme Court, an attorney\u2019s second guessing himself through the beneficial lens of hindsight is of little persuasion in those proceedings. Further, this Court points out that neither party secured the attendance of Trial Counsel to testify at the evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, there was no evidence presented regarding whether the trial was progressing favorably or unfavorably, whether the State had yet proven or not yet proven the elements of the crime, or whether Trial Counsel\u2019s observations of the jury led him to believe a favorable verdict was more or less likely. Without evidence regarding the totality of the circumstances as they existed, this Court find that the Defendant has not overcome the presumption that Trial Counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable and effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">(Citation, quotation marks and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">As to prejudice, the 3.850 court concluded that Sims had not shown that, absent trial counsel\u2019s consent to the mistrial, the State was barred from retrying him. The 3.850 court noted that the trial court\u2019s comments, both at the first trial and at the hearing before the second trial, made clear that the trial judge considered a mistrial manifestly necessary, whether or not Sims\u2019s counsel consented, and that Sims had not called the trial judge to testify to the contrary. The 3.850 court emphasized that the trial court\u2019s denial of Sims\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds was raised on direct appeal and affirmed. The First DCA affirmed the denial of Sims\u2019s 3.850 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">E. Section 2254 Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">In June 2009, Sims filed his <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition alleging that: (1) his second trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause; and (2) that his trial counsel was ineffective for consenting to a mistrial at his first trial. The district court denied Sims\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. This Court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of \u201c[wjhether Sims was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to object after the court <em>sua sponte </em>declared a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">To establish constitutionally ineffective assistance, the defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>diced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. To establish deficient performance, the petitioner must show his counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable in light of prevailing professional norms. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. To satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong, the petitioner \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Furthermore, a federal court may not grant habeas relief on ineffective assistance claims that were previously decided in state court, unless the state court decision was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d; or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Section 2254(d) \u201cimposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings_\u201d <em>Hardy v. Cross, </em>565 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 490, 491, 181 L.Ed.2d 468 (2011) (quoting <em>Felkner v. Jackson, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1305, 1307, 179 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Our standard of review is \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d when \u201ca <em>Strickland </em>claim [is] evaluated under the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) standard.\u201d <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 123, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009). \u201cThe question is not whether a federal court believes the state court\u2019s determination under the <em>Strickland </em>standard was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable \u2014 a substantially higher threshold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">15. Sims\u2019s Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">Sims has not shown that the 3.850 court\u2019s denial of his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland </em>or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. Sims claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for consenting, rather than objecting, to the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial in the first trial. Sims\u2019s ineffective assistance claim rests on the assumption that if his trial counsel had objected to the mistrial, the state trial court necessarily would have still granted a mistrial, and Sims then would have prevailed on his subsequent motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. For several reasons, we cannot say the 3.850 court unreasonably concluded that Sims had not shown deficient performance or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">First, there is no showing that if defense counsel had objected, the state trial court would have still declared a mistrial to even create a double jeopardy issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-17\">Second, even if the state trial court still would have declared a mistrial, the state trial court can properly do so even over a defendant\u2019s objection. In the case of a mistrial, the double jeopardy bar to a second trial can be lifted either by the defendant\u2019s consent to the mistrial or by the trial court\u2019s finding, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the mistrial is a \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 671-72, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2087-88, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). When the defendant does, not consent, trial judges still have broad discretion to <em>sua sponte </em>declare a mistrial \u201c \u2018whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ation, there is a manifest necessity for doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Renico v. Lett, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 1863, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824)). The trial court need not make an explicit finding of manifest necessity or articulate on the record the factors that led to that conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 1863-64. \u201cA trial judge properly exercises his discretion to declare a mistrial if an impartial verdict cannot be reached, or if a verdict of conviction could be reached but would have to be reversed on appeal due to an obvious procedural error in the trial.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 464, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 1070, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Third, in any event, Sims did not submit any evidence showing that no reasonable attorney in his trial counsel\u2019s shoes would have consented (or failed to object) to the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>mistrial, especially given the strong evidence against Sims at that point in time. Trial counsel\u2019s correspondence says nothing about the progress of the trial at that point in time or counsel\u2019s decisionmaking or counsel\u2019s reasons for abiding by the trial court\u2019s ruling. The letters do not even admit that trial counsel consented to the mistrial or did so erroneously. Contrary to Sims\u2019s claim, the letters do not show trial counsel\u2019s ignorance of the legal standards applicable to double jeopardy and mistrials. As the 3.850 court explained, these letters amount only to trial counsel\u2019s \u201crehashing\u201d with the benefit of hindsight and do not prove that trial counsel\u2019s consent (or failure to object) to the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial was objectively unprofessional at the point in time it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Moreover, we know from the record of the first trial that the State had already presented sufficient evidence from Allen, Welch and Trooper Gill at that point in time to convict Sims. The jury already had heard that Sims\u2019s truck was stopped in the middle of the road, that the victim saw someone slumped over the steering wheel, that Sims was present at the scene and appeared impaired, that Sims admitted he had been driving and that Sims\u2019s blood-alcohol level still was above the legal limit over four hours after the crash. The trial, if anything, was not going favorably for Sims.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Under these circumstances, Sims simply did not present any evidence to provide the kind of context that might rebut the presumption of reasonableness. As such, we cannot say the 3.850 court unreasonably concluded that Sims did not overcome the \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that trial counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and, therefore, that Sims\u2019 did not carry his burden to show deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">As to prejudice, the record, if anything, shows that the trial court declared the mistrial <em>sua sponte </em>primarily based on manifest necessity due to the hospital records, and not necessarily based on Sims\u2019s consent. As the trial court explained when it denied Sims\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial was based on the \u201ctotality of the situation\u201d and because justice required a mistrial to allow the parties to obtain \u201cdiscovery and deal with it and then come back and try the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">For all of these reasons, the 3.850 court did not act contrary to, or unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>apply, <em>Strickland </em>in rejecting Sims\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\">.
