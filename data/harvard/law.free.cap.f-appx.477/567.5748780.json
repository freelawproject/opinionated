The IJ\u2019s decision denied asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">We review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions in this case because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that when the BIA agrees with a finding of the IJ, we review both decisions). We review legal determinations <em>de novo. Id. </em>And we review fact determinations under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test\u201d whereby we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (<em>en banc). </em>We \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the ... decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. To reverse a fact determination, we must conclude \u201cthat the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Men</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>doza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d that is, a person unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including political opinion and membership in a particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Njoroge sought relief based on his political opinion and his membership in a particular social group.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Njoroge contended that he owned several properties in Kenya and that it was known in the community that he was a wealthy landowner. He alleged that he was first approached for money by the Mungiki \u2014 a Kenyan anti-government guerilla group \u2014 in 1982 and that he refused to make a monetary contribution to their organization. Then, between 1990 and 2005, Njoroge received several harassing phone calls and threatening letters from the Mungiki demanding money. Because he refused to cooperate, the Mungiki allegedly burglarized his home and vandalized his property on several occasions, including killing and stealing his livestock, destroying his crops, and burning down his place of business. In 2006, after a neighbor was killed, Njoroge and his wife fled to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The IJ determined that the Mungiki was a criminal organization that targeted Njo-roge because of his wealth, not because of a statutorily protected ground. As a result, the IJ concluded that Njoroge was ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal. The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s assessment that Njoroge failed to demonstrate a nexus between his political opinion and the alleged past or future persecution by the Mungiki.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">An alien who alleges persecution by a guerilla group on account of his political opinion \u201cmust establish that the guerillas persecuted [him] or will seek to persecute [him] in the future <em>because of </em>[his] actual or imputed political opinion.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person \u25a0has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006). Moreover, \u201cthe mere existence of a generalized \u2018political\u2019 motive underlying the guerrillas\u2019 [activities] is inadequate to establish ... the proposition that [the petitioner] fears persecution <em>on account </em>o/political opinion.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Thus, merely alluding to the guerilla movement\u2019s possible political motives is insufficient to satisfy a petitioner\u2019s burden. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">After review, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions that Njoroge failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion; and we are not compelled to reverse the decision. Nothing evidences that the events that Njoroge experienced \u2014 including threatening phone calls and letters and vandalism to his home and business \u2014 were based on his actual or imputed political opinion. First, Njoroge is not a member of a political party and testified that he supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>whatever government is in power. To the extent that the Mungiki had a political agenda with which Njoroge disagreed, that alone is insufficient to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>112 S.Ct. at 816. Moreover, the testimony of Njo-roge and Njoroge\u2019s own expert witness establishes that the Mungiki is a criminal organization \u2014 known for extortion \u2014 that targeted Njoroge because of his wealth and because he refused to comply with its monetary demands. And it is well-established that neither being the victim of extortion nor being targeted for refusing to cooperate with a criminal organization constitute viable grounds for asylum relief. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions that Njoroge was unentitled to asylum; and we are not compelled to reverse the decisions. Njoroge\u2019s failure to establish eligibility for asylum forecloses his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">. Njoroge\u2019s asylum application also sought derivative relief for his wife, Lucy Michuki, who is listed as a petitioner in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\">. The IJ also denied relief under the Convention Against Torture. We will not address this claim, however, because Njoroge failed to challenge this denial in his appeal to the BIA \u2014 -and, thus, failed to exhaust his administrative remedies \u2014 and fails to raise the issue on appeal. See <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">. On appeal, Njoroge does not challenge the IJ's and the BIA's denial of relief based on his membership in a particular social group. Thus, that issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
