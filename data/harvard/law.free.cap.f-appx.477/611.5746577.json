Law-ton pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute over 50 grams of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and carrying a firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Lawton originally had been sentenced to 156 months\u2019 imprisonment for the drug offense and a consecutive 60-month term for the firearm offense, with this sentence including a 79-month downward departure based on the government\u2019s substantial-assistance motion. In 2008, Lawton filed his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion pursuant to Amendments 706 and 713 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which the district court granted. The district court applied a percentage-based approach for calculating the extent of the previous downward departure, and resentenced Lawton to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment for the drug offense, which was below the amended range of 188 to 235 months. Lawton subsequently filed a second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion pursuant to Amendment 750, which the district court denied because it did not lower his guideline range further. On appeal, Lawton asserts that, although Amendment 750 does not reduce his guideline range, changes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) support a reduction in his sentence because he should receive a flat reduction of the original 79-month amount of his downward departure, not just a percentage of the departure from the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">\u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Part A of Amendment 750 amended \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and reducing offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750, Pt. A, <em>cross referencing </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 748 (2011). Amendment 750 became effective on November 1, 2011. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">A district court may modify a defendant\u2019s previously imposed imprisonment sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the relevant amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) and the reduction is consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Parts A and C of Amendment 750 to the Guidelines may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c). Pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10, the applicable policy statements provide that a reduction in the imprisonment term is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201cthe court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant\u201d if the applicable retroactive amendment \u201chad been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). All of the other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing proceeding remain unaffected. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. Under the second step, the court must decide whether, to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The district court is required to apply the version of \u00a7 1B1.10 that is in effect at the time that it rules on the \u00a7 3582 motion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.6) (Nov. 1, 2011). Amendment 759 made changes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u00a7 1B1.10, which became effective on November 1, 2011, and would apply to any \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion decided on or after that date. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. Section 1B1.10 now provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGb\">If the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B). The commentary regarding this provision notes that the district court is not limited by the guideline range if the defendant\u2019s sentence was reduced pursuant to a government motion for substantial assistance. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.3). However, in describing what a \u201ccomparably less\u201d sentence would be, the - commentary adopts a percentage-based approach, noting that, if the original sentence was reduced by 20 percent, then the amended sentence also may be reduced by 20 percent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\u201c[A] party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate. Otherwise, the issue\u2014 even if properly preserved at trial \u2014 will be considered abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">As an initial matter, because Lawton does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that Amendment 750 did not reduce his guideline range, he has abandoned any challenge to this finding. Because Amendment 750 did not lower Law-ton\u2019s guideline range, a reduction is not authorized. In addition, Lawton\u2019s argument that the changes to \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) create ambiguity on whether the district court should have reduced his sentence by the original 79-month departure fails because the commentary to that guideline specifically supports the district court\u2019s percentage-based approach in granting his prior \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that Lawton was ineligible for a reduced sentence because Amendment 750 did not change his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
