The district court sentenced Dorsey to 114 months in prison on Counts 1, 3, and 4; a consecutive 30 months in prison on Count 2; and a consecutive 120 months in prison on Count 5. He appeals his sentence for Counts 1, 3, and 4, contending that the district court erred by concluding that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 did not apply retroactively to his case. He also appeals his sentence for Count 5, contending that Count 5 does not constitute a second or subsequent conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We turn first to Irby\u2019s contention that the Fair Sentencing Act applied retroactively to his case. In <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), the Supreme Court held that the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s \u201cnew, more lenient mandatory minimum provisions ... apply\u201d to defendants who committed a crack cocaine crime before the Act went into effect but whom the district court did not sentence until after it went into effect. Dorsey committed his crack cocaine crimes before the Act went into effect but was not sentenced until after it was effective. The district court faithfully followed our precedent holding that the Fair Sentencing Act was not applicable to cases like this one, but in light of <em>Dorsey, </em>we vacate Irby\u2019s sentence for Counts 1, 3, and 4, and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">We next turn to Irby\u2019s contention that Count 5 is not second or subsequent conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). If a defendant receives a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction under \u00a7 924(c), he is subject to a mandatory consecutive sentence of 25 years for that second conviction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). A district court may deem one of two \u00a7 924(c) convictions charged in the same indictment as a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). <em>United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1111-12 (11th Cir.2010) (noting that we \u201clong ago rejected\u201d the argument that a district court cannot impose a 25-year sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) for a conviction contained in the same indictment as the other \u00a7 924(c) conviction); <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 134-35, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 1997-98, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993). Thus, the district court did not err in considering one of Irby\u2019s two \u00a7 924(c) convictions a second or subsequent conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) even though the two \u00a7 924(c) convictions were charged in the same indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Irby\u2019s sentence on Counts 1, 3, and 4, and REMAND for resentencing. We AFFIRM Irby\u2019s sentence on Count 5.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-10\">. Because we vacate Irby's sentence for Counts 1, 3, and 4, we do not reach his contention that the district court erred by concluding that two of his prior convictions constituted separate offenses for the purpose of his sentence enhancement under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
