The district court recharacterized his petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it as a successive and unauthorized motion. Shoupe now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) and argues that he may bring his challenge as a \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. He also moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Because Shoupe sought relief under \u00a7 2241, he is not required to obtain a COA to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2241 relief. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). His motion for a COA, therefore, is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Because Shoupe challenged his sentence, and because \u00a7 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence, the district court did not err by recharacterizing Shoupe\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Before Shoupe may file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, he must obtain an order from this court authorizing the district court to consider a second or successive application. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h). Shoupe has not sought or obtained leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Therefore the district court properly dismissed his motion as successive and unauthorized. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255, Shoupe may attack his federal sentence under \u00a7 2241 if he shows that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). The bar against filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 878. The savings clause applies only to claims that were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion,\u201d if the claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">Shoupe asserts that, because of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), he was charged and then sentenced for the drug amount alleged in his indictment. He further asserts that, if he had been sentenced after <em>United States v. Salto, </em>220 Fed.Appx. 299 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished), his sentence would not have been based on that particular drug amount. He thus contends, in a loose analogy to <em>Reyes-Reque-na, </em>that <em>Salto </em>renders him \u201cinnocent\u201d of the sentence imposed under the sentencing regime in force between <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Salto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not foreclose challenges to drug quantities used for sentencing but rather increased the Government\u2019s burden of proving the drug quantities required for enhanced statutory maximum penalties. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>2348 (holding that a \u201cfact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). In addition, <em>Salto </em>was not a Supreme Court decision and did not establish that Shoupe may have been convicted of \u201ca nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904; <em>Salto, </em>220 Fed.Appx. at 300-01. Shoupe has not demonstrated that his claim is within the savings clause. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e). The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed. Because there is no viable ground for an appeal, Shoupe\u2019s motion for leave to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP) is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COA DENIED; IFP DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
