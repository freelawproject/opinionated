Leitman argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court failed to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. Leitman also argues that his sentence is unreasonable and the district court failed to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2 before ordering forfeiture. We affirm Leitman\u2019s conviction and sentence, and we dismiss Leitman\u2019s appeal of the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>There was no plain error in Leit-man\u2019s guilty plea. Leitman argues that the district court failed to ensure that he understood the charges against him and failed to inform him that the government requested the forfeiture. The district court complied with and satisfied the \u201ccore principles\u201d of Rule 11, <em>see United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005), when it determined that Leitman had knowingly and intelligently pleaded guilty to the crime of mail fraud as it was described by the prosecutor and that Leit-man understood and had \u201cagreed to the entry of a money judgment against [him] to be determined at a later time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Leitman challenges the eight-level enhancement of his sentence for violating a prior administrative order, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) (Nov.2010), relocating his fraudulent business scheme to evade law enforcement, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(A), and being an investment adviser or associated with an investment adviser, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(18)(A)(iii), but we need not address Leitman\u2019s challenges because the \u201cguidelines error, if any, did not affect [his] sentence,\u201d <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006). The district court stated that it varied upward from the guideline range of 121 to 151 months of imprisonment because it was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d to address Leitman\u2019s \u201cnefarious and deceitful\u201d and \u201cabhorrent\u201d fraud. The district court also stated that the guidelines \u201csubstantially understate^] the manner in which [the] offense was committed,\u201d which included Leitman\u2019s violation of his oaths to protect the public as a member of the Florida Bar and as a certified public accountant; \u201cpreying upon fellow service members\u201d; exacting \u201cusurious fees that [he] charged by moving [the] location[ ]\u201d of his business from Florida to Puerto Rico and then to New Mexico; inflicting \u201cpsychological injuries\u201d by defrauding his mother and longtime friends, including his \u201cson\u2019s godfather\u201d; \u201cpreying upon the elderly and retirees\u201d who could not \u201crecoup their losses\u201d; and \u201ccon-tinu[ing][his] criminal conduct after having been put on notice by the Florida business regulators and the Florida Bar.\u201d The district court found Leitman\u2019s crime so \u201cexceptional\u201d that it varied upward 59 months from the high end of the guideline range. The district court considered the \u201cstatements of all parties, the presentence report which contains the advisory guidelines, and the statutory factors,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and explained that Leitman\u2019s \u201cconduct [required] the strongest possible measure of deterrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it varied upward from the guidelines range. Leitman swindled over 36 friends, associates, and fellow military personnel out of more than $3.4 million, and several of his victims lost their life savings and were forced to end their retirements or rely on their families for financial support. In the light of the seriousness and magnitude of Leitman\u2019s misconduct, his sentence of 210 months of imprisonment is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"Au1I\">Leitman\u2019s challenge to the order of forfeiture is barred by the appeal waiver in his plea agreement. Leitman\u2019s plea agreement provided that he \u201cagree[d] to entry of a money judgment against him ... which is therefore property subject to forfeiture pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 982,\u201d and that he \u201cknowingly and voluntarily waive[d] ... any right to appeal the forfeiture.\u201d The district court discussed the waiver with Leitman during his change of plea hearing, and Leitman said that he understood and had agreed to waive his right to appeal the forfeiture. <em>See United States v. Bascomb, </em>451 F.3d 1292, 1293 (11th Cir.2006). Leitman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>waiver was knowing and voluntary, so we dismiss his appeal of the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We AFFIRM Leitman\u2019s sentence and conviction, and we DISMISS his appeal as to forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
