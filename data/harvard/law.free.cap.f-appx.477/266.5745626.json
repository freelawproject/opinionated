He alleges that he obtained lawful permanent resident (LPR) status in 1990 under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) \u00a7 201(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a, which allows the Attorney General to grant an adjustment to LPR status if the alien satisfies various conditions, including establishing \u201cthat he entered the United States before January 1, 1982.\u201d \u00a7 1255a(a)(2)(A). In 2004, Tzoc visited Guatemala and was allowed to reenter the United States without formal admission. He pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine. In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated removal proceedings against him, charging that he was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">After several rounds of proceedings before the immigration judge (IJ) followed by appeals to the BIA, the IJ sustained the charge and ultimately ordered Tzoc removed to Guatemala. The IJ found that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(a) because Tzoc testified at a hearing before the IJ in 2007 that he had lived in the United States for approximately 21 years and that he came to the United States in 1986, when he was 17 years old. At the time of that proceeding, the case had been remanded to allow Tzoc to explain this prior testimony or provide other evidence to show that he actually entered at the required time (before January 1, 1982). In the final proceeding before the IJ, Tzoc failed to present any such evidence. The IJ also found that he was ineligible for a waiver of removability under \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H). The BIA dismissed his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Tzoc argues that the BIA erred in finding him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. We review this question of law de novo, \u201cdeferring to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers.\u201d <em>Vasquez-Martinez v. Holder, </em>564 F.3d 712, 715 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In order to be eligible for cancellation of removal, an alien must have been \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d for at least five years. \u00a7 1229b(a)(l). Tzoc argues that his IRCA adjustment in 1990 shows that he satisfied this requirement. However, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines the phrase \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d as \u201cthe status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant <em>in accordance with the immigration laws, </em>such status not having changed.\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(20) (emphasis added). If Tzoc first entered the United States after January 1, 1982, as he testified repeatedly before the IJ, then his IRCA adjustment to LPR status was not \u201cin accordance with the immigration laws,\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(20); <em>see </em>\u00a7 1255a(a)(2)(A). \u201cIf, as a matter of law, [the alien] was not eligible to receive LPR status [when he acquired it], then he could not, and therefore, did not <em>lawfully </em>acquire it \u2014 absent which he is not eligible for cancellation of removal.\u201d <em>Ramos-Torres v. Holder, </em>637 F.3d 544, 548 (5th Cir.2011); <em>see also In re Longstaff, </em>716 F.2d 1439, 1441-42 (5th Cir.1983) (rejecting Tzoc\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d in another INA provision, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Tzoc contends that the BIA erroneously assigned him the burden of proving that his prior IRCA adjustment was lawful. However, an alien applying for relief from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>removal has the burden of proof to establish that he is statutorily eligible for relief. \u00a7 1229a(c) (4) (A) (i); <em>Ramos-Torres, </em>637 F.3d at 548. Even were this not so, his own testimony that he first entered in 1986 provides some evidence that he did not lawfully obtain LPR status; despite a remand in which to offer contrary evidence, he failed to do so. Accordingly, his argument that the DHS failed to show that he obtained his IRCA adjustment of status through fraud or misrepresentation is misplaced. <em>See also Longstaff, </em>716 F.2d at 1440 (holding that the alien was ineligible for naturalization even though \u201cno evidence suggest[ed]\u201d that the alien \u201cknew or had reason to know\u201d that he was excluda-ble from , the United States at the time of his original application for admission as an LPR).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Although Tzoc argues that the BIA violated the IRCA confidentiality provision, that provision limits the Government\u2019s use of \u201cthe information furnished by the applicant pursuant to an application filed under this section.\u201d \u00a7 1255a(c)(5)(A). Tzoc\u2019s testimony during the 2007 removal hearing was not the information furnished by him pursuant to the application for an IRCA adjustment, which he filed years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Tzoc also challenges the BIA\u2019s refusal to consider his request for a \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) waiver. Because the IJ\u2019s decision impacted the BIA\u2019s ruling, we will consider the underlying decision of the IJ in reviewing this daiim <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002). Whether Tzoc was eligible for the \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) waiver is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>See Rana v. Holder, </em>654 F.3d 547, 549-52 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">As the IJ found, such a waiver would not help Tzoc because he was not subject to removal \u201con the ground\u201d that he had committed fraud or misrepresentation. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H). Although Tzoc assumes that the DHS\u2019s contention that his IRCA adjustment of status in 1990 was improper entails an implicit allegation that he committed fraud or a willful misrepresentation in his IRCA application, the DHS did not have to make such a charge because Tzoc had the burden of proving that he was statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See Vasquez-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d at 715. Rather, Tzoc\u2019s own testimony gave rise to a question regarding whether his IRCA adjustment to LPR status in 1990 was lawful. <em>See id.; Ramos-Torres, </em>637 F.3d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
