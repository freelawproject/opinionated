Aguilar-Ortiz argues that his within-guidelines sentence is unreasonable in that it was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). Relying on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Aguilar-Ortiz contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1 is flawed and not based on \u201c \u2018empirical data and national experience.\u2019 \u201d As such, he argues that his within-guidelines sentence should not be afforded the presumption of reasonableness. He also contends that the flawed Guideline overstates the seriousness of his offense because \u201cit does not equally apportion the number of unlawful aliens, smuggled, transported, or harbored and as a result effectively punishes one for not smuggling, transporting, or harboring more aliens.\u201d Aguilar-Ortiz also argues that the Guidelines do not take into consideration his history and personal characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Aguilar-Ortiz recognizes that <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), forecloses his argument that because the Guideline is not empirically grounded, the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to a sentence calculated under \u00a7 2L1.1. Aguilar-Ortiz further recognizes that because he did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence before the district court, this court reviews his argument under the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The district court expressly stated that it had also considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and found \u201cthat a fair and reasonable sentence can be achieved with a sentence selected from within the advisory range.\u201d Aguilar-Ortiz does not offer any specific argument that the district court considered any irrelevant or improper factors, that it made an error in judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or that it did not account for a factor that should receive significant weight. Given the deference owed to the district court\u2019s sentence determination, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), his conclusional assertion that his sentence is unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to establish plain error and to rebut the presumption that the. sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
