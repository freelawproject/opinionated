He contends that his within-guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because Nava\u2019s arguments fail under either a plain error or an abuse of discretion standard of review, we need not decide whether, despite his arguments in the district court in support of a downward variance, Nava\u2019s failure to object to the reasonableness of his sentence results in plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">As Nava concedes, his contention that a sentence imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. </em>Duarte, 569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). We have rejected the argument that the illegal reentry guideline\u2019s alleged lack of an empirical basis and alleged double-counting of previous convictions renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>Nava\u2019s reliance on his allegedly benign motive for reentering the United States is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008), Likewise, to the extent Nava contends that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because it failed to account for his cultural assimilation into the United States, he fails to show reversible error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234-35 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">On the whole, Nava\u2019s arguments are a request to re-weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). That this court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA defendant\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). Nava neither has shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable nor has he rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
