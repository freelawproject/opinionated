Reversible error has been shown; we reverse and remand for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-16\">McNeal filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In her petition, McNeal reported that her home was subject to two mortgage liens: a first priority lien in the amount of $176,413 held by HSBC and a second priority lien in the amount of $44,444 held by Homecomings Financial, LLC, a subsidiary of GMAC Mortgage, LLC (collectively, \u201cGMAC\u201d). McNeal also reported that her home\u2019s fair market value was $141,416. The parties do not dispute these factual allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-17\">McNeal then sought to \u201cstrip off\u2019 GMAC\u2019s second priority lien, pursuant to sections 506(a) and 506(d). McNeal contended that, because the senior lien exceeded the home\u2019s fair market value, GMAC\u2019s junior lien was wholly unsecured and, thus, void under section 506(d). The bankruptcy court denied the motion, concluding that section 506(d) did not permit a Chapter 7 debtor to \u201cstrip off\u2019 a wholly unsecured lien. The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-18\">When the district court affirms the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, we review only the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision on appeal. <em>Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. v. Mosley, </em>494 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.2007). And we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Hemar Ins. Corp. of Am. v. Cox, </em>338 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-19\">That GMAC\u2019s junior lien is both \u201callowed\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 and wholly unsecured pursuant to section 506(a) is undisputed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To determine whether such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>an allowed \u2014 but wholly unsecured \u2014 claim is voidable, we must then look to section 506(d), which provides that \u201c[t]o the extent that a lien secures a claim against a debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void.\u201d <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Several courts have determined that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dewsnup v. Timm, </em>502 U.S. 410, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992) \u2014 which concluded that a Chapter 7 debtor could not \u201cstrip down\u201d a partially secured lien under section 506(d) \u2014 also precludes a Chapter 7 debtor from \u201cstripping off\u2019 a wholly unsecured junior lien such as the lien at issue in this appeal. <em>See, e.g., Ryan v. Homecomings Fin. Network, </em>253 F.3d 778 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Talbert v. City Mortg. Serv., </em>344 F.3d 555 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Laskin v. First Nat'l Bank of Keystone, </em>222 B.R. 872 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1998). But the present controlling precedent in the Eleventh Circuit remains our decision in <em>Folendore v. United States Small Bus. Admin., </em>862 F.2d 1537 (11th Cir.1989). In <em>Folendore, </em>we concluded that an allowed claim that was wholly unsecured \u2014 just as GMAC\u2019s claim is here \u2014 was voidable under the plain language of section 506(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 862 F.2d at 1538-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">A few bankruptcy court decisions within our circuit \u2014 including the decision underlying this appeal \u2014 have treated <em>Folendore </em>as abrogated by <em>Dewsnup. See, e.g., In re McNeal, </em>No. A09-78173, 2010 Bankr.LEXIS 1350, at *9-12 (Bankr.N.D.Ga. Apr. 9, 2010); <em>In re Swafford, </em>160 B.R. 246, 249 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1993); <em>In re Windham, </em>136 B.R. 878, 882 n. 6 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1992). But <em>Folendore </em>\u2014 not <em>Dewsnup </em>\u2014 controls in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">\u201cUnder our prior panel precedent rule, a later panel may depart from an earlier panel\u2019s decision only when the intervening Supreme Court decision is \u2018clearly on point.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atl. Sounding Co., Inc. v. Townsend, </em>496 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2007). Because <em>Dewsnup </em>disallowed only a \u201cstrip down\u201d of a partially secured mortgage lien and did not address a \u201cstrip off\u2019 of a wholly unsecured lien, it is not \u201cclearly on point\u201d with the facts in <em>Folendore </em>or with the facts \u00e1t issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Although the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Dewsnup </em>seems to reject the plain language analysis that we used in <em>Folen-dore, \u201c </em>\u2018[tjhere is, of course, an important difference between the holding in a case and the reasoning that supports that holding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atl. Sounding Co., Inc., </em>496 F.3d at 1284 (citing <em>Crawford-El v. Britton, </em>523 U.S. 574, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 1590, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998)). \u201c[T]hat the reasoning of an intervening high court decision is at odds with that of our prior decision is no basis for a panel to depart from our prior decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAs we have stated, \u2018[ojbedience to a Supreme Court decision is one thing, extrapolating from its implications a holding on an issue that was not before that Court in order to upend settled circuit law is another thing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, the Supreme Court \u2014 noting the ambiguities in the bankruptcy code and the \u201cthe difficulty of interpreting the statute in a single opinion that would apply to all possible fact situations\u201d \u2014 limited its <em>Dewsnup </em>decision expressly to the precise issue raised by the facts of the case. 112 S.Ct. at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">Because \u2014 under <em>Folendore </em>\u2014 GMAC\u2019s lien is voidable under section 506(d), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>reverse and remand for additional proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">. In bankruptcy terms, a \u201cstrip down\u2019\u2019 of an undersecured lien reduces the lien to the value of the collateral to which it attaches and a \"strip off\u201d removes a wholly unsecured lien in its entirety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1051-20\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-22\">An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest ... is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor's interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>such property ... and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor's interest ... is less than the amount of such allowed claim.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">. Although <em>Folendore </em>addressed the 1978 version of the Bankruptcy Code, the 1984 amendments to the Code did not alter the pertinent language in section 506(a) or (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
