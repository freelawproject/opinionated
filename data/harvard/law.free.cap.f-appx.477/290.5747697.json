His guidelines range of imprisonment was calculated at 108 to 185 months of imprisonment, although his two drug offenses were subject to mandatory minimum sentences of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-20\">At Jaramillo\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court pronounced concurrent sentences of 108 months. Defense counsel pointed out the mandatory minimum, and the district court corrected Jaramillo\u2019s sentences to concurrent 120-month terms. Jaramillo now appeals, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because defense counsel corrected the district court to his detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-21\">To establish ineffective assistance, Jar-amillo must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>629 F.3d 462, 469 (5th Cir.2010) (observing that the <em>Strickland </em>standard of review applies in direct appeals raising ineffective assistance of counsel claims). A failure to establish either prong defeats the claim. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To demonstrate deficient performance, Jaramillo must show that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. He must overcome a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s performance was \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-22\">\u201c[T]he proper measure of attorney performance [is] simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Moore v. Quarterman, </em>534 F.3d 454, 467 (5th Cir.2008). (quoting <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 521, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003)). \u201cPrevailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association standards and the like ... are guides to determining what is reasonable.\u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 521, 123 S.Ct. 2527. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>American Bar Association Standard 4-1.2(g) provides, \u201cDefense counsel should disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to defense counsel to be directly adverse to the position of the accused and not disclosed by the prosecutor.\u201d Defense counsel did not perform deficiently by preventing the district court from making an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
