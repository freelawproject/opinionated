On appeal, Simmons argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court erroneously designated him a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">We first address the government\u2019s request that we dismiss Simmons\u2019s appeal pursuant to the sentence appeal waiver in Simmons\u2019s plea agreement. Under that provision, Simmons agreed to waive his right to appeal his sentence or the manner in which it was imposed unless: (1) the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum sentence (in this case, forty years); (2) is the result of an upward departure or variance from the guidelines range; (3) is an illegal sentence; or (4) the government appealed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">The plea transcript indicates that the magistrate judge specifically questioned Simmons about the sentence appeal waiver and its exceptions and that Simmons indicated that he understood the waiver. However, the record also shows that the district court never adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s written report recommending acceptance of the plea agreement, and, at sentencing, the district court informed Simmons he had the right to appeal his sentence and did not discuss the waiver at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>all.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court has not yet issued a published opinion enforcing an appellate waiver in this situation, but several sister circuits have concluded that the district court constructively accepted a plea agreement when the district court worked within the terms of the agreement and thus enforced the waiver. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Leyva-Matos, </em>618 F.3d 1213, 1216 n. 1 (10th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>571 F.3d 690, 694 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Skidmore, </em>998 F.2d 372, 375 (6th Cir.1993). And here, the district court arguably proceeded as though it had formally accepted the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">We need not resolve this issue because Simmons\u2019s appeal lacks merit in any event.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Simmons contends that the district court erred (1) in counting Simmons\u2019s three state drug possession convictions because they were based on Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13, a facially unconstitutional statute, and (2) in counting his state aggravated battery conviction because Simmons was actually innocent of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, a defendant is a career offender if, among other things, he \u201chas at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). \u2022 Commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines states that prior convictions that have been reversed, vacated or \u201cruled constitutionally invalid in a prior case\u201d should not be counted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 6. We have explained, however, that nothing in this commentary or the guidelines themselves \u201cauthorizes district courts to question state convictions for other reasons.\u201d <em>United States v. Roman, 989 </em>F.2d 1117, 1120 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc). Instead, \u201c[a] defendant must demonstrate that a conviction is \u2018presumptively void\u2019 before a sentencing court may inquire into its constitutional validity for purposes of sentencing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Farris, </em>77 F.3d 391, 397 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">\u201cThis court has suggested that \u2018presumptively void\u2019 convictions \u2018are small in number and are perhaps limited to un-counseled convictions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>203 F.3d 1279, 1287 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Roman, </em>989 F.2d at 1120). Thus, as a general rule, a defendant may not collaterally attack the prior conviction during his federal sentencing except where the attack is based on a violation of the right to counsel. <em>Farris, </em>77 F.3d at 397; <em>see also Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 487, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 1734, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Here, the district court did not err in counting Simmons\u2019s three drug possession convictions and his aggravated battery conviction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>mons did not contend that any of his state convictions were obtained in violation of his right to counsel. Nor did he show that any of these convictions have been vacated or reversed. Simmons\u2019s arguments that Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13 is facially unconstitutional and that he is actually innocent of aggravated battery are collateral attacks on his state convictions that may not be brought in his federal sentencing. Accordingly, the district court correctly calculated Simmons\u2019s advisory guidelines range as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and Simmons has not shown that his 188-month sentence is proeedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\">. We note that the district court\u2019s final judgment <em>after </em>sentencing reflects that Simmons pled guilty and was adjudicated guilty. Nonetheless, if the district court is going to allow the magistrate judge to conduct the plea hearing, and even if the defendant does not object to the magistrate judge's report, the district court still should formally adopt the report and thereby accept the guilty plea <em>before </em>sentencing. This would have avoided the issues here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\">. We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We review the sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Cooper, </em>203 F.3d 1279, 1286 (11th Cir.2000). Although Simmons's appeal brief states that his sentence is both substantively and procedurally unreasonable, the brief does not contain any argument as to substantive reasonableness. Instead, the brief argues only that the district court improperly calculated Simmons\u2019s guidelines range as a career offender, which is a procedural reasonableness challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
