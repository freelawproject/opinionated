Currently incarcerated in the Eastern District of Texas, he argues that his indictment is fatally flawed, thereby establishing that he is actually innocent and the convicting court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Reviewing the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo, <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Harris\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenges trial errors and thus is properly construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. He may therefore proceed via \u00a7 2241 only if he demonstrates that \u00a7 2255 relief would be ineffective or inadequate. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Harris, however, has not alleged or established that his claims of actual innocence and lack of subject matter jurisdiction \u2014 predicated on allegations of a fatally defective indictment \u2014 are either based upon a retroactive Supreme Court decision establishing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense or were foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his trial, appeal, or \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). He has therefore shown no error on the part of the district court in dismissing his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
