No reversible error has been shown; we affirm in part and dismiss in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">On appeal, Cerda-Enriquez argues that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because his Florida conviction for resisting an officer with violence, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines is a question that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194, 1196 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Under section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), a sentencing court must impose a 16-level enhancement if the defendant was deported after being convicted of a felony that is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as an \u201coffense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). In interpreting identical language in the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, the United States Supreme Court determined that \u201cthe phrase \u2018physical force\u2019 means <em>violent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">\u201c[I]n determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for enhancement purposes, we apply a \u2018categorical\u2019 approach,\u201d meaning that we look only at \u201cthe fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d at 1196-97. Only when the judgment of conviction or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>statute is ambiguous do we look at the facts underlying the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1197. Because no such ambiguities existed in this case, the district court erred in considering the underlying facts of Cerda-Enriquez\u2019s conviction for resisting a law enforcement officer with violence. <em>See United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010) (applying the categorical approach to determine whether a conviction under section 843.01 was a violent felony under the residual clause of the ACCA). Despite this error, we affirm Cerda-Enriquez\u2019s sentence because his offense qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Cerda-Enriquez does not dispute that he was convicted of resisting a law enforcement officer with violence. The Florida statute defining that offense provides that, \u201c[w]hoever knowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person or such officer or legally authorized person, is guilty of a felony of the third degree.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. Florida courts have concluded that \u201cviolence is a necessary element of [this] offense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Rawlings v. State, </em>976 So.2d 1179, 1181-82 (Fla. 5th Dist.Ct.App.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Construing the plain language of section 843.01, \u201coffering\u201d to do violence involves the attempted use or threatened use of \u201cphysical force\u201d or <em>\u201cviolent </em>force\u201d \u2014 and \u201cdoing violence\u201d involves the actual use of \u201cphysical force\u201d or <em>\u201cviolent </em>force\u201d \u2014 as contemplated by section 2L1.2 and by the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As a result, we conclude that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 for resisting a law enforcement officer with violence qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of enhancement under section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-8\">. Nothing evidences that the district court believed that it lacked the authority to grant a downward departure based on cultural assimilation. Thus, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Cerda-Enriquez\u2019s argument that the district court erred by denying his departure request. <em>See United States v. Norris, </em>452 F.3d 1275, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2006) (\"This Court lacks jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to grant a downward departure, unless the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked the statutory authority to depart from the guideline range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">We also reject Cerda-Enriquez's argument that the district court erred by failing to consider \u2014 as a basis for a downward variance\u2014 the disparity in the availability of \"fast track\u201d sentencing programs. <em>See United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir. 2008) (reaffirming that \"a [sentencing] court may not consider sentencing disparities associated with early disposition programs in imposing sentence.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-15\">. Cerda-Enriquez also argues \u2014 and the government concedes \u2014 that his Florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer is not a crime of violence for purposes of section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). We agree based on our decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>609 F.3d 1168, 1169-70 (11th Cir.2010), in which we concluded that \"the fact of a conviction for felony battery on a law enforcement officer in Florida, standing alone, no longer satisfies the 'crime of violence\u2019 enhancement criteria as defined under the \u2018physical force\u2019 subdivision of [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 ] 4B 1.2(a)(1) of the sentencing guidelines.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\">. We are bound by the Florida courts\u2019 interpretation of the elements of a state offense. <em>See Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1269; <em>Arawak Aviation v. Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>285 F.3d 954, 959 (11th Cir.2002) (stating that \"[i]n matters of state law, federal courts are bound by rulings of the state's highest court\" and \"[i]f the state's highest court has not ruled on the issue, a federal court must look to the intermediate state appellate courts.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">. Cerda-Enriquez argues that the \"offering or doing violence\u201d element of section 843.01 cannot satisfy section 2L1.2\u2019s \"physical force\u201d requirement because a defendant could \"offer[] or do[] violence\u201d in a negligent or reckless way. <em>See United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1336 (11th Cir.2010) (concluding that a <em>mens rea </em>higher than recklessness is necessary for a prior conviction to qualify as a \"crime of violence\u201d under section 2L1.2). We are unpersuaded by this argument. Even if section 843.01 is a general intent crime, <em>see Frey v. State, </em>708 So.2d 918, 920 (Fla.1998), the sort of force contemplated by the statute is \u201cviolence force,\u201d <em>see Rawlings, </em>976 So.2d at 1181 (\"[Violence is a necessary element of the offense.\u201d). This element is sufficient for liability under section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
