GORDON</author> <p id=\"Anz\" pgmap=\"886\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b886-8\" pgmap=\"886\">After plaintiff Andrea Barber filed a class action against defendant American Airlines, Inc., defendant moved quickly to refund the $40 baggage fee that plaintiff had paid in connection with her cancelled flight and that had been the subject of her class action suit. Citing the refund, the trial court found that there was no longer a controversy between the parties and dismissed the suit pursuant to section 2 \u2014 619 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619 (West 2006). For the reasons discussed below, we reverse.</p> <p id=\"b886-9\" pgmap=\"886\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"AZv\" pgmap=\"886\">1. Plaintiffs Complaint</p> <p id=\"b886-10\" pgmap=\"886\">Since a section 2 \u2014 619 motion accepts as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts, we will provide the facts alleged by plaintiff in her complaint. Morr-Fitz, Inc. v. Blagojevich, 231 Ill. 2d 474, 488 (2008).</p> <p id=\"b886-11\" pgmap=\"886\">The complaint alleged that plaintiff \u201cpurchased a ticket number 100173579545115 for transportation on flight number 4414 to travel from Chicago O\u2019Hare to White Plains[, New York,] on August 11, 2008.\u201d Plaintiff \u201cchecked in for the flight according to the procedures of the Defendant at O\u2019Hare Airport and checked two suitcases for transport on her flight to White Plains, New York.\u201d At check-in, defendant required plaintiff \u201cto pay an additional $40.00 to Defendant for transportation of her two suitcases to New York.\u201d Plaintiff alleged that \u201cDefendant commenced charging passengers extra to transport their luggage on passenger flights on May 12, 2008.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b886-12\" pgmap=\"886(42) 887(88)\">The complaint further alleged that, at some point after check-in, defendant \u201ccanceled the subject flight.\u201d In response, plaintiff \u201crequested a cancelation [sic] of her ticket and refund to the price of the subject airlines ticket and the $40.00 paid for transportation of her two suitcases from the Defendant\u2019s counter agent.\u201d While defendant \u201cauthorized a refund of the price of the airline ticket,\u201d it \u201crefused to refund the $40.00 paid to transport her two suitcases.\u201d Plaintiff alleged that she \u201cwas told by Defendant\u2019s counter agent at O\u2019Hare Airport that it is the policy and practice of Defendant not to refund fees paid by ticket holders for transportation of luggage in connection with a passenger flight when that flight is canceled by Defendant and the passenger does not accept another flight.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b887-5\" pgmap=\"887\">In addition, the complaint alleged that defendant failed to disclose that it would not refund the baggage fee if the flight was cancelled. In support of this allegation, plaintiff attached Exhibit A to her complaint. The complaint stated that Exhibit A was a \u201ccopy of Defendant\u2019s website Baggage Information.\u201d Exhibit A appears to be a two-page printout of a section from defendant\u2019s Web site that is entitled \u201cGeneral Baggage Information.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b887-6\" pgmap=\"887\">The \u201cGeneral Baggage Information\u201d printout did not contain information about a refund in case of a cancelled flight. The printout stated, in relevant part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b887-7\" pgmap=\"887\">\u201cCustomers who purchased domestic economy class tickets May 12, 2008 through June 14, 2008, may check one bag for free and check a second bag for $25 each way. Customers who purchased domestic economy class on or after June 14, 2008, will be charged $15 each way for the first checked bag and $25 each way for the second checked bag.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b887-8\" pgmap=\"887\">Since plaintiff\u2019s travel date was August 11 and she checked two items, the above-quoted policy required her to pay $15 for her first checked item and $25 for her second checked item, for a total of $40 for the two checked items.</p> <p id=\"b887-9\" pgmap=\"887\">The complaint contained two counts: count I was breach of contract; and count II was a class action. In count I, plaintiff alleged that defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to transport her two suitcases was a breach of contract and Plaintiff was entitled to a refund.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b887-10\" pgmap=\"887(44) 888(20)\">In count II, the class action count, plaintiff sought to bring this suit on behalf of \u201call other persons who (i) paid Defendant to have their luggage transported in conjunction with passenger travel; (ii) Defendant canceled their flight; (iii) passenger requested a refund for the canceled flight and luggage fee; and (iv) they were denied a refund of the fee paid for luggage transport.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b888-3\" pgmap=\"888\">Plaintiff filed her complaint on August 15, 2008, four days after her flight was cancelled, and plaintiff served defendant with the complaint on August 21.</p> <p id=\"b888-4\" pgmap=\"888\">2. Discovery</p> <p id=\"b888-5\" pgmap=\"888\">In an interrogatory dated September 29, 2008, plaintiff asked defendant to \u201c[identify persons receiving refunds for the ticket price on American Airlines or American Eagle flights canceled since June 15, 2008 who also paid baggage fees and did not receive a refund of the baggage fees and the amounts they each paid to transport their baggage.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b888-6\" pgmap=\"888\">On October 30, 2008, defendant filed a response to plaintiffs interrogatory, objecting to it on two grounds. Defendant claimed, first, that the interrogatory was \u201coverly broad, unduly burdensome and will not lead to the discovery of relevant evidence\u201d; and second, that it was \u201cpremature while American\u2019s Motion to Dismiss remains pending.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b888-7\" pgmap=\"888\">In a written order dated November 7, 2008, the trial court stated that \u201cDefendant\u2019s objections to interrogatory is entered and continued.\u201d On January 28, 2009, plaintiff moved to compel discovery. In a written order dated February 26, 2009, the trial court denied plaintiffs motion to compel and observed that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was pending.</p> <p id=\"b888-8\" pgmap=\"888\">3, Defendant\u2019s Section 2 \u2014 619 Motion to Dismiss</p> <p id=\"AtD\" pgmap=\"888\">Defendant did not file its motion to dismiss until October 30, 2008. Although defendant was served on August 21, 2008, with a summons requiring it to file an answer or otherwise appear within 30 days, defendant did not file an appearance until October 6, 2008, and did not file its dismissal motion until October 30. 166 Ill. 2d R. 101(d) (defendant must \u201cfile his answer or otherwise file his appearance within 30 days after service, exclusive of the day of service\u201d). Although defendant\u2019s appearance was filed well after the 30-day period, the appellate record contains no orders granting defendant an extension of its time to answer or otherwise appear.</p> <p id=\"b888-9\" pgmap=\"888(85) 889(68)\">In its motion, defendant moved to dismiss pursuant to section 2 \u2014 619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure on the ground that there was some \u201caffirmative matter *** defeating\u201d plaintiffs complaint. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619(a)(9) (West 2006). In essence, defendant\u2019s motion claimed, first, that plaintiff had received a full refund, pursuant to defendant\u2019s policy for refunding baggage fees on cancelled flights, and thus her claim was now moot. Second, defendant claimed that the court had to dismiss plaintiffs complaint, due to plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to attach the contract to her complaint. A plaintiff who alleges breach of contract is statutorily required to attach the contract at issue to her complaint. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 606 (West 2006) (\u201c[i]f a claim or defense is founded upon a written instrument, a copy thereof, or of so much of the same as is relevant, must be attached to the pleading as an exhibit\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b889-3\" pgmap=\"889\">When considering a section 2 \u2014 619 motion, a trial court may consider affidavits. Raintree Homes, Inc. v. Village of Long Grove, 209 Ill. 2d 248, 262 (2004). Thus, we will provide the information contained in the affidavits that defendant attached to its section 2 \u2014 619 motion.</p> <p id=\"b889-4\" pgmap=\"889\">Defendant attached three affidavits from its employees: (1) Robert Trimm, a \u201cManager, Passenger Refund Services,\u201d whose department credited plaintiffs credit card with a refund on September 25, 2008; (2) John Terrell, a \u201cSenior Analyst for Support Services,\u201d who identified defendant\u2019s \u201cConditions of Carriage\u201d that were current on plaintiffs date of travel; and (3) Debra Shaffer, an \u201cExecutive Office Manager,\u201d who reviewed plaintiffs complaint on September 4, 2008, and then immediately offered to refund plaintiffs baggage fees and possibly court costs.</p> <p id=\"b889-5\" pgmap=\"889\">Specifically, Robert Trimm, a passenger refund manager, stated that on \u201cSeptember 25, 2008, my department processed a refund back to the original form of payment in the amount of $40.00 for ticket number 0012604558285\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that \u201c[t]his ticket was originally issued to Andrea Barber on August 11, 2008 for excess baggage charges.\u201d The refund thus occurred approximately a month after defendant was served with plaintiffs complaint. Trimm stated that he had attached, as an exhibit to his affidavit, a copy of the business record created by defendant to memorialize the refund.</p> <p id=\"b889-6\" pgmap=\"889\">John Terrell, a \u201cSenior Analyst for Support Services,\u201d stated that he had attached, as an exhibit to his affidavit, a document entitled \u201cAmerican Airlines Conditions of Carriage.\u201d He stated that he had \u201cprinted\u201d this document on July 2, 2008, and that it was \u201ca true and correct copy of American\u2019s Conditions of Carriage as it was available to airport agents on August 11, 2008.\u201d He further stated that this document \u201cwould have been made available to customers asking to review or for a copy of American\u2019s Conditions of Carriage\u201d on August 11, 2008.</p> <p id=\"b889-7\" pgmap=\"889(33) 890(122)\">The \u201cConditions of Carriage\u201d is 12 pages long, single spaced, and in small font. It contains sections concerning both baggage and refunds. It does not state anything specifically about a refund of baggage fees after a cancelled flight.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the document does state that \u201c[a]s used in this contract, ticket means your passenger ticket and baggage check.\u201d (Bold in original.) The document further states that \u201c[i]n the event the refund is required because of America\u2019s failure to operate on schedule or refusal to transport, the refund will be made directly to you \u2014 (1) [i]f the ticket is totally unused, the full amount paid (with no service charge or refund penalty).\u201d In this sentence, the word \u201cticket,\u201d as defined by the \u201cConditions\u201d itself, means both the passenger ticket and the baggage check. Thus, the unused \u201cticket,\u201d which requires a full and automatic refund, includes both the unused passenger ticket and the unused baggage check.</p> <p id=\"b890-3\" pgmap=\"890\">Debra Shaffer, an \u201cExecutive Office Manager,\u201d stated that on September 4, 2008, she received a copy of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, she determined that plaintiff was entitled to a refund, and she informed plaintiff\u2019s counsel by telephone that defendant was \u201cprepared to issue a refund.\u201d Shaffer stated that, in that same telephone conversation on September 4, she also informed counsel that defendant \u201cwould consider paying the court costs that the Plaintiff had incurred to date.\u201d According to Shaffer, \u201c[c]ounsel refused and advised [Shaffer] that the case would proceed as a class action.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b890-4\" pgmap=\"890\">In addition to the three affidavits, defendant also attached a letter, dated September 9, 2009, from defendant\u2019s counsel to plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The letter claimed that defendant\u2019s policy concerning baggage fee refunds was displayed on its Web site, in a section of the Web site entitled \u201cFAQs.\u201d By stating that the policy was in a section entitled \u201cFAQs,\u201d the letter appears to concede plaintiffs claim that the policy was neither in the \u201cGeneral Baggage Information\u201d section of the Web site, which was provided as Exhibit A to plaintiffs complaint, nor in the \u201cConditions of Carriage\u201d section, which defendant provided as an exhibit to Terrell\u2019s affidavit. The letter did not explain how a passenger who was interested in a baggage fee refund would be directed to the \u201cFAQs\u201d section.</p> <p id=\"b890-5\" pgmap=\"890(78) 891(30)\">Counsel\u2019s letter provided the \u201cFAQs\u201d Web address and claimed that defendant\u2019s refund policy was available at this address on the date of plaintiffs cancelled flight. The letter quoted the policy as stating, \u201c \u2018in situations where a customer has paid for checked bags but doesn\u2019t fly due to a flight cancellation or schedule change, they may request a refund through American Airlines\u2019 refund process.\u2019 \u201d In the letter, defendant\u2019s counsel stated that she attached a sheet which contained defendant\u2019s policy. This sheet stated that the passenger \u201cmay request a refund at the ticket counter before leaving the airport or mail the original baggage charge receipt\u201d to defendant.</p> <p id=\"b891-5\" pgmap=\"891\">In her response to defendant\u2019s motion, plaintiff submitted an affidavit in which she reiterated some of the information already stated in her complaint and in which she added that she had \u201cnot agreed to accept a refund of the $40.00 paid for the baggage transportation since this suit was filed on August 15, 2008.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b891-6\" pgmap=\"891\">In its reply, defendant claimed that \u201cthe contract that governed the plaintiffs air transportation was her ticket and American Airlines\u2019 Conditions of Carriage.\u201d Defendant claimed that plaintiffs complaint was fatally flawed for its failure to attach a copy of defendant\u2019s \u201cConditions of Carriage.\u201d Defendant also claimed that to succeed on her breach of contract claim, plaintiff had to prove that defendant violated its \u201cConditions of Carriage.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b891-7\" pgmap=\"891\">To its reply, defendant attached a second affidavit from employee John Terrell, a senior analyst for airport services. His affidavit quoted the portion of the \u201cFAQs\u201d section that had previously been provided only in a letter from counsel. Terrell\u2019s affidavit also provided a \u201cFAQs\u201d Web address for this information, but the address provided in Terrell\u2019s affidavit was different from the address that counsel had provided in her September 29 letter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Terrell stated that this \u201cBaggage Fee Refund Policy\u201d was \u201cpublicly available on [defendant\u2019s] website on August 11, 2008.\u201d However, he stated that he had attached only \u201cexcerpts\u201d from this policy to his affidavit.</p> <p id=\"b891-8\" pgmap=\"891\">Attached to Terrell\u2019s affidavit was a typed sheet entitled \u201cBaggage Allowance,\u201d which stated in full:</p> <blockquote id=\"b891-9\" pgmap=\"891\">\u201cQ: If I pay a Checked Bag Fee but my flight is cancelled so I don\u2019t fly, will I get a refund for the Bag Fee?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b891-10\" pgmap=\"891\">A: Yes. In situations where a customer paid for checked bags but doesn\u2019t fly due to a flight cancellation or schedule change, they may request a refund through American Airlines refund process. Note: the refund will not be initiated automatically. You may request a refund at the ticket counter before leaving the airport or mail the original baggage charge receipt to:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-2\" pgmap=\"892\">American Airlines</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-3\" pgmap=\"892\">[address omitted]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-4\" pgmap=\"892\">When mailing a refund request please include:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-5\" pgmap=\"892\">*The passenger\u2019s name</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-6\" pgmap=\"892\">*Address</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-7\" pgmap=\"892\">*The form of payment used (including the credit card number, if applicable)</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-8\" pgmap=\"892\">*The ticket number(s)</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-9\" pgmap=\"892\">*The date of travel</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-10\" pgmap=\"892\">*The departure city and destination city</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b892-11\" pgmap=\"892\">Remember to keep a copy of the baggage charge receipt for your records. Please allow six to eight weeks for processing.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b892-12\" pgmap=\"892\">The exhibit appeared to be a typed sheet, as opposed to Terrell\u2019s previously submitted \u201cConditions of Carriage,\u201d which was clearly a printout from defendant\u2019s Web site. The affidavit did not indicate how long the \u201cBaggage Allowance\u201d section was or where the quoted excerpt appeared in that section. The affidavit also did not explain how someone seeking a refund for a baggage fee would know to go to a section that was not labeled either \u201cRefund\u201d or \u201cBaggage Fee,\u201d but rather \u201cBaggage Allowance.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b892-13\" pgmap=\"892\">4. The Order Appealed From</p> <p id=\"b892-14\" pgmap=\"892\">In a written order dated March 10, 2009, the trial court stated that \u201cDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted for the reasons set forth on the record.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b892-15\" pgmap=\"892\">During the court proceeding on March 10, defendant orally asked the trial court to dismiss for two reasons. First, defendant claimed that plaintiffs complaint was deficient for not including her ticket, which defendant claimed was the contract between plaintiff and defendant. Second, defendant claimed that plaintiffs complaint was moot, since she had already received her refund, pursuant to a preexisting policy.</p> <p id=\"b892-16\" pgmap=\"892\">Orally and in open court, the trial court stated that it granted defendant\u2019s motion on its second ground. The trial court stated, in relevant part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b892-17\" pgmap=\"892\">\u201c[T]he question is, Does the plaintiff get a refund, And in this case, yes. And she got it. And she got it in very short order. As soon as there was notice that, in fact \u2014 well, the complaint was filed. *** I think here what has been shown in the documents attached to the motion to dismiss is that there is a policy of refund and that the plaintiff got the refund. I don\u2019t think that there is much more to this controversy. And therefore, I am granting this motion to dismiss.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b893-2\" pgmap=\"893\">In the notice of appeal, dated April 8, 2009, plaintiff stated that she appealed from \u201cthe order of [the trial judge] on March 10, 2009 granting Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint and denying Plaintiff leave to file an Amended Complaint.\u201d The appellate record does not contain a motion by plaintiff for leave to amend her complaint, either made in writing or made orally at the March 10 proceeding. This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b893-3\" pgmap=\"893\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b893-4\" pgmap=\"893\">The primary issue on this appeal is whether defendant\u2019s act of unilaterally posting a credit to plaintiffs credit card made plaintiffs claims moot.</p> <p id=\"b893-5\" pgmap=\"893\">The following facts appear to be undisputed, and they are also supported by the complaint and the affidavits submitted in the case at bar. Plaintiff purchased an airline ticket from defendant for travel on August 11, 2008, and paid defendant an additional $40 in baggage fees. Defendant cancelled her flight. After defendant received plaintiff\u2019s class action complaint, it determined that plaintiff was entitled to a refund of the $40 in baggage fees and offered her a refund and a possible reimbursement of court costs, which she refused. Approximately a month after plaintiff\u2019s complaint was served on defendant, defendant unilaterally acted to credit plaintiffs credit card with the amount of the baggage fees. On the date of plaintiff\u2019s cancelled flight, defendant\u2019s claimed \u201cBaggage Fee Refund Policy\u201d was not available in either the \u201cGeneral Baggage Information\u201d or the \u201cConditions of Carriage\u201d sections of its Web site. The \u201cConditions of Carriage,\u201d which defendant claims was the contract between the parties, does not state anything specifically about a baggage fee refund after a cancelled flight. However, the \u201cConditions of Carriage\u201d does define the word \u201cticket,\u201d as used in that contract, to include both the passenger ticket and the baggage check, and the contract does provide for a full and automatic refund for such a \u201cticket\u201d in case of a cancelled flight.</p> <p id=\"b893-6\" pgmap=\"893\">1. Standard of Review</p> <p id=\"b893-7\" pgmap=\"893\">On appeal, plaintiff asks us to reverse the trial court\u2019s order, issued pursuant to section 2 \u2014 619 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619 (West 2006). \u201cA motion to dismiss, pursuant to section 2 \u2014 619 of the Code, admits the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, but asserts an affirmative defense or other matter that avoids or defeats the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.\u201d DeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 Ill. 2d 49, 59 (2006); Solaia Technology, LLC v. Specialty Publishing Co., 221 Ill. 2d 558, 579 (2006). For a section 2 \u2014 619 dismissal, our standard of review is de novo. Solaia Technology, 221 Ill. 2d at 579; Morr-Fitz, 231 Ill. 2d at 488.</p> <p id=\"b894-4\" pgmap=\"894\">When reviewing \u201ca motion to dismiss under section 2 \u2014 619, a court must accept as true all well-pleaded facts in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and all inferences that can reasonably be drawn in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.\u201d Morr-Fitz, 231 Ill. 2d at 488. In addition, \u201cit is well established that a cause of action should not be dismissed with prejudice unless it is clear that no set of facts can be proved under the pleadings which would entitle plaintiffs to relief.\u201d Morr-Fitz, 231 Ill. 2d at 488. \u201cIn ruling on a motion to dismiss under section 2 \u2014 619, the trial court may consider pleadings, depositions, and affidavits.\u201d Raintree, 209 Ill. 2d at 262. Even if the trial court dismissed on an improper ground, a reviewing court may affirm the dismissal if the record supports a proper ground for dismissal. Raintree, 209 Ill. 2d at 261 (when reviewing a section 2 \u2014 619 dismissal, we can affirm \u201con any basis present in the record\u201d); In re Marriage of Gary, 384 Ill. App. 3d 979, 987 (2008) (\u201cwe may affirm on any basis supported by the record, regardless of whether the trial court based its decision on the proper ground\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b894-5\" pgmap=\"894\">2. Timeliness of Section 2 \u2014 619 Motion</p> <p id=\"b894-6\" pgmap=\"894\"> \u201cFor a motion to be properly brought under section 2 \u2014 619, the motion (1) must be filed \u2018within the time for pleading,\u2019 and (2) must concern one of nine listed grounds.\u201d River Plaza Homeowner\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Healey, 389 Ill. App. 3d 268, 275 (2009), quoting 735 ILCS 5/2\u2014 619(a) (West 2006).</p> <p id=\"b894-7\" pgmap=\"894\">We cannot determine whether the first requirement of a timely filing was satisfied, since we cannot determine from the appellate record whether defendant received an extension to file an answer or a dismissal motion.</p> <p id=\"b894-8\" pgmap=\"894\">However, we do not find defendant\u2019s motion defective on this ground for two reasons. First, plaintiff did not claim either at the trial level or on this appeal that defendant failed to file its section 2 \u2014 619 motion \u201cwithin the time for pleading.\u201d 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619(a) (West 2006). \u201cIssues not raised are waived.\u201d River Plaza, 389 Ill.

Akinyemi, 391 Ill. App. 3d at 340-41; Cohen, 382 Ill. App. 3d at 110 (plaintiffs claim is not moot if \u201cthe timing of the defendant\u2019s tender\u201d indicates that it \u201cwas an attempt to unfairly \u2018pick off\u2019 the class action representative without offering him a full opportunity to\u201d be heard). For example, in Akinyemi, this court found no support for \u201cplaintiffs allegation of an unfair pick off\u2019 where defendant credited plaintiffs account before it had any notice of plaintiffs class action. Akinyemi, 391 Ill. App. 3d at 340-41. By contrast, in the case at bar, defendant credited plaintiffs account approximately a month after it was served with defendant\u2019s class action complaint. Compare with Hayman v. Autohaus On Edens, Inc., 315 Ill. App. 3d 1075, 1077-78 (2000) (where a corporate defendant provided the consumer plaintiff with a refund of the full amount at issue \u2014 a full month before the plaintiff had even filed his class action suit \u2014 plaintiffs claim was moot); Yu, 314 Ill.

App. 3d at 822 (we remanded in order to allow plaintiffs to move for certification, where the trial court had dismissed on mootness grounds, before plaintiffs had a reasonable opportunity to seek class certification) (quoted in Gelb II, 356 Ill.

App. 3d at 821 (plaintiff was diligent where, two weeks after the complaint, he \u201cattempted to initiate\u201d discovery concerning the putative class members, but it was stayed, and the case was dismissed a mere \u201c111 days\u201d after filing). On January 28, 2009, plaintiff moved to compel that discovery, presumably in anticipation of filing a certification motion and rebutting a claim of lack of numerosity. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 801(1) (West 2006) (to succeed on a motion for class certification, plaintiff must show that \u201c[t]he class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\u201d). On February 26, 2009, the trial court informed plaintiff that it was placing that issue on hold while defendant\u2019s dismissal motion was pending, and then the trial court granted the dismissal motion less than two weeks later. Only seven business days elapsed between the trial court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs motion to compel and the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the case. Seven days did not offer \u201ca reasonable opportunity\u201d to file a certification motion. Arriola, 323 Ill. App. 3d at 152 (\u201cthe plaintiff must have a reasonable opportunity to file a motion for certification\u201d); Gelb I, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 822 (it was premature for a trial court to dismiss on mootness grounds, without first allowing plaintiffs \u201ca reasonable opportunity to file a motion for [class] certification\u201d). By seeking discovery promptly and filing a motion to compel it, plaintiff \u201cexercised the required reasonable diligence\u201d in pursuing her class action claim, under the circumstances of the case at bar. Akinyemi, 391 Ill. App. 3d at 341; Cohen, 382 Ill. App. 3d at 110. \u201c[T]o hold otherwise would be to encourage plaintiffs to file class certification motions with the complaint,\u201d and thereby force trial courts to rule on certification, before any meaningful settlement discussion or discovery had taken place. Gelb I, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 822.</p> <p id=\"b899-3\" pgmap=\"899\">For these reasons, plaintiffs \u201cpick off\u2019 claim survives the tests articulated by this court in Akinyemi and related cases. Thus, defendant\u2019s unilateral act of crediting plaintiffs credit card did not make plaintiffs claim moot.</p> <p id=\"b899-4\" pgmap=\"899\">5. Other Exceptions to the Mootness Doctrine</p> <p id=\"b899-5\" pgmap=\"899\">Other exceptions to the mootness doctrine include (1) the \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d exception; and (2) the public interest exception. In re A Minor, 127 Ill. 2d 247, 257-58 (1989). Neither one applies to the facts at bar.</p> <p id=\"b899-6\" pgmap=\"899\">To receive the benefit of the \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d exception, the complainant must \u201cdemonstrate that: (1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.\u201d In re Barbara H., 183 Ill. 2d 482, 491 (1998), citing In re A Minor, 127 Ill. 2d at 258.</p> <p id=\"b899-7\" pgmap=\"899\">The criteria for the public interest exception are also well established. \u201c \u2018In order to fall into the public interest exception (1) the question must be of a public nature; (2) an authoritative determination of the question must be desirable for the purpose of guiding public officers; and (3) the question must be likely to recur.\u2019 \u201d Filliung v. Adams, 387 Ill. App. 3d 40, 56 (2008), quoting Brown v. Duncan, 361 Ill. App. 3d 125, 134 (2005).</p> <p id=\"b899-8\" pgmap=\"899(96) 900(103)\">Neither the repetition exception nor the public interest exception applies to the facts at bar. First, the \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d exception does not apply because there is not \u201ca reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.\u201d In re Barbara H., 183 Ill. 2d at 491, citing In re A Minor, 127 Ill. 2d at 258. The plaintiff in the case at bar now has her own personal contact at American Airlines, who presumably would reimburse plaintiff immediately (if not sooner) if the same exact sit\u00faation were to arise again. In addition, we could find that \u201cthe challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation\u201d only if we presumed that it would be too short because American Airlines would move quickly to pick off any possible class representative. In re Barbara H., 183 Ill. 2d at 491, citing In re A Minor, 127 Ill. 2d at 258. If we were going to make that assumption, then that analysis is better made under the \u201cpick off\u2019 rules and cases, which are discussed in section 4 (\u201cThe Refund\u201d) of our opinion.</p> <p id=\"b900-3\" pgmap=\"900\">Second, the public interest exception does not apply because \u201can authoritative determination of the question\u201d is not \u201cdesirable for the purpose of guiding public officers.\u201d The officials of American Airlines are not public officers. Filliung, 387 Ill. App. 3d at 56, quoting Brown, 361 Ill. App. 3d at 134.</p> <p id=\"b900-4\" pgmap=\"900\">6. \u201cPicking Off\u2019 Exception</p> <p id=\"b900-5\" pgmap=\"900\"> For these reasons, the \u201cpicking off\u2019 exception is the mootness exception that most aptly applies to the facts at bar. This exception has been applied before to permit a class action to proceed, as we are doing here. Gelb I, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 822; Hillenbrand, 308 Ill. App. 3d at 392.</p> <p id=\"b900-6\" pgmap=\"900\">Gelb I is almost identical to the case at bar. It would be almost impossible for us to rule differently without abandoning Gelb I. In Gelb I, as in the case at bar, defendants tendered a settlement offer to the named plaintiffs before plaintiffs had filed a motion for certification. Gelb I, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 811. In Gelb I, the tender occurred only a month and a half after suit was filed, and defendants then moved quickly to dismiss, claiming that their tender had mooted the case. Gelb I, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 811. Similarly, in the case at bar, the refund occurred only a month after suit was filed, and defendant moved to dismiss only a month after the refund. In Gelb I, we reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal order, finding that it was premature to dismiss on mootness grounds without first allowing plaintiffs \u201ca reasonable opportunity to file a motion for [class] certification.\u201d Gelb I, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 822. In Gelb I, we found that the plaintiff was diligent where, two weeks after the complaint, he \u201cattempted to initiate discovery\u201d concerning the putative class members but it was stayed. Gelb I, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 821. Similarly, in the case at bar, plaintiff served discovery to obtain the identities of putative class members only a month after having served defendant with her class action complaint; but, as in Gelb I, it was stayed. In Gelb I, we remanded in order to allow plaintiffs to move for certification, which is the same exact action that we are taking in the case at bar. Gelb I, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 822.</p> <p id=\"b901-2\" pgmap=\"901\">Similarly, in Hillenbrand, this court reversed and remanded, with directions that the trial court rule on class certification prior to ruling on any motions \u201cbased on the theory of mootness.\u201d Hillenbrand, 308 Ill. App. 3d at 392. In Hillenbrand, defendant had tendered a settlement offer which would have made the named plaintiffs entirely whole. Hillenbrand, 308 Ill. App. 3d at 390. After the offer, defendant moved for summary judgment claiming that, \u201cas a result of [defendant\u2019s] tender of payment, the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claim was moot, leaving them without standing to represent the purported class.\u201d Hillenbrand, 308 Ill. App. 3d at 385. We reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, stating that \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would allow a party to avoid ever defending a class action suit by simply tendering payment to the named plaintiffs.\u201d Hillenbrand, 308 Ill. App. 3d at 392. Similarly, in the case at bar, we reverse and remand to allow the trial court to rule on class certification.</p> <p id=\"b901-3\" pgmap=\"901\">7. Attaching Contract to Complaint</p> <p id=\"b901-4\" pgmap=\"901\">Second, defendant claimed that the trial court had to dismiss plaintiffs complaint, due to plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to attach the contract to her complaint. As noted above, the trial court did not dismiss the complaint on this ground. Nonetheless, we will consider this ground, since we may affirm the trial court\u2019s section 2 \u2014 619 dismissal on any ground supported by the appellate record. Raintree, 209 Ill. 2d at 262 (when reviewing a section 2 \u2014 619 dismissal, we can affirm \u201con any basis present in the record\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b901-5\" pgmap=\"901\">A plaintiff who alleges breach of contract is statutorily required to attach the contract at issue to her complaint. Section 2 \u2014 606 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201c[i]f a claim or defense is founded upon a written instrument, a copy thereof, or of so much of the same as is relevant, must be attached to the pleading as an exhibit.\u201d 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 606 (West 2006).</p> <p id=\"b901-6\" pgmap=\"901\">Defendant claimed that the trial court was statutorily required to dismiss due to plaintiff s failure to attach a contract. In support of its claim, defendant cited Plocar v. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts of America, Inc., 103 Ill. App. 3d 740, 749 (1981), and Cahill v. Eastern Benefit Systems, Inc., 236 Ill. App. 3d 517, 520 (1992).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Both cases bear little resemblance to the case at bar.</p> <p id=\"b902-4\" pgmap=\"902\">In Plocar, the appellate court stressed that \u201cthe trial court [had] afforded the plaintiffs three opportunities\u201d to remedy the deficiencies in their complaint before dismissing it. Plocar, 103 Ill. App. 3d at 750. In Plocar, plaintiffs had filed a total of three complaints. Plocar, 103 Ill. App. 3d at 743. After plaintiffs filed their original complaint, defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to attach the contract at issue, as required by our Code of Civil Procedure. Plocar, 103 Ill. App. 3d at 743. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, but simultaneously granted plaintiff a month to file an amended complaint. Plocar, 103 Ill. App. 3d at 743. After plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, defendants renewed their motion, and plaintiffs moved for leave to file a second amended complaint, which the trial court allowed them. Plocar, 103 Ill. App. 3d at 743. After plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint \u2014 still with no contract \u2014 the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, dismissing the complaint with prejudice. Plocar, 103 Ill. App. 3d at 743. The facts in Plocar remind us of the old adage: \u201cthree strikes and you\u2019re out.\u201d In Plocar, we affirmed the trial court, observing that \u201ca party does not have a right to unlimited amendments,\u201d and that, at some point, \u201c[t]he trial court may bring the litigation to an end\u201d when it believes that further amendments will not bear fruit. Plocar, 103 Ill. App. 3d at 750.</p> <p id=\"b902-5\" pgmap=\"902\">The facts in Cahill are similar to the facts in Plocar, except that the Cahill plaintiff was given five chances to attach the contract. In Cahill, plaintiff filed a total of five complaints before the trial court dismissed the case. Cahill, 236 Ill. App. 3d at 518 (trial court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s fourth amended complaint, which would have been their fifth filed complaint). See also Alpha School Bus Co. v. Wagner, 391 Ill. App. 3d 722, 748 (2009) (trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint, which would have been their fourth filed complaint, \u201cwithout granting them leave to amend\u201d again); Bruemmer, 329 Ill. App. 3d at 757-58 (trial court did not err, when \u201c[f] olio wing two [more] attempts to replead, the trial court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s third amended class action complaint with prejudice\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b902-6\" pgmap=\"902\">In the case at bar, since the trial court exercised its discretion not to dismiss on this ground, and since a trial court on remand would have the discretion to grant plaintiff leave to amend, we believe that it is premature for us, as a court of review, to affirm the dismissal on this basis. Plocar, 103 Ill. App. 3d at 749 (the decision of whether to grant plaintiff leave to amend is left to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion); 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 616(a) (West 2006) (\u201camendments may be allowed on just and reasonable terms\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b903-2\" pgmap=\"903\">8. Failure to State a Cause of Action</p> <p id=\"b903-3\" pgmap=\"903\">Defendant also claims that plaintiff failed to establish that defendant breached any contract term. A failure to state a cause of action is a claim properly brought pursuant to section 2 \u2014 615 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 615 (West 2006); Poo-Bah Enterprises, Inc. v. County of Cook, 232 Ill. 2d 463, 471-72 (2009). In the case at bar, defendant moved to dismiss pursuant to only section 2 \u2014 619 and the trial court ordered the case dismissed pursuant to that section. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619 (West 2006). Sections 2 \u2014 615 and 2 \u2014 619 are very different sections and are not interchangeable. A section 2 \u2014 615 motion asserts that the complaint failed to state sufficient facts which, if true, could entitle the plaintiff to relief. Poo-Bah, 232 Ill. 2d at 471-72. In marked contrast, a section 2 \u2014 619 motion admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint but asserts that some other matter defeats the action. DeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 Ill. 2d 49, 59 (2006).</p> <p id=\"b903-4\" pgmap=\"903\"> Although our Code of Civil Procedure permits a defendant to bring \u201ca combined motion,\u201d it requires a combined motion to \u201cbe in parts.\u201d 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619.1 (West 2006). \u201cEach part [of a combined motion] shall be limited to and shall specify that it is made under one of Sections 2 \u2014 615, 2 \u2014 619 or 2 \u2014 1005,\u201d which concern, respectively, a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, a motion to dismiss due to some affirmative matter, and a motion for summary judgment. 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 619.1 (West 2006), citing 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 615, 2 \u2014 619, 2 \u2014 1005 (West 2006); e.g., Heastie v. Roberts, 226 Ill. 2d 515, 525 (2007) (discussing a combined motion and its component parts). In the case at bar, defendant did not bring its motion in parts, labeled under different code sections. Defendant\u2019s motion was brought solely under section 2 \u2014 619.</p> <p id=\"b903-5\" pgmap=\"903\"> We will not analyze defendant\u2019s motion under section 2 \u2014 615, where plaintiff has not once amended her complaint, where the trial court may have freely granted her leave to amend in order to correct any deficiency, where defendant did not move pursuant to section 2 \u2014 615, and where the trial court did not analyze defendant\u2019s motion on that basis. Mulay v. Mulay, 225 Ill. 2d 601, 611 (2007) (after holding that dismissal was improperly granted under section 2 \u2014 619, our supreme court remanded so that the trial court could consider dismissal under section 2 \u2014 615).</p> <p id=\"b903-6\" pgmap=\"903(77) 904(142)\">\u201c[A] motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2 \u2014 615 should not be granted unless it is clearly apparent that no set of facts can be proved that would entitle the plaintiff to recovery.\u201d Alpha, 391 Ill. App. 3d at 735. \u201cAs a general rule, a trial court should exercise its discretion liberally in favor of allowing amendments if doing so will further the ends of justice, and it should resolve any doubts in favor of allowing amendments.\u201d Alpha, 391 Ill. App. 3d at 748 (dismissal of plaintiffs third amended complaint was not an abuse of discretion). In the case at bar, if we permitted a dismissal under section 2 \u2014 615, we would be robbing plaintiff of any opportunity to amend her complaint, which may have been relief that the trial court may have freely granted. Cf. Schwanke, Schwanke &amp; Associates v. Martin, 241 Ill. App. 3d 738, 743-44 (1992) (dismissal must be vacated if it was granted pursuant to a motion brought under the wrong section of the Code of Civil Procedure and if it resulted in prejudice to plaintiff). See also Gelb I, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 822 (it was premature for a trial court to dismiss on mootness grounds, without first allowing plaintiffs \u201ca reasonable opportunity to file a motion for [class] certification\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b904-3\" pgmap=\"904\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b904-4\" pgmap=\"904\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint pursuant to section 2 \u2014 619 and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Based on the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that defendant\u2019s act of unilaterally posting a credit to plaintiffs credit card did not make plaintiffs claims moot.</p> <p id=\"b904-5\" pgmap=\"904\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b904-6\" pgmap=\"904\">J.

Board of Education of Township High School District 205, 99 Ill. 2d 481, 459 N.E.2d 1364 (1984). The plaintiffs there were two teachers who had been dismissed by the defendant board of education. Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 483. The plaintiffs filed a class action complaint on behalf of 57 other teachers who had also been dismissed. Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 483. Nearly one month after the complaint was filed, the board offered, and the two named plaintiffs accepted, reinstatement. Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 483-84. The board moved to dismiss the complaint on mootness grounds four months later. Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 484. The trial court granted the motion. Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 484.</p> <p id=\"b904-10\" pgmap=\"904(34) 905(95)\">Our supreme court affirmed. Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 487. The court held the claims of the named plaintiffs became moot when the board granted the relief demanded by the complaint \u2014 namely, reinstatement. Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 485. Anticipating this finding, the plaintiffs argued in the alternative that the complaint was improperly dismissed because relief could still have been granted to the teachers who had not been offered reinstatement. Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 484. The court rejected this argument on two grounds: (1) the named plaintiffs failed to move for class certification before the trial court ruled on the board\u2019s motion to dismiss; and (2) no remaining member of the class sought to substitute himself as the named representative. Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 485-87.</p> <p id=\"b905-3\" pgmap=\"905\">An exception to Wheatley has slowly evolved in our appellate court. The exception, which the majority terms the \u201cpick off\u201d exception, has its origin in Arriola v. Time Insurance Co., 323 Ill. App. 3d 138, 751 N.E.2d 221 (2001). The court there relied on Wheatley in holding a class action cannot be sustained if the defendant tenders full damages to the named plaintiff before the plaintiff moves for class certification. Arriola, 323 Ill. App. 3d at 151. The court went on to say in dicta that had the named plaintiff moved for class certification early in the litigation, the result could have been different. Arriola, 323 Ill. App. 3d at 151-52. The court quoted this language from Susman v. Lincoln American Corp., 587 F.2d 866, 870 (7th Cir. 1978): \u201c \u2018If the class action device is to work, the courts must have a reasonable opportunity to consider and decide a motion for certification.\u2019 \u201d Arriola, 323 Ill. App. 3d at 152; see also 735 ILCS 5/2 \u2014 802 (West 2008). The Arriola court interpreted this language as implicitly holding that a class action plaintiff must be given a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to move for class certification before the case can be dismissed. Arriola, 323 Ill. App. 3d at 152. Arriola has since been cited for the proposition that a class action suit should not be dismissed where the defendant tendered full payment to the named plaintiff before the plaintiff had a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to move for certification of the class. See Gelb v. Air Con Refrigeration &amp; Heating, Inc., 326 Ill. App. 3d 809, 821, 761 N.E.2d 265 (2001); Bruemmer v. Compaq Computer Corp., 329 Ill. App. 3d 755, 763-64, 768 N.E.2d 276, 283 (2002); Cohen v. Compact Power Systems, LLC, 382 Ill. App. 3d 104, 109-14, 887 N.E.2d 668 (2008); Akinyemi v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 391 Ill. App. 3d 334, 340-42, 908 N.E.2d 163 (2009).</p> <p id=\"b905-4\" pgmap=\"905(85) 906(24)\">The exception to Wheatley developed through this line of cases has no basis in law. Susman did not hold, as the Arriola court suggested, that a named plaintiff in a class action suit is entitled to a reasonable opportunity to move for class certification. The court was concerned with the trial court\u2019s opportunity to rule on class certification once a motion to dismiss has been filed. Susman, 587 F.2d at 870. The court\u2019s holding was limited \u201cto the fairly narrow situation where a motion for certification has been pursued with reasonable diligence and is pending when a tender is made.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Susman, 587 F.2d at 871 n.4.</p> <p id=\"b906-4\" pgmap=\"906\">The majority cites public policy concerns in allowing a defendant to prevent class action litigation by \u201cpicking off\u2019 the named plaintiff before there is an opportunity to protect the interests of absent class members by moving for certification. But there is no prohibition against settlements with class members as long as the rights of non-settling class members are not affected. Jankousky v. Jewel Cos., 182 Ill. App. 3d 763, 767, 538 N.E.2d 689 (1989) (noting that public policy favors and encourages settlements). There is no suggestion here that defendant\u2019s refund to plaintiff affected the rights of others who did not receive similar refunds. Presumably, the remaining class members can either pursue class litigation or bring their claims individually. Indeed, this class action could have survived had one of the nonsettling class members substituted himself as the named representative. See Wheatley, 99 Ill. 2d at 487.</p> <p id=\"b906-5\" pgmap=\"906\">Plaintiff had 207 days, from the time the complaint was filed until the time the trial court ruled on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, to file a motion for class certification. She failed to do so. I would affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal under Wheatley.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
