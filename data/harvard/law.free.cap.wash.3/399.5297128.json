Under such instruction the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of the offense charged in the indictment, hut guilty of the crime of petit larceny. Defendant duly moved in arrest of judgment, and for his discharge in pursuance of said verdict. The court denied said motion, and sentenced the defendant as for conviction of petit larceny. Said actions of the court, in instructing the jury and imposing the sentence as above set forth, are assigned as error on this appeal. The learned judge of the court below must have construed the acts set out in said \u00a7 835 as equivalent to the taking and converting of the property embezzled, and to have concluded therefrom that under said section the value of the property would be material as establishing the grade of the larceny. We think, however, that said section cannot be thus construed. Certain acts therein set forth are by force of said section made a crime. The legislature has seen fit to declare that that crime shall be called larceny; but it does not follow that because they have called this offense by the same name as those set out in \u00a7 830 and \u00a7 831 of said code that it is the same. Under said \u00a7 835, the defendant is either guilty or not guilty of the crime charged. There are no grades thereunder. If he shall embezzle or fraudulently convert to his own use, under the circumstances named in said section, any property, he is guilty of the crime charged, whether the amount be great or small; and the only effect that the value of the property could have in a case under said section would be to influence the discretion of the court as to the penalty to be imposed. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>made a further objection, that the facis stated in the indictment did not constitute any offense; but the conclusion to which we have come, as above stated, makes it unnecessary to pass upon this question. The indictment, then, being for the offense stated in said section, and such offense being incapable of division into grades, it follows, that the verdict of the jury as above stated was substantially one of acquittal, and that the motion in arrest of' judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The judgment and sentence must be reversed, and the' prisoner discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Anders, O. J.. and Scott, Dunbar and Stiles, JJ.\u201e concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
