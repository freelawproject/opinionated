Carmichael was convicted in the San Bernardino County Superior Court of escape from lawful custody (\u00a7 4532, subd. (b)), burglary (\u00a7 459), and first degree robbery (\u00a7 211, former \u00a7 211a). He was sentenced to state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">On July 14, 1972, Carmichael was convicted in the San Luis Obispo County Superior Court of a violation of section 4500: assault by an inmate serving a life term.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Carmichael was sentenced to state prison for the term prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In 1981, Carmichael filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Solano County Superior Court. He requested the court to order the Board of Prison Terms to recompute his term of imprisonment for the violation of section 4500 and to give him the benefit of the lesser punishment provided by section 4501<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which proscribes in-prison assaults by nonlifers. His theory was twofold: (1) retroactive application of section 4501 was mandated by <em>People </em>v. <em>Community Release Bd. (Phoenix) </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 792 [158 Cal.Rptr. 238]; and (2) retroactive application of the lesser punishment was mandated by the equal protection clauses of the United States and California Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The trial court found in Carmichael\u2019s favor on the equal protection claim and issued a writ of habeas corpus directing the Board of Prison Terms to compute Carmichael\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201cwith application of the punishment for assault specified by <em>Penal Code </em>Section 4501, . . . \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">We begin with basics. Simply stated, the concept of equal protection is \u201c\u2018that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 480, 502 [96 Cal.Rptr. 553, 487 P.2d 1193].) Mr. Carmichael received treatment not merely \u201clike\u201d but identical to that afforded those with whom he was and is similarly situated: prisoners who are convicted of having committed assault while serving a life term. At the time of Mr. Carmichael\u2019s aggravated assault, the penal law of this state took a very dim view of such intramural crime: punishment was a life term without possibility of parole for nine years. (Stats. 1965, ch. 1904, \u00a7 1, p. 4412.) It continues to hold the same view and to impose the same punishment. (Stats. 1977, ch. 316, \u00a7 21, pp. 1264-1265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The elements of the offense proscribed by section 4500 are the same today as they were when the offense was committed by Mr. Carmichael: (1) an aggravated assault; (2) by a state prisoner; (3) <em>serving a life term-, </em>(4) with malice aforethought. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Noah </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 469, <em>477 </em>[96 Cal.Rptr. 441, 487 P.2d 1009]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Gaulden) (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 773, 778 [136 Cal.Rptr. 229].) Identity is also found in the reasons for discouraging such conduct. Simply stated, section 4500 was enacted to promote prison security by discouraging assaults by prison inmates <em>(People </em>v. <em>Noah, supra, </em>at p. 475; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Gaulden), supra, </em>at p. 778) and to deter the commission of such assaults by lifers who might otherwise believe they had nothing to lose. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 330, 335 [202 P.2d 53], cert. den., 338 U.S. 836 [94 L.Ed. 510, 70 S.Ct. 43]; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 880, 890 [160 Cal.Rptr. 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>The only part of the picture that has been modified is the punishment for robbery. When Mr. Carmichael was sentenced to prison in 1971, the punishment for robbery was\u2014under the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL)\u2014a term of five years to life. (Former \u00a7 213, subd. 1; Stats. 1967, ch. 149, \u00a7 1, p. 1216.) The maximum potentiality of that punishment \u2014life\u2014made him a \u201clife prisoner\u201d within the meaning of section 4500 even though the Adult Authority had the power to later fix a lesser term. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harmon </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 9, 16-17 [4 Cal.Rptr. 161, 351 P.2d 329], disapproved on other grounds in <em>In re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jefferson </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 438, 442-443 [303 P.2d 1024]; see also, <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.3d at p. 890.) With the advent of the UDSA, robbery became punishable by a state prison term of two, three, or four years. (\u00a7 213; Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 138, p. 5100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Mr. Carmichael compares his situation to that of a person who commits a robbery after the effective date of the DSL and later commits an aggravated assault in prison. Such a person, not a \u201clife prisoner\u201d within the meaning of section 4500 at the time of the assault, is obviously not subject to prosecution under that section as Mr. Carmichael was. Instead, the DSL robber is subject to prosecution under section 4501 (in-prison assault by a nonlifer). Thus, Mr. Carmichael\u2019s argument is close to being a play on words\u2014the wrong words. It is premised on an inaccurate characterization of his 1972 offense: Mr. Carmichael was not convicted of a crime of aggravated assault <em>by an inmate serving a robbery term </em>but of aggravated assault <em>by an inmate serving a life term. </em>Status as a lifer then defined and continues to define the assault offense under section 4500. That status of lifer at the time of the assault is what the Legislature was focusing on in attaching the severe penalties which flow from a section 4500 conviction. As we have noted, the Legislature was attempting to deter severely violent crime by those who might otherwise think themselves immune from punishment because they were already lifetime guests of the state penal system. For this reason it is the prisoner\u2019s status on the day of the offense that is crucial. Thus, a life prisoner may be validly convicted of violating section 4500 even though the conviction under which he became a life prisoner is later declared invalid. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Gaulden), <em>supra, </em>66 Cal.App.3d at p. 778; <em>Wells v. People of State of California </em>(9th Cir. 1965) 352 F.2d 439, 442, cert. den., 384 U.S. 1009 [16 L.Ed.2d 1021, 86 S.Ct. 1968].)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>In its equal protection analysis, the trial court identified two classes: (1) inmates serving a robbery conviction with an ISL sentence; and (2) inmates serving a robbery conviction with a DSL sentence. This is where its analysis went astray. The correct class comparison is: (1) inmates serving a life term under the ISL who commit an assault in prison; and (2) inmates serving a life-term under the DSL who commit an assault in prison. For each class the punishment for the prison assault is the same: a life term without possibility of parole for nine years. Identical punishment for identical crimes does not violate equal protection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The order granting the writ of habeas corpus is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Rattigan, Acting P.
