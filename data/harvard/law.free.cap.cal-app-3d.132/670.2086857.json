Real party in interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Wesley Wickham is the plaintiff in the action. Petitioner (hereinafter defendant) seeks an appropriate writ or writs (mandate and/or .., prohibition) requiring respondent court to vacate an order denying a motion to strike an amended complaint filed in the action; to vacate certain discovery orders; to grant the motion to strike; to desist from conducting further proceedings in the action; and to dismiss it. The principal question is whether the action survived in respondent court after (1) it had been removed to a federal court in diversity proceedings and (2) the federal court had dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Real party in interest (plaintiff) is a resident of California. He commenced action No. P 37639 by filing a complaint in respondent court on March 24, 1980. The pleading was captioned \u201cComplaint For Actual And Punitive Damages For Tortious Breach Of Insurance Contract.\u201d It named only defendant and fictitious parties as the defendants in the action. In the prayer of the complaint, plaintiff sought to recover $25,000 in general damages and $200,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Defendant is an Illinois corporation transacting the business of insurance in California. In proceedings conducted pursuant to federal law, it caused the action to be removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (hereinafter federal court) on the ground of diversity of citizenship. (See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1332, 1441, 1446.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the action had been removed, it was designated action No. C80 1627 AJZ in the federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint in the federal court, naming a California resident as an additional defendant in action No. C80 1627 AJZ. He also moved the federal court for an order remanding the action to respondent court on the ground that \u201cdiversity jurisdiction\u201d no longer existed in the federal court. The latter court dismissed the amended complaint, as to the additional defendant, and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Defendant then filed an answer in action No. C80 1627 AJZ. When it had been set for trial in the federal court, plaintiff moved \u201cfor an order dismissing the action without prejudice so that he could file <em>a new action </em>in a state court, naming additional nondiverse defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Italics added.) The federal court acted on the motion by filing an order in which it reviewed the history of the action and ordered it \u201cdismissed without prejudice\u201d on specified conditions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The order was filed on April 14, 1981. On the same date, the federal court filed a judgment in which action No. C80 1627 AJZ was formally \u201cdismissed without prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">On April 30, 1981, plaintiff filed in respondent court a \u201cFirst Amended Complaint For Tortious Breach Of Insurance Contract (Compensatory And Punitive Damages).\u201d The pleading was filed in respondent court\u2019s action No. P 37639 (i.e., in the action plaintiff had commenced in that court on Mar. 24, 1980). Defendant and five of its employees were named in the amended complaint as defendants in the action. Four of the employees were alleged to be residents of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Defendant moved respondent court for an order striking the amended complaint on the ground that the federal court\u2019s dismissal of the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>tion, without remanding it to respondent court, had operated to terminate it and to require plaintiff to commence a new action if his claims were to be pursued. Plaintiff filed written opposition to the motion, asserting that the proposed requirement would cause problems because \u201cthe Statute of Limitations has run.\u201d The motion to strike was heard on May 12, 1981. Respondent court denied it from the bench, expressing agreement with a statement by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that \u201cthe state court action is merely suspended during the federal court action [szc].\u201d A formal order denying the motion was filed on May 15, 1981. The court subsequently denied a motion by defendant for reconsideration of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Plaintiff had meanwhile commenced discovery proceedings in action No. P 37639 by noticing the depositions of California residents who had been named as defendants in the amended complaint but who had not been served with it. Defendant thereupon moved the federal court for an order vacating its dismissal of the action on the ground that the proposed discovery violated the conditions - of the dismissal by that court. (See fns. 2 and 3, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The motion was denied in an order made by the federal court on June 18, 1981. The court stated in this order that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s attempt to depose two Allstate employees who have not been served and hence have not been formally made parties to the action is indeed in technical violation of the conditions of this court\u2019s order of dismissal,\u201d but that defendant was \u201cnot unduly prejudiced by this violation\u201d and that \u201d[i]t may seek a protective order in state court . ... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Plaintiff next moved respondent court for an order compelling two of defendant\u2019s resident employees to give their depositions. Defendant opposed the motion on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to proceed and that the deposition proceedings were in violation of the conditions of the federal court\u2019s dismissal of the action. In an order made on June 23, 1981, respondent court granted the motion and ordered defendant\u2019s employees to appear for their depositions. Plaintiff subsequently noticed their depositions, and a motion for letters rogatory authorizing the deposition of other employees of defendant in the State of Illinois. Defendant thereupon commenced the present proceeding in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Defendant contends in its petition that respondent court was without jurisdiction to proceed in the action because the federal court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>had <em>dismissed </em>it without <em>remanding </em>it, and that the dismissal terminated it. Plaintiff argues that respondent court could \u201cresume\u201d jurisdiction after the federal court\u2019s dismissal because there is \u201cno substantive difference between a remand to the state court and a voluntary dismissal without prejudice [by a federal court] for the purpose of allowing the state action to proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Defendant\u2019s position is correct. One of the controlling federal statutes establishes that removal of a civil action from a state court to a federal court, on the ground of the defendant\u2019s diverse citizenship (see fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>operates as a literal \u201cremoval\u201d of <em>the </em>action from the state court and terminates that court\u2019s jurisdiction to proceed in it at the time. (28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1446 (a), (d), (e).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A companion federal statute makes it clear that proceedings in <em>the </em>action may thereupon be conducted in the federal court, which has exclusive jurisdiction after removal; that the federal court must \u201cremand\u201d <em>the </em>action to the state court of origin if federal jurisdiction is subsequently found wanting; and that the state court may resume its first-instance jurisdiction if\u2014but only if\u2014there is a \u201cremand\u201d of <em>the </em>action to it from the federal court. (28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1447 (a) and (c).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">It is undisputed that there was no <em>remand </em>by the federal court in the present case, and that the action was <em>dismissed </em>by that court on plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>tiff\u2019s motion. The dismissal was entered when the federal court had exclusive jurisdiction of the action. The fact that the dismissal was \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d permitted plaintiff to pursue his claims in another action, and this prospect was clearly portended throughout the proceedings in which he moved the federal court for dismissal. (See fns. 2, 3, and 4, <em>ante.) </em>The dismissal without prejudice nevertheless terminated <em>the </em>action, and placed him in a \u201clegal position\u201d as if he had never brought it. <em>(LeCompte </em>v. <em>Mr. Chip, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1976) 528 F.2d 601, 603.) There having been a dismissal without remand, there was no <em>action </em>in which respondent court could \u201cresume\u201d jurisdiction as plaintiff contends. That court consequently erred, and exceeded its jurisdiction, in permitting further proceedings in action No. P 37639 after the federal court had dismissed it as action No. C80 1627 AJZ. (Cf. <em>Styers </em>v. <em>Pico, Inc. </em>(1976) 236 Ga. 258 [223 S.E.2d 656, 657-658]; see also <em>Garden Homes </em>v. <em>District Court of Somerville </em>(1957) 336 Mass. 432 [146 N.E.2d 372, 373-374].)</p>\n<p id=\"AP7\">Plaintiff cites a single California decision <em>(Dauenhauer </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 22 [307 P.2d 724]) for the proposition that \u201c[a] <em>state court action </em>still exists after removal and is merely held in \u2018abeyance\u2019 or \u2018suspended\u2019 while <em>the federal action </em>proceeds.\u201d (Italics ours.) His literal references to two actions (one in each court) reflect a misinterpretation of what happens when <em>an </em>action is removed from a state court to a federal court. <em>Dauenhauer </em>does not support the dual references; it is distinguishable because it involved a remand by a federal court, not a dismissal (149 Cal.App.2d at p. 24), and it established only that removal of <em>an </em>action from a state court places its jurisdiction in a \u201cstate of suspension\u201d which may be terminated by a remand of <em>the </em>action from the federal court but not otherwise. (See <em>id., </em>at p. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"As1\">Defendant is entitled to a writ of mandate requiring respondent court to vacate its order denying the motion to strike the first amended complaint, and to grant the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1085, 1086; 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 86, par. (d), pp. 3860-3861.) Defendant has also demonstrated its entitlement to relief by way of a writ of prohibition restraining respondent court from proceeding in <em>the </em>action in excess of its jurisdiction. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1102, 1103; 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7\u00a7 39 [pp. 3813-3814], 54 [pp. 3829-3830].) A provision in a peremptory writ of mandate requiring dismissal of the action will serve this purpose. Dismissal by respondent court will amount to a pro forma repetition of the dismissal previously ordered by the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>court, but it will dispose of the action for respondent court\u2019s purposes. It will also operate to vacate the challenged discovery orders, none of which has been performed. The requisite peremptory writ is ordered below.</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\">Apparently anticipating the result we have reached, plaintiff in effect requests a determination by this court, that the statute of limitations was tolled, as to the fictitious defendants named in his original complaint, while the action was pending in the federal court. The statute of limitations has been identified as the source of the present controversy, but it has not been raised in either trial court; the record before us does not permit us to examine whether it has been tolled as suggested; and we do not reach that question.</p>\n<p id=\"AMFE\">A peremptory writ of mandate will issue, commanding respondent court to vacate its order denying the motion to strike the first amended complaint filed in action No. P 37639; to grant the motion; and to dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"AWqd\">Caldecott, P.
