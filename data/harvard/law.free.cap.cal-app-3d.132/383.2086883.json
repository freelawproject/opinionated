J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayk\">An information charging defendant with cultivation of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11358) was dismissed following an order of the trial court suppressing evidence of 515 growing marijuana plants (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (j)) and a finding that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1385). The People appeal. The issue concerns the extent of the privacy interest of the locator of an unpatented mining claim in the surface area of the property on which his claim resides. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">A Siskiyou County Sheriff\u2019s officer received information that marijuana was growing in the area of defendant\u2019s mining claim. He contacted the United States Forest Service which identified the claim site as public land. Special Agent Robert Dimmick, a forest service criminal investigator, accompanied sheriff\u2019s officers to the claim site. At the entrance to the driveway leading to defendant\u2019s residence there was a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign. As the officers drove up the driveway adjacent to defendant\u2019s house, they observed a marijuana plant growing in a pot on the front lawn. They followed a black plastic irrigation pipe down the road and, 60 to 80 yards beyond defendant\u2019s house, discovered 515 marijuana plants growing in an irrigated plot near a mine shaft opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">For purposes of the suppression hearing it was competently established that defendant\u2019s mining claim on which the marijuana was growing was located on United States Forest Service land. An officer from the forest service testified than an unpatented mining claim on forest service land gives the locator the right to mine minerals but does not confer surface ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The superior court held that a claim locator\u2019s limited possessory interest does not deprive him of the same \u201cFourth Amendment rights to which private landowners are entitled.\u201d Since there was no search warrant and no basis <em>for a </em>claim of exigency to justify the warrantless intrusion, the court suppressed as evidence all but the one potted marijuana plant found on defendant\u2019s front lawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In so ruling, the trial court was apparently guided by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curtis-Nevada Mines, Inc. </em>(E.D.Cal. 1976) 415 F.Supp. 1373, a case cited to the trial court by defendant and holding that only members of the public holding governmental recreation licenses or permits are entitled to access to land on which are located unpatented mining claims. That case was reversed on appeal, however, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curtis-Nevada Mines, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 611 F.2d 1277, a decision which was not cited to the trial court. In that case the federal court of appeals held that the general public has a right of free access to land on which are located unpatented mining claims for recreational use of the surface resources and for access to adjoining property, to the extent such uses do not interfere with mining activities (at p. 1286). The court of appeals decision pivoted on the court\u2019s interpretation of the 1955 Surface Resources and Multiple Use Act (30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 611-612). The broad purpose of the Surface Resources and Multiple Use Act (act) is to provide for multiple use of the surface of public lands not incompatible with subsurface resource development and to end abuses of the old law which permitted claims to be located with no intent to prospect or mine but rather to gain exclusive possession of surface resources. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1279-1282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Section (b) of the act (30 U.S.C. \u00a7 612) is directly relevant to the question before us. It provides in part: \u201c(a) Any mining claim hereafter located under the mining laws of the United States shall not be used, prior to issuance of patent therefor, for any purposes other than prospecting, mining or processing operations and uses reasonably incident thereto. [If] (b) <em>Rights under any mining claim hereafter located under the mining laws of the United States shall be subject, prior to issuance of patent therefor, to the right of the United States to manage and dispose of the vegetative surface resources thereof and to manage other surface resources thereof </em>[italics ours] (except mineral deposits subject to location under the mining laws of the United States). Any such mining claim shall also be subject, prior to issuance of patent therefor, to the right of the United States, its permittees, and licensees, to use so much of the surface therof as may be necessary for such pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>poses or for access to adjacent land: <em>Provided, however, </em>That any use of the surface of any such mining claim by the United States, its permit-tees or licensees, shall be such as not to endanger or materially interfere with prospecting, mining or processing operations or uses reasonably incident thereto: ...\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Vegetation consists of \u201cplant life\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1971) p. 2537). Marijuana is a plant (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11018). Entry by Agent Dimmick, a federal officer, on land the site of an unpatented mining claim to search for, remove or otherwise deal with illegally cultivated marijuana is squarely within the authority reserved by Congress to the federal government to \u201cmanage and dispose of the vegetative surface resources\u201d on such land. Arguably, illegally grown marijuana is not a \u201cresource\u201d within the meaning of the act; nevertheless, its discovery and removal is directly related to management of other vegetation indisputably within that classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Agent Dimmick did not initiate the entry onto defendant\u2019s mining claim. Siskiyou County Sheriff\u2019s deputies provided the impetus for the operation. Agent Dimmick accompanied them to show them where the claim was and to observe himself whether federal land was being put to unlawful use by cultivation of marijuana. Participation by or presence of a federal officer is not essential to a legal entry by local law enforcement officers on public land owned by the federal government. The act as construed by the court of appeals in <em>Curtis-Nevada Mines </em>provides that lands on which unpatented mining claims are located are open to access and uses by the public which do not interfere with mining activities (pp. 1283-1286). The local officers therefore were lawfully on the land and they had a right to seize contraband which they observed there in plain view <em>(Lorenzana </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 626, 634 [108 Cal.Rptr. 585, 511 P.2d 33]; <em>North </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 301, 306 [104 Cal.Rptr. 833, 502 P.2d 1305, 57 A.L.R.3d 55]). While it is clear the officers\u2019 observation of the growing marijuana was not coincidental to an entry for some nonlaw enforcement related purpose, inadvertence is not a prerequisite to a lawful plain view discovery <em>(North </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at pp. 307-308).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to establish that the marijuana was found on public land. As we have indicated, we are satisfied there is substantial competent evidence of public ownership of the land. However, even were we to accept the converse proposition, our conclusion would not change. A warrantless intrusion may be justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>fied by an officer\u2019s good faith reasonable belief that a person with authority to do so has given consent thereto. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carr </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 287, 298 [104 Cal.Rptr. 705, 502 P.2d 513].) The record shows the sheriff\u2019s officers acted only after contacting the forest service and receiving assurances the land was public. A forest service agent accompanied them to the site. Even if they were mistaken as to the status of the land, the officers\u2019 belief that the land was under the control of the forest service which consented to their entry was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed; the superior court is directed to vacate the order granting the motion to suppress, to enter a new order denying the motion and to take such further proceedings as are required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Carr, J., and Sparks, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
