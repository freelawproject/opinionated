J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALR\">The People appeal from the order of the Superior Court of Alameda County dismissing the action against defendant and respondent Pedro Padilla entered after the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence made pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5. The People contend on appeal that as a matter of law the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">At approximately 4:40 p.m. on January 13, 1981, Oakland Police Officer Silva was on duty in uniform and in a marked police car. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>area of 10th Avenue and East 12th Street, he noticed a yellow Buick Opel with no rear license plate and a broken taillight. He turned on his lights and siren. The Opel pulled to the side of the road and stopped. At about this time, Officer Emerson arrived in another police car and parked behind Officer Silva\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Officer Silva got out of his car and walked up to the driver\u2019s side of the Opel, told the driver the reasons for the traffic stop and asked to see his driver\u2019s license and car registration. Defendant was the passenger in the Opel. Officer Silva testified that \u201cAt that time my attention was distracted over to the passenger by his hands in his pants pockets and moving around nervously and just looking, turning his head every which way.\u201d Officer Silva was concerned that his \u201csafety was in jeopardy because of the way that he [defendant] was acting and his hands being the way they were.\u201d Officer Silva directed Officer Emerson \u201cto go over to the driver\u201d and Officer Silva went to the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle. Officer Silva asked defendant for some identification in an effort to get defendant to remove his hands from his pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Defendant, who did not remove his hands from his pockets, stated in Spanish that he had no identification with him and that it was at home. Officer Silva testified that at this point he was \u201creally getting concerned, so I asked him, \u2018Would you please step out of the vehicle.\u2019\u201d Defendant moved in the seat, kept his hands in his pockets and told Officer Silva that he actually did have identification with him. At this change in defendant\u2019s story, Officer Silva\u2019s concern increased and he again asked defendant to step out of the car. Defendant took his right hand out of his pants pocket and began to open the door. As he was exiting, defendant removed his left hand from his pocket and put a plastic baggie in a tray between the two bucket seats. The baggie contained a brown powdery substance that appeared to be heroin. Officer Silva reached through the open door and retrieved the baggie. Defendant was placed under arrest. The driver of the Opel was cited for the two vehicle violations and was allowed to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The United States Supreme Court has held that a police officer may ask a driver and/or passenger to get out of a vehicle, when the officer stops a vehicle for a routine traffic violation. <em>(Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms </em>(1977) 434 U.S. 106 [54 L.Ed.2d 331, 98 S.Ct. 330]; see also <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Connelie </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 291, 298 [55 L.Ed.2d 287, 293, 98 S.Ct. 1067].) The Supreme Court found such a request did not violate the Fourth Amendment, because the intrusion into the individual\u2019s per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>sonal liberty was <em>\u201cde </em>minimis\u201d and \u201c[w]hat is at most a mere inconvenience cannot prevail when balanced against legitimate concerns for the officer\u2019s safety.\u201d <em>(Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, supra, </em>at p. 111 [54 L.Ed.2d at p. 337].) It is not clear whether <em>Mimms </em>is the law in California. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Galbreath) (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 988, 990-991 [164 Cal.Rptr. 116]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Satchell </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 347, 353 [146 Cal.Rptr. 307].) Even if the law in California does not allow a police officer as a matter of course to request individuals to alight from their vehicles, an officer may do so \u201cwhen appropriate.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Simon) </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 186, 206, fn. 13 [101 Cal.Rptr. 837, 496 P.2d 1205].) Such a precautionary measure constitutes \u201ca lesser intrusion than a pat-down search, . . . . \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">It is clear in the instant case that Officer Silva did not request defendant to get out of the vehicle \u201cmerely by reason of the traffic citation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Brown) </em>111 Cal.App.3d 948, 956 [168 Cal.Rptr. 915].) Defendant\u2019s conduct gave Officer Silva sufficient reason to fear for his safety. The small intrusion on defendant\u2019s personal liberty was justified by the officer\u2019s legitimate concern for his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Defendant argues that Officer Silva was not entitled to ask for defendant\u2019s identification. To support his position defendant relies upon <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 47, 51 [61 L.Ed.2d 357, 362, 99 S.Ct. 2637], wherein the United States Supreme Court held if an officer detains a person for the purpose of having the person identify himself, the officer must \u201chave a reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the individual is involved in criminal activity.\u201d <em>Brown </em>is not in point in the instant case, because defendant was not detained for the purpose of obtaining his identification. The vehicle in which defendant was a passenger was lawfully stopped for traffic violations. Officer Silva testified that he asked defendant for his identification in an effort to get defendant to remove his hands from his pockets. Clearly, Officer Silva could merely have asked defendant \u201cto keep his hands in sight.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Simon), supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 186, 206, fn. 13.) Officer Silva was also justified in asking defendant for his identification in order to have defendant remove his hands from his pockets. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Clayton </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 335, 337 [91 Cal.Rptr. 494].) Defendant could have produced his identification without removing the plastic baggie from his pocket. The contraband was discovered in this case because of defendant\u2019s precipitous behavior in disposing of it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>not because the officer acted unreasonably or in an overbearing manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The order dismissing the action is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Feinberg, J., and Barry-Deal, J.; concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 30, 1982.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
