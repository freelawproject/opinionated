She contends she is the owner in fee simple of a one-third interest in the property by virtue of an automatic reversion provision in the deed. We read the deed to avoid a reversion. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">The complaint alleges that in June of 1967 Springmeyer (by a trustee) and two siblings granted 5.819 acres of land in El Dorado County to the city.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <em>habendum </em>clause in the deed declares that the land is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>be used for \u201cgovernment office purposes.\u201d Two conditions of reversion are declared. First, if the city fails to build and occupy one or more office buildings for city office purposes, by specified date, the property is automatically to revert to the grantors. Second, if subsequent to compliance with that condition, the real property ceases to be used for \u201cgovernment office purposes,\u201d an automatic reversion is to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In September of 1972 and July of 1979 the city allowed buildings and other structures to be built upon the property for use by the County of El Dorado. On July 23, 1979, plaintiff commenced this action alleging that the reversion conditions required defendant \u201cto utilize [the] property <em>solely </em>for municipal government purposes.\u201d The demurrer was granted for failure to state a cause of action. The court said that \u201cgovernment office purposes\u201d encompasses <em>\u201cany </em>government office, state, county, or city,\u201d and therefore the county uses objected to by plaintiff.\u201d Plaintiff appealed from the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">We are concerned here with the law of remedies. Plaintiff argues that any use of the property not <em>exclusively </em>for <em>city </em>offices violates the second condition and triggers an automatic reversion of the property to the grantors. We disagree. As we shall show, the test to be applied is whether the <em>deed </em>evinces a clear and unmistakable intention to cause a reversion if the property is not used exclusively for city government offices. We conclude that it does not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Plaintiff contends that a demurrer is an inappropriate procedure by which to test the meaning of \u201cgovernment office purposes\u201d since it precludes her use of extrinsic evidence of the grantors\u2019 intentions. She relies upon <em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 33 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641, 40 A.L.R.3d 1373] and <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Zaid </em>(1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 788 [74 Cal.Rptr. 371] for support. <em>Thomas Drayage </em>holds that \u201c[t]he test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face, but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 37.) In <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Zaid </em>the court applied this principle to the interpretation of a deed. It overruled a demurrer denying an amendment to a complaint, saying: \u201c[W]here \u2018a pleaded instrument is, because of the uncertainty of the language in which it is expressed, susceptible of more than one construction <em>as to its nature or as to the purpose intended by the parties to be attained by it, .. . </em>the construction of the party pleading it should be accepted, if such construction be reasonable\u2019 in considering a pleading attacked by general demurrer. <em>(Richards </em>v. <em>Farmers etc. Bank, </em>7 Cal.App. 387, 395 [94 P. 393].)\u201d <em>(Connell </em>v. <em>Zaid, supra, </em>268 Cal.App.2d at pp. 794-795.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">These authorities, generally applicable to written instruments <em>(Estate of Dodge </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 311, 318-319 [98 Cal.Rptr. 801, 491 P.2d 385]), do not control. The law views reversion as an anomalous doctrine, an exception to the general aversion to forfeiture. (See generally, Rest., Property, \u00a7\u00a7 44-58, pp. 121-199; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 46, pp. 153-155; Simes, <em>Restricting Land Use in California by Rights of Entry and Possibilities </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>of Reverter </em>(1962) 13 Hastings L.J. 293; Ferrier, <em>Determinable Fees and Fees Upon Condition </em>(1936) 24 Cal.L.Rev. 512.) Reversion is a drastic remedy for imposing the grantor\u2019s restrictions upon the use of the real property, whether the revocation of title operates automatically, upon the happening of a condition subsequent (a fee simple determinable),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or by reentry (a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent). Its all-or-nothing character has an inherent potential for working inequity, since it provides no occasion for comparison of the severity of the remedy with the gravity of the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">To minimize the potential for inequity, the law requires clear expression of the grantor\u2019s intent. A provision relied upon for reversion must use language that leaves no doubt of an intention to work a forfeiture upon the occurrence of the declared condition. (See, e.g., 2 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate (1977) Estates \u00a7\u00a7 15:4-15:6, pp. 601-607.) \u201cSuch conditions are not favored in law because they tend to destroy estates, and no condition in a deed relied on to create a condition subsequent will be so interpreted if the language of the provision will bear any other reasonable construction. While no precise form of words is necessary to create a condition subsequent, still it must be created by express terms or by clear implication .... There must be language used which is so clear as to leave no doubt that the grantor intended that an estate upon condition subsequent should be created\u2014 language which <em>ex proprio vigore </em>imports such a condition. [Citations.]\u201d (Ha<em>wley </em>v. <em>Kafitz </em>(1905) 148 Cal. 393, 394-395 [83 P. 248]; see also <em>Gramer </em>v. <em>City of Sacramento </em>(1935) 2 Cal.2d 432, 437-438 [41 P.2d 543]; see also <em>Cherokee Valley Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Summerville Ele</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>mentary Sch. Dist. </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 579, 587-588 [106 Cal.Rptr. 467].) These cases concern the issue whether the remedy of reversion was intended by the grantors. We are concerned here not with the intention to create the remedy, but with the conditions to which the remedy applies. It is but a short step from the one to the other. The policies directing clarity of expression apply with as much force to the terms of a reversion condition as to the existence of the remedy. It follows that the precise event which triggers the reversion must be plainly expressed in the deed. In case of doubt, the deed must be read to preclude reversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">These principles necessarily preclude the use of extrinsic evidence to clarify a latent ambiguity in the terms of the reversion condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is for the courts to independently determine from the face of the deed whether it requires reversion in the circumstances at issue. To survive a demurrer the <em>deed </em>must show a clear intention to allow a reversion upon the <em>particular </em>contingency which is alleged to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We apply these principles to the reversion language in the deed. The deed grants real property to the City of South Lake Tahoe. It requires, as a condition of the grant, that the \u201cgrantee\u201d construct, by June 30, 1972, office buildings upon the property \u201cfor the use and occupancy of various basic municipal government departments .. . including by way of example and without limitation, grantee\u2019s Building, Planning, and Recreation Departments and City Manager; but expressly excluding [its] use ... for corporate yard purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">These provisions unmistakably contemplate use of the property for <em>city </em>government purposes of the kind enumerated. The first reversion condition, as to which no issue is tendered, is tied to compliance with these conditions. At issue is the second reversion condition, which provides: <em>\u201cIf </em>after the Grantee has complied with all of said covenants and agreements and has constructed or caused to be constructed said office building or buildings upon said real property, <em>said real property at any time ceases to be and is no longer used for government office purposes, </em>then the title to said real property shall automatically revert to the Grantors herein, their heirs, successors and assigns.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The trial court determined that when the deed says \u201cceases to be ... used for <em>government </em>purposes\u201d it means <em>any </em>government office, state, county, or city, including, obviously, the County of El Dorado. The deed is easily susceptible of this reading since it displays the grantors\u2019 command of words of narrower governmental import (\u201ccity,\u201d \u201cmunicipal\u201d) implying a deliberate use of \u201cgovernment\u201d in its broader signification. The deed can also be read in context as the plaintiff avers. However, a showing of latent ambiguity is insufficient to survive a demurrer. If the language in the deed will bear a reasonable construction which avoids a reversion, that construction must be adopted. (See <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>Kafitz, supra, </em>148 Cal. at pp. 394-395.) We are thus compelled to accept the trial court\u2019s reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">We also affirm on an alternate ground. By accepting <em>arguendo </em>plaintiffs construction, we are presented with another ambiguity, whether <em>exclusivity </em>of city use should be <em>read into </em>the condition. We substitute \u201ccity government office\u201d in the deed where \u201cgovernment office\u201d occurs. The meaning thus ascribed to the <em>habendum </em>clause does not entitle plaintiff to quiet title.  No right of reversion inheres in such a clause <em>(Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>County of Modoc </em>(1913) 164 Cal. 493 [129 P. 794]), even if the purposes declared are exclusive. <em>(Beran </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 562, 564-565 [205 P.2d 107] [\u2018\u201cProperty is to be used for residence and service station purposes <em>only.'\u201d </em>(Italics added.)].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   The transformation of the second condition is also of no avail as it would then read, \u201c[i]f ... said real property at any time ceases to be and is no longer used for <em>city </em>government office purposes, then the title to said real property shall automatically revert to the Grantors .... \u201d Reasonably read, this produces an automatic reversion only if the property is no longer used for <em>any </em>city government purposes, a condition not alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Puglia, P.

The authority for it in California law is sparse, with the exception of the special case of exploratory oil and gas leases. (See, e.g., <em>Dabney </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1935) 5 Cal.2d 1 [53 P.2d 962, 103 A.L.R. 822].) That it can lawfully be extended beyond this case is questionable. (See Ferrier, <em>Determinable Fees and Fees Upon Condition, </em>supra; Comment, <em>Oil and Gas: \"Overriding Royalties\": \u201cProceeds Interests\" </em>(1938) 26 Cal.L.Rev. 480, 482, fn. 14.) The one square precedent is <em>McDougall </em>v. <em>Palo Alto etc. School Dist. </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 422 [28 Cal.Rptr. 37], which allowed such an estate without discussion of the policy issues involved. (Cf. <em>Parry </em>v. <em>Berkeley etc. Foundation </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 422 [74 P.2d 738, 114 A.L.R. 562]; and see Bowman, <em>Ogden\u2019s Revised Cal. Real Property Law </em>(Cont.Ed.Bar 1974) \u00a7 2.14, p. 34, where it is implied without reference to <em>McDougall </em>that no such estate exists.)</p>\n<p id=\"A_3\">\u2022 The problems arising from a reversion are illustrated in this case by the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the statute of limitations. Plaintiff says the statute is no bar because she \u201cautomatically\u201d came into possession in 1972. If this were the case, minor breaches, long past the normal five-year bar, would cloud the chain of title. Alternatively, if an action in ejectment is the remedy for a breach of such a condition, premature actions for minor breaches might be induced. Limiting a grantor to a right of reentry upon breach avoids these problems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\"><em>Cherokee Valley Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Summerville Elementary Sch. Dist. </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 579, 586 [106 Cal.Rptr. 467], suggests the contrary in dicta but without analysis of the implications of the strict drafting rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We do not mean to imply that in such circumstances the grantor is without remedy; rather, that the drastic remedy of revocation of title is not available.
