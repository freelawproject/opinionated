J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkG\">The Newport-Mesa Unified School District appeals from a judgment denying declaratory relief. The case involves the extent of the district\u2019s responsibility to pay for the private education of Dr. and Mrs. Hubert\u2019s son, Bernt, under the federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401 et seq.). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Statutory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (EAHCA) expanded an existing program providing federal grants to states for the education of handicapped children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The stated purpose of the legislation is \u201cto assure that all handicapped children have available to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>... a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs, to assure that the rights of handicapped children and their parents or guardians are protected, to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all handicapped children, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educate handicapped children.\u201d (Pub. L. No. 94-142, \u00a7 3(a); 89 Stat. 775.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">To receive federal funds under the EAHCA, a state must fulfill a number of eligibility requirements. Two such requirements are that the state must have \u201cin effect a policy that assures all handicapped children the right to a free appropriate public education\u201d (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(1)) and that the state must establish \u201cprocedural safeguards as required by section 1415 . ...\u201d (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(5)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The procedures required by section 1415 are \u201cto assure that handicapped children and their parents or guardians are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of free appropriate public education by [any State educational agency, local educational agency, or intermediate educational unit].\u201d (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(a).) Among the procedural safeguards is the right of the parents or guardian to have an \u201cimpartial due process hearing\u201d if the local educational agency refuses to change a child\u2019s educational placement. (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(2).) If the hearing is conducted by the local educational agency, the party aggrieved by the decision rendered in the hearing is entitled to an impartial review of the hearing by the state educational agency. (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(c).) Finally, a party aggrieved by the decision from the hearing or the review of the hearing may seek relief in a \u201cState court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States .. . . \u201d (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">At the heart of the controversy in the present case is what is commonly referred to as the \u201cstay put\u201d or \u201cstatus quo\u201d provision. Section 1415(e)(3) states, \u201cDuring the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or local educational agency and the parents or guardian otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then current educational placement of such child, or, if applying for initial admission to a public school, shall, with the consent of the parents or guardian, be placed in the public school program until all such proceedings have been completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>The procedural safeguards enumerated in section 1415 are interpreted in the Code of Federal Regulations (34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.500 et seq.) and are codified in this state in the Education Code (at \u00a7 56500 et seq.) and the California Administrative Code (at \u00a7 3300 et seq. of tit. 5). Thus, variations of the section 1415 \u201cstay put\u201d provision appear in the Code of Federal Regulations (34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.513), the Education Code (\u00a7 56505, subd. (d)), and the Administrative Code (tit. 5, \u00a7 3308, subd. (m); see also \u00a7 3124, subd. (m)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">California law also coincides with the EAHCA in having the general goal of assuring all handicapped children the right to a free appropriate public education. (See Ed. Code, \u00a7 56000.) The Legislature has expressly stated its intention \u201cto assure that all individuals with exceptional needs are provided their rights to appropriate programs and services which are designed to meet their unique needs under Public Law 94-142 [the EAHCA].\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">If the required free appropriate education cannot be provided in the public schools, a student is entitled to an appropriate education at a private school at no cost to his or her parents or guardian. (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413(a)(4)(B); Ed. Code, \u00a7 56365.) The private school need not be in California for a California school district to be responsible for the cost. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 56365, subd. (d); Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, \u00a7 3208.) However, a school district is not required to pay for a student\u2019s private school education if he or she is placed there by his or her parents and there is an available free appropriate public education. (34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.403(a); Ed. Code, \u00a7 56365, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Bernt Hubert is an educationally handicapped individual who was enrolled in special education classes at the Corona Del Mar High School of the Newport Mesa Unified School District. Bernt\u2019s parents became dissatisfied with his progress at the high school and requested that his individualized education program (see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(19); Ed. Code, \u00a7 56340 et seq.) include the placement of Bernt at the Provo Canyon School, a private school in Utah. The school district refused, claiming it could provide an appropriate education within the public school system. In light of the dispute, the Huberts requested a due process hearing in October 1979. One month later, before the due process hearing was held, Bernt\u2019s parents unilaterally removed Bernt from Corona Del Mar High School and enrolled him, at their own expense, at Provo Canyon School.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">A fair hearing panel met three times during January 1980 and decided to defer its final decision until after Bernt could undergo a comprehensive inpatient diagnostic evaluation. Following the evaluation, the panel met again in June 1980 and issued its decision. The panel found that the school district did not have an appropriate educational program and that Bernt was appropriately placed at Provo Canyon School. Additionally, the panel ordered the school district to \u201cpay for the cost of Bernt\u2019s education and related services at Provo Canyon School from the date of placement [i.e., when Bernt\u2019s parents first enrolled him at the private school] . .. . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The school district appealed the fair hearing panel\u2019s decision to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The superintendent affirmed the panel\u2019s decision on September 29, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">On October 30, 1980, the school district filed the instant action for declaratory relief. The only portion of the superintendent\u2019s decision that was challenged was the order holding the school district financially responsible for Bernt\u2019s expenses at Provo Canyon School incurred during the pendency of the administrative proceedings. The school district has conceded that Provo Canyon School was the appropriate placement for Bernt and has accepted its responsibility to pay for his education at Provo Canyon School from September 29, 1980, the date of the superintendent\u2019s decision. The trial court ruled in favor of the Huberts and two appeals followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The issue to be decided is whether the Huberts should be reimbursed for the costs of Bernt\u2019s private schooling that were incurred during the pendency of the administrative proceedings held to determine the appropriate placement for Bernt. The Huberts contend that to deny them reimbursement would amount to a deprivation of Bernt\u2019s statutorily guaranteed right to a free appropriate education. They claim that they took a financial gamble by placing Bernt in private school pri- or to the conclusion of the administrative proceedings. If the final decision had been that the school district was capable of providing an appropriate education, the Huberts concede that they would have no right to reimbursement. However, because their position has been vindicated, they assert that the school district should comply with its statutory duty to provide a free appropriate education by paying for that which the administrative hearings determined it should have been paying for all along. The school district contends that the Huberts are not entitled to reimbursement, because they violated the \u201cstay put\u201d provision of the applicable state and federal laws. Although the Huberts\u2019 position is persuasive from a policy standpoint, the law as written by Congress and the California Legislature supports the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Congress has set out in explicit detail the manner in which complaints concerning the provision of a free appropriate education are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>be handled, and California, as required, has established procedures in conformity with the federal law. There must be \u201can opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the . . . educational placement of the child . ...\u201d (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(1)(E).) Whenever such a complaint is presented, there must be \u201can opportunity for an impartial due process hearing\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(2)) and \u201cany party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in such a hearing may appeal to the State educational agency ...\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1415(c)). However, \u201c[d]uring the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or local educational agency and the parents or guardian otherwise agree, the child <em>shall </em>remain in the then current educational placement of such child . . ..\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(3), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">In the present case, the Huberts had a due process hearing on their complaint concerning Bernt\u2019s educational placement, and the school district, as the party aggrieved, appealed the hearing decision to the Superintendent of Public Instruction. But, contrary to the express mandate of state and federal law, the Huberts changed the educational placement of their son during the pendency of the administrative proceedings without the consent of the state or local educational agency. Although the statutes do not address the issue of reimbursement if parents should violate the \u201cstay put\u201d provision, it is inconceivable that the procedural system structured by Congress and adopted by the California Legislature would require parents to be compensated for costs they incurred in violating that very system. It is even less likely that Congress and the California Legislature intended that a child\u2019s early transfer to a more appropriate educational placement at public expense should depend upon the financial ability of the parents to initially pay the cost of private placement and assume the risk of obtaining reimbursement only if the administrative proceeding vindicates the parent\u2019s choice. In short, we see no reason to doubt that Congress meant what it said when it enacted section 1415(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The Huberts\u2019 argument that a failure to reimburse them is contrary to the purpose of EAHCA is unavailing. It is true that the legislation was passed to assure all handicapped children a free appropriate public education and that it was intended to \u201cresult in maximum benefits to handicapped children and their families.\u201d (Sen. Rep. No. 94-168, 1st Sess., p. 6 (1975), reprinted in 1975 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 1430.) However, within this general statutory framework, Congress enacted a specific rule, the \u201cstay put\u201d provision, which directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>applies to this case. The purpose of EAHCA would not be served by an interpretation which would in effect make the \u201cstay put\u201d provision applicable only to the handicapped children of parents who are not wealthy enough to assume the financial risk of giving their child a private education. In any event the general intent of the EAHCA cannot negate the clear and unambiguous meaning of one of its specific provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The Huberts also direct our attention to the state and federal regulations which state that the \u201cstay put\u201d provision does not preclude a school district from removing a child from school if the child is endangering himself or others. (See comment to 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.513; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, \u00a7 3308(m)(l).) It is contended that because parents were not included in this \u201cexception,\u201d both Congress and the California Legislature intended to limit the unilateral actions of school districts only, and not of parents. Again, the Huberts\u2019 argument avoids dealing with the clear language of the law. If section 1415(e)(3) was not meant to also proscribe unilateral parental action, that section would not require the agreement of the parents <em>and </em>the state or local educational agency to alter the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The same conclusion was reached in the similar case of <em>Stemple </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of Prince George\u2019s Cty. </em>(4th Cir. 1980) 623 F.2d 893, cert. den. (1981) 450 U.S. 911 [67 L.Ed.2d 334, 101 S.Ct. 1348]. There, as here, the parents sought reimbursement after unilaterally moving their handicapped child to a private school prior to any administrative hearings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court ruled that section 1415(e)(3) imposed a duty on the parents not to remove their child from the public schools while the administrative proceedings were pending and stated, \u201cOf course, that duty may not be totally enforceable by the state, but it certainly negates any right on the part of parents, in violation of the duty and in the absence of agreement, to elect unilaterally to place their child in private school and recover the tuition costs thus incurred.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 897.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>State of Neb. </em>(D.Neb. 1980) 491 F.Supp. 1074, affirmed in part, vacated in part (8th Cir. 1981) 645 F.2d 592, the \u201cstay put\u201d provision was likened to \u201can automatic preliminary injunction.\u201d (491 F.Supp. at p. 1088.) The court held that \u201cthe maintenance of the status quo under the [EAHCA] requires not only that a child be edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>cated in the same placement during any proceeding under the Act, but also that no change in the financing of that placement occur.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1089.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(7th Cir. 1981) 658 F.2d 1205 arrived at the same result as <em>Stemple </em>and <em>Monahan, </em>but for a different reason. The <em>Anderson </em>court first stated that \u201cbecause we are certain that parents have the right to move their handicapped children to private schools, we view section [1415(e)(3)] as expressing a congressional preference rather than as creating a statutory duty.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1209.) Reimbursement was not permitted, however, because it was concluded that the EAHCA did not provide for a damages remedy absent exceptional circumstances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Nothing in the legislative history of the EAHCA is contrary to our holding. The discussions of the \u201cstay put\u201d provision itself are nothing more than paraphrases of the statutory language. (See, e.g., Sen. Conf. Rep. No. 94-455, 1st Sess., p. 50 (1975), reprinted in 1975 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 1503; remarks of Sen. Williams, 121 Cong. Rec. 37416 (1975).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As for the procedural safeguards in general, a major concern expressed was that all proceedings to resolve complaints be conducted expeditiously so as to minimize the time a handicapped student was without an appropriate education.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This indicates congressional concern for the child who is inappropriately placed, but also shows an intent that the problem be remedied through the impartial hearing process and not by unilateral action.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Although we find no right to reimbursement in the present case, we do not read section 1415(e)(3) as an absolute bar to the recovery of costs incurred by parents in unilaterally moving their child to a private school during the pendency of the due process proceedings. In some cases, such as when the proceedings take an inordinate amount of time contrary to congressional intent (see fn. 8 and text, <em>ante), </em>such action by the parents might be justified.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, no circumstances excusing a violation of the \u201cstay put\u201d provision have been presented in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Finally, we do not find applicable the cases cited by parents and amici. The opinions from other states\u2019 courts do not discuss federal law, but base their decisions solely on interpretations of their states\u2019 particular statutory schemes, which schemes appear to differ significantly from California law. <em>(Board of Ed. </em>v. <em>Conn. State Bd. of Ed. </em>(1980) 179 Conn. 694 [427 A.2d 846]; <em>Krawitz </em>v. <em>Com., Dept. of Ed. </em>(1979) 48 Pa.Commw.Ct. 155 [408 A.2d 1202]; <em>Amherst-Pelham Reg. School </em>v. <em>Dept. of Ed. </em>(1978) 376 Mass. 480 [381 N.E.2d 922].) The federal cases relied upon, are not relevant since they deal with issues different than that present here. (Cox v. <em>Brown </em>(D.D.C. 1980) 498 F.Supp. 823 (preliminary injunction granted placing children in private schools); <em>Frankel </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ed. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1979) 480 F.Supp. 1156 (\u00a7 1415(e)(3) not in issue); <em>Boxall </em>v. <em>Sequoia U. High Sch. Dist., supra, </em>464 F.Supp. 1104 (\u00a7 1415(e)(3) not in issue).) The only case that we have seen that truly supports the Huberts\u2019 position is <em>Blomstrom </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Dept. of Ed. </em>(D.Mass. 1982) 532 F.Supp. 707. With that case, we simply disagree. Although the court makes a strong policy argument,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we believe that the clear language of section 1415(e)(3) must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>The judgment against the Newport-Mesa Unified School District (4 Civ. 27087) is reversed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The appeal from the \u201corder after hearing\u201d (4 Civ. 25824) is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Kaufman, J., and Hamilton, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 2, 1982, and respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 25, 1982.

On April 14, 1981, an \u201corder after hearing\u201d was filed declaring the writ of mandate petition moot, ordering the school district to pay the Huberts \u201cas ordered by the Fair Hearing Administrative decision,\u201d awarding court costs to the Huberts, and denying the Huberts\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees. That same day, the court denied the school district\u2019s request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. On April 22, the court amended its order nunc pro tunc to award $2,500 in attorney\u2019s fees to the Huberts.

Dist. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1979) 464 F.Supp. 1104, 1112; but see also <em>Lombardi </em>v. <em>Ambach </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1981) 522 F.Supp. 867, 872 (claim for reimbursement barred in federal court by 11th Amendment).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The conference report noted that \u201clanguage is also adopted to require that during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceedings regarding a complaint, unless the State or local educational agency and the parents or guardian of the child otherwise agree, the child involved in the complaint shall remain in his or her present educational placement .... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Senator Williams stated, \u201cI cannot emphasize enough that delay in resolving matters regarding the education program of a handicapped child is extremely detrimental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>to his development. The interruption or lack of the required special education and related services can result in a substantial setback to the child\u2019s development. Thus, in view of the urgent need for prompt resolution of questions involving the education of handicapped children it is expected that all hearings and reviews conducted pursuant to these provisions will be commenced and disposed of as quickly as practicable consistent with fair consideration of the issues involved.\u201d (121 Cong. Rec. 37416.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Similarly, Senator Stafford stated, \u201cThe conferees [the House and Senate members who drafted the final version of the EAHCA] are cognizant that an impartial due process hearing may be required to assure that the rights of the child have been completely protected. We did feel, however, that the placement, or change of placement should not be unnecessarily delayed while long and tedious administrative appeals were being exhausted. Thus, the conference adopted a flexible approach to try to meet the needs of both the child and the State.\u201d (121 Cong. Rec. 37412.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Such a position has been taken in other cases. In <em>Foster </em>v. <em>District of Columbia Bd. of Ed. </em>(D.D.C. 1981) 523 F.Supp. 1142, a mother unilaterally moved her child to a private school and then requested reimbursement at a subsequent due process hearing. The court found that the \u201cstatutory scheme specifically prohibits the plaintiffs in the instant case from the self-help of placing the child in a private school and then later seeking reimbursement of tuition.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1144.) However, the court stated that \u201c[s] elf-help may be sanctioned, indeed requisite, in some exceptional cases, with unique factual occurrences, where the parent has exhausted all other avenues for relief or other considerations of justice compel it.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1146.) The court went on to note that \u201c[t]he purpose of the due process hearing procedures is to assure that parents\u2019 grievances are addressed quickly and efficiently by an impartial third party. One of the myriad of claims which a hearing may address is a parent\u2019s claim that she and her child have been so aggrieved by the actions of the school authorities that removal of the child from the public schools was a reasonable course of action.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1146, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>658 F.2d 1205, the court held that although damages should not generally be awarded in actions under the EAHCA, \u201cwe can envision at least two exceptional circumstances in which a limited damage award might be appropriate.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1213.) The two circumstances mentioned were the parents unilaterally changing the status quo when necessary to protect the child\u2019s physical health or when the school board \u201chas acted in bad faith by failing to comply with the procedural provisions of section [1415] in an egregious fashion.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1214.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In their appellate briefs, both the parents and amici make allegations of facts purporting to justify the unilateral action that was taken. Parents claim that they placed Bernt at Provo Canyon School because he was a danger to himself, and amici assert that the school district did not fulfill its responsibility of holding a fair hearing within 35 days of the receipt of the parents\u2019 request for such a hearing (see Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, \u00a7 3308(e)). However, they are of no consequence on appeal since no such factual issues were presented to or decided by the trial court. This is evident from the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>discussion, which occurred prior to oral argument in superior court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cThe Court: You guys are stipulating to submit the whole case, and I will decide the whole case and get it over with? You don\u2019t want a trial on the declaratory relief action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cMr. Mahaffa [parents\u2019 attorney]: We will, your honor. We really don\u2019t need a trial. The only part of the administrative decision the district is appealing is the legal issue. We don\u2019t need a trial. If we had never brought our motion for temporary relief and had set the matter for a trial date, we would have gone in on a summary judgment because we\u2019re looking solely to the legal issue, federal statute 1415(e) .... When that\u2019s resolved, the interpretation of that statute, it will afford relief either for their position or our position.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The court held that the general intent of the EAHCA should govern the reimbursement issue, because \u201cthere is nothing in the legislative history that mentions, and therefore prohibits, reimbursement.\u201d (532 F.Supp. at p. 710.) The court also made the following comments: (1) \u201cSince the EAHCA was a compromise that carefully considered budgetary constraints facing local communities and the problems inherent in evaluating children with special needs ... the best rule is one that forces each party to bear the costs of their own errors while simultaneously keeping in mind the best interests of the child\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 712); (2) \u201cWhen the Act is considered in light of the practical application of the due process provisions the logical construction of \u00a7 1415(e)(2) and \u00a7 1415(e)(3) permits reimbursement. Given the inevitably protracted nature of any due process proceedings, the best interests of the child and his family would not be served by forbidding the parents to move the child\u201d <em>(id.); </em>(3) \u201cCongress did not intend to create a system that would cause a child to stay mired in an inappropriate program while the appellate mechanism slowly determined his fate. [Citation.] Permitting reimbursement is a sound compromise. If the school committee was initially wrong everyone would be restored to the position the statute initially sought to encourage. If the parent was incorrect they must bear the financial burden of giving their child a private education as any other parent would. In both cases, however, the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>receives the education considered appropriate by his parents, the party normally vested with the power to make such decisions.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 713.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Because the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the Huberts was made to them as the prevailing parties, we reverse that award solely because we have determined that they should not have prevailed.
