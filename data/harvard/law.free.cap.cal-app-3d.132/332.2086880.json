We answer this question in the affirmative and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">After Sophia Elam filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice against doctors Martin J. Schur, Merrill F. Cahn and Samuel Markarian, and College Park Hospital (Hospital),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hospital was granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Elam complains Schur, a licensed podiatrist, performed negligent podiatric surgery at Hospital to correct bilateral bunions and bilateral hammer toes. She was admitted to Hospital for surgery by Schur and Markarian, a medical doctor, pursuant to a hospital coadmission procedure requiring concurrence of a medical doctor before admitting a podiatric patient and the physician\u2019s assumption of responsibility for the overall medical care of that patient, including the taking of a medical history and the performance of a physical examination to insure podiatric surgery is not contraindicated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The surgery was performed by Schur and Cahn.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">Schur was always an independent contractor with Hospital and never an employee or agent. He was never paid by Hospital, as he operated his own office and billed Elam directly. She had personally selected him for medical treatment. In June 1974 he applied for appointment to Hospital\u2019s medical staff. After verifying his doctor of podiatric medicine degree, state podiatric license, and podiatric surgery privileges at Hillside and Heartland Hospitals in San Diego, Hospital\u2019s governing board granted Schur podiatric surgery privileges on April 25, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"A0o\">Between April 25, 1975 and the date of surgery, Hospital\u2019s medical care evaluation committee (later renamed patient care evaluation committee), was responsible for evaluating and improving the quality of care rendered to patients treated at Hospital. The committee met monthly, reviewing the medical charts of doctors and podiatrists treating patients at Hospital. On this routine basis, Schur\u2019s medical charts were reviewed along with the charts of other doctors and podiatrists. The committee constituted a peer review mechanism designed to continually monitor, evaluate and improve the quality of medical care furnished patients at Hospital in compliance with the standards of the JCAH. The committee never complained or reported to the Hospital\u2019s administration it considered or had reason to consider Schur incompetent or unqualified to practice, podiatric surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Elam\u2019s counsel has handled three other cases against Schur, including <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Schur, </em>No. 354963, filed June 17, 1974; <em>Earlywine </em>v. <em>Schur, </em>No. 359278, filed October 22, 1974; and <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Schur, </em>No. 383533, filed June 17, 1976. Each case involved Schur\u2019s first seeing the patient less than a week before the operation. In its answers to interrogatories, Hospital <em>admits it learned of the Bailey malpractice suit against Schur approximately four and one-half months before Elam\u2019s </em>surgery,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\n<em>The Doctrine of Corporate Hospital Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Elam asserts Hospital breached its duty to her of insuring the competence of its staff physicians.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, she contends a hospital owes a duty to the patient of selecting and reviewing the competency of its staff physicians carefully. California case precedent establishes a hospital may be held liable for a doctor\u2019s malpractice when the physician is actually employed by the hospital or is ostensibly the agent of the hospital (see <em>Quintal </em>v. <em>Laurel Grove Hospital </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 154, 166-168 [41 Cal.Rptr. 577, 397 P.2d 161]; <em>Seneris </em>v. <em>Haas </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 811, 829-832 [291 P.2d 915, 53 A.L.R.2d 124]; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>California Lutheran Hospital </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 296, 304 [163 P.2d 860]), but not absent such a relationship (see <em>Meier </em>v. <em>Ross General Hospital </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 420, 435 [71 Cal.Rptr. 903, 445 P.2d 519]; <em>Mayers </em>v. <em>Litow </em>(1957) 154 Cal.App.2d 413, 417-418 [316 P.2d 351]; <em>Konnoff v. Fraser </em>(1944) 62 Cal.App.2d 788, 791 [145 P.2d 368]; compare, <em>Hedlund </em>v. <em>Sutter Med. Serv. Co. </em>(1942) 51 Cal.App.2d 327 [124 P.2d 878] (hospital may be held liable for tortious acts of physicians where it has contracted to furnish medical services)). However, we find no appellate decision of this state addressing precisely this application of the doctrine of corporate hospital liability (Comment, <em>Piercing The Doctrine of Corporate Hospital Liability, supra, </em>17 San Diego L.Rev. 383, 386, fn. 16), nor \u201cconsidering] tort liability of a hospital for negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>selection or retention of staff practitioners\u201d <em>(Matchett </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 623, 629, fn. 4 [115 Cal.Rptr. 317]; Comment, <em>The Hospital\u2019s Responsibility for its Medical Staff: Prospects for Corporate Negligence in California, supra, </em>8 Pacific L.J. 141, 142.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, we treat this matter as one of first impression.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The essential elements of actionable negligence include: (1) a defendant\u2019s legal duty to use due care; (2) a breach of that duty; and (3) the breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury. <em>(United States Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Haidinger-Hayes, Inc. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 586, 594 [83 Cal.Rptr. 418, 463 P.2d 770]; <em>George A. Hormel &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Maez </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 963, 966 [155 Cal.Rptr. 337]; <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>J. D. Diffenbaugh Co. </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 494, 504 [124 Cal.Rptr. 467].) Hospital argues it does not owe its patients a legal duty to exercise reasonable care in selecting, reviewing and periodically evaluating the competency of the physicians and podiatrists it permits to treat patients within its facilities. Therefore, even if its unreasonable actions were a proximate cause of Elam\u2019s injuries, it may not be held liable on a negligence theory. Accordingly, in order to determine whether the doctrine of corporate hospital liability should be applied, we must determine whether the cited legal duty of care exists\u2014\u201can essential precondition to liability founded on negligence.\u201d <em>(Hooks </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Permanente Medical Group </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 435, 443 [165 Cal.Rptr. 741].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The threshold determination of whether a duty is owed the plaintiff constitutes primarily a question of law within the exclusive province of the court. <em>(Weirum </em>v. <em>RKO General, Inc. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 40, 46 [123 Cal.Rptr. 468, 539 P.2d 36]; <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 350, 355 [159 Cal.Rptr. 446].) \u201cDuty, however, is a rather ephemeral concept: It may be imposed by statute or the terms of a contract; it may arise from the character of particular activities or from the nature of human society itself\u2014and its ascertainment and definition in any specific factual context is an imprecise task at best.\u201d <em>(Valdez </em>v. <em>J. D. Diffenbaugh Co., </em>supra, 51 Cal.App.3d 494, 505.) Consequently, its existence or absence \u201ccannot be determined by mechanical or formal tests. Rather, \u2018judicial recognition of such duty ... is initially to be dictated or precluded by considerations of public policy.\u2019\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Alameda County Social Services Agency </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 929, 935 [153 Cal.Rptr. 712], quoting <em>Peter W. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 814, 822 [131 Cal.Rptr. 854].) In other words, \u201c\u2018\u201cduty\u201d is not sacrosanct in itself, but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u2019\u201d <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 728, 734 [69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912, 29 A.L.R.3d 1316], quoting Prosser Law of Torts (3d ed. 1964) at p. 333; <em>Weirum </em>v. <em>RKO General, Inc., </em>supra, 15 Cal. 3d 40, 46; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Alameda County Social Services Agency, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d 929, 935.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Our analysis of whether Hospital owed the disputed duty to Elam commences with the fundamental policy embodied in Civil Code section 1714, providing liability for injuries to another caused by one\u2019s failure to exercise ordinary care under the circumstances. (See <em>Hooks </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Permanente Medical Group, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.3d 435, 443; <em>George A. Hormel &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Maez, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.3d 963, 967.)  \u201cDuty\u201d is thus presumed, as \u201cno .. . exception should be made unless clearly supported by public policy.\u201d <em>(Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 112 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561, 32 A.L.R. 3d 496].) Such \u201c[a] departure from this fundamental principle involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the balancing of a number of considerations; the major ones are the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 112-113.) However, the primary consideration is the foreseeability of the risk.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Weirum </em>v. <em>RKO General, Inc., supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 40, 46; <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 728, 739.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Although not involving the determination of whether a hospital can be directly liable for the negligence of its staff physicians, case precedent establishes a hospital has a duty of reasonable care to protect patients from harm <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>California Lutheran Hospital, supra, </em>27 Cal.2d 296, 299), including the discovery and treatment of their medical conditions. (See <em>Guilliams </em>v. <em>Hollywood Hospital </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 97 [114 P.2d 1]; and Comment, <em>The Hospital\u2019s Responsibility for its Medical Staff: Prospects for Corporate Negligence in California, supra </em>8 Pacific L.J. 141, 149.) In <em>Rice </em>v. <em>California Lutheran Hospital, supra, </em>27 Cal. 2d 296, the Supreme Court held a \u2018\u201c\u201chospital owes its patients the duty of protection, and must exercise such reasonable care toward a patient as his known condition may require.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 299; <em>Murillo </em>v. <em>Good Samaritan Hospital </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 50, 55 [160 Cal.Rptr. 33]; <em>Valentin </em>v. <em>La Societe Francaise </em>(1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 1, 6 [172 P.2d 359].) Moreover, the court held a hospital is \u201cunder a duty to observe and know the condition of a patient. Its business is caring for ill persons, and its conduct must be in accordance with that of a person of ordinary prudence under the circumstances, a vital part of those circumstances being the illness of the patient and incidents thereof.\u201d <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>California Lutheran Hospital, supra, </em>27 Cal.2d 296, 302; <em>Murillo </em>v. <em>Good Samaritan Hospital, supra, </em>99 Cal.App.3d 50, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>55.)  We can perceive of no reason why this established duty of! due care does not encompass the duty asserted by Elam; for, as a gener- , al principle, a hospital\u2019s failure to insure the competence of its medical staff through careful selection and review creates an unreasonable risk of harm to its patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Our conclusion accords with statutory authority recognizing hospital accountability for- the quality of medical care provided and the competency of its medical staff. Health and Safety Code section 1250, subdivisions (a), (b), (f) and (g)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> define hospital in pertinent part as \u201ca health facility having a duly constituted governing body with overall administrative and professional responsibility . . . . \u201d More specifically, section 32125 confers upon the board of directors of a public hospital the responsibility of its operation in accordance with \u201cthe best interests of the public health,\u201d including the power to \u201cmake and enforce all rules, regulations and by-laws necessary for the administration, government, protection and maintenance\u201d of the hospital, and to insure that minimum standards of operation required by statute are followed. Sections 32128<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and Business and Professions Code section 2282<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> set forth, at least by implication, the scope of public and private hospitals\u2019 duty of care. Regarding staff selection, although the medical staff is to be \u201cself-governing,\u201d a hospital must provide procedures for selection and reappointment of the medical staff in accordance with JCAH standards, implying investigation of competency for initial appointment and periodic review of competency before reappointment. The hospital\u2019s duty to guard against physicians\u2019 incompetency is further implied by requiring renewal of staff privileges at least every two years (implying a periodic competency review) and the periodic review of the medical records of hospital patients. Although these reviews are conducted by medical staff \u201cpeer\u201d committees, the governing body of the hospital is responsible for establishing the review procedures. Finally, section 32128 provides that the hospital rules shall include \u201c[s]uch limitations with respect to the practice of medicine and surgery in the hospital as the board of directors may find to be in the best interests of the public health and welfare . .. . \u201d (See Comment, <em>The Hospital\u2019s Responsibility for its Medical Staff: Prospects for Corporate Negligence in California, supra, </em>8 Pacific L.J. 141, 150-159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Sections 70701<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 70703<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of title 22, California Administrative Code, are even more explicit. Title 22, California Administrative Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>section 70701, subdivision (6) mandates the hospital governing body \u201c[r]equire that the medical staff establish controls that are designed to ensure the achievement and maintenance of high standards of professional ethical practices including provision that periodically all physicians may be required to demonstrate their ability to perform surgical and other procedures competently and to the satisfaction of an appropriate committee or committees of the staff.\u201d Moreover, title 22, California Administrative Code, section 70703, subdivision (a) requires each hospital to \u201chave an organized medical staff responsible to the governing body for the fitness, adequacy and quality of the medical care rendered to patients in the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWq\">Further, our conclusion is consonant with the public\u2019s perception of the modern hospital as a multifaceted, health-care facility responsible for the quality of medical care and treatment rendered. The community hospital has evolved into a corporate institution, assuming \u201cthe role of a comprehensive health center ultimately responsible for arranging and coordinating total health care.\u201d (Southwick, <em>The Hospital as an Institution\u2014Expanding Responsibilities Change Its Relationship with the Staff Physician </em>(1973) 9 Cal. Western L.Rev. 429.) The patient treated in such a facility receives care from a number of individuals of varying capacities and not merely treated by a physician acting in isolation. <em>(Ybarra </em>v. <em>Spangard </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 486, 491 [154 P.2d 687, 162 A.L.R. 1258].) The patient relies upon the effectiveness of this \u201chighly integrated system of activities .. <em>.(Id., </em>at p. 493; see Comment, <em>The Hospital\u2019s Responsibility for its Medical Staff: Prospects for Corporate Negligence in California, supra, </em>8 Pacific L.J. 141, 149-150.) Consequently, \u201c[t]he concept that a hospital does not undertake to treat patients, does not undertake to act through its doctors and nurses, but only procures them to act solely upon their own responsibility, no longer reflects the fact. The complex manner of operation of the modern-day medical institution clearly demonstrates that they furnish far more than mere facilities for treatment. They appoint physicians and surgeons to their medical staffs, as well as regularly employing on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>salary basis resident physicians and surgeons, nurses, administrative and manual workers and they charge patients for medical diagnosis, care, treatment and therapy, receiving payment for such services through privately financed medical insurance policies and government financed programs known as Medicare and Medicaid. Certainly, the person who avails himself of our modern \u2018hospital facilities\u2019 (frequently a medical teaching institution) expects that the hospital staff will do all it reasonably can to cure him and does not anticipate that its nurses, doctors and other employees Will be acting solely on their own responsibility.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Misericordia Community Hospital </em>(1981) 99 Wis.2d 708 [301 N.W.2d 156, 164]; see <em>Bing v. Thunig </em>(1957) 2 N.Y.2d 656, 666-667 [163 N.Y.S.2d 3, 143 N.E.2d 3, 8].)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Moreover, imposing the duty of care upon a hospital should have the \u201cprophylactic\u201d effect of supplying the hospital with a greater incentive to assure the competence of its medical staff and the quality of medical care rendered within its walls. Otherwise stated, \u201c[s]ince the corporate negligence theory focuses upon the hospital\u2019s own conduct in providing medical care, the spectre of liability based upon this theory should encourage the hospital to examine its conduct more carefully in order to prevent the occurrence of unreasonable harm to patients.\u201d (Comment, <em>The Hospital\u2019s Responsibility for its Medical Staff: Prospects for Corporate Negligence in California, supra, </em>8 Pacific L.J. 141, 149; but see, <em>Piercing The Doctrine of Corporate Hospital Liability, supra, </em>17 San Diego L.Rev. 383, 398-399; see generally, Southwick, <em>The Hospital as an Institution\u2014Expanding Responsibilities Change Its Relationship with the Staff Physician, supra, </em>9 Cal. Western L.Rev. 429, 466, regarding the mutual dependency of a hospital governing board and its medical staff.) Indeed, the hospital is in the best position to evaluate the competence of physicians it, in its discretion, allows to perform surgery and to practice within its premises, as it constitutes the only institutional \u201cvehicle available to coordinate the delivery of health care of reasonable quality to large numbers of people, especially in urban areas.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 466; see Vogel &amp; Delgado, <em>To Tell The Truth: Physicians\u2019 Duty To Disclose Medical Mistakes </em>(1980) 28 UCLA L.Rev. 52, 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Finally, our holding agrees with the decisions of courts in varying jurisdictions. It appears the proposition a hospital may be held liable to a patient under the doctrine of corporate negligence has its genesis in <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Charleston Community Memorial Hospital </em>(1965) 33 Ill.2d 326 [211 N.E.2d 253, 14 A.L.RJd 860], where the court found hospital negligence in failing to require consultation with or examination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>members of its medical staff and to review the treatment rendered plaintiff. From this beginning, the doctrine has been utilized and expanded by the courts of several jurisdictions to collectively impose upon a hospital a direct and independent responsibility to its patients of insuring the competency of its medical staff and the quality of medical care provided through the prudent selection, review and continuing evaluation of the physicians granted staff privileges.

Contrary to the assertions of amicus, the California Hospital Association, the articulated public policy considerations support the imposition of this general duty and outweigh the potential effect of corporate hospital liability upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>structure of medical malpractice insurance in California. Moreover, imposing hospital-corporate liability does not interfere with the Legislature\u2019s comprehensive efforts to ameliorate the integrity and quality of the health care system (see, e.g., Stats. 1975, 2d Ex. Sess., ch. 2, pp. 3978-4007), but rather supplements the efforts by encouraging hospitals to actively oversee the competence of their medical staff and the quality of the medical treatment rendered on their premises, while providing victims with an additional avenue for relief. Simply stated, the Legislature has not attempted to immunize the hospital from liability arising from its negligence. Instead, the underlying statutory intent of the cited legislative campaign is the protection and furtherance of the health care interest of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\n<em>The Trial Court Erred in Granting the Motion for Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The law governing summary judgment procedure pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c is firmly established. \u2018\u201cThe matter to be determined by the trial court in considering such a motion is whether the defendant (or the plaintiff) has presented any facts which give rise to a triable issue. The court may not pass upon the issue itself. Summary judgment is proper only if the affidavits in support of the moving party would be sufficient to sustain a judgment in his favor [fn. omitted] and his opponent does not by affidavit show such facts as may be deemed by the judge hearing the motion sufficient to present a triable issue. The aim of the procedure is to discover, through the media of affidavits, whether the parties possess evidence requiring the weighing procedures of a trial. In examining the sufficiency of affidavits filed in connection with the motion, the affidavits of the moving party are strictly construed and those of his opponent liberally construed, and doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion. Such summary procedure is drastic and should be used with caution so that it does not become a substitute for the open trial method of determining facts.\u2019\u201d <em>(Corwin </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 842, 851-852 [94 Cal.Rptr. 785, 484 P.2d 953], quoting <em>Stationers Corp. </em>v. <em>Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 412, 417 [42 Cal.Rptr. 449, 398 P.2d 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In light of our conclusion Hospital owes generally a duty to insure the competency of its medical staff and to evaluate the quality of medical treatment rendered on its premises, the filed papers pertaining to the motion for summary judgment are replete with triable issues of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>fact. For example, whether Hospital should have conducted an investigation through its peer review committee upon notice of the <em>Bailey </em>case? Whether the committee had conducted its periodic reviews of Schur in a nonnegligent manner? Assuming a review was made after notice of the <em>Bailey </em>case, was it performed in a nonnegligent manner? If it had been made in a careful and proper manner, would the committee have recommended revocation or suspension of Schur\u2019s staff privileges?</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\n<em>Disposition:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Staniforth, Acting P.
