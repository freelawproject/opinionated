J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_x\">Defendants were charged in two counts with (1) possession for sale and (2) transportation of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11359, 11360, subd. (a)). The superior court determined that evidence essential to support the magistrate\u2019s holding order was the product of an illegal search and seizure and granted defendants\u2019 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>to dismiss the information (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995). The People appeal. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1238, subd. (a)(8).) We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">At the time of the alleged offenses, Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Brand was on patrol alone in a squad car. At about 2 a.m. he observed a vehicle being driven erratically. A passenger in the vehicle was leaning out of a window shouting and waving what appeared to be a whiskey glass. Officer Brand attempted to stop the vehicle to investigate a possible violation of Vehicle Code section 23102, subdivision (a) (driving under the influence of an intoxicant). His first effort to detain the vehicle was frustrated when the driver, having pulled over and stopped on the officer\u2019s command, resumed travel as Brand was exiting his squad car. As Brand again stopped the vehicle, another officer arrived to provide assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">There were three men in the car. Defendant Faddler was the driver; defendants Raymond Williams and Rodney Harold Bals\u00f3n were passengers. Brand ordered the occupants out of the vehicle and directed them to the rear of their automobile in front of his patrol car. Williams was slow to comply and appeared to be under the influence of an intoxicant. Bals\u00f3n was boisterous and \u201cmouthy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Brand asked Faddler for his driver\u2019s license. He advised it was in the glove compartment and started to move toward his car to retrieve the license. Brand ordered him to stay where he was and proceeded to the defendants\u2019 vehicle himself to obtain the driver\u2019s license from the glove compartment. Upon opening the front passenger door, Brand observed in plain view on the floorboard a baggie containing marijuana. Defendants were then arrested and placed in custody in the patrol vehicle. Following the arrests a search of defendants\u2019 car produced more marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">It cannot be seriously disputed that Officer Brand\u2019s articulated suspicions reasonably warranted the detention of the defendants. <em>(In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 894 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957].) Furthermore, the search of the passenger compartment of defendants\u2019 car following their arrest was clearly authorized if Officer Brand\u2019s initial observation of marijuana when he opened their car door as a first step to obtaining Faddler\u2019s license from the glove compartment was lawful. <em>(Wimberly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 557, 562-566 [128 Cal.Rptr. 641, 547 P.2d 417].) Our analysis therefore will focus on Officer Brand\u2019s initial entry into defendants\u2019 car to secure the driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>At the preliminary hearing the magistrate denied defendants\u2019 motion to suppress, commenting that \u201copening the door [to defendants\u2019 car] . .. clearly was a search.\u201d However, the magistrate believed the intrusion was justified under all the circumstances. The superior court took a somewhat different approach, holding consent to enter the glove compartment absolutely essential to a lawful search; finding no consent, the trial court dismissed the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">For present purposes, we assume the correctness of the trial court\u2019s finding of a lack of consent. A converse finding of course would have validated Officer Brand\u2019s initial entry into defendants\u2019 vehicle. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 252, 256 [26 Cal.Rptr. 620].) We think, however, the trial court erred in rejecting the theory advanced by the People and accepted by the magistrate: that exigent circumstances justified the officer\u2019s entry of defendants\u2019 vehicle to retrieve the driver\u2019s license from the glove compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Officer Brand had made a lawful stop of defendants\u2019 vehicle to investigate whether the driver was under the influence of an intoxicant. As the driver, defendant Faddler was required to have a valid driver\u2019s license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 12500, subd. (a)), to have that license in his immediate possession when driving and to present that license upon demand of a peace officer enforcing the traffic laws (Veh. Code, \u00a7 12951). As a peace officer engaged in a lawful detention investigating violation of the traffic laws, Officer Brand had a right to examine Faddler\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In the ordinary situation where the safety of the officer or the public is not endangered thereby, a driver may himself retrieve and present his license for examination by an investigating police officer. That was not the situation here. The lateness of the hour, the presence of three men in the vehicle, the nature of the suspected violation and the conduct of the defendants together justified Officer Brand for his own safety ordering the occupants out of the vehicle and strictly controlling their movements during the remainder of the detention <em>(People </em>v. <em>Remiro </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 809, 829 [153 Cal.Rptr. 809, 2 A.L.R.3d 1135]). The identical considerations amply justified Officer Brand\u2019s decision to secure defendant Faddler\u2019s, license himself rather than to permit him to separate from his companions and rummage about in his automobile, thereby diminishing the officer\u2019s control over a potentially dangerous situation and creating a potential threat to his safety and that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>public. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 720, 724 [78 Cal.Rptr. 439]; see <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 361, 368-369 [142 Cal.Rptr. 299].)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The trial court acknowledged the defendant Faddler\u2019s legal obligation to display his driver\u2019s license and the officer\u2019s right to examine it. In the face of Faddler\u2019s refusal to consent to the retrieval of his license by the officer, the trial court suggested as a solution to the perceived impasse that the officer should have arrested Faddler for failure to have a valid driver\u2019s license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 12500), \u201ctaken him down and booked him . .. under 12500, and he could have proved he had a driver\u2019s license later on.\u201d We are constrained to observe that the suggested \u201csolution\u201d involves a needlessly cumbersome procedure wasteful of time and resources merely to verify what defendant Faddler at all times asserted and the officer had no cause to disbelieve: that Faddler had a valid driver\u2019s license located in the glove compartment. Moreover a license in the glove compartment is in the \u201cimmediate possession\u201d of the driver within the meaning of Vehicle Code section 12951, thus giving no cause for arrest or citation under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The constitutional provisions securing the right of privacy protect against unreasonable official conduct. We are satisfied that no constitutional rights are implicated by the type of minimal intrusion which occurred here, given its limited objective, legitimate purpose, and the exigent circumstances which practically prohibited the accomplishment of that purpose in any other way than was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Evans, J., and Blease, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 11, 1982. Reynoso, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
