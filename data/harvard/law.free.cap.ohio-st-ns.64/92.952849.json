A. MacGahan, against Samuel A. Ford and others, to recover the amount of assessments levied on'their lands for the construction of a main seAver in sewer district No. 26 in the city of Toledo. The averments of the petition showed that, the proceeding\u2019s for the establishment of the district, the location and construction of the sewer, and levying the assessments, were regular and in conformity with the statute. The mode adopted for making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>assessment was according to benefits to the property in the district, and the amount levied on the property of the defendants was apportioned by the committee on that basis. The defendants admitted by answer the regularity of the proceedings, but contested the plaintiff\u2019s ciaim on the ground that their lands were already provided with sufficient local drainage, and needed none that would be supplied by the sewer; and that their lands were not in anyway benefited by the construction of the sewer. The common pleas court found for the defendants, and the cause was appealed from its judgment to the circuit court, which, upon final hearing, made a finding of facts as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">\u2019 \u201c1. That the city of Toledo is a municipal corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Ohio as a city of the first class, third grade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">2. That the common council of the city of Toledo passed the necessary legislation providing for the construction of a main sewer in sewer district number twenty-six of the city of Toledo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">3. That said legislation so passed provided that the cost and expense of said main sewer, except that part in the street and alley intersections, should be levied and assessed upon the lots and lands bounding, fronting or abutting thereon, or benefited thereby in proportion to benefits the same might receive for local drainage, and the remainder of the cost and expense of constructing said sewer should be levied upon all the real property in main sewer district number twenty-six according to benefits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-8\">4.

That the river bottom is traversed by Ottawa river and said lowland is thirty feet below the highland.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">6.

That said real estate derived no benefit by reason of the construction of said sewer other than that resulting to property generally in said sewer district, from having the sewerage carried away to said river outlet, and the special local benefit that will result thereto whenever said lots or lands shall be built upon. Surface water from said lowlands can not be drained into said sewer as now situated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-10\">11.

That the section referred to is applicable to main sewers, is apparent from the context. The preceding section, (2379) re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>quires that, \u201cthe council shall provide for assessing the costs and expenses of constructing main sewers, upon the lots and lands bounding or abutting upon the streets, lands, alleys, highways, market spaces, public landings, and commons, in or along which the same shall pass, by the feet front, or according to the valuation of the same on the tax list, or according to benefits, as it shall determine.\u201d The limitations' on the assessments authorized by that section, are prescribed in section 2380. Provision is then made for assessments for local sewerage by section 2381.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Nor do any of the subsequent provisions of section 2380 remove, or affect, the exemptions authorized by that section, nor prescribe any different rule, or mode, or power of assessment for a main sewer in cities of the third grade of the first class, except in regard to the <em>excess </em>over the assessment authorized by the preceding clause of the section. In such cities, the council is authorized to levy such <em>excess </em>on all the real property of the sewer district according to benefits; but that is the extent to which power is given such city different from that which governs other municipalities in levying assessments for main sewers; We do not concur in that part of the opinion of the circuit court which seems to hold differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Only those lots and lands, however, embraced within the bounds which may be assessed for a main sewer, are exempt from such assessment under section 2380, that, in the language of the section, \u201cdo not need local drainage, or which are then provided therewith.\u201d When it is determined what constitutes local drainage, within the meaning of the statute, it becomes, in each case, a qxiestion of fact whether the lots or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>lands involved need, or are provided with, drainage of that kind. It was held in <em>Wewell </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>45 Ohio St., 407, that, in order to give application to the exemption of the statute, it was not necessary the local drainage should be provided by municipal authority. If for any reason it exists, and is adequate, the statute applies. In that case a large sewer emptying into the river, ample for all local sewage of lands entitled to connect with it, had been constructed without municipal action, and that whs held sufficient to exempt the lands so entitled to connect, from assessments for another sewer constructed by the city. The question here, however, is somewhat different. It is whether present sufficient surface drainage constitutes local drainage within the purview of the statute; or must it be such as provides the land with adequate drainage for the necessary and usual purposes of sewerage? We think it must be of the latter character to work an exemption of the land from assessment. There is no direct finding that the lands of the plaintiffs in error were provided with drainage of that kind, nor that they did not need such drainage. Certain probative facts are found which tend to establish the ultimate fact, but in our opinion they fall short of that result. As we interpret them they show that the lands were supplied with sufficient natural or surface drainage and did not need <em>immediate </em>house or local drainage to dispose of sewage originating on the lands, but that they would be benefited as other lands in the sewer district by having the sewage carried away, in addition to the local benefit when the lands are built upon. To authorize an assessment for sewer purposes, it is not necessary that the property should have immediate need for the use of the sewer. If so, vacant lots on im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>proved streets, adjacent to buildings would be exempt. And, the length of time the ground may probably remain vacant, only goes to the urgency of the need and the measure of the benefit. But, that vacant ground may and generally does receive a present special appreciable benefit from the construction of a sewer, on account of its proximity and accessibility cor all sewerage purposes, is known to everyone conversant with the subject. The drainage of sewage into an open ravine in a city would be inimical to the public health, and can hardly be considered such local drainage as the statute contemplates. On account of the situation and condition of the lands of the plaintiffs in error this seems like an extreme case for assessment; but it purports to have been levied according to local and special benefits, and the presumption is that the committee acted upon sufficient information, and according to law. The burden is upon the plaintiffs in error to show that their lands did not need local drainage, or were provided therewith, to entitle them to claim exemption from the assessment. The findings of the circuit court do not so show, in our opinion. The judgment of a lower court should not be reversed, unless the error is manifest, and it is entitled to that construction of its record which is most favorable to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b119-7\">Shauck, C.
