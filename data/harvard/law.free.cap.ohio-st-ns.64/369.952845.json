After adjudging that the parties be divorced and that the custody of their child, Edith B.

Law shall, of the insurance that he now holds upon his life, or which he may hereafter procure, and which he agrees to do, set apart the sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) for the benefit of said plaintiff, Carrie B. Law, which policies of insurance, in the event of the death of the said George W. Law, shall be payable to and paid to said Carrie B. LaAv, and in case of the death of the said Carrie B.

Law as to alimony, shall be in lieu of, and in full satisfaction of all claims, rights, interests or demands that said plaintiff has or may have acquired in the property and estate of the said defendant by reason of her marriage to him, and the said plaintiff shall relinquish any and all such interests by instrument in writing duly executed upon the demand of said defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">On the day preceding the entry of this decree George W. Law, with surety, gave bond to Mrs. Law for the payment of alimony according to the terms which were carried into the decree. On the 11th day of April, 1894, George W. Law filed his petition in the court of common pleas seeking a reduction of the alimony to fifteen hundred dollars a year, and of said insurance to seventy-five hundred dollars on account of reasons occurring after the entry of the decree of August, 1889. Mrs. Law answered denying that any change had occurred to justify a reduction of said amounts, and she alleged in her answer that in so far as the decree of 1889 related to the subject of alimony and insurance they were entered by agreement of the parties. These allegations of the answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>were denied in the reply. On a hearing the court of common pleas entered a judgment reducing the alimony from three thousand dollars per annum to eighteen hundred dollars per annum. Mrs. Law took an appeal to the circuit court where, upon a hearing, the alimony was fixed at twenty-two hundred dollars per annum in lieu of the three thousand dollars per annum awarded by the original decree. Afterward she received and accepted the amount adjudged to her by the circuit court. She now seeks a reversal of the judgment by which the amount awarded to her by the terms of the original decree was reduced.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-5\"><em>Thomas McDougal; Alfred G.

The view presented by counsel for the plaintiff in error is that the terms of the original decree, not being affected by fraud or mistake, were conclusive upon the subject of alimony and not subject to modification for any reason. Since no question was reserved by the decree for future consideration, that view receives strong support from <em>Petersine </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>28 Ohio St., 596, and from the general course of decisions upon the subject. Authority* for the subsequent modification of the decree is, however, said to be found in the later case of <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>43 Ohio St., 499. In that case there had been a divorce because of the wife\u2019s aggression, and the holding was that the decree as to alimony, so-called, might be modified upon the petition subsequently filed by the husband for that purpose. If it be assumed that the case was correctly decided, it affords no warrant for the present judgment, for it concedes that where the terms of a decree as to alimony are fixed by the court pursuant to an agreement of the parties they are not subject to modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">That the terms of the decree of August, 1889, as to alimony, were fixed by agreement of the parties is the proper inference from the testimony of counsel who were concerned in the case. It is rendered certain by the bond executed prior to the decree, whereby the husband bound himself to pay alimony according to the terms of the decree subsequently en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>tered. It is made conclusive by the terms of the decree. The divorce in the present case was on account of the aggression of the husband, and it was therefore a case for alimony properly so called. The wife had not forfeited any of the rights which marri\u00e1ge gave her in the property of her husband. The concluding terms of the decree against the wife, assented to by her, and precluding the further assertion by her of any interest in the husband\u2019s estate are in law, as they purport to be, in consideration of the antecedent provision as to alimony. The provisions in her favor, being consideration for those which were adverse to her, must be final according to their terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">2. There is no merit in the contention that Mrs. Law\u2019s acceptance of the amount awarded to her by the circuit court in lieu of the amount fixed by the decree of 1889, estops her from prosecuting this proceeding in error. She has taken nothing by the judgment of the circuit court. \u2022 By the terms of the decree of 1889 she became conclusively entitled to all she has received, and more. It can not be said that by accepting a portion of the sum due her by the terms of the original decree she has waived her right to insist upon, payment of the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and original petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b396-7\">Minshall, C.
