Where a corporation commences an action, it need not aver in its petition that it is a corporation; and if such averment is made, it will be held to be immaterial and mere surplusage, and a general denial to a petition containing such averment will not impose upon the plaintiff the burden of proving on the trial that it is such corporation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b287-10\">2. To raise the issue of <em>nul tiel corporation, </em>the defendant must Specially plead in his answer that the plaintiff is not a corporation. Smith v.

In the National Supply Company case, the petition avers that the company is a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of the state of West Virginia, that it is doing business in the state of Ohio, and that it has complied with the laws of this state relating to foreign corporations doing business in Ohio, and then proceeds to state its cause of action arising on a judgment recovered by it against said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Frank E. Brady in the state of Indiana. The answer is a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">In the Union Supply and Hardware Company case, the petition avers that it is a corporation duly organized and incorporated under the laws of the state of Ohio, and is doing business in this state, and then declares upon a judgment recovered by it against said Frank E. Brady in the state of Indiana. The answer is a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">No proof of the incorporation of either company was introduced upon the trial in the court of common pleas, other than the transcripts of the judgments so recovered in the state of Indiana. Plaintiff in error claims that in the absence of such proof the judgment should have been in his favor. The court of common pleas regarded such proof unnecessary and rendered judgment against him in both cases. The circuit court affirmed the judgments, and thereupon Mr. Brady filed his petition in error in this court, seeking to reverse the judgments of the courts below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-7\"><em>G.

If the defendant desires to raise the issue as to whether the plaintiff is a corporation, he must specially plead and aver in his answer that the plaintiff is not a corporation, and has no right to contract or sue as such, as the case may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The same rule applies when a -corporation comes in by way of cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>If, hoAvever, a corporation is made a defendant in an action, and its charter, powers or franchises become the foundation of such action, the same must be specifically pleaded in the petition; and if the corporation be a foreign one, the name of the state by which, and the substantial terms in which, the charter, powers and franchises Avere granted, should appear in the petition. <em>Devoss </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>22 Ohio St., 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>Judgements affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b290-6\">Min shall, C.
