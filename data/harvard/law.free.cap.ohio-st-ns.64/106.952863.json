He alleged that he was the owner of a farm through which passes a public highway along which he had shade trees of much beauty. The company had wires along said highway and poles for their support; that in the growth of the trees their branches had reached the wires and interfered with their operation. Whereupon he authorized the company to trim the small branches of said trees each year, but only to such extent as might be necessary to prevent such interference. That in disregard of his rights and of the restriction placed by him upon said permission the company wrongfully and unnecessarily severed the tops of some of said trees and large limbs from others, thus destroying their beauty and usefulness as shade trees and unfavorably affecting their vitality. The material portion of the answer is a denial that the servants of the company liad trimmed the trees unnecessarily or in excess of the permission given. On the trial the plaintiff offered evidence tending to establish the allegations of his petition. The company offered evidence to show not only that the injury was much less than that which the plaintiff claimed and less than the testimony of some of his witnesses tended to establish, but also that a tenant in charge of the farm had given the company\u2019s servants oral permission to trim the trees precisely as they were trimmed on this occasion. This evidence was admitted but the court instructed the jury: \u201cIf you find that the defendant\u2019s servants did not do more to said trees than the petitioner says he had permitted it to do from, time to time, the plaintiff cannot recover even nominal damages from the defendant. But I charge you that any cutting of said trees beyond the extent of what he had so permitted, if you so find from the evidence, without the consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>of the plaintiff, would have been wrongful and would entitle hint to recover at least nominal damages. And, the interest of said plaintiff in said trees being a property inhering in the land itself, such consent to cut and sever from said trees, limbs and branches in excess of that which he says he had given permission to do, would have to be in writing. No mere verbal permission to do such alleged excessive cutting would protect the defendant from liability for damages for such excessive cutting. * * * If you should find upon the said issues under the charge of the court and the evidence in favor of the plaintiff, he would be entitled to recover of the defendant actual or compensatory damages, the measure of which in a case where the trees injured, if you so- find, have no substantial value as timber severed from the realty, is the difference between the value of the land before and after the injury consequent upon such injury. * * * I charge you further that if you find from the evidence and the charge of the court that the plaintiff is entitled to compensatory damages, you are at liberty to go further and find what the law denominates punitive damages under the following circumstances: If you find from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s agents in such cutting of said trees acted wantonly and recklessly:and without regard to the rights of the plaintiff then you may add such punitive damages as you may deem proper not beyond the amount in all of $5,000.00 (the amount sued for), and in such case you may take into consideration and allow as a part of compensatory damages, reasonable fees of counsel.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-6\">Evidence to shoAv that the trees were trimmed on this occasion in the usual manner and only to the usual extent, and that the company\u2019s instructions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>its servants Avere to trim the trees so as to keep the Avire clear for a year was offered by the defendant and rejected by the court.

Fearons, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-7\">The principle of exemplary damages or punishment in civil cases was for many years the subject of much discussion among the text Avriters. Many opposed it as a violation of constitutional right and conceded that it was dangerous and liable to abuse, but finally it has become the rule in most of the states. 1 Sutherland, on Damages, page 722.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-8\">The first and most glaring error to be discussed is that instruction of the court which solemnly declared the law of the land to be, that a party by his agent could grant a verbal permit to the agent of another party to do a certain act, and when action is brought for the consequences of such act and exemplary damages claimed, the fact that such verbal permission was granted would be no protection to the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-9\">It is unquestionably true that plaintiff\u2019s interest in his trees was an interest in real estate. It is also true that a. grant of an interest in real estate to be valid must be in writing. But the error consists in treating the permission to cut the trees as a grant, when it was in fact only a license. The defendant does not claim to have acquired of the plaintiff any property right in his trees, but only to have obtained a license to cut away limbs and branches. <em>Cook </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Stearns, 11 Mass., 533; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Sorrell, </em>Vaughn, 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-4\">A license may be oral and is revocable at the pleasure of the licensor, but revocation cannot affect the validity of the acts already done under the license. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>West, </em>71 Cal., 126; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>211 Ill.

Parol license to build a railway across one\u2019s land where money was expended in reliance therein was held irrevocable in <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>110 Ind., 490; <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>Canal Co., 2 </em>Disn., 100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-9\">A license to enter upon the land of another and do a particular act or a series of acts, may be valid though not granted by deed or in writing. Such a license does not transfer any interest in land, although when granted for a valuable consideration and acted upon, it cannot be countermanded. <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Carpenter, 4 </em>Met., 580; Chitty on Contracts, 300-2; Greenleaf on Evidence, 271.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>In an action for trespass for cutting and removing timber, tbe defendant assumed that he had a license to do the acts complained of by virtue of a verbal contract for the sale of the trees cut and removed and that the contract had been executed. This was properly held to be a good plea in bar to the action. <em>Seleh </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>28 Ind., 255.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-6\">But assuming that there must be consent in writing and that it was a statutory right, it was for the benefit of the owner of the land. It could therefore be waived by him, and if the issue is made upon such waiver or verbal permission, then it would be competent for defendant to show that such verbal permission had been granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">Section 6871 make it a statutory duty for a miner to do certain specific things, supply timber for props, etc., in his mine, yet the Supreme Court has held that the contributory negligence of an employe, who was injured by the failure of the mine owner to supply the necessary timber for props, etc., and the contributory negligence of the miner would defeat a recovery. <em>Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Estievenard, </em>53 Ohio St., 43; 28 Am. &amp; Eng.

Proof was offered tending to show it. The facts stated were attempted to be controverted, and the issue of fact was directly made between the witness Forgy, that the trees had a tendency to injure the roadway, and the witness Hill, who, in rebuttal, attempted to controvert the statement. The defendant, therefore, was entitled to an application of the law to that state of facts. <em>Embler </em>v. Walker, 51 Hun., 384; Gen.

Stat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-6\">As to exemplary damage the charge of the court is fully supported by <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>10 Ohio St., 277; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Slusser, </em>19 Ohio St., 157; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>19 Ohio St., 162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-7\">The measure of damages on account of injury to or destruction of trees depends upon their character and purpose. Thus where they have an intrinsic value separate from and not dependent upon the soil, the measure may be their value severed from the land. It is otherwise where their utility wholly or partly depends upon their attachment to and growth in the soil. Such are fruit, ornamental and shade trees. The measure of damages with respect to these, under the authorities, is that given by the court in its charge. Counsel seem to object to it as erroneous. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Keystate Gas Co., </em>148 N. Y., 112.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-8\">The court follows its former holding in <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>132 N. Y., 199, where the whole subject is elaborately discussed in the light of the authorities, and identically the same rule announced. It is recognized in the following cases and seems to be the settled law: <em>Carner </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>43 Minn., 375; <em>Hoye </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>46 Minn., 269; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>35 Fed., 484; <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Stillwell, </em>52 Hun., 353; <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>72 Cal., 75; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Billingsley, </em>17 Ala., 391; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Goodall, </em>18 N.

It was the <em>difference </em>in values before and after the injuries. If a distinction exists between the \u201cvalue\u201d of land and its \u201cmarket value,\u201d it is hardly conceivable that the difference between the <em>values </em>before and after the injury would vary from the difference between the <em>market values </em>before and after such injury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b135-7\">Shauck, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">The trial of the case was unnecessarily prolonged and the record expanded by introducing the opinions of witnesses whose information did not exceed that of the jury. In other respects there appears to have intervened no error which substantially affected the recovery of compensatory damages, unless they exceeded the amount shown by the evidence. The instruction that oral permission beyond that given by the plaintiff in person, and admitted in his petition, would not avail the defendant, though indicating an incorrect view of the law, did not operate prejudicially in so far as a recovery of actual damages was had. The undisputed evidence shows that the tenant from whom such further permission was said to have been received was without authority to give it. A license, whether written or oral, if given by an unauthorized person, would not defeat a recovery by the owner of damages actually sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>But the instructions given permitted the jury to award exemplary damages and the amount recovered suggests that damages of that character entered into the verdict. A consideration of the rules with respect to such damages is required by the fact that the instructions permitted their recovery, the record not showing affirmatively that they were not included in the verdict. Such damages being puhitive in their nature are an exception to the general rules that in private actions the injured party is to be made whole, and that acts deemed worthy of punishment are prosecuted by the state. With respect to the recovery oi damages of that character in private actions the different states have not adopted a uniform rule. The requisites to their recovery in this state were described in <em>Simpson </em>v. McCaffrey, 13 Ohio, 522: \u201cThe principle of permitting damages in certain cases, to go beyond naked compensation, is for example, and the punishment of the guilty party for the wicked, corrupt and malignant motive and design, which prompted him to the wrongful act. A trespass may be committed from a mistaken notion of power, and from an honest motive to accomplish some good end. But the layr tolerates no such abuse of power, nor excuses such act; yet, in morals, and the eye of the law, there is a vast difference between the criminality of a person acting mistakenly from a worthy motive, and one committing the same act from a wanton and malignant spirit, and with a corrupt and wicked design. Hence where a jury are called upon to give smart money, or damages beyond compensation, to punish the party guilty of the wrongful act, any evidence which would show this difference, or rather all the facts and circumstances which tend to explain or disclose the motives and design of th\u00e9 party committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the wrongful act, are evidence which should go to the jury for their due consideration.\u201d/^That \u201ca corporation may be subjected to exemplary or punitive damages for tortious acts of its agents or servants done within the scope of their employment, in all cases where natural persons, acting for themselves, if guilty of like tortious acts, would be liable for such damages,\u201d was held in the <em>Atlantic and Great Western Railway Company </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>19 Ohio St., 162. Although the case was decided by a divided court, it es: tablished the law upon the subject for this state. But since in cases of this character the punishment may not fall upon the actual wrongdoer, they present reasons why great care should be taken that such damages are not imposed unless all the conditions for their recovery are present. To show that they were not present in this case an oral license from an unauthorized tenant in charge of the farm, if acted upon in good faith, as well as the instructions of the company to its servants, if given in good faith, were available. While the evidence offered by the plaintiff below tended to establish all that is necessary to a recovery of full compensation, there is little evidence of such motive as would justify a recovery of punitive damages. The court should have admitted all the evidence offered to show the absence of such motive, or it should have instructed the jury that only compensation should be awarded. j;</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-7\">Minshall, Williams, Burket, Spear and Davis, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
