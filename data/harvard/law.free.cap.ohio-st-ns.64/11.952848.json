But the Ginsburgs are not helped by this. The company had acquired title and consequently the lien of the mortgage had attached long before the Ginsburgs appeared on the scene.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-9\">The exact proposition they must maintain is that, no matter what the terms or conditions of a mortgage may be, a subsequent statute giving certain liens priority to the mortgage operates to displace such mortgage on property to which it has attached, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>when such property was acquired after the passage of the, law, in favor of liens the right to which arose and was perfected after the mortgage had so attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">We submit that there is neither reason nor authority in favor of this proposition, and that its application would, moreover, in this case, cause the law in question to contravene section 10, article 1 of the federal constitution, which prohibits the states from passing any \u201claw impairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">The act of 1883, giving a lien to certain persons for work and material on railroads cannot have a retroactive effect so as to displace liens already created and recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-8\"><em>Feike </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>12 C.

At the time the Ohio Southern Railway Company executed its mortgage, 1881, it had no authority to mortgage or acquire any property in Clinton or Greene counties, Ohio, and the finding of said mortgage in said counties would not thereby make the same a lien on said extension, by virtue of, the after-acquired property clause therein contained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-10\">2. Should we be in. error as to the above proposition, and said mortgage became a lien on said Jeffersonville extension by reason of its provisions and the recording thereof as above stated, still we maintain the lien of said mortgage is subordinate to the said lien of defendants in error, and this is true notwithstanding the mortgage may have been filed fojr record at a date prior to. the delivery of the rails by defendants in error.

They overlook the fundamental principle of the law that no man or corporation can give a mortgage upon property not by them owned; and that when a mortgage so given does eventually become effective and attach to something, it is subject to and restricted by the laws' in force at the then time and not some fifteen years prior when the mortgage had no force or effect upon the property thereafter sought to be held under it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-6\">The provision contained in the mortgage that it is to include property to be thereafter acquired by the mortgagor, does not create a lien upon such property at othe time of the execution of the mortgage, because neither a person or corporation can mortgage property which is not then in existence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Hence section 10, article 1 of the federal constitution has no application to this case. <em>Rousculp </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>10 C.

Sections 3289, 4133, Bev. Stat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-9\"><em>b. </em>The date of execution of a mortgage is an immaterial matter, in a contention of priority between it and another lien. \u201cAs to third persons, mortgages have no effect either at law or in equity until delivered to the recorder of the proper county for record.\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Noggle, </em>4 Ohio St., 45; <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>3 0 Ohio St., 390; <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Stimmel, </em>40 Ohio St., 298.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-10\">It follows, therefore, that until the mortgage was recorded, it was not a lien as against third parties, and as it did not take effect until after the passage of the act of April 6, 1883, it became a lien (if at all) subject to the provisions of that act, and as the liens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>under that act are prior to any lien \u201ctaken or to be taken,\u201d they are superior to that of said mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-5\">The trust company, as to this Jeffersonville branch, stands in no different or better position from what it would occupy if its mortgage had been executed in the spring of 1894.

If the property is already subject to mortgages or other liens, the general mortgage does not displace them, although they may be junior to it in point of time. It only attaches to such interest as the mortgagor acquires; and if he purchase property, and give a mortgage for the purchase money, the deed which he receives and the mortgage which he gives are regarded as one transaction, and no general lien impending over him, whether in the shape of a general mortgage or judgment or recognizance, can displace such mortgage for purchase money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>79 U.

The plaintiffs in error are the purchasers of the railroad on behalf of the holders of the first mortgage bonds and the Central Trust Company of New York. The fund is insufficient to pay the amount of the outstanding first mortgage bonds, with the interest, and the defendants in error insist that mechanics\u2019 liens for materials and labor furnished by them respectively, in the construction of the Jeffersonville branch of the Ohio Southern Railroad are prior to the lien of the holders of the first mortgage bonds. The circuit court so held. 19 C. C., 436.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">On May 23, 1881, the Ohio Southern Railroad Company made a mortgage or trust deed to the Central Trust Company to secure four million dollars of bonds. It was provided that 1920 bonds of $1,000 each should be issued immediately, and the remainder at the rate of $15,000 a mile for each and every mile of completed railroad, branch, extension or addition in excess of one hundred and twenty-nine miles, or when the purchase money of said bonds should be deposited in a suitable depositary, to be used only for the purpose of constructing, etc., said line, or any <em>\"branch </em>or extension thereof. The property mortgaged was described as \u201call and singular the line of railroad of the party of the first part, extending from the city of Springfield in the county of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Clark, in the state of Ohio, through the counties of Clark, Madison, Fayette, Highland, Pike, Ross, Jackson, Gallia and Lawrence, in said state, to the village of Rockwood in said county of Lawrence, and to all <em>branches, </em>additions and extensions <em>pertaining thereto </em>* \" * all materials and other supplies for the constructing, operating, maintaining, repairing or replacing, or for the operating, or improvement of the said railroad or any part thereof, or any part of its equipments or appurtenances. Also all rights, powers, privileges and franchises connected with or relating to the said line of road or the construction and maintenance, operation or improvement thereof, and all other property of every kind or nature pertaining to the said line of railroad whether now held and owned by the said party of the first part or hereafter to be acquired.\u201d It was provided that the liens of the bondholders as between themselves should be equal in priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In article 8 of said trust deed it was provided that the party of the first part \u201ccovenants and agrees that the entire- proceeds of the sale of bonds secured hereby shall and will be faithfully and exclusively applied to the redemption of the one million dollars of bonds lately issued by the Springfield Southern Railroad Company, to the building, constructing, completing, equipping, extending, renewing, and replacing of the said railroad <em>and branches. * </em>* * <em>And that the said money shall not be appropriated to or used for any other purpose or purposes whatsoever.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">This mortgage was filed for record in Fayette county on the 26th of May, 1881, and it was filed for record in Greene county, June 22, 1894, and in Clinton and Warren counties somewhat earlier, these with Fayette county being the counties in which what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>was known as the Jeffersonville branch was located. It appears from the record that the railroad company acquired the right of way to the Jeffersonville branch by contract in 1883, and received deeds therefor during the year 1894. The defendants in error furnished materials and did work for the construction of the Jeffersonville branch from March, 1895, to May, 1895, and perfected mechanics\u2019 liens on the Ohio Southern railroad in May, 1895.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">It does not appear in the record that any of the money paid for these bonds was actually applied to the construction of th\u00e9 Jeffersonville branch, nor does it definitely appear that it was not. But although the trustee, The Central Trust Company of New York, and the railroad company may not have applied the money strictly as provided in the trust, yet the holders of bonds purchased in the open market cannot be made to suffer for their delinquency. They should, at least, stand with equal favor before the court along with material men and laborers, so that the money furnished under this mortgage creates as strong an equity, appealing as forcibly to the conscience of the court, as that created by the furnishing of labor and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The question made in this case is whether the mechanics\u2019 liens of the defendants in error are prior to the lien of the mortgage aforesaid upon the after-acquired property of the Ohio Southern Railroad, namely, the Jeffersonville branch. The circuit court seems to have based its conclusion upon a proposition of law stated by Taft, J., in the case of <em>Harris </em>v. <em>The Youngstown Bridge Co., </em>90 Fed. Rep., 322, to the effect that a mortgage covering after-acquired property attaches only to such interests as the mortgagor has at the time the mortgagor acquires the title thereto. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>This had been decided in many cases before the one mentioned, and the proposition is not controverted in this case by anyone. It is even conceded that if the defendants in error had, when the company obtained th\u00e9 title to the Jeffersonville branch, already commenced the performance of a contract on the completion of which he would be entiled to a lien, such lien when duly taken would reach back and prevail over the mortgage. But just here the point of contention arises. When <em>did </em>the railroad company <em>acquire title </em>to the Jeffersonville branch? The circuit court seems to have assumed that the title was not acquired until the construction of the branch was completed, and that the lien of the. defendants in error accrued in the acquisition of the property. If the circuit court had taken the trouble to read carefully the opinion of Taft, J., in the case cited, it probably would not have relied upon that case as authority for the judgment which it rendered. For example this: \u201cIt follows that <em>the lien </em>given by the after-acquired property clause of the first mortgage <em>attached </em>to the rights of way in the streets <em>immediately upon the passage of the ordinances, </em>and that <em>improvements upon the rights of way only increased the security </em>by becoming a part of the realty. The lien asserted by Harris, trustee, on this part of the terminals, <em>did not arise in the act of acquisition, </em>but only in the improvement <em>after acquisition. * </em>* * <em>It was the ordinance which passed the title, and not the laying of the tracks by its authority.\u201d Harris </em>v. <em>The Youngstown Bridge Company, </em>90 Fed. Rep. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">We take this to be the law, and applying that principle to the present case, the Ohio Southern Railroad Company acquired the title to the Jeffersonville branch when it acquired its right of way in 1893 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>1894. The claims of the defendants in error arose, not in the act of acquisition, but in making the improvements on the property <em>after </em>the acquisition, in the year 1895. If the case stood thus, there could be little doubt that the lien of the first mortgage was prior to the mechanics\u2019 liens. But what effect has the intervention of the statute of 1883, being now section 3208 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio? If the statute be prospectively construed, that is to say, if we construe it as though it should read \u201cshall have precedence over any lien taken or to be taken <em>after ihe passage of this act,\u201d </em>then it is contended that the mechanics\u2019 liens are still prior to the liens under the mortgage, because the right to a mortgage lien on the Jeffersonville branch was not acquired until the title in the Jeffersonville branch was acquired and the mortgage was recorded in the counties through which it runs, that is, in 1894, so that the statute would give priority to those mechanics\u2019 liens over a mortgage thus \u201ctaken\u201d after the passage of the act. But the answer to this is that the contractual right of the plaintiffs in error to have a lien under the mortgage, was acquired at, and dated from, the time of its execution in 1881, and simply attached to and became operative upon, the after-acquired property, on the acquisition of the property in 1894. The argument that the mortgage on after-acquired property is operative only as a contract to mortgage and that a new mortgage must be executed in order to acquire a lien in behalf of the bondholders on that property, is untenable and hardly calls for analysis. But whether the instrument of 1881 be a mortgage or a contract for a mortgage, it must be conceded that it conferred a contractual right upon the bondholders to have the first lien on the after-acquired property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and hence, if the statute of 1883 be construed so as to defeat that right, then the statute is retroactive, and impairs the obligation of the contract, and it is so far unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">We therefore conclude that the court of common pleas and the circuit court were in error in deciding that section 3208 does not violate any contract obligation held under and by virtue of this mortgage; and, in holding that it is not retroactive as to the mortgage of 1881, if it be held that, by force of the statute, the mechanics\u2019 liens of the defendants in error have priority thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The judgment of the court of common pleas and that of the circuit court are reversed and judgment is rendered for the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b45-9\">Shauck, O.
