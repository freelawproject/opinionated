The plaintiff responded to this by filing the petition in this case in the superior court, and obtained thereby a temporary injunction against the prosecution of the- ease before the justice and against the disposal of property- of the plaintiff held in pawn by Clauss. After an amended petition had been filed, the superior court, on motion by the defendant, dissolved the temporary injunction. The superior court in general term affirmed the judgment dissolving the injunction; and the plaintiff in error now seelcs to.reverse the judgment of the superior court in special and general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In substance the amended petition sets out the following facts: That the plaintiff and the defendant as a pawnbroker had within three years preceding the filing of the petition mutual running accounts, the plaintiff receiving in small amounts, at different times, $166 and pawning and pledging with defendant, at different times various articles of wearing apparel and jewelry; and that to the best of her knowledge she had repaid him more than $113, interest and principal, the interest being at unlawful rates. That plaintiff pawned to defendant a sealskin coat worth $250, and paid him $50 as the same became due as he claimed; but when she failed for two weeks to make the last regular payment demanded by him, he refused to accept when tendered, the amount owing by her in redemption of the sealskin coat, and as the plaintiff is informed sold the coat and converted all of the proceeds to his own use. That she pawned with defendant a diamond stud worth $100 which she afterwards redeemed, a gold ring worth $10, a watch worth $150, a watch worth $30, a gift from her father, all of which are in his possession. As a further security for said loans she mortgaged to defendant a folding bed worth $15, a combination secretary worth $50, but which is an heirloom in plaintiff\u2019s family, two vases worth $150, with decorations by plaintiff\u2019s deceased sister, and various other articles of the value of $235. That the defendant threatens to sell and dispose of the mortgaged articles together with the pawned articles, which if done would be an irreparable loss to her, the said articles being her necessary household furniture and wearing apparel, and some of them being priceless to her, for the loss of which she could not be compensated in damages. That on the second day of May, 1899, plaintiff tendered to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>fendant all the money he had before that time claimed .on said mortgage, which he refused to receive, and that on the following day he instituted the suit before the justice of the peace, and plaintiff avers that the notes for which plaintiff is sued are forgeries, and that she is unable to state the true condition of accounts existing between her and the defendant, and an account will be necessary to ascertain the same. That, instigated by the defendant as plaintiff believes and charges, two individuals have sought entrance into her home, being unable to give warrant or authority therefor when demanded, charging plaintiff with removal of what he termed \u201cClauss\u2019 furniture.\u201d Tftat defendant\u2019s license as a pawnbroker has been revoked because of illegal and dishonest practices, that he is not the owner of realty, is taxed on $600 personalty and that he is a married man.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">The prayer of the petition is for an accounting; for an injunction against the prosecution of the action before the justice of the peace; for cancellation of the notes and the chattel mortgage; that plaintiff may be allowed to redeem all the property so pawned and mortgaged; that defendant be restrained from selling or disposing of the pawns now held by him; and that upon the accounting the plaintiff recover of the defendant the amount which may be found to be due her.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-7\"><em>David Stuart Hounshell, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-8\">Maxwell on Code Pleading, p. 501; Jones on Pledges, Sec. 559; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Runals, </em>14 Wis., 755; <em>White M.

High on Injunctions, Secs. 89, 93. This familiar rule, however, is general but not universal; and we think that the case at bar comes within a distinctly marked exception, namely, where a pledge is the subject of controversy and it is a family relic, ornament, or heirloom having a special value to the owner, and for the loss of which damages in money would not be an adequate compensation. In such case a tender having been made of the amount previously claimed to be due, and refused, as alleged in this case, and it appearing that an accounting may be necessary to determine the state of running accounts between the parties; and that the sale or disposal of the pawned articles either by execution or otherwise, may cause an irreparable loss to the defendant in the action at law, no good reason appears why equitable relief should not be afforded. Under our code of civil procedure a provisional injunction could be had in an action for the recoyery of money only, in the court of common pleas or superior court of Cincinnati, and a full and adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>defense could be there made without resorting to a separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">But the case here is different. The action is in a court of limited jurisdiction. A justice of the peace is not invested with the power to enforce equitable rights or to consider equitable defenses; so that the matters of account, fraud and oppression, irreparable injury and redemption of pledged and mortgaged property alleged here could not lawfully be heard and determined in the justice\u2019s court. If adequate relief could be had by appeal from the judgment of the justice of the peace, there might,, perhaps, \"be no ground for this proceeding; but during the time which is required to transplant the case from the justice\u2019s court into the court of common pleas the apprehended loss or injury may take place; because on the theory of the defendant in error, equity cannot interfere. By the necessity of the case, then, there could not be a full and adequate protection of the defendant\u2019s right before the justice of the peace; and the defendant had the right to resort to a court of general jurisdiction for redemption of the specific property pledged and mortgaged, for such discovery and accounting as may be necessary to determine the actual amount due; and for such restraining order, or orders, as the nature of the case might require.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The judgments of the superior court in general term and special term are</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Reversed,</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-7\">Shauck, C.
