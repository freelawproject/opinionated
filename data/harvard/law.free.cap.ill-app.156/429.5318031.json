In an action of trespass on the case against three defendants, one only, the appellant here, was served with process. All of them, however, pleaded the general issue.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-12\" pgmap=\"453\">When the case was called for trial, defendants did not appear, and after an ex parte hearing before a jury, a verdict of $1,000 was returned against one defendant, the appellant here. The record recites that \u201cissues being joined as to Patrick W. Loftus, it is ordered that a jury come,\u201d etc. The record shows no disposition made of the issues between plaintiff and the other defendants. Judgment was rendered against Patrick W. Loftus alone, at the same term of court. At the second term thereafter, the appellant moved the court to set aside the judgment. From a denial of this motion an appeal was prayed and allowed\u00bb</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-4\" pgmap=\"454\">John J. Swenie and T. F.

Its judgment therefore was not a nullity; it was valid until reversed. After the term, the court was powerless to set aside the judgment, even if this defendant\u2019s attorney, contrary to the facts in this case, had known nothing of the verdict and so had been unable to move for a new trial during the term. The court therefore did not err in refusing to vacate the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b454-8\" pgmap=\"454\">It would he improper on this appeal from the order refusing to vacate a judgment to consider the alleged errors at the trial or defects in the declaration.</p> <p id=\"b454-9\" pgmap=\"454\">The appeal was not and could not after the term have been allowed from the original judgment.
