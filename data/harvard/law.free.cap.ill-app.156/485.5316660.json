Plaintiff issued to defendant a policy insuring him against loss from legal liability for personal injuries caused by his horses and vehicles for one year from October 29, 1906. Before that policy was issued one Laughlin called on defendant and asked to write him such a policy. Laughlin said that he would get the best rate he could, and afterwards returned and gave defendant a rate which he accepted. Laughlin afterwards brought defendant the policy and defendant paid him the premium, which he paid to plaintiff. October 1, 1907, Laughlin brought to defendant a similar policy of the plaintiff dated August 26, 1907, insuring defendant for one year from October 29, 1907,' and said to defendant that if he would pay the premium, $100, he would give defendant $5 out of his commission. Defendant then gave Laughlin a check for $95, payable to his order, and Laughlin delivered the policy. The check was paid October 8, 1907: It does not appear that defendant saw Laughlin after the delivery of the first policy until the second was delivered. The application for the second policy was not signed by the defendant, but below the blank for the signature of the applicant are the words:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\" pgmap=\"510\">\u201cBroker, M.

Laughlin. In March, 1908, Grogan asked Lynch if he had paid the premium to Laughlin, and Lynch answered that he had. Grogan said that Laughlin had not turned in the premium and that he would see him and fix it up. March 19, 1908, plaintiff wrote Lynch cancel-ling the policy and enclosing a bill for $50 for the earned premium and for such earned premium this suit was brought. A trial by the court resulted in a judgment for the defendant, to reverse which this writ of error is prosecuted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-4\" pgmap=\"511\">C.

If from the evidence it could be held that Laughlin was the agent of the defendant to procure the first' policy, such authority ceased when that policy was procured. Two months before the first policy expired plaintiff issued and delivered to Laughlin the second policy, charged the premium to him, gave him a bill therefor, and when he did not pay the premium over to the company within the period of credit allowed him, the company sent him another bill for the premium. Grogan, the resident secretary of the plaintiff, testified that he knew when he delivered the policy to Laughlin that Laughlin, \u201cwas delivering this insurance.\u201d He further testified on cross-examination in part as follows: \u201cI made some effort to collect this insurance premium from Mr. Laughlin. A bill was sent enclosed with the policy. I made some effort after the policy was issued; a bill was sent several times, and I had some conversation with him about it. He said he was endeavoring to collect, doing his best to get the money for the company from Mr. Lynch and could not get it. \u2018</p> <p id=\"b511-8\" pgmap=\"511\">Q. But he was acting for you in that capacity, was he, in placing this insurance? A. The premium usually comes through the broker.</p> <p id=\"b511-9\" pgmap=\"511\">Q. He was acting for you I say. Answer the question yes or no. A. Yes.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b511-10\" pgmap=\"511(10) 512(24)\">Four months after the policy took effect Grogan asked defendant' if he had paid the premium to Laughlin, and when told that he had, said he would see Laughlin and fix it up.</p> <p id=\"b512-5\" pgmap=\"512\">We think that on the evidence the trial judge might properly find that as between the company and Lynch, Laughlin was authorized to collect the premium from Lynch, or on the authority of the case of The Lycoming Ins. Co. v. Ward, 90 Ill. 545, might properly find that the company was estopped from claiming that the payment of the premium by Lynch to Laughlin made on the delivery of the policy was not binding on the company. The judgment of the Municipal Court is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b512-6\" pgmap=\"512\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
