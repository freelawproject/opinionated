Defendant also contends the trial court prejudicially erred in instructing the jury on the sentence enhancement, and expert opinion testimony was necessary with respect to the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">In the published portion of our opinion, we agree there was insufficient evidence that defendant knew or should have known the victim, who suffers from schizophrenia, was \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d within the meaning of the enhancement statute (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 667.9, subd. (a)). Accordingly, we will strike that enhancement. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we also agree the trial court erred in failing to instruct on theft <em>as a lesser included offense </em>of robbery, but find that error harmless as to defendant\u2019s robbery conviction. We will, however, vacate defendant\u2019s theft convictions, as defendant could not be convicted of robbery <em>and </em>the lesser included theft offenses. In light of these modifications\u2014particularly the striking of the section 667.9 enhancement\u2014we will remand the case to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">In May 2008, S.B. was shopping at the S &amp; K Market, as she did every week. Defendant, who shopped at the store regularly, had seen S.B. before and felt she was a nice person from having \u201cseen her around.\u201d Defendant saw S.B. go into the store and saw her come out about five to 10 minutes later. He saw her put her purse down and asked her if she was \u201c \u2018okay,\u2019 because she sort of was looking around.\u201d S.B. had put her purse on the ground to load her purchases into her purse, but the purse was touching her foot. Defendant walked up to her and grabbed her purse off the ground. S.B. struggled with defendant over the purse, but she lost her hold and fell down, and defendant fled with the purse. S.B. pursued defendant, yelling at him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>give her purse back. As she followed him, he punched her and knocked her down. She got up and continued chasing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Debra Williams, a witness in a passing vehicle, saw defendant snatch the purse from S.B.\u2019s feet, saw S.B. catch defendant and grab the purse, and saw defendant punch S.B. and knock her to the ground. Michael Faulkner, Jesse Ramirez, and Tim Ashlock chased after defendant. Faulkner caught defendant and told him to stop. Defendant eventually slowed down and gave Faulkner the purse. Faulkner told the others to call the police. When defendant resisted, Faulkner and Ashlock wrestled him to the ground and ultimately tied his hands to restrain him.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">When Stockton Police Officer David Reeder arrived on the scene, he saw two men holding defendant down. Officer Reeder took defendant back to his patrol car. On the way there, defendant said he was not \u201cgoing to go back to this bullshit.\u201d Officer Reeder placed defendant under arrest, gave him Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> warnings, and interviewed him. Defendant admitted he took the purse off the ground and claimed it was not a big deal. He said she said, \u201c \u2018give it back.\u2019 He said he didn\u2019t have to listen to a crazy lady.\u201d Defendant referred to S.B. as a \u201ccrazy lady\u201d a couple of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Defendant testified he saw S.B. go in the store and come out about five to 10 minutes later carrying her purse. She set it on the ground and began to roll a cigarette. He approached her and asked if she was okay, and she responded she was fine. Then he grabbed her purse and ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">A number of people chased defendant. He stopped running because he thought the police were chasing him. He returned the purse and apologized for taking it. Then the men chasing him beat him up and detained him until police arrived. Defendant denied punching S.B. or struggling with her for the purse. He denied he knew she had mental health issues, but admitted she looked like an easy target.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">S.B. had been taking medication for schizophrenia since she was 18 years old. She lived in a board and care home; she could not live on her own. The home provided her food, did her laundry, administered her medications, cooked her food, and helped with her day-to-day living activities. There was a 9:00 p.m. curfew. If she was doing well, she could come and go as she liked, but if she was not doing well, the home could ask her to stay there. The home also helped with housecleaning and monitored any unusual behavior of its residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>S.B. stayed in school until she was about 18 years old and received her GED (general equivalency diploma). She also may have taken some community college classes. S.B. walked by herself to places such as the market, the park, and the community center. She did not take the bus because she was afraid the bus would crash based on how it leans. She supported herself financially by selling clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Every two weeks S.B. got an injection of Haldol to control her auditory hallucinations. When she did not get the medication, she talked to herself and could not find her way home. She was on her medication when defendant stole her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">S.B. had received assistance from San Joaquin County Behavioral Health Services since 1998. Vicki Simpson had been her behavioral health caseworker since 2006. In 2006, before S.B. moved into the residential care home, Simpson visited her apartment. The apartment was \u201cseriously dilapidated.\u201d S.B. was not attending her health care appointments, and her apartment was filthy and cockroach infested. There were dirty dishes in the sink that had not been washed for weeks. There was hardly any food in the apartment. She was afraid to get dentures because she thought her teeth would grow back from taking vitamins. The residential home where she lived brought S.B. to her psychiatric and health care appointments, helped her function in the community, and administered and monitored her medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Defendant was charged by information with robbery, grand theft (theft from the person of another), and petty theft with a prior. The information further alleged that defendant had two prior convictions (including one for grand theft) for which he had served prison terms. The information also alleged an enhancement under section 667.9 for each of the three counts. Section 667.9 provides for a one-year sentence enhancement when the defendant knows or reasonably should know that the victim of an enumerated offense is 65 years of age or older, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, a paraplegic, a quadriplegic, or under 14 years old. Here, the information did not specify which condition applied, but the case was tried on the theory that the victim, S.B., was developmentally disabled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">The trial on the prior prison term allegations was bifurcated and the substantive charges and the section 667.9 enhancement were presented to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>jury. The trial court instructed the jury on robbery, grand theft, and petty theft as distinct charges. The court did not instruct the jury that theft is a lesser included offense of robbery, nor that they could convict defendant on only one of the three charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">On the section 667.9 enhancement, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-6\">\u201c[T]o prove this allegation, the People must prove at the time of the theft [S.B.] was developmentally disabled and at the time of the theft, defendant knew or reasonably should have known that [S.B.] was developmentally disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-7\">\u201cDevelopmentally disabled means a severe, chronic disability of a person that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-8\">\u201cOne, is attributable to mental or physical impairment or a combination of mental or physical impairment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-9\">\u201cTwo, is likely to continue indefinitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-10\">\u201cAnd, three, results in a substantial functional limitation in three or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-11\">\u201cA, to care for one\u2019s self.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-12\">\u201cB, to understand and express language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-13\">\u201cC, to learn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-14\">\u201cD, to be independently mobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-15\">\u201cE, to engage in self-direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-16\">\u201cF, to live independently or G, to be economically self-efficient [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-17\">The jury found defendant guilty of all three counts and found the section 667.9 enhancement allegation true. The court found the prior prison term enhancement allegations true.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-18\">The trial court denied probation and sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of six years in prison, consisting of the middle term of three years for robbery, a consecutive one-year term for the section 667.9 enhancement, and one year for each of the prior prison term enhancements. The trial court stayed sentence on the \u201clesser include[d] [theft] offenses\u201d under section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">\n<em>The Section 667.9 Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Section 667.9 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cAny person who commits [an enumerated offense] against a person who is 65 years of age or older, or against a person who is blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, a paraplegic, or a quadriplegic, or against a person who is under the age of 14 years, and that disability or condition is known or reasonably should be known to the person committing the crime, shall receive a one-year enhancement for each violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Subdivision (d) of section 667.9 provides that \u201c[a]s used in this section, \u2018developmentally disabled\u2019 means a severe, chronic disability of a person, which is all of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-9\">\u201c(1) Attributable to a mental or physical impairment or a combination of mental and physical impairments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-10\">\u201c(2) Likely to continue indefinitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-11\">\u201c(3) Results in substantial functional limitation in three or more of the following areas of life activity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-12\">\u201c(A) Self-care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-13\">\u201c(B) Receptive and expressive language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-14\">\u201c(C) Learning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-15\">\u201c(D) Mobility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-16\">\u201c(E) Self-direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-17\">\u201c(F) Capacity for independent living.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-18\">\u201c(G) Economic self-sufficiency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-19\">Defendant contends the trial court prejudicially erred in instructing the jury on the section 667.9 enhancement because the \u201careas of life activity\u201d referenced in the statute \u201chave a complex and peculiar meaning which needed further clarification and definition.\u201d He also contends expert testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>necessary to assist the jury in determining whether S.B. had a substantial functional limitation in three or more of these areas of life activity. Finally, he contends \u201cthere was insufficient evidence to support the [section 667.9] enhancement because the prosecution failed to prove [S.B.] was developmentally disabled within the meaning of [the statute]\u201d and, \u201c[m]ore significantly, . . . failed to prove by substantial evidence that [defendant] knew or reasonably should have known that [S.B.] suffered from such an indefinite mental or physical impairment resulting in a substantial functional limitation in three or more of the abilities listed in subdivision (d)(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">We will assume for the sake of argument that no special instruction further defining the areas of life activity described in the enhancement statute and no expert testimony regarding those areas of life activity was required. We will also assume there was sufficient evidence that S.B. was developmentally disabled within the meaning of the statute. Even with these assumptions, however, we conclude the enhancement must be stricken because there was no substantial evidence that the fact S.B. was developmentally disabled was \u201cknown or reasonably should be known to\u201d defendant at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">The People contend \u201c[t]here was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that [defendant] knew that [S.B.] was developmentally disabled\u201d because he \u201ctestified that he knew of [S.B.], had observed her for some time on the day of the robbery, and had talked to her previously.\u201d He also \u201ctestified that he generally thought of [S.B.] as a \u2018very nice person\u2019 \u201d and \u201cat the time of his arrest. . . repeatedly referred to [S.B.] as a \u2018crazy lady.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">None of these facts, alone or together, was sufficient to support a determination beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew S.B. was \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d within the meaning of section 667.9. True, the jury could reasonably have inferred from the evidence that defendant knew S.B. had some sort of mental impairment\u2014thus, his reference to her as a \u201ccrazy lady.\u201d But that alone was not enough to satisfy the knowledge element of the statute. To prove that defendant knew S.B. was developmentally disabled, there had to be evidence from which the jury reasonably could have found that defendant knew S.B. was mentally impaired <em>and </em>knew that, as a result, she had a severe, chronic disability that was likely to continue indefinitely and that resulted in her being substantially functionally limited in three or more of the specific areas of life activity identified in the statute (self-care, receptive and expressive language, learning, mobility, self-direction, capacity for independent living, and economic self-sufficiency). Without this knowledge, defendant could not have known S.B. was \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d as the enhancement statute defines that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>The People\u2019s argument on defendant\u2019s constructive knowledge of S.B.\u2019s developmental disability fares no better. Essentially, they assert that because \u201c[S.B.] appeared before the jury\u201d and \u201c[t]he jury had the opportunity to view and listen to her,\u201d \u201cthe jury was in the best position to determine whether [defendant] . . . should have reasonably known about [S.B.]\u2019s impairment.\u201d In support of this argument, the People reference the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, in which he suggested defendant reasonably should have known S.B. was developmentally disabled \u201cby [his] interaction with her.\u201d To support this argument, the prosecutor asked the jury, \u201cHow long did it take you to find out just from listening to her testify that she, you know, mentally wasn\u2019t all there completely? It\u2019s not really\u2014it\u2019s something that\u2019s just notable. And if you communicate with somebody on more than one occasion like him who claims to be in tune with that type of thing, then you reasonably should have known that especially when you\u2019re using derogatory language to refer to that person afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">We reject this constructive knowledge argument for the same reason we rejected the People\u2019s actual knowledge argument. Just because defendant had reason to know S.B. had a mental impairment\u2014in the prosecutor\u2019s words, was not \u201call there\u201d\u2014did not mean he had reason to know that, as a result of her impairment, she had a severe, chronic disability that was likely to continue indefinitely and that resulted in her being substantially functionally limited in three or more of the specific areas of life activity identified in the statute (self-care, receptive and expressive language, learning, mobility, self-direction, capacity for independent living, and economic self-sufficiency).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The concepts of \u201cmental impairment\u201d and \u201cdevelopmental disability\u201d are not coextensive, particularly under section 667.9. Thus, the mere fact that S.B. suffered from an apparent mental impairment (in her case, schizophrenia) did not mean she was developmentally disabled, and the mere fact that defendant may have had reason to know she suffered from a mental impairment did not mean defendant had reason to know that the other facts necessary to classify S.B. as developmentally disabled within the meaning of the enhancement statute existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The People\u2019s reliance on <em>People v. Smith </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1182 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 820] to support their argument is misplaced. In <em>Smith, </em>the defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding under section 667.9 that he should have known his victim was 65 years of age or older because \u201calthough the jury could view the victim\u2019s physical appearance at trial, the prosecutor noted for the record only that [her] hair was gray, but did not note any other physical characteristics indicating her to be more than a certain age.\u201d <em>(Smith, </em>at p. 1190.) The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, stating, \u201cthe record shows that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>presented to the jury included [the victim]\u2019s physical appearance before the jury. Evidence was also presented that [she] was just three months short of her sixty-eighth birthday on the day of the robbery. We therefore presume, in support of the judgment, that the jury could reasonably deduce from its view of [her] physical appearance that defendant reasonably should have known that she was at least 65 years old.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The fact that a jury may reasonably deduce a person\u2019s <em>age </em>from that person\u2019s physical appearance in no way supports the conclusion that a jury may reasonably deduce from a person\u2019s appearance that the person is <em>developmentally disabled within the meaning of section 667.9. </em>Obviously, as we have explained above, proof of developmental disability requires far more than looking at and/or listening to someone and deciding the person is \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cnot all there.\u201d Indeed, to prove here that S.B. was developmentally disabled, the prosecution did far more than bring her into the courtroom for the jury to see and hear. As we have detailed above, the prosecution elicited extensive testimony about S.B.\u2019s schizophrenia and how it affected her ability to live, work, and care for herself (among other things). There was no evidence, however, that defendant was aware of any of these things when he took S.B.\u2019s purse. On this record, all he knew or had reason to know was that she had some sort of mental impairment. Because that was not sufficient to support imposition of the section 667.9 enhancement, we will strike that enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">The section 667.9 enhancement is stricken, and the convictions for grand theft and petty theft with a prior are vacated. The case is remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-10\"> All further section references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b972-10\"><em> Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b973-10\"> Although the information alleged a section 667.9 enhancement for each count, ultimately the jury was asked to decide that enhancement as to the robbery charge only, presumably because while robbery is one of the enumerated offenses to which the enhancement applies, theft is not. (See \u00a7 667.9, subd. (c)(3).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b978-11\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1147.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b978-10\">SCOTLAND, P. J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"A_n\">With one exception, my colleagues got it right. We differ only on whether there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of his crime was \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 667.9, subdivisions (a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>My colleagues begin by assuming the evidence establishes that the victim was \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d within the meaning of the statute. It does.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The evidence showed that the victim suffered from schizophrenia and was unable to live independently. Thus, she stayed in a board and care home to obtain needed help with the tasks of day-to-day living. When the victim had lived alone, her apartment was filthy. Indeed, a mental health specialist described the apartment as \u201cgross.\u201d For example, cockroaches were on the floor, unwashed dishes appeared to have \u201cbeen there for a number of weeks,\u201d and hardly any food was in the apartment. The victim suffered from anxiety even when taking medication for her mental illness. The medication would stop her from hearing voices, allow her to remember things that she would otherwise forget, and help her to have a normal life. However, if the victim did not take her medicine, she would walk the streets talking to herself and could not find her way home. The victim would not wear dentures because she believed that her teeth would grow back since she was taking vitamins.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Based on this evidence, a jury reasonably could find that the victim\u2019s mental illness was likely to continue indefinitely and caused her to have substantial functional limitations in three areas of life activity: self-care; capacity for independent living; and self-direction. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.9, subd. (d)(1), (2), (3)(A), (E) &amp; (F).)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">In my view, the evidence is also sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of his crime was developmentally disabled. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prince </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 1179, 1251 [57 Cal.Rptr.3d 543, 156 P.3d 1015] [in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact that the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">For starters, by his own admission, defendant knew the victim was mentally ill; he called her the \u201ccrazy lady.\u201d Defendant also admitted he had seen, spoken to, and \u201cinteracted\u201d with the victim on other occasions prior to stealing her purse. Because defendant described the victim as the crazy lady, the jury reasonably could deduce that his prior interaction with the victim occurred at times when she was not taking her medication. When the victim failed to take her medication, she would walk the streets talking to herself and was unable to find her way home. Even when she took medication, her mental illness was apparent. During summation, the prosecutor observed that the victim\u2019s mental problem was \u201csomething that\u2019s just notable\u201d and that, having listened to her testify, jurors must have recognized the victim \u201cwasn\u2019t all there completely.\u201d Even defense counsel acknowledged the victim was \u201csomebody who appears different.\u201d Thus, the jury could reasonably deduce that, when he grabbed the victim\u2019s purse, defendant knew the victim\u2019s mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>illness impaired her ability to function. Indeed, defendant admitted that, before he grabbed the victim\u2019s purse, he asked her if she was \u201cokay\u201d because \u201cshe sort of was looking around.\u201d He also admitted that the victim \u201clook[ed] like [she was] an easy target\u201d at first. These admissions\u2014coupled with evidence that the victim was an older, toothless person who would not wear dentures because she believed her teeth would grow back since she was taking vitamins, who suffered from anxiety even when taking her medication, and who was confused and talking to herself when not taking her medication\u2014paint the picture that, from his interactions with her on other occasions and from his observations of her on the day that he grabbed her purse, defendant was aware or reasonably should have been aware that the victim\u2019s mental illness substantially limited her ability to function in life activities such as self-care, the capacity for independent living, and self-direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The majority\u2019s contrary conclusion fails to allow for reasonable inferences that a layperson is capable of deducing. To instead apply the majority\u2019s test will effectively mean that, unless the evidence establishes that a defendant is a mental health expert, a jury never could find a defendant knew or had reason to know that a victim was developmentally disabled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
