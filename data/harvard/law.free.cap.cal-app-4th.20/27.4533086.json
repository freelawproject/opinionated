J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai\">The Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. (EPIC) appeals from an order dismissing its purported \u201csupplemental petition\u201d for writ of mandate challenging the reapproval of a timber harvest plan (THP). EPIC objects to the dismissal on two procedural grounds. We find no merit to EPIC\u2019s contentions. In affirming the order of dismissal, we hold that, after an alternative writ of mandate is fully complied with by the respondent, the issuing court retains no continuing jurisdiction in such proceedings over the subject matter of the writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">I. Procedural Background and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">A. <em>The Alternative Writ of Mandate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">Real party in interest Pacific Lumber Company (P-L) submitted THP 1-90-237 HUM to respondent California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Forestry) on April 11, 1990. The THP proposed the logging of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>154 acres of old-growth redwood and Douglas fir on a 237-acre site near Eureka. Forestry did not accept the THP for filing because it did not contain sufficient surveys of wildlife species potentially affected by the logging. The THP was resubmitted October 15, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Forestry disapproved the THP on January 30, 1991, on the ground that the plan did not include adequate studies of the potential impact of logging on the marbled murrelet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">P-L appealed Forestry\u2019s denial of the THP to the State Board of Forestry (Board). On March 6, 1991, after hearing extensive testimony, the Board overturned Forestry\u2019s denial and approved the THP. The Board\u2019s \u201cofficial response\u201d to public comment indicated that while no murrelets were sighted on the THP site, they were known to be in the general vicinity. The Board concluded that the THP\u2019s proposals for mitigation of harm to any murrelets on site were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">On March 26, 1991, EPIC and the Sierra Club challenged the approval of the THP by a petition for writ of mandate, naming the Board as respondent. The petition alleged, inter alia, that the THP failed to include adequate surveys for marbled murrelets potentially present on the plan site, and that the proposed mitigation measures were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">On July 26, 1991, the Board served an answer to the petition; it also served a \u201cnotice of nonopposition\u201d to the issuance of the alternative writ. The matter came before Judge William F. Ferroggiaro, Jr., for hearing on August 5, 1991. The Attorney General, appearing as counsel for the Board, announced that the Board did not oppose the issuance of an alternative writ because it was prepared to set aside its approval of the THP. Counsel listed three reasons for the Board\u2019s position: (1) The Board had adopted in June emergency regulations for the protection of the marbled murrelet, including detailed survey requirements; (2) the marbled murrelet had on August 1 been listed as a \u201cthreatened species\u201d by the California Fish and Game Commission; and (3) there was some suspicion on the part of the Board that so little was known of the murrelet that designing mitigation measures was not possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">On August 6, 1991, the superior court issued an alternative writ of mandate, commanding the Board to set aside its March 6, 1991, decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>approving the THP or in the alternative to show cause why it had not done so. On September 11, 1991, the Board complied with the alternative writ by setting aside the approval decision \u201cas commanded by\u201d the superior court\u2019s alternative writ. The Board recited that \u201cFinal administrative action on [P-L\u2019s] appeal will be taken only after a public hearing at which [P-L] and the public will be afforded an opportunity to be heard. The [Board] will receive additional evidence on whether the proposed operation will provide adequate protection to wildlife in light of the listing of the Marbled murrelet by the California Fish and Game Commission and the adoption of emergency regulations by the [Board].\u201d The public hearing was set for November 5, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">On September 25, 1991, the Attorney General on behalf of the Board served a \u201creturn to alternative writ of mandamus,\u201d reciting that the Board \u201cfully complied with the terms of the alternative writ by making an order setting aside its decision to approve THP-1-90-237 HUM.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Thereafter, the Board thoroughly reconsidered the plan with input from P-L and several government agencies. On March 13, 1992, the Board again approved the THP. In a detailed 10-page statement of findings, the Board approved the plan subject to four conditions subsequent, and concluded that \u201cWith the conditions imposed by the Board, . . . the plan reflects the best knowledge reasonably available about the murrelet. The Board believes it unreasonable to require [P-L] to forgo harvesting and wait until further, or different, mitigation and survey techniques are developed by the scientific community.\u201d The four conditions were (1) the conducting of preharvest surveys pursuant to the Pacific seabird protocols; (2) sharing that survey information with Forestry and the Department of Fish and Game; (3) monitoring for marbled murrelets during timber operations; and (4) postharvest surveys, also to be shared as per condition (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">On September 18, 1992, EPIC filed a \u201csupplemental petition for writ of mandate\u201d in the same superior court proceeding (No. 91CP0244) in which the alternative writ had been previously issued and complied with. The \u201csupplemental petition\u201d was filed a full six months after the Board\u2019s decision to approve the THP. The Sierra Club, an original petitioner in action 91CP0244, was not named a petitioner in the supplemental pleading; Forestry and the Department of Fish and Game were added as additional respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Also on September 18, Judge Ferroggiaro issued a temporary restraining order against further timber operations. On September 21, P-L demurred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the \u201csupplemental petition,\u201d and filed a motion to strike and for judgment on the pleadings. P-L argued, inter alia, that the initial mandate proceeding had been concluded with the filing of the return showing full compliance with the alternative writ, and that in any case the new pleading was not filed within the 30-day limitations period for challenging a THP approval. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21080.5, subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">B. <em>The Attempted Disqualification of Judge </em>Ferroggiaro<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">A. <em>Full Compliance With an Alternative Writ of Mandate Divests the Issuing Court of Continuing Jurisdiction Over the Subject Matter of the Writ Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">As noted, we do not have a transcript of the October 9, 1992, hearing before Judge Hatch; we also lack a statement of reasons for his entry of the dismissal. The parties tacitly agree, however, that Judge Hatch dismissed the matter because EPIC could not file a \u201csupplemental petition\u201d in the old mandate action but had to file a new petition. EPIC contends that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">Although the Board filed a return to the alternative writ indicating full compliance, the prior mandate proceeding was never formally dismissed as moot. EPIC takes this procedural anomaly and grafts it onto the authorities which give a court inherent, continuous jurisdiction to enforce a <em>peremptory </em>writ of mandate. (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1097; <em>City of Carmel-by-theSea </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 964, 971 [187 Cal.Rptr. 379]; <em>Cartwright </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 567, 571 [115 Cal.Rptr. 402].)  The result of this combination is EPIC\u2019s contention that a court having issued an <em>alternative </em>writ somehow retains jurisdiction\u2014by operation of law\u2014to monitor future activity of an agency even though the alternative writ was fully complied with. Thus, EPIC claims it could legally have filed a \u201csupplemental petition\u201d in the old mandate proceeding to challenge the agency action after compliance which led to the reapproval of the THP.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">EPIC presents no authority for this proposition, relying almost entirely on the cases vesting jurisdiction to enforce a peremptory writ. The jurisdiction to enforce a judgment of the court, however, is very different from some sort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>of inchoate jurisdiction over a proceeding which is moot. It is clear that once the Board fully complied with the alternative writ, the initial writ petition had served its purpose and was moot; it is inexplicable that the petition was not formally dismissed. (See <em>Palma </em>v. <em>U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 177-178 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893]; <em>Save Oxnard Shores </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 140, 149 [224 Cal.Rptr. 425].) Given full compliance with the alternative writ, no further judicial action could be taken save dismissal: Mandamus does not lie to compel that which is being done voluntarily. <em>(Bruce </em>v. <em>Gregory </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 666, 671 [56 Cal.Rptr. 265, 423 P.2d 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">EPIC\u2019s initial writ accomplished its purpose, the setting aside of the approval of the THP. At that point, the writ was moot and the Board was \u201cgoing back to the drawing board.\u201d To accept EPIC\u2019s argument for some sort of \u201cwatchdog\u201d jurisdiction invites a procedural open-endedness which is inconsistent with CEQA\u2019s general policies in favor of expeditious review. To paraphrase Justice Cardozo, \u201cjurisdiction in the air will not do.\u201d <em>(Palsgraf </em>v. <em>Long Island Railroad Co. </em>(1928) 248 N.Y. 339 [162 N.E. 99, 59 A.L.R. 1253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The trial court\u2019s action was correct on a further ground. Whether EPIC could file a \u201csupplemental petition\u201d or was required to initiate a new mandate proceeding, it had to file something within 30 days of the March 13, 1992, reapproval of the THP. \u201cAny action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul a determination or decision of a state agency, board, or commission approving or adopting a [THP] . . . shall be commenced no later than 30 days from the date of the filing of notice of the approval or adoption of the [plan].\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21080.5, subd. (g).) The Legislature has provided for such short limitations periods to \u201cavoid delay and seek prompt resolution of CEQA claims.\u201d <em>(San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 498, 504 [234 Cal.Rptr. 527].)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">EPIC\u2019s failure to comply with the 30-day statute of limitations barred its attack on the March 13, 1992, Board approval of the reconsidered THP. P-L repeatedly points this out and EPIC blithely ignores its procedural lapse. Given EPIC\u2019s failure to file a timely challenge to the reapproval, the appropriate label for its untimely challenge is academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>B. <em>Judge Hatch Did Not Abuse His Discretion by Hearing Respondent\u2019s Demurrer and </em>Motions<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">III.
