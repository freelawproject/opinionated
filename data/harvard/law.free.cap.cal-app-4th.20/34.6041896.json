J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOm\">Albion River Watershed Protection Association and Friends of Salmon Creek (Albion) appeal from a judgment dismissing their petition for writ of mandate. The petition had challenged the approval of a timber harvest plan (THP) by respondent California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Forestry). The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Albion had failed to request a hearing within 90 days of filing as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.4 (section 21167.4). Albion now contends that section 21167.4 is inapplicable to judicial review of THP\u2019s. We will reject this argument under the authority of our recent decision in <em>Dakin </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 681 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 490]. However, as in that case, we will reverse the judgment of dismissal because the <em>Dakin </em>rule operates prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">We will also reverse an order imposing sanctions against Albion. While sanctions may ultimately be appropriate, we deem it necessary to remand this case so the trial court can consider the issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">A. <em>Applicability of Section </em>21167.4*</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">B. <em>Sanctions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The trial court imposed sanctions of $2,736.10 against Albion under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 which states, \u201cEvery trial court may order a party ... to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party as a result of bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d The court based the sanctions award on two grounds. First, the court ruled that Albion\u2019s failure to request a hearing on the writ petition within 90 days of filing, as required by section 21167.4, was \u201ca bad faith tactic that was both frivolous and solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d Alternately, the court noted Albion had violated a local rule which states that a complaint must be served within 60 days from the date it is filed. The court ruled that by waiting three and one-half months to serve its complaint, Albion had engaged in tactics \u201cwhich were \u2018solely intended to cause [and which did cause] unnecessary delay.\u2019 \u201d (Brackets in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Albion now claims an award of sanctions could not be based on either of these grounds. As to the first, we agree. The 90-day rule described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>by section 21167.4 does not apply in this case because Albion\u2019s petition was filed before <em>Dakin </em>became final. Thus, Albion was not required to request a hearing within 90 days prior to the finality of Dakin\u2019s resolving the issue of the applicability of section 21167.4, and cannot be sanctioned for failure to comply with that statute under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The trial court\u2019s additional ground for imposition of sanctions is a different story. As the trial court noted, Albion failed to serve its complaint within 60 days and presented absolutely no excuse for the delay. This act undoubtedly delayed the resolution of the case. Normally, under circumstances such as this, we would simply defer to the trial court and affirm the award of sanctions. However, under the facts of this case, we cannot do so. Although the trial court based its sanction award on two grounds, it is not clear whether the court believed either of those grounds alone would have supported an award of sanctions. Under these circumstances, we believe the better practice is to remand the case so the trial court can consider whether Albion\u2019s failure to serve the complaint in accordance with the court\u2019s local rules, by itself, justified an award of sanctions. In so doing, we state no opinion on whether an award of sanctions on this ground is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Nor do we state any opinion on whether an award of sanctions is appropriate because Albion filed its initial petition \u201cIn Pro Per\u201d through one Andrea Luna, who declared herself under penalty of perjury to be \u201ca member and the legal coordinator for petitioner,\u201d and then waited approximately six months before retaining an attorney.  It is settled that an unincorporated association must be represented by a person licensed in this state to practice law. <em>(Clean Air Transport Systems </em>v. <em>San Mateo County Transit Dist. </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 576, 578-579 [243 Cal.Rptr. 799]; <em>Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 729-730 [147 Cal.Rptr. 631, 581 P.2d 636]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6125 et seq.) It is not clear whether the trial court specifically considered or rejected Albion\u2019s initiation of this litigation in propria persona as a further frivolous tactic supporting its sanctions award under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">If an unincorporated association clearly violates Business and Professions Code section 6125 et seq., by filing a complaint in propria persona through a member unlicensed to practice law, such action may well be found to be</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>frivolous under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, particularly in the case of an experienced litigant so acting. Such action may, as well, necessarily delay progress of the litigation thus initiated until such association\u2019s representation is assiimed by one legally authorized to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The judgment is reversed. The matter is remanded for further proceedings in determining whether grounds exist for imposition of sanctions against Albion independently of consideration of the 90-day rule of section 21167.4. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">King, J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b50-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The trial court\u2019s order of November 25, 1992, on the motions of Forestry and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation to strike the complaint and for judgment on the pleadings, inter alia, mooted the issue of Albion\u2019s standing to sue by reason of its initiation of this action in propria persona only <em>as to those motions, </em>since Albion had retained present counsel when they were heard. That order, however, did <em>not </em>purport to deal with the question of whether Albion, an unincorporated association with a substantial history of participating as a party in THP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>litigation, thereby undertook a frivolous tactic or bad faith action proscribed by Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.'</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
