Weinberg, Robert Hermann, Judith A. Gordon, Gerald J. Ryan </em>and <em>Christopher Keith Hall </em>of counsel), for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtDt\">I. Appellant\u2019s statements, made during parole supervision in the absence of counsel, were admissible at his parole revocation hearing. <em>(People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479; <em>People v Claudio, </em>59 NY2d 556; <em>People ex rel. Calloway v Skinner, </em>33 NY2d 23; <em>Morrissey v Brewer, </em>408 US 471; <em>Gagnon v Scarpelli, </em>411 US 778; <em>Mempa v Rhay, </em>389 US 128; <em>People ex rel. Grace v Bantum, </em>113 Misc 2d 313.) II. Even if appellant had a right to counsel when he met with his parole officer, the division of parole had inadequate <em>notice </em>that counsel had been retained for parole matters. <em>(People v Marrero, </em>51 NY2d 56.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b196-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b196-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">After being paroled from a sentence imposed upon a conviction for robbery in the second degree, relator was arrested for attempted burglary and possession of a weapon. Prior to his release on bail, relator\u2019s Legal Aid counsel advised him of his obligation to report the arrest to his parole officer and further advised him that Legal Aid would represent him at any parole revocation hearing. When relator reported the arrest to his parole officer, he also informed his parole officer that his counsel advised him not to give any details, but, at the parole officer\u2019s urging, he admitted violating the conditions of his parole. The admission was introduced at relator\u2019s final revocation hearing which resulted in a finding that he had violated the terms of his parole and his being remanded for one year or in accordance with any new sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Under these circumstances, any violation of relator\u2019s right to counsel under the State Constitution would not preclude the use at a final parole revocation hearing of statements obtained by the parole officer in the absence of relator\u2019s counsel. A violation of a constitutional right may have different consequences depending upon whether the evidence obtained in violation of that right is attempted to be used in criminal or noncriminal proceedings. Thus, in <em>People v Ronald W. </em>(24 NY2d 732), it was held that statements given by a probationer to his probation officer in a custodial setting without <em>Miranda </em>warnings could sustain the revocation of probation and imposition of sentence. However, in <em>People v Parker </em>(57 NY2d 815, <em>affg </em>82 AD2d 661), we held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>statements made by a Federal parolee to his parole officer under similar circumstances could not be used in a subsequent criminal prosecution <em>(but see, Minnesota v Murphy, </em>465 US 420). <em>People ex rel. Piccarillo v New York State Bd. of Parole </em>(48 NY2d 76) is not to the contrary. There, we recognized that a parole revocation hearing is different from a criminal trial conducted to determine guilt or innocence, and is, instead, an administrative proceeding at which it is determined whether a parolee violated the terms of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In the present case, both courts below properly determined that relator\u2019s statement could be used at his final revocation hearing and, therefore, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed <em>(see also, Matter of Utsey v New York State Bd. of Parole, </em>89 AD2d 965). We are here not presented with the issue of the permissible uses, if any, of relator\u2019s statements in other proceedings <em>(cf. Minnesota v Murphy, </em>465 US 420, <em>supra; compare, People v Parker, </em>57 NY2d 815, <em>affg </em>82 AD2d 661, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Jasen, Meyer, Simons, Kaye and Alexander concur in Per Curiam opinion; Judge Titone taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
