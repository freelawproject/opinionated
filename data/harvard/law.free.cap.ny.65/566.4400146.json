It arises from proceedings instituted in the Village of Depew Justice Court charging defendants with six counts of obscenity in the third degree based upon their possession of allegedly obscene video cassette movies in violation of Penal Law \u00a7 235.05 (1). That statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>person is guilty of obscenity in the third degree when, knowing its content and character, he:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">\u201c1. Promotes, or possesses with intent to promote, any obscene material\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">After arraignment, defendants moved to suppress the seized films contending that the warrant authorizing their seizure was not based upon probable cause. Justice Court granted defendants\u2019 motion and dismissed the informations and County Court affirmed its order. The People appeal by leave of a Judge of this court. They contend that the Justice Court, a local criminal court, was without jurisdiction to invalidate a search warrant issued by Supreme Court, a superior court (CPL 10.10 [2], [3]), and that even if it did have the power to review the Supreme Court warrant it erred in finding that the Supreme Court Justice authorized the warrant without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">Insofar as the jurisdictional question is concerned, the motion was properly entertained by Justice Court. The Constitution provides that local courts \u201cshall have the jurisdiction prescribed by the legislature\u201d (NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 17 [a]) and the Legislature has provided that when an information is pending in a local criminal court, as these informations were, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>motion to suppress \u201cmust be made in such court\u201d (CPL 710.50 [1] [c]). Moreover, Justice Court had such jurisdiction even though the warrant was issued by a Supreme Court Justice. CPL 690.05 provides that warrants shall be issued by local criminal courts but the Supreme Court Justice was authorized to issue this warrant because at the time he did so he was exercising preliminary \u2014 not trial \u2014jurisdiction of the local criminal court, as the Criminal Procedure Law permits him to do <em>(see, </em>CPL 10.10 [3] [f]). Thus, Justice Court acted properly when it reviewed his probable cause determination <em>(see, People v Guerra, </em>65 NY2d 60). Whether it is wise for a Village Justice, who may or may not be a lawyer, to review a Supreme Court Justice\u2019s warrant authorizations is a matter for the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Turning to the merits of defendants\u2019 motion, analysis starts with recognition of the constitutional requirement that no warrant shall issue except upon probable cause (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 12; US Const 4th Amend). This requirement was designed to insure that the determination of probable cause (or to use the statutory term, reasonable cause <em>[see, </em>CPL 690.10]), to believe that the property is subject to seizure must be made by a neutral magistrate interposed between police officers and the citizenry and exercising a \u201c \u2018detached and independent judgment\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Potwora, </em>48 NY2d 91, 94; <em>People v Hanlon, </em>36 NY2d 549, 558; <em>Marcus v Search Warrant, </em>367 US 717). Before finding probable cause, the magistrate must have before him \u201cthe full facts from which inferences might be drawn, and information necessary to determine their reliability\u201d and he must undertake a searching inquiry of them. It is a duty which he may not delegate, in part or in whole, regardless of the qualifications of the person on whom reliance is placed <em>(People v Potwora, supra, </em>at pp 94-95; <em>Lee Art Theater v Virginia, </em>392 US 636; <em>see also, Monserrate v Upper Ct. St. Book Store, </em>49 NY2d 306; <em>People v Abronovitz, </em>31 NY2d 160, 164-165; <em>People v Rothenberg, </em>20 NY2d 35, 38; <em>People v Hughes, </em>31 AD2d 235). Moreover, in making that searching inquiry the magistrate is obliged to recognize that 1st Amendment items are presumptively protected by constitutional guarantees of free speech <em>(see, Roaden v Kentucky, </em>413 US 496). Because their seizure based upon the ideas they contain may constitute a prior restraint, there is a higher standard for evaluation of a warrant application seeking to seize such things as books and films, as distinguished from one seeking to seize weapons or drugs, for example <em>(Roaden v Kentucky, supra, </em>at p 504; <em>Marcus v Search Warrant, </em>367 US 717, 730-731, <em>supra). </em>In applying the 4th Amendment to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>items, the court must act with \u201cscrupulous exactitude\u201d <em>(Stanford v Texas, </em>379 US 476, 481-485; <em>see also, Maryland v Macon, </em>472 US _, 125 S Ct 2778, 2780-2782).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Consistent with these rules, the task of the issuing magistrate in this case was not to decide guilt or innocence but to determine in a preliminary way from the information submitted and available to him whether there was probable cause to believe that the material to be seized was obscene within the tripartite definition of the statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(see, People v Potwora, </em>48 NY2d 91, <em>supra; People v Abronovitz, </em>31 NY2d 160, <em>supra; People v Rothenberg, </em>20 NY2d 35, <em>supra). </em>Because the record does not indicate whether the magistrate viewed the films or questioned the investigators, we must judge his warrant authorization solely on the allegations contained in the papers submitted to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The applications consisted of an affidavit of the Sheriff\u2019s deputy who rented the 10 cassettes from defendants\u2019 store and separate affidavits relating to each film executed by an investigator from the District Attorney\u2019s office who had viewed the films after the deputy delivered them to him for that purpose. In each affidavit the investigator identified the film by title, indicated the time required to view it, 80-90 minutes generally, and described the sexual activity shown in some of the scenes. Each affidavit contained approximately 15-20 typewritten lines describing the film, the descriptions in the two shortest affidavits containing only 11 lines and in the longest one, 27 lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Each affidavit recites that the subject film depicts one or more acts enumerated under section 235.00 (1) (b). Many of the scenes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>described contain explicit sexual activity, patently offensive by any constitutional standard, but the allegations of the affidavits do not indicate whether they constitute all, most or a few of the scenes presented in the films. Thus, some of the affidavits describe only two or three scenes in the movie and others refer to \u201cone scene\u201d, \u201ca scene\u201d, \u201canother scene\u201d, or \u201ca later scene\u201d without any attempt to describe the film as a whole, the continuity of the action or the pervasiveness of the sexual conduct. The descriptions of the action are not supplemented by references to the narrative or dialogue of the films and the affiant attempted to describe the \u201ccharacter\u201d or \u201ctheme\u201d of the movies by settings having nothing to do with plot, phrases such as \u201ca middle class white neighborhood\u201d, \u201cthe home of one of the six girls\u201d or \u201ca high school for girls.\u201d He made no attempt to reveal the story line (or lack of one) of the films or demonstrate that their \u201cpredominant appeal\u201d was to prurient interest. In short, none of the affidavits permit an inference that the scenes described are more than a catalog of offensive parts of the whole. Undoubtedly, similar lists could readily be compiled by excerpting descriptions of scenes from books and movies having recognized merit. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d and Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cSatyricon\u201d come quickly to mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The dissent contends that this deficiency is cured because the affidavits allege that certain acts occurred \u201cthroughout\u201d the movies (dissenting opn, at pp 580-581). Significantly, the word \u201cthroughout\u201d appears in only two of the affidavits. But further than that the statements relied upon are conclusory and patently ambiguous. They may be interpreted as alleging that sexually explicit acts are pervasive in the two films described but they may also be interpreted in other, less inculpatory ways. That being so, the magistrate was required to inquire and clarify the affidavits\u2019 meaning and the record does not establish that he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We have previously held that the courts should not analyze applications in a grudging or hypertechnical manner when determining whether they meet constitutional standards <em>(see, People v Hanlon, </em>36 NY2d 549, 559, <em>supra, </em>and cases cited therein). We do not suggest otherwise now. Certainly a screenplay need not be annexed to a warrant application nor need the issuing magistrate view the film or even a part of it before approving a warrant. There must be enough information before him in one form or another, however, to enable him to judge the obscenity of the film, not of isolated scenes from it. The affidavits, if that is all that is relied upon, need not describe the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>content of the movie but they must contain enough information to permit the issuing magistrate, applying contemporary community standards, to judge the films as a whole and determine that they are within the statutory definitions of obscenity and thus are not entitled to constitutional protection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Probable cause cannot be inferred from the title of an hour and a half long film or from the description of a few scenes from it, even when the scenes described portray conduct enumerated in subdivision 1 (b) of the statute. Indeed, it is precisely the type of personal view of the \u201cclear and present danger\u201d posed by obscenity, such as that expressed on page 578 of the dissent, which makes it mandatory that the court insist on the sufficiency of the material before the magistrate and that he take a \u201chard look\u201d at it, exercising care to adhere to the proper legal standards so that his subjective views or those of the police do not infringe upon the constitutional rights of citizens. It is the failure of the affidavits in this case to contain sufficient information to permit this which distinguishes it from decisions cited by the People, cases such as <em>United States v Espinoza </em>(641 F2d 153, <em>cert denied </em>454 US 841), in which the supporting affidavits purported to describe every picture in the books to be seized, <em>United States v Sherpix, Inc. </em>(512 F2d 1361), in which the affidavit described in explicit detail every scene in the film <em>{id., </em>at pp 1368-1369), <em>United States v Middleton </em>(599 F2d 1349), in which there was a lengthy affidavit describing the conduct in the film in specific detail <em>{id., </em>at pp 1351-1354), and <em>United States v Marks </em>(520 F2d 913, <em>revd on other grounds </em>430 US 188), in which the affiants were also examined by the court <em>{id., </em>at p 917).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Accordingly, the order of County Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">. The majority have not adopted defendants\u2019 contentions and therefore the extensive discussion of them in the dissent is irrelevant <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at pp 575-576). Similarly unnecessary is the inclusion of the full text of the supporting affidavits in the dissent\u2019s appendix. The majority do not dispute that the affidavits describe patently offensive sexual acts defined by Penal Law \u00a7 235.00 (1) (b). Our disagreement with the dissent concerns only the question of whether the affidavits are sufficient to meet the additional requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c) of the statute and thereby support a finding of probable cause that the statute has been violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\">. Penal Law \u00a7 235.00 defines \u201cObscene\u201d as follows: \u201cAny material or performance is \u2018obscene\u2019 if (a) the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to the prurient interest in sex, and (b) it depicts or describes in a patently offensive manner, actual or simulated: sexual intercourse, sodomy, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sadism, masochism, excretion or lewd exhibition of the genitals, and (c) considered as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value. Predominant appeal shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults unless it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be designed for children or other specially susceptible audience\u201d <em>(see also, Miller v California, </em>413 US 15, <em>reh denied </em>414 US 881).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-5\">. The dissent contends that this standard has been \u201crejected unanimously by the Federal courts and by an overwhelming number of sister state courts that have considered it.\u201d (Dissenting opn, at p 573.) It fails, however, to cite any authority to support this sweeping generalization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">. The dissent relies on <em>Sequoia Books v McDonald </em>(725 F2d 1091) and <em>United States v Pryba </em>(502 F2d 391). <em>Sequoia Books </em>involved an action brought by a store owner against a Sheriff pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 1983 because of the seizure of allegedly obscene magazines. The opinion gives few particulars of the warrant application, reciting only that part quoted by the dissent <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at p 582) which it described as the \u201cleast unprintable of the descriptions\u201d (725 F2d 1091, 1093). The 1971 <em>Pryba </em>case involved a prosecution for shipments of obscene materials in interstate commerce under the broadly worded definition of obscenity contained in that statute. The court found probable cause for the seizure in an affidavit based upon hearsay which \u201cin good taste briefly\u201d alleged only that the film depicted \u201ca man and a female engaged in sexual intercourse, and various other sexual activities by males and males and males and females\u201d <em>(United States v Pryba, </em>502 F2d 391,404, n 89, <em>supra). </em>While delicacy and brevity have a place in the world, one would not consider them important or even desirable considerations on a warrant application. While we accord the Federal courts the greatest respect, we are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>bound by their decisions and insofar as <em>Pryba </em>may be interpreted as contrary to our decision, we do not follow it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b623-4\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANXM\">(dissenting). In this obscenity case, the majority holds that the five affidavits in question, which describe the content and character of video movies as graphically depicting successive acts of deviate sexual conduct, including incestuous intercourse, oral and anal sodomy, and onanism, are insufficient, as a matter of law, to support a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause that those video movies were obscene. Because I believe that the materials ordered seized by the magistrate were adequately described in the affidavits, as set forth in full in the appendix to this opinion,* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 would hold that the magistrate had \u201cenough information before him\u201d to reasonably believe that the video movies were obscene as legislatively defined and, therefore, that the warrant was properly issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">At the outset, it is important to note that what is before us is not whether the defendants are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of promoting or possessing obscene material, as that would require a full adversary hearing, but rather, simply whether the magistrate, in issuing the warrant to seize the movies, had probable cause to believe that they were obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The majority today holds that unless obscenity is unambiguously established by the affidavits in question, a magistrate is incapable of rendering a probable cause determination to issue a warrant for the seizure of sexually explicit films, described in those affidavits, solely for evidentiary purposes. This adopted position has never been advanced by the United States Supreme Court, and has been rejected unanimously by the Federal courts and by an overwhelming number of the sister state courts that have considered it (see, <em>infra, </em>at pp 581 to 583). Thus, in my opinion, the majority has undermined the policies advanced by a rigorous enforcement of the obscenity laws; disregarded traditional principles governing judicial review of a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause, and blurred the distinction between probable cause and guilt; failed to recognize that the magistrate had reasonable grounds to believe that the affidavits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>described the content and character of each movie as a whole; and misconstrued the limited purpose of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Defendants Erhardt and P. J. Video, Inc., are each charged with six counts of obscenity in the third degree, a class A misdemeanor. The prosecutions stem from investigations of defendants by the Erie County District Attorney\u2019s office. David J. Groblewski, a confidential criminal investigator assigned to the Erie County District Attorney\u2019s office, and previously a member of the New York State Police for 25 years, reviewed 10 video cassette movies which had been rented from defendants by a member of the Erie County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The 10 video cassette movies were selected from the \u201cAdult Cassette Movie List\u201d, which contained a total of 30 films and was printed upon the letterhead of Network Video, the business name under which defendants conducted business. Investigator Groblewski viewed the movies in their entirety and summarized the theme and conduct depicted in each film. Sworn affidavits describing the movies were submitted by Investigator Groblewski, and annexed to the application for a warrant authorizing the search of defendants\u2019 premises. On November 21,1983, Supreme Court Justice Theodore S. Kasler, issued a search warrant which authorized the Village of Depew Police Department to make a search of defendants\u2019 premises. The warrant specifically authorized a search for the following video cassette movies entitled: \u201cCalifornia Valley Girls\u201d, \u201cTaboo II\u201d, \u201cTaboo\u201d, \u201cAll American Girls\u201d, \u201cDebbie Does Dallas\u201d, \u201cBody Magic\u201d, \u201cDeep Throat\u201d, \u201cEvery Which Way She Can\u201d, \u201cFilthy Rich\u201d and \u201cLittle Girls Blue\u201d. The warrant also authorized a search for \u201cany personal papers or documents which tend to identify the owner, leasee <em>[sic] </em>or whomever has custody or control over the premises or vehicle searched or the items seized, and seize said property forthwith\u201d. The warrant was based upon the application of Sergeant Scioli, the affidavit of Erie County Sheriff Deputy Costanza, and 10 affidavits prepared by Investigator David Groblewski.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">As a result of the execution of the warrant on November 22, 1983, the defendants\u2019 premises were searched and one or two copies of each of the movies named in the warrant application, together with certain documents, were seized as evidence for trial. A sworn itemized inventory statement, dated December 5, 1983 and completed by Sergeant Scioli, clearly indicates that only one or two copies of each cassette tape named in the warrant application were seized. By order dated December 5, 1983, Justice Kasler directed that the seized property be tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>rarily retained, in the furtherance of justice, pursuant to CPL 690.05 through 690.55. While the 10 films named in the warrant application were seized, defendants were charged with promoting obscenity only with respect to five of those films, to wit: \u201cTaboo\u201d; \u201cAll American Girls\u201d; \u201cDebbie Does Dallas\u201d; \u201cCalifornia Valley Girls\u201d; \u201cTaboo II\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Defendants made an omnibus motion before Depew Village Court seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>suppression of the seized films. A review of defendants\u2019 affidavit in support of the omnibus motion, and arguments of defense counsel advanced at the suppression hearing, reveal that the sole ground upon which defense counsel sought suppression was that due to the magistrate\u2019s failure to personally view the films in question, the warrant was constitutionally infirm. Paragraph 73 of defendants\u2019 affidavit contended: \u201cThus, it is clear that under New York law before a search warrant may be issued regarding materials presumptively protected under the First Amendment, which the video tapes in this case indisputably are <em>(Interstate Circuit v Dallas, </em>390 US 676 [1968]; <em>Kingsley Pictures Corp. v Regents, </em>360 US 684 [1959]; <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v Wilson, </em>343 US 495 [1952]; <em>Monserrate v Upper Ct. St. Book Store, </em>49 NY2d 306), two distinct procedures must be engaged in by the issuing magistrate <em>prior </em>to the authorizing a search warrant: (a) the issuing Magistrate must himself personally review the facts (i.e., the materials themselves) upon which he is called to render a judgment of probable cause; and (b) the inquiry must \u2018focus searchingly\u2019 on the issue of \u2018obscenity\u2019.\u201d Paragraphs 74 and 75 of the affidavit clarified the constitutional flaw perceived by defense counsel: \u201cIn this case, it is clear that Justice Kasler <em>did not </em>personally review the video tapes but instead unconstitutionally delegated his duty of examining the full facts regarding the films\u2019 obscenity to various law enforcement officers * * * Here, Judge Kasler allowed Investigator Groblewski to determine whether probable cause existed to believe that the films were obscene \u2014 a determination which our Courts have long recognized is a matter of personal taste and <em>must be </em>performed by a neutral and detached Magistrate, not a law enforcement officer [citations omitted].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">At the motion hearing, held on February 15, 1984, defense counsel reiterated the thrust of his argument: \u201cThe procedure is, at least in this state, a magistrate, in order to fulfill that constitutional requirement of prior judicial scrutiny and focus upon that issue, has to look at the film or magazines or material in question.\u201d Defense counsel stressed: \u201cContinuously, the Court of Appeals said the magistrate is to look at the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>material\u201d. Finally, defense counsel concluded: \u201cI submit, falling clearly within the doctrine that is the facts, the whole facts have to be presented to the judge and I submit that in this state, at least the law is the judge has to look at the material because otherwise he is delegating his authority, which the Court of Appeals says he can\u2019t do.\u201d The proposition that the magistrate unconstitutionally delegated his responsibility to conduct a full and searching inquiry by relying upon investigator\u2019s affidavits was immediately, and sharply, disputed by the Assistant District Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">By order dated March 23,1984, the Village Court granted the motion to suppress, and held: \u201cIn this instance, it was an investigator assigned to the District Attorney\u2019s office who made the allegation that the materials seized were obscene\u201d. The order of suppression was affirmed by County Court, Erie County, upon the theory that \u201c[u]nder the circumstances of this case, the Court finds the holding of the Court below that under New York law, the issuing magistrate had failed to make an adequate finding of probable cause for the issuance of the warrant because he relied solely upon the affidavits of the police officers without any further investigation or viewing of the materials to be confiscated, was not an improvident abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">I begin my analysis by recognizing that the People of New York, through the Legislature, have declared that the evils of obscenity, reasonably created or advanced by its promotion, justifies such invasion of the freedom of expression as is necessary to avoid the danger presented. Defendants have been charged with multiple counts of promoting obscenity in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 235.05 [1]). Penal Law \u00a7 235.05 (1) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of obscenity in the third degree when, knowing its content and character, he [p]romotes, or possesses with intent to promote, any obscene material\u201d. Penal Law \u00a7 235.00 defines the word \u201cobscene\u201d in the following manner: \u201cAny material or performance is \u2018obscene\u2019 if (a) the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to the prurient interest in sex, and (b) it depicts or describes in a patently offensive manner, actual or simulated: sexual intercourse, sodomy,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sexual bestiality, masturbation, sadism, maso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>chism, excretion or lewd exhibition of the genitals, and (c) considered as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value. Predominant appeal shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults unless it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be designed for children or other specially susceptible audience\u201d. This definition, added by the Laws of 1974 (ch 989), was adopted to conform New York\u2019s definition of obscenity to that articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller v California </em>(413 US 15). <em>(See, </em>Memorandum of Approval, Malcolm Wilson, 1974 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2124.) As Penal Law \u00a7 235.00 was adopted with the express purpose of incorporating into New York law the Federal standard of obscenity set forth in <em>Miller, </em>and indeed is identical thereto, application of that statute necessarily entails interpretation of the Federal guidelines. Thus, it cannot fairly be said that the majority opinion rests upon \u201cbona fide separate, adequate, and independent [state] grounds\u201d <em>(Michigan v Long, </em>463 US 1032, 1041; <em>compare, New York v Uplinger, </em>467 US 246 [Per Curiam]).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The legitimate policies vindicated by vigorous enforcement of obscenity laws have been well explored by the Supreme Court. There exists a social interest in order and morality which is advanced by reasonable governmental restraint over the public distribution and sale of obscene movies. <em>(Paris Adult Theatre I v Slaton, </em>413 US 49, 61; <em>Roth v United States, </em>354 US 476, 485; <em>Chaplinsky v New Hampshire, </em>315 US 568, 572.) This State has made a judgment that the promotion of obscenity has a tendency to injure the community as a whole or jeopardize, in Chief Justice Warren\u2019s words, the \u201cright * * * to maintain a decent society\u201d. <em>(Jacobellis v Ohio, </em>378 US 184, 199 [dissenting opn].) The Legislature does, of course, have the power to make moral, as well as social, judgments. <em>(People v Onofre, </em>51 NY2d 476, 494 [Jasen, J., concurring].) Such a judgment was rendered by enactment of laws proscribing the promotion of obscene materials. The underlying social and moral purpose of New York\u2019s restriction upon the promotion of obscenity was highlighted by Judge Scileppi, when he stated: \u201cIt is regrettable that freedom of expression \u2014 one of our most cherished liberties \u2014 is perverted by those who profit from the salacious and obscene at the expense of decency and morality, as a spurious rallying cry to defeat the high purpose contained in our obscenity laws. Obscen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ity is striking a telling blow at community decency and morality everywhere with impunity.\u201d (Scileppi, <em>Obscenity and the Law, </em>10 NY L Forum 297, 305 [1964].)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">New York\u2019s obscenity laws further serve to protect the participants in the <em>visual </em>depiction of sexual conduct. <em>(New York v Ferber, </em>458 US 747, 764, <em>revg </em>52 NY2d 674; <em>see, </em>Jacobs, <em>Patterns of Violence: A Feminist Perspective on the Regulation of Pornography, </em>7 Harv Women\u2019s LJ 5, 18-23.) The Supreme Court has recognized that there exists a qualitative distinction between the <em>visual </em>depiction of sexual conduct and the printed description of such conduct. <em>(New York v Ferber, </em>458 US 747, 764, <em>supra.) </em>A state has a heightened interest in the regulation of the photographic portrayal of sexual conduct since it is necessarily connected to participatory conduct of actual parties. The visual depiction of sexual conduct presents the real potential for physical and psychological harm to the participants. In <em>California v LaRue </em>(409 US 109,117), the Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Rehnquist, underscored the vital difference between conduct and printed description: \u201cas the mode of expression moves from the printed page to the commission of public acts that may themselves violate valid penal statutes, the scope of permissible state regulations significantly increases. States may sometimes proscribe expression that is directed to the accomplishment of an end that the state has declared t\u00f3 be illegal when such expression consists, in part, of \u2018conduct\u2019 or \u2018action\u2019\u201d. The regulation of visually depicted obscenity limits the distribution of materials produced by conduct or action harmful to the participants therein. It is thus unrealistic to suggest that the regulation of obscenity is merely to limit the dissemination of offensive ideas. The promotion of obscenity for profit creates and advances a clear and present danger to the participants in the movies, as well as to women generally, resulting from conceivable instances where a viewer of such films seeks, by compulsion, to simulate that which he has viewed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When this court imposes additional burdens upon the magistrate and law enforcement personnel, and thereby disregards the probable cause standards utilized by virtually every other American court, the legitimate policies of protecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>community, the participants in visually depicted obscenity, and women generally, are unnecessarily undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Applying these principles, it is necessary to review whether the magistrate erred in issuing the search warrant. It is unquestioned that in situations in which the materials to be seized may be entitled to protection under the 1st Amendment, the requirements of the 4th Amendment should be scrupulously honored. <em>(See, Zurcher v Stanford Daily, </em>436 US 547, 564-565; <em>Stanford v Texas, </em>379 US 476, 485, <em>reh denied </em>380 US 926; <em>Marcus v Search Warrant, </em>367 US 717, 732-733.) While it can be said that the Supreme Court has not provided clear guidelines in determining probable cause for obscenity, nevertheless, there is certainty that 1st Amendment due process requires that a focused judicial determination be made of the character of expression prior to seizure. <em>(Marcus v Search Warrant, supra, </em>at p 732; Monaghan, <em>First Amendment \u201cDue Process\u201d, </em>83 Harv L Rev 518, 522; <em>cf. Maryland v Macon, </em>472 US _, 105 S Ct 2778, 2782-2783.) The critical question is whether the affidavits were sufficiently detailed to permit the magistrate to focus searchingly on the question of obscenity. In my view, the procedure utilized by the magistrate and law enforcement personnel demonstrated the requisite sensitivity to freedom of expression, and was both reasonable under the circumstances and constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">I am disturbed by the majority\u2019s departure from the traditional principles governing judicial review of a warrant issued upon probable cause. I had thought, as we have repeatedly held, that search warrant applications should be read in a commonsense and realistic manner and not in a hypertechnical manner. <em>(People v Hanlon, </em>36 NY2d 549, 558-559.) A showing of probable cause requires much less evidence than does a finding of guilt. <em>(United States v Ventresca, </em>380 US 102.) In dealing with probable cause, as the name itself implies, we deal with probabilities. <em>(New York v Quarles, </em>467 US_, 104 S Ct 2626; <em>United States v Pryba, </em>502 F2d 391, 404, <em>cert denied </em>419 US 1127.) Where the facts set forth in the police affidavits are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the subject materials are obscene, probable cause exists and the magistrate may properly issue the warrant. <em>(Illinois v Gates, </em>462 US 213; <em>Carroll v United States, </em>267 US 132,162.) Concomitant with the traditional deference paid to a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause by reviewing courts, we must recognize that our task is not to substitute our judgment as to probable cause but merely to determine whether there was a substantial basis for the magistrate\u2019s determination. <em>(Id.; see also, United States v Fuller, </em>441 F2d 755, 759.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>I take issue with the majority that the affidavits furnished the issuing magistrate did not describe the essential nature of the movies as a whole. Each of the affidavits describing the films clearly state at the outset that \u201cthe <em>content </em>and character of the above mentioned video movie is as follows.\u201d Inasmuch as the magistrate was reviewing affidavits describing movies which were advertised.by defendants as \u201cadult cassette movies\u201d, it was reasonable for him to believe that the affidavits faithfully and accurately described the substance of each movie as a whole. Each affidavit describes the numerous acts of deviate sexual intercourse and the objectification of women occurring in each film which the majority concede to be offensive. Each film is of relatively short duration. Manifestly, the acts described in each movie consume a substantial time span. Thus, the magistrate may reasonably have concluded that the described, successive acts of deviate sexual intercourse pervaded each film. When the title of each movie is considered together with its plot and setting, its general theme and serious value, if any, may reasonably be discerned. The films were described in each of the five nonconclusory affidavits in such a fashion as to permit the magistrate to focus searchingly on the issue of obscenity. Under these circumstances, there was a reasonable basis for the magistrate to authorize the seizure of the films in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">It is the majority\u2019s view that the affidavits provided the magistrate with insufficient information to determine probable cause for obscenity since the affidavits purportedly do not indicate whether the acts described \u201cconstitute all, most or a few of the scenes presented in the films.\u201d (Majority opn, at p 571.) This statement is factually incorrect. First, as noted above, it is clear that each affidavit recited that it described the <em>\u201ccontent </em>and character\u201d of each movie. This statement provided the magistrate with a reasonable basis to infer that the affidavits described most or all of the activities portrayed in each film. Second, the allegations in two of the affidavits state that the deviant sexual intercourse depicted in each film is pervasive. The affidavit describing \u201cAll American Girls\u201d notes that <em>\u201c[throughout </em>the movie, the [six] girls reminisce about their high school days with <em>each </em>one depicting her sexual <em>acts </em>with her male partner.\u201d (A-3; emphasis supplied.) Also, in the affidavit describing the film entitled \u201cDebbie Does Dallas\u201d, it is stated that <em>\u201c[throughout, </em>the movie depicts some lesbianism along with sexual acts of intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus.\u201d (A-5; emphasis supplied.) The use of the word \u201cthroughout\u201d should certainly convey to any reasonable person that <em>all </em>or <em>most </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>movie has been described. It could not be more plainly said to permit a reasonable inference that the films predominantly depicted obscene sexual conduct. Any other reading of the affidavits is to substitute this court\u2019s judgment for that of the magistrate and improperly engage this court in a hypertechnical and semantical review of the affidavits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in <em>United States v Pryba </em>(502 F2d 391, <em>cert denied </em>419 US 1127, <em>supra), </em>which the majority expressly declines to follow (majority opn, at pp 572-573, n 4), is the leading Federal case concerning the sufficiency of affidavits submitted to demonstrate probable cause in obscenity cases. In <em>Pryba, </em>defendant was convicted of interstate transportation of obscene matter and possession of such matter with intent to disseminate. On appeal, defendant challenged the search of his premises on the basis that the affidavit underlying the warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause. The magistrate did not personally view the films alleged to be obscene. The description of the films to be seized was set forth in an affidavit which merely stated that: \u201cThe above films depict a man and a female engaged in sexual intercourse, and various other sexual activities by males and males and males and females.\u201d (502 F2d, at p 410 [15].) Applying the constitutional test of obscenity as set forth in <em>Miller </em>(502 F2d, at p 404, n 90), and noting that the affidavit \u201cdescribes, though in good taste briefly, what the films depict\u201d (502 F2d, at p 404) the D. C. Circuit held: \u201cThe question before the [warrant issuing magistrate] was whether, on the allegations of the affidavit, there was probable cause for believing that a violation of obscenity laws had occurred. And \u2018[i]n dealing with probable cause, * * * we deal with probabilities\u2019; \u2018the term \u201cprobable cause\u201d * * * means less than evidence which would justify condemnation\u2019. The affidavit stated that the \u2018films depict\u2019 not only \u2018a man and a female engaged in sexual intercourse\u2019, but also \u2018various other sexual activities by males and males\u2019 as well as by \u2018males and females\u2019. <em>We have no difficulty whatever in accepting that information as an adequate foundation for a belief by the [warrant issuing magistrate], if persuaded to so believe, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>that the films might well be adjudged obscene.\u201d </em>(502 F2d, at p 404 [citations omitted; emphasis supplied].) The D. C. Circuit clearly illustrates the proper role of a reviewing court in adjudging a magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination, and rejects the notion, adopted today by the majority in this court, that the supporting affidavit must unambiguously establish obscenity in order to demonstrate a probability that the film is obscene under the <em>Miller </em>test. <em>(See also, United States v Sherpix, Inc., </em>512 F2d 1361, 1368, 1369 [DC Cir]; <em>United States v Middleton, </em>599 F2d 1349, 1356, 1358 [5th Cir]; <em>United States v Sherwin, </em>572 F2d 196,198, n 3 [9th Cir], all of which expressly embrace the <em>Pryba </em>view.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The recent case of <em>Sequoia Books v McDonald </em>(725 F2d 1091 [7th Cir], <em>cert </em>denied_US_, 105 S Ct 83) is instructive as to the issue at bar. In <em>Sequoia, </em>the Seventh Circuit addressed a claim brought by Sequoia seeking the return of seized magazines and an injunction against future seizures. Certain materials had been seized solely on the basis of a detailed affidavit from a police investigator which described nine magazines. One magazine was thus described: \u201cMagazine entitled \u2018Let\u2019s F_\u2019 containing therein pictures describing vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, eunnilingus and fallatio [sic].\u201d Rejecting defendant\u2019s assertion that the affidavit failed to show probable cause that the seized material was obscene, Circuit Judge Posner, speaking for a unanimous court, stated: \u201cThere was, it is true, a possibility that photographs of sexual acts might be redeemed by aesthetic or other values, and hence that the officers might seize constitutionally protected materials. But the possibility was slight. * * * The slight possibility of a temporary suppression of constitutionally protected sex magazines is not enough to invalidate the warrant under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (725 F2d, at pp 1093-1094.) <em>Sequoia Books, </em>like <em>Pryba, </em>demonstrates the needlessness and irrelevance of the majority\u2019s requirement for mathematical specificity in warrant affidavits submitted at the probable cause stage of an obscenity prosecution. <em>(See also, United States v Christian, </em>549 F2d 1369 [10th Cir], <em>cert denied </em>432 US 910; <em>State v Tavone, </em>482 A2d 693 [RI], <em>cert denied </em>US _, 105 S Ct 1879; <em>People v Hobbs, </em>59 Ill App 3d 793, 375 NE2d 1367.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">The Federal authorities cited by the majority, which are affirmatively relied upon to demonstrate examples of affidavits containing sufficient information, simply do not support their holding. In <em>United States v Espinoza </em>(641 F2d 153, <em>cert denied </em>454 US 841 [majority opn, at p 572]), the warrant affidavit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>deemed sufficient despite the fact that the 11-line summary of a 36-page magazine failed to indicate whether it encompassed the entire magazine or describe the text accompanying photographs. <em>United States v Sherpix, Inc. </em>(512 F2d 1361, <em>supra </em>[majority opn, at p 572]) merely reiterated the rule set forth by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in <em>Pryba, </em>discussed above, and certainly did not <em>require </em>an unambiguous showing of obscenity. In <em>United States v Middleton </em>(599 F2d 1349, <em>supra </em>[majority opn, at p 572]), the affidavit does not purport to summarize <em>every </em>scene, as the majority would here require, and the case relies heavily on <em>Pryba. United States v Marks </em>(520 F2d 913 [majority opn, at p 572]) is of virtually no precedential value since the extremely brief summaries were buttressed by a preseizure obscenity hearing \u2014 a procedure never required in New York <em>(see, People v Heller, </em>29 NY2d 319), and, indeed, the case was later reversed by the Supreme Court (413 US 483).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">As a final point, I would note that the scope and execution of the warrant in this case were closely circumscribed to avoid impermissible interference with constitutionally protected expression. The 4th Amendment requirement that warrants particularly describe the item to be seized must be observed with the most scrupulous exactitude when the material to be seized implicates 1st Amendment interests. <em>(Stanford v Texas, </em>379 US 476, 485, <em>supra.) </em>Strict adherence to the constitutional requirement of particularity eliminates any possibility that the officer in the field will exercise independent discretion and seize materials not judicially determined to be obscene. Ad hoc, nonjudicial determinations of obscenity, made at the site of the seizure, are constitutionally proscribed. <em>(See, e.g., Marcus v Search Warrant, </em>367 US 717, 731-732, <em>supra.) </em>In this case, however, the particularity requirement was scrupulously honored. The warrant authorized detention of 10 specifically named films which had been individually described in detail in police affidavits. Only those films were ordered detained. Thus, the warrant\u2019s scope was limited and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">A critical inquiry in a judicial determination as to the constitutional validity of a seizure of presumptively protected materials is the purpose for which the warrant was issued. Seizure may be effected to garner evidence for use in a subsequent criminal proceeding or, alternatively, to suppress and destroy the obscene materials. Where there is a seizure of large quantities of books for the sole purpose of their destruction, a prior judicial determination of obscenity in an adversary hearing is required to avoid abridgement of the public\u2019s right to unobstructed circulation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>nonobscene books. (A <em>Quantity of Books v Kansas, </em>378 US 205, 213; <em>see also, Heller v New York, </em>413 US 483, 491, <em>supra; Marcus v Search Warrant, </em>367 US 717, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Here, however, the purpose of the search of the premises of Network Video and the detention of the 10 films specifically named in the warrant application was solely to secure evidence to aid in the prosecution of defendants for promoting obscenity. There was no actual or constructive \u201cseizure\u201d. As evidenced by the sworn, itemized inventory statement, only one or two copies of each of the films specified in the warrant application were taken during the execution of the warrant. The terms of the. warrant commanded the police officers to enter Network Video and upon finding the <em>named </em>property, \u201cit\u201d was to be detained. In view of the detention of only one or two copies of each film named in the warrant, the executing officer understood the limitations and specificity of the warrant. <em>(See, Stanford v Texas, </em>379 US 476, 485, <em>supra; Andresen v Maryland, </em>427 US 463, 493 [Brennan, J., dissenting].) Moreover, there has been no showing that defendants were precluded, by injunction or otherwise, from offering for rental other copies of the movies or restocking their supply of said movies. As in <em>Heller v New York </em>(413 US 483, 490, <em>supra), </em>the films were not subject to any form of \u201cfinal restraint\u201d. There was no injunction against exhibition or threat of destruction. Rather, one or two copies of each film were merely detained for preservation as evidence <em>(Perial Amusement Corp. v Morse, </em>482 F2d 515, 525 [2d Cir]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The limited nature of the detention represents a bona fide attempt to strike a proper balance between the need to preserve evidence for use in criminal prosecutions and the right of the public of unobstructed access to nonobscene materials. <em>(See, Sequoia Books v McDonald, </em>725 F2d 1091, 1093-1094, <em>cert </em>denied_US _, 105 S Ct 83, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Accordingly, it is my view that the order of County Court should be reversed, the motion to suppress denied, and the case remitted to the Depew Village Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Meyer, Kaye and Alexander concur with Judge Simons; Judge Jasen dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion; Judge Titone taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"Aa_\">A-l</p>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">\u201cTABOO II\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">David J.
