Hale </em>and <em>Patrick B. Silva </em>for appellants in the first above-entitled action.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3I\">I. The court below erred when it construed the 14th Amendment prohibition against State action as both authority and a mandate for Mayors to add sexual orientation as a new protected category in our Human Rights Laws. <em>(Kilbourn v Thompson, </em>103 US 168; <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641; <em>Rapp v Carey, </em>44 NY2d 157; <em>Matter of Fullilove v Beame, </em>48 NY2d 376; <em>Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, </em>62 NY2d 422; <em>University of Cal. Regents v Bakke, </em>438 US 265; <em>State Div. of Human Rights v Kilian Mfg. Corp., </em>35 NY2d 201; <em>Youngstown Co. v Sawyer, </em>343 US 579.) II. The court below erred in holding that all who supply goods and services to a municipality are engaged in State action and thus fall within the ambit of the proscription of the 14th Amendment. <em>(Jackson v Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 US 345; <em>Lugar v Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 US 922; <em>Blum v Yaretsky, </em>457 US 991; <em>Rendell-Baker v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Kohn, </em>457 US 830; <em>Dronenburg v Zech, </em>741 F2d 1388.) III. The order and its implementing regulations clearly compromise appellants\u2019 constitutionally protected right to freely exercise their religion. <em>(Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398; <em>International Socy. v Barber, </em>650 F2d 430; <em>NLRB v Catholic Bishop of Chicago, </em>440 US 490; <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, </em>406 US 205.) IV. There is no basis in fact for the assertion by the majority in the court below that under Executive Order No. 50 a contracting agency may refuse to hire in those instances where sexual orientation or affectional preference is a bona fide occupational qualification. V. The court should reinstate the finding of Special Term that the New York City Board of Estimate has no greater authority to act in this area than the Mayor. <em>(Matter of Natilson v Hodson, </em>264 App Div 384, 289 NY 842.) VI. The decided cases have consistently rejected the theory that homosexual and bisexual preference and practice are protected either by the existing human rights acts or by the 14th Amendment. <em>(Dronenburg v Zech, </em>741 F2d 1388; <em>Doe v Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, </em>425 US 901; <em>DeSantis v Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel.

Moss, Edward P. O\u2019Keefe </em>and <em>William D. Smith </em>for appellant in the second above-entitled action.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADC\">I. The Mayor lacks authority to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of \u201csexual orientation\u201d or \u201caffectional preference\u201d. <em>(Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, </em>62 NY2d 422; <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641; <em>Rapp v Carey, </em>44 NY2d 157; <em>Matter of Fullilove v Beame, </em>48 NY2d 376; <em>Edenwald Contr. Co. v City of New York, </em>86 Misc 2d 711, 47 AD2d 610; <em>Matter of County of Oneida v Berle, </em>49 NY2d 515.) II. The United States Constitution does not give the Mayor authority to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of \u201csexual orientation\u201d or \u201caffectional preference\u201d. <em>(Katzenbach v Morgan, </em>384 US 641; <em>Ex parte Virginia, </em>100 US 339; <em>United States v Solomon, </em>419 F Supp 358, 563 F2d 1121; <em>Youngstown Co. v Sawyer, </em>343 US 579; <em>Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, </em>62 NY2d 422; <em>Doe v Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, </em>403 F Supp 1199, 425 US 901; <em>Dronenburg v Zech, </em>741 F2d 1388; <em>Rich v Secretary of Army, </em>735 F2d 1220; <em>National Gay Task Force v Board of Educ., </em>729 F2d 1270; <em>DeSantis v Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>608 F2d 327.) III. The Board of Estimate, like the Mayor, has no authority to legislate new protected classifications. <em>(Loos v City of New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>York, </em>257 App Div 219; <em>Bergerman v Lindsay, </em>25 NY2d 405, 398 US 955; <em>Hotel Dorset Co. v Trust for Cultural Resources, </em>63 AD2d 157, 46 NY2d 358; <em>BusTop Shelters v City of New York, </em>99 Misc 2d 198; <em>Matter of Natilson v Hodson, </em>264 App Div 384, 289 NY 842; <em>Matter of C.K.

The Constitution does not <em>compel </em>the Mayor to attach the \u201csexual orientation/affectional preference\u201d strings to Agudath Israel\u2019s city contract grants. <em>(Blum v Yaretsky, </em>457 US 991; <em>Chrisman v Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace, </em>506 F2d 308; <em>Taylor v St. Vincent\u2019s Hosp., </em>523 F2d 75, 424 US 948; <em>Watkins v Mercy Med.

II. The Constitution does not <em>permit </em>the Mayor to attach the \u201csexual orientation/affectional preference\u201d strings to Agudath Israel\u2019s city contract grants, <em>(Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, </em>62 NY2d 422; <em>Everson v Board of Educ., </em>330 US 1; <em>Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398; <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, </em>406 US 205; <em>Dronenburg v Zech, </em>741 F2d 1388, 746 F2d 1579; <em>Rich v Secretary of Army, </em>735 F2d 1220; <em>Grove City Coll. v Bell, 687 </em>F2d 684; <em>Bob Jones Univ. v United States, </em>461 US 574.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-5\"><em>Frederick A.

Adler </em>and <em>Paul Rephen </em>of counsel), for respondents in the first, second and third above-entitled actions.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_F\">I. Executive Order No. 50 is valid as an exercise of the Mayor\u2019s power and duty to effect compliance with the State and Federal constitutional prohibitions upon city funding of invidious private employment discrimination against homosexuals, and also as an exercise of his authority to determine the manner of conducting the business of the city by protecting it against interruptions of services rendered pursuant to contract. <em>(Matter of Kimball, </em>33 NY2d 586; <em>Norton v Macy, </em>417 F2d 1161; <em>Ashton v Civiletti, </em>613 F2d 923; <em>Better v Middendorf, </em>632 F2d 788, <em>cert denied sub nom.

II. Executive Order No. 50, to the extent here involved, is a valid exercise of the Mayor\u2019s authority to enlarge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>pool of persons eligible for discrimination-free, merit hiring. <em>(Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641; <em>Matter of Bauch v City of New York, </em>21 NY2d 599; <em>Pilot Mechanical Corp. v Carroll, </em>94 Misc 2d 437; <em>Matter of Dairymen\u2019s League Coop.

III. Executive Order No. 50 is effective as an implementation of the power of the Board of Estimate to approve contracts of the type here involved. <em>(Matter of Kay field Constr. Corp. v Morris, </em>15 AD2d 373; <em>Matter of Mathalia Motors v City of Oneida, </em>105 Misc 2d 843, 84 AD2d 637; <em>Matter of Zara Contr.

IV. Mayoral power to issue Executive Order No. 50 cannot be preempted except by Charter amendment. Nor has the City Council attempted preemption. <em>(People v Cook, </em>34 NY2d 100; <em>Council for Owner Occupied Hous. v Koch, </em>119 Misc 2d 241; <em>Matter of Ames v Smoot, </em>98 AD2d 216, 62 NY2d 804; <em>Kiernan v City of New York, </em>64 Misc 2d 617, 35 AD2d 1081; <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v Town of Red Hook, </em>60 NY2d 99; <em>Flanagan v Mount Eden Gen.

The practice and toleration of homosexuality is condemned by Jewish religious law. II. The Federal Constitution bars governmental imposition of vague oaths that encroach on constitutionally protected activities. <em>(Baggett v Bullitt, </em>377 US 360; <em>Cramp v Board of Public Instruction, </em>368 US 278.) III. A religious employer may reasonably apprehend that disapproval of homosexual practices will be classified as \u201cdiscrimination\u201d. <em>(United States v City of Buffalo, </em>457 F Supp 612, 633 F2d 643; <em>Steadman v Hundley, </em>421 F Supp 53; <em>Compston v Borden, Inc., </em>424 F Supp 157; <em>Rogers v Equal Employment Opportunity Commn., </em>454 F2d 234, 406 US 957; <em>Bundy v Jackson, </em>641 F2d 934; <em>Bridgeport Guardians v Delmonte, </em>553 F Supp 601.) IV. Religious organizations cannot constitutionally be required to surrender free exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>cise rights in order to qualify for city contracts. <em>(Speiser v Randall, </em>357 US 513; <em>Thomas v Review Bd., </em>450 US 707; <em>Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398; <em>Shapiro v Thompson, </em>394 US 618; <em>Elrod v Burns, </em>427 US 347; <em>Perry v Sindermann, </em>408 US 593.) V. Statutory exemptions for religious institutions should be broadly construed to protect religious liberty. <em>(NLRB v Catholic Bishop of Chicago, </em>440 US 490.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-4\"><em>David L. Benetar </em>and <em>Stanley Schair </em>for The New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, <em>amicus curiae.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2mB\">I. Executive Order No. 50 and the regulations promulgated thereunder represent an unlawful usurpation of the legislative function and are inconsistent with existing antidiscrimination laws which do not mandate affirmative action. <em>(Rapp v Carey, </em>44 NY2d 157; <em>Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, </em>62 NY2d 422; <em>Matter of Fullilove v Beame, </em>48 NY2d 376; <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641; <em>Dames &amp; Moore v Regan, </em>453 US 654; <em>Youngstown Co. v Sawyer, </em>343 US 579.) II. The majority in the court below erred in finding a constitutional predicate for the issuance of Executive Order No. 50. <em>(Youngstown Co. v Sawyer, </em>343 US 579; <em>Shelley v Kraemer, </em>334 US 1; <em>Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 US 3; <em>Rendell-Baker v Kohn, </em>457 US 830; <em>Lugar v Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 US 922; <em>Blum v Yaretsky, </em>457 US 991; <em>Lefcourt v Legal Aid Socy., </em>445 F2d 1150; <em>Myron v Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>752 F2d 50; <em>Matter of Wilson, </em>59 NY2d 461; <em>Ohio Contrs. Assn. v Keip, </em>713 F2d 167.) III. Executive Order No. 50\u2019s extraterritorial application to facilities and employers outside New York is unconstitutional under both the Constitutions of the United States and of the State of New York. <em>(Matter of Walston &amp; Co. v New York City Commn. on Human Rights, </em>41 AD2d 238; <em>Matter of New York Times Co. v City of New York Commn. on Human Rights, </em>41 NY2d 345; <em>Bigelow v Virginia, </em>421 US 809; <em>Hood &amp; Sons v Du Mond, </em>336 US 525; <em>White v Massachusetts Council of Constr.

McDowell </em>and <em>Lorence L. Kessler </em>for The Equal Employment Advisory Council, <em>amicus curiae.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Air\">I. The decision below improperly sanctions the imposition by an Executive Order of extensive affirmative action requirements in a manner contrary to the State and Federal Constitutions and in disregard of prior decisions of this court. <em>(Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, </em>62 NY2d 422; <em>Matter of Fullilove v Beame, </em>48 NY2d 376; <em>Rapp v Carey, </em>44 NY2d 157; <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641; <em>Youngstown Co. v Sawyer, </em>343 US 579; <em>Washington v Davis, </em>426 US 229.) II. The city and the court below improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>rely upon Federal equal protection standards to justify the imposition of requirements that are inconsistent with the standards established by this court and the New York legislative bodies. <em>(Brown v Board of Educ., </em>347 US 483; <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v Murgia, </em>427 US 307; <em>California Assn. of Physically Handicapped v Federal Communications Commn., </em>721 F2d 667; <em>Brown v Sibley, </em>650 F2d 760; <em>DeSantis v Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel.

Executive Order No. 50\u2019s bar against discrimination on the basis of sexual preference is a valid exercise of the Mayor\u2019s authority to contract. <em>(Matter of Bauch v City of New York, </em>21 NY2d 599; <em>LeCesse Bros. Contr. v Town Bd., </em>62 AD2d 28; <em>Matter of Dairymen\u2019s League Coop.

II. The enforcement mechanism of Executive Order No. 50 insofar as it pertains to discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, sex, age, disability, marital status, creed or color is not properly before this court. <em>(Wasmuth v Allen, </em>14 NY2d 391, 379 US 11.) III. Executive Order No. 50 permissibly implements legislative prohibitions against employment discrimination. (Mat<em>ter of Fullilove v Beame, </em>48 NY2d 376; <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641; <em>Norwood v Harrison, </em>413 US 455; <em>National Black Police Assn. v Velde, </em>712 F2d 569.) IV. Neither the antidiscrimination statutes nor the free exercise clause of the 1st Amendment bars the application of Executive Order No. 50 to appellants. <em>(Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398; <em>Bob Jones Univ. v United States, </em>461 US 574; <em>United States v Lee, </em>455 US 252; <em>Braunfeld v Brown, </em>366 US 599; <em>Cooper v General Dynamics, </em>533 F2d 163.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-6\"><em>Thomas B.

Executive Order No. 50 is fully grounded in well-established constitutional principles and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>is therefore constitutional. <em>(Columbus Bd. of Educ. v Penick, </em>443 US 449; <em>Plyler v Doe, </em>457 US 202; <em>Loving v Virginia, </em>388 US 1; <em>Korematsu v United States, </em>323 US 214; <em>Graham v Richardson, </em>403 US 365; <em>Gleason v Gleason, </em>26 NY2d 28; <em>Norton v Macy, </em>417 F2d 1161; <em>Van Ooteghem v Gray, </em>628 F2d 488,654 F2d 304; <em>Gay Students Org. v Bonner, </em>509 F2d 652; <em>People v Onofre, </em>51 NY2d 476, 451 US 987.) II.

Statistical data, when utilized in conjunction with an examination of employment practices and procedures, provides a legitimate basis for a prima facie finding of discrimination. <em>(Matter of CUNY-Hostos Community Coll. v State Human Rights Appeal Bd., </em>59 NY2d 69; <em>300 Gramatan Ave. Assoc. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>45 NY2d 176; <em>State Div. of Human Rights v Kilian Mfg.

We disagree and hold that because of the separation of powers delineated in the City Charter, the Mayor has no authority to initiate such a policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">On April 25, 1980, the Mayor of the City of New York issued Executive Order No. 50 \u201cto ensure compliance with the equal employment opportunity requirements of City, State and Federal law in City contracting\u201d (Executive Order No. 50 \u00a7 1). The Executive Order applies to virtually every contract with the city, and requires that those entering into such contracts agree to ensure \u201cequal employment opportunity\u201d in all of their employment decisions. \u201cEqual employment opportunity,\u201d as defined in section 3 (i) of the order, includes not discriminating on the basis of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference,\u201d terms which all parties agree refer to a person being homosexual or bisexual rather than heterosexual. The order provides that the Mayor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Services has the responsibility to implement, monitor compliance with, and enforce these equal employment requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Pursuant to this grant of authority, the Bureau of Labor Services promulgated regulations, effective January 21, 1982, which require that specific language implementing Executive Order No. 50 be inserted into contracts with the city. In the required language, a contractor agrees, among other things, not to discriminate in any employment decision on the basis of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference\u201d and to state that condition in all solicitations or advertisements for employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Agudath Israel and the Salvation Army, the plaintiffs in two of three actions consolidated on appeal, are not-for-profit religious and charitable corporations. Both have annual contracts with the city, pursuant to which they provide social services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>such as day care facilities, counseling services, and senior citizen centers, and the city pays a portion of the costs of such services. The plaintiffs in the third action (the \u201cUnder 21\u201d action) are not-for-profit corporations under the sponsorship of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, and they too provide social service programs partially funded through annual contracts with the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The plaintiffs in all three actions object on religious grounds to signing a contract in which they would agree not to discriminate on the basis of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference,\u201d and have advised the city that they will not sign any contracts which contain such a condition. The city, in turn, has notified the plaintiffs that the contracts for the services they provide will not be renewed unless plaintiffs are in full compliance with Executive Order No. 50 and the Bureau of Labor Services\u2019 regulations promulgated thereunder, including the provision for insertion of the objected-to language into all the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Faced with the expiration of their contracts, plaintiffs brought three separate actions, each seeking a declaration that the portion of Executive Order No. 50 pertaining to \u201csexual orientar tion or affectional preference\u201d is beyond the scope of the Mayor\u2019s authority, and thus void, and a permanent injunction against enforcement of this part of the order and the regulations implementing it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The plaintiffs in all three actions moved for summary judgment, and the motions were referred to the same Justice at Special Term. Special Term held that the challenged portion of Executive Order No. 50 was an impermissible usurpation of legislative power by Mayor Koch, and, in three separate judgments, declared that portion unlawful and permanently enjoined the city and the Mayor from enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The Appellate Division consolidated the three appeals by the defendants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in a split decision, disagreed with Special Term\u2019s conclusion that the Mayor had exceeded his authority insofar as Executive Order No. 50 related to \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference\u201d. Rejecting the separation of powers concerns expressed by Special Term and the dissenting Justice at the Appellate Division, the majority at the Appellate Division characterized those principles as \u201cvestigial relics * * * relied upon for State court holdings in fewer and fewer desultory cases\u201d, and concluded that the Mayor \u201cdid no more than make express the policies and principles [of equal protection] already firmly embedded in our State and Federal Constitutions.\u201d (108 AD2d, at pp 258-259.) Upon \u201csearch of the record,\u201d the Appellate Division granted defendants summary judgment declaring Executive Order No. 50 and the regulations promulgated thereunder constitutional and valid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Mayor lacked the authority to proscribe discrimination by city contractors on the basis of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference\u201d is a facial attack on this portion of Executive Order No. 50, and our resolution of the case does not depend on the status of the plaintiffs as religious organizations. Nor do we decide today the extent to which New York City may regulate the employment practices of those with whom it does business. Rather, the sole issue we address is the extent of the authority in this area of the chief executive officer of the city, the Mayor, and specifically, whether the executive may forbid discrimination by city contractors on a ground not covered by any legislative enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">One of the fundamental principles of government underlying our Federal Constitution is the distribution of governmental power into three branches \u2014 the executive, legislative and judicial \u2014 to prevent too strong a concentration of authority in one person or body <em>(see, Youngstown Co. v Sawyer, </em>343 US 579; <em>id., </em>at pp 634, 635 [Jackson, J., concurring]; 1 Story, Commentaries on the Constitution \u00a7 525 [5th ed]). We have consistently recognized that this principle of separation of powers among the three branches is included by implication in the pattern of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>government adopted by the State of New York <em>(see, e.g., Matter of LaGuardia v Smith, </em>288 NY 1, 5-6; <em>Matter of County of Oneida v Berle, </em>49 NY2d 515, 522), and, contrary to the Appellate Division\u2019s characterization of the doctrine as a \u201cvestigial relic,\u201d we have very recently unanimously reaffirmed its continuing vitality <em>(see, Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, </em>62 NY2d 422, 427). While the doctrine of separation of powers does not require the maintenance of \u201c\u2018three airtight departments of government\u2019 \u201d <em>(Nixon v Administrator of Gen. Servs., </em>433 US 425, 443; 1 Story, Commentaries on the Constitution \u00a7 525, <em>supra), </em>it does require that no one branch be allowed to arrogate unto itself powers residing entirely in another branch <em>(Youngstown Co. o Sawyer, supra; Matter of Nicholas v Kahn, </em>47 NY2d 24, 30-31).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Of course, the pattern of government established for New York City by the City Charter is not identical to that of the United States or the State of New York. Still, the City Charter does provide for distinct legislative and executive branches: the City Council \u201cshall be vested with the legislative power of the city, and shall be the local legislative body of the city\u201d (New York City Charter, ch 2, \u00a7 21), while the Mayor \u201cshall be the chief executive officer of the city\u201d <em>(id., </em>ch 1, \u00a7 3). Thus, our prior decisions have held that, no matter how well-intentioned his actions may be, the Mayor may not unlawfully infringe upon the legislative powers reserved to the City Council <em>(see, Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, supra; Matter of Fullilove o Beame, </em>48 NY2d 376; <em>Matter of Broidrick o Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The authority conferred upon the Mayor, as chief executive officer, does, of course, include the power to enforce and implement legislative enactments <em>(Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, </em>62 NY2d, at p 427, <em>supra). </em>Indeed, if the City Council were to enact valid legislation proscribing discrimination by city contractors, or employers within the city generally, on the basis of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference,\u201d the Mayor would have the duty to enforce it. The City Council, however, has never enacted any such law despite the introduction of bills which would have done so. The New York City Human Rights Act, in defining the types of \u201cunlawful discriminatory practices\u201d which an employer may not engage in, contains no reference to \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference,\u201d or to any similar classifications (Administrative Code of City of New York \u00a7 Bl-7.0). Similarly, Administrative Code \u00a7 343-8.0, which restricts discriminatory employment practices by many city contractors, contains no such classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The relevant provisions of State law are closely akin to those of the city. The State Human Rights Law, which covers employment discrimination (Executive Law \u00a7 296), does not include among the protected classifications anything analogous to \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference,\u201d nor does Labor Law \u00a7 220-e, which mandates the inclusion of an antidiscrimination provision in most State and municipal contracts, encompass any such category. Finally, there is no Federal statute which the Mayor might be implementing. Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (42 USC \u00a7 2000e), the employment discrimination provision of Federal civil rights legislation, does not include homosexuals or bisexuals among the protected classes of employees <em>(see, e.g., DeSantis v Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>608 F2d 327; <em>Blum v Gulf Oil Corp., </em>597 F2d 936).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The issue we face, therefore, is whether the Mayor, in including within the coverage of Executive Order No. 50 \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference,\u201d despite the fact there is no legislative enactment prohibiting employment discrimination on such a basis, acted within the scope of his authority as the chief executive officer of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Defendants contend that the Mayor\u2019s authority to promulgate the challenged portion of Executive Order No. 50 stems from two aspects of his functions as executive \u2014 the power to regulate the terms of city contracts, and the power or duty to prevent the city from engaging in or funding discriminatory conduct which violates the equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. We address each of these arguments in turn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Under section 8 (a) of the City Charter, the Mayor has all of the residual powers of the city. Thus, in <em>Matter of Bauch v City of New York </em>(21 NY2d 599, 605), we noted that the Mayor had the authority to enter into contracts on the city\u2019s behalf and to determine the manner of transacting its business and affairs. Defendants contend that this power to regulate the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>city contracts gives the Mayor the authority to forbid parties who contract with the city from discriminating on the basis of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay </em>(39 NY2d 641, <em>supra) </em>and <em>Matter of Fullilove v Beame </em>(48 NY2d 376, <em>supra), </em>we held that attempts by the Mayor of New York City to mandate some type of affirmative action in employment decisions by city contractors were impermissible infringements upon the legislative power because they utilized a remedial device which, rather than implementing a legislative policy, enacted a new policy not embraced by the City Council. Defendants rely on language in <em>Broidrick and. Fullilove </em>approving executive action which \u201c \u2018only would enlarge the pool of persons eligible for employment based on discrimination-free merit selection\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Fullilove v Beame, </em>48 NY2d, at p 379, <em>supra; Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d, at p 649, <em>supra). </em>This statement, however, was not intended to authorize the executive to enact his own views of what persons should be protected from employment discrimination without regard to the laws enacted by the Legislature. Rather, approval of enlarging the pool of employees was in reference to an executive implementing appropriate remedial relief to enforce a legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Two other decisions from this court further explicate this distinction. In <em>Rapp v Carey </em>(44 NY2d 157), we invalidated a Governor\u2019s Executive Order requiring a broad range of State employees within the executive branch, including many not subject to removal by the Governor, to file financial disclosure statements and to abstain from various political and business activities not otherwise prohibited. We held that the order in question went beyond the powers of the Governor, including the power to implement legislation, and unlawfully \u201cassume[d] the power of the Legislature to set State policy in an area of concededly increasing public concern\u201d <em>(id., </em>44 NY2d, at p 160). Most recently, in <em>Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch (supra), </em>we held that the Mayor of New York City did not have the authority to mandate that at least 10% of all construction contracts awarded by the city be given to \u201clocally based enterprises,\u201d as such an order went beyond the Mayor\u2019s \u201cfunction of implementing general Charter-conferred powers\u201d <em>{id., </em>62 NY2d, at p 429). Of particular relevance here is our recognition in <em>Subcontractors </em>that \u201cthe general power to enter into contracts which is bestowed upon the executive branch of government ordinarily cannot serve as a basis for creating a remedial plan for which the executive never received a grant of legislative power\u201d <em>{id., </em>at p 428).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Thus, as Special Term recognized, our prior cases hold that an executive may not usurp the legislative function by enacting social policies not adopted by the Legislature. Private employers in this State are free to make employment decisions on whatever basis they choose, as long as the basis is not prohibited by law <em>(cf. O\u2019Connor v Eastman Kodak, </em>65 NY2d 724; <em>Murphy v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 NY2d 293). Congress, the State Legislature and the City Council have enacted laws restricting the bases upon which most private employers may discriminate. None of these legislative bodies, however, has chosen to include a person\u2019s \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference\u201d among the proscribed bases, nor have they established any general requirement that employment decisions must be merit-based. An attempt by the Mayor to broaden the class of persons protected from discrimination by private employers, or to require that all employment decisions be merit-based, however commendable, is an enactment of policy which the City Charter leaves to the City Council.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the challenged portion of Executive Order No. 50 does not fall within the Mayor\u2019s Charter-conferred power to regulate the terms of city contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The second basis put forth by the defendants for upholding the validity of the portion of Executive Order No. 50 covering \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference\u201d is that the Mayor is properly acting to ensure compliance with constitutional guarantees of equal protection. The Appellate Division majority accepted this argument, concluding that the Mayor has the constitutional obligation, stemming from the equal protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions, to prevent all organizations contracting with the city from engaging in invidious discriminatory employment practices, which would include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in part that \u201cNo State shall * * * deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This provision extends, of course, to subdivisions of a State, such as New York City (see, <em>e.g., Hunter v Erickson, </em>393 US 385). Plaintiffs contend, however, that the Mayor is attempting to \u201cenforce\u201d the equal protection requirements of the 14th Amendment in a manner which is reserved to Congress. Section 5 of the 14th Amendment states that \u201cCongress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this [Amendment].\u201d The significance of this section is that it gives to Congress some authority to effectively enlarge the substantive reach of the equal protection clause by enacting laws prohibiting certain action even though such action would not otherwise be found by the judiciary to violate equal protection <em>(see, Katzenbach v Morgan, </em>384 US 641; <em>United States v Guest, </em>383 US 745, 774 [Brennan, J., concurring]; Tribe, American Constitutional Law, at 28-29, 265-267; <em>cf. City of Rome v United States, </em>446 US 156 [enforcement of 15th Amend]).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Although the Mayor does have a responsibility to uphold the United States Constitution, and a duty to prevent actions by the city which would violate the 14th Amendment\u2019s requirement of equal protection, as interpreted by the judiciary, he does not have the power to expand the coverage of the equal protection clause. The Mayor, unlike Congress, has no authority to prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>discrimination merely because he feels that the prohibition furthers the goals of the 14th Amendment. His duty extends only to the prohibition of such discrimination if it in fact violates that provision. Accordingly, the Mayor\u2019s inclusion of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference\u201d in Executive Order No. 50 can be upheld under the 14th Amendment only if either discrimination on this basis by city contractors would violate the equal protection clause, or if the city would be violating the clause by contracting with those who so discriminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The prohibitions in the 14th Amendment are directed at the \u201cState,\u201d and they \u201c \u2018erect no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful\u2019 \u201d <em>(Blum v Yaretsky, </em>457 US 991,1002, quoting <em>Shelley v Kraemer, </em>334 US 1,13; <em>see, Jackson v Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 US 345, 349). In order for a court to conclude that there is \u201cState action,\u201d thus making equal protection requirements applicable, the alleged discriminatory conduct of a private employer must be \u201cfairly attributable to the State\u201d <em>(Lugar v Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 US 922, 937; <em>see, Matter of Wilson, </em>59 NY2d 461, 476).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The Supreme Court has yet to formulate a single test which can be employed to determine whether there is the requisite degree of State involvement <em>(see, Reitman v Mulkey, </em>387 US 369, 378), and all the facts and circumstances of a particular case must be considered <em>(Burton v Wilmington Parking Auth., </em>365 US 715, 722). It is clear, however, that the mere fact that a private entity contracts with the government <em>(see, e.g., Blum v Yaretsky, supra), </em>is regulated by the government <em>(see, e.g., Jackson v Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 US 345, <em>supra), </em>or performs a function also performed by the government <em>(see, e.g., Rendell-Baker v Kohn, </em>457 US 830), is not enough by itself to treat it as a State actor. Rather, there must be some basis for finding that the State is \u201cresponsible\u201d for the private conduct <em>(Blum v Yaretsky, </em>457 US, at p 1004, <em>supra), </em>either because it maintains such a close relationship with the private actor that it can be viewed as a joint participant in all decisions of the latter <em>(see, Burton v Wilmington Parking Auth., </em>365 US 715, <em>supra), </em>because it allows the private actor to perform a function traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State <em>(see, e.g., Evans v Newton, </em>382 US 296), or because it requires or otherwise encourages the challenged conduct of the private actor <em>(see, e.g., Peterson v City of Greenville, </em>373 US 244).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">There are no facts or circumstances pointed to by defendants or otherwise apparent which could make the city responsible for the employment decisions of the plaintiffs or of city contractors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>generally. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rendell Baker v Kohn (supra), </em>virtually compels the conclusion that their conduct is not attributable to the city and thus cannot be said to violate the 14th Amendment. In <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>the entity in question was a privately operated high school in Massachusetts for maladjusted students. Virtually all of the school\u2019s students were referred to it by city school committees and the State, and pursuant to contracts with these governmental entities, the school received funding which paid for most of the costs of educating these students. In an action brought by a discharged employee against the school, the Supreme Court held that the school\u2019s personnel decisions were not State action, even though it received public funds, its business consisted almost exclusively of performing public contracts, and it performed a \u201cpublic function,\u201d where the government did not influence or coerce those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Thus, Executive Order No. 50, in prohibiting discrimination by city contractors on the basis of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference,\u201d is not prohibiting conduct covered by the 14th Amendment. The defendants contend, however, that even if the employment decisions of organizations contracting with the city are not State action, the city itself would be in violation of the 14th Amendment if it contracts with an entity which discriminates on the basis of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference,\u201d and the Mayor, therefore, is fulfilling his duty to prevent this violation. This contention is superficially appealing, but cannot withstand closer analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Neither this court nor the Supreme Court has ever held that the government may have no contacts with a private entity which discriminates or otherwise acts in a manner in which the government itself could not. Furthermore, while there is a distinction between seeking to hold a private actor responsible under the 14th Amendment for discriminatory conduct and seeking to enjoin governmental involvement with that actor <em>(Blum v Yaretsky, </em>457 US, at pp 1003-1004, <em>supra; </em>Note, <em>State Action: Theories For Applying Constitutional Restrictions To Private Activity, </em>74 Colum L Rev 656, 698-699), the considerations of State action applicable to the former are also relevant to the latter <em>(Blum v Yaretsky, </em>457 US, at p 1004, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Defendants rely heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Norwood v Harrison </em>(413 US 455), in which the court enjoined the State of Mississippi from lending textbooks to private schools with racially discriminatory admissions policies. The court concluded that, although the textbook lending program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>had not been implemented in order to further racial segregation, as it applied to all private schools and had begun prior to the desegregation of the public schools, the State was granting \u201ctangible financial aid [which] has a significant tendency to facilitate, reinforce, and support private discrimination\u201d <em>{id., </em>413 US, at p 466).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">There are several crucial distinctions between <em>Norwood </em>and this case. To begin, the Supreme Court found that the State\u2019s action in <em>Norwood </em>was effectively promoting the discrimination by the private actors <em>(see, Gilmore v City of Montgomery, </em>417 US 556, 568-569). In contrast, there is no evidence that the city, by contracting for goods or services with a private organization, would be promoting any discriminatory acts by that organization (c<em>f. </em>Novack, Rotunda &amp; Young, Constitutional Law, at 520 [2d ed]). Additionally, while the State in <em>Norwood </em>was gratuitously providing aid to the private entities, the city, in entering into contracts, is purchasing items it requires or fulfilling obligations it has, thus further negating any assertion that it is promoting the discriminatory acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Perhaps the most significant distinction between <em>Norwood </em>and this case is that the former involved governmental entanglement in racial discrimination. The Supreme Court has consistently recognized that the central purpose underlying the equal protection clause was to prevent governmental conduct discriminating on the basis of race, and that any such discrimination is subject to the most exacting scrutiny <em>(see, e.g., Palmore v Sidoti, </em>466 US 429, 104 S Ct 1879, 1881-1882; <em>Washington v Davis, </em>426 US 229, 239). Consequently, it has become apparent that where racial discrimination by a private actor is involved, a lesser degree of State involvement than would otherwise be required will support a finding of \u201cState action\u201d <em>(see, Adickes v Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 US 144, 190-191 [Brennan, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part]; <em>Taylor v Consolidated Edison Co., </em>552 F2d 39, 42, <em>cert denied </em>434 US 845; Note, <em>State Action: Theories For Applying Constitutional Restrictions To Private Activity, </em>74 Colum L Rev 656, 657-658, 661). More generally, government has been permitted fewer contacts with private actors engaged in racial discrimination than with those otherwise acting in a manner which the government itself could not <em>(see, e.g., Granfield v Catholic Univ., </em>530 F2d 1035, 1046, n 29, <em>cert denied </em>429 US 821; <em>compare, e.g., </em>title VI of the Civil Rights Act, 42 USC \u00a7 2000d [prohibiting racial discrimination in any activity or program receiving Federal financial assistance, without exception], <em>with </em>title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>USC \u00a7 1681 <em>et seq. </em>[prohibiting sex discrimination in any educational program or activity receiving this assistance, but with several exemptions]; <em>Norwood v Harrison, supra, with Board of Educ. v Allen, </em>392 US 236).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Courts have uniformly refused to apply the same level of scrutiny applied to racial classifications in determining equal protection challenges to classifications based on sexual orientation <em>(see, e.g., Rich v Secretary of Army, </em>735 F2d 1220, 1229; <em>Hatheway v Secretary of Army, </em>641 F2d 1376, 1382, <em>cert denied </em>454 US 864; <em>DeSantis v Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>608 F2d, at p 332, <em>supra). </em>We need not decide now whether some level of \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d would be applied to governmental discrimination based on sexual orientation <em>(see, Hatheway v Secretary of Army, </em>641 F2d, at p 1382, <em>supra; </em>Note, <em>An Argument for the Application of Equal Protection Heightened Scrutiny to Classifications Based on Homosexuality, </em>57 S Cal L Rev 797, 810-834; Note, <em>Challenging Sexual Preference Discrimination in Private Employment, </em>41 Ohio St U 501, 513-514). Rather, we conclude only that the equal protection clause does not ordinarily prevent the city from contracting with private employers who discriminate on this basis, as the existence of the contract would not, by itself, make the city \u201cresponsible\u201d for the private employment decisions so as to invoke constitutional protections <em>(see, Blum v Yaretsky, </em>457 US, at p 1004, <em>supra). </em>Thus, we reject defendants\u2019 contention that the prohibition in Executive Order No. 50 against discrimination by city contractors on the basis of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference\u201d is necessary to prevent the city from aiding or engaging in a violation of the 14th Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">As we have found that the Mayor lacked any authority to promulgate the challenged portion of Executive Order No. 50, we hold that this portion was an unlawful usurpation of the legislative power of the City Council. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified by reinstating the orders and judgments at Special Term.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\">. The plaintiffs in the <em>Under 21 </em>action included in their complaint a similar facial challenge to all of Executive Order No. 50 as well as a challenge to all of Executive Order No. 50, as applied to religious or religiously sponsored corporations. We reject the argument that the Mayor may not enforce existing State and city laws prohibiting employment discrimination through the establishment of an additional \u201cenforcement mechanism\u201d (the Mayor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Services), and thus decline to hold all of Executive Order No. 50 invalid on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">As to the second additional challenge, we cannot on the record before us determine the extent to which 1st Amendment and 14th Amendment concerns would be implicated by enforcement of the various aspects of the order on the <em>Under 21 </em>plaintiffs, and we thus decline to issue an advisory opinion on whether the Mayor may regulate the employment practices of a religious corporation contracting with the city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">. Plaintiffs in the <em>Under 21 </em>action cross-appealed from the judgment at Special Term insofar as it did not invalidate all of Executive Order No. 50 (see, n 1, <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">. The Appellate Division order \u201cmodifies\u201d the Special Term judgments as it affirms the judgment in the <em>Under 21 </em>action insofar as it did not invalidate all of Executive Order No. 50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\">. At Special Term, defendants asserted as a third basis for validating all of Executive Order No. 50 an alleged \u201cratification\u201d through a resolution of the New York City Board of Estimate. Defendants have since abandoned any reliance on the Board of Estimate\u2019s actions in attempting to uphold the order, and none of the complaints in the actions before us seeks to invalidate any Board of Estimate resolutions. Thus, the issue of whether the Board of Estimate may require that all contracts submitted to it for approval must prohibit discrimination by the contractor on the ground of \u201csexual orientation or affectional preference\u201d is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">. We reject the dissent\u2019s argument that the challenged portion of Executive Order No. 50, by restricting non-merit-based discrimination, is permissible as an attempt by the Mayor \u201cto ensure that the city receive the greatest value for the lowest possible cost\u201d (dissenting opn, at p 367). To begin, as the most apparent consequence of the enforcement of this part of the order would be a <em>reduction </em>in the number of entities willing to contract with the city, it is unclear how the city would economically benefit from such enforcement. If a city agency feels that the price of a particular contract is too high due to a contractor\u2019s employment policies, it is of course free to choose some other contractor. More significantly the dissent itself concedes that Executive Order No. 50 is an enactment of social policy, notwithstanding the economic arguments now set forth by defendants, and thus is akin to the remedial plan in <em>Subcontractors </em>which we unanimously held invalid. The Federal cases cited by the dissent in support of this argument (dissenting opn, at p 368) are distinguishable, as those courts were construing a specific grant of authority to the executive by Congress. Any dictum in those cases that the president has the authority to regulate the employment practices of government contractors even absent authorization by Congress was rejected by a more recent Federal case <em>(see, Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v Friedman, </em>639 F2d 164, 167-172, n 13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">. We have held that the State constitutional equal protection clause (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 11) is no broader in coverage than the Federal provision <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Esler v Walters, </em>56 NY2d 306, 313-314) and this equation with the Federal provision extends to the requirement of \u201cState action\u201d in order for the equal protection clause to be applicable <em>(Dorsey v Stuyvesant Town Corp., </em>299 NY 512, 530-531, <em>cert denied </em>339 US 981). In <em>Dorsey, </em>we recognized that the State provision approved at the Constitutional Convention of 1938 and adopted by the electorate that same year, was designed simply to \u201c \u2018embodty] in our Constitution the provisions of the Federal Constitution which are already binding upon our State and its agencies\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 530 [quoting from 2 Rev Record of NY State Constitutional Convention, 1938, at 1065]). The dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>Sharrock v Dell Buick-Cadillac </em>(45 NY2d 152) is misplaced, as that case concerned the interpretation of the due process clause in the State Constitution (art I, \u00a7 6), a provision enacted prior to, and containing language materially different from, its counterpart in the 14th Amendment, and thus readily supporting a broader interpretation than the Federal provision. Accordingly, we need only analyze the equal protection issue under the framework of the 14th Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b414-7\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZT\">(dissenting). In concluding that the Mayor of New York City is not empowered by Constitution, Federal or State, or statute to bar those contracting with the city from discriminating in employment on a basis unrelated to bona fide occupational qualification, the majority ignores the difference between hiring quotas affirmatively imposed and a negative ban on arbitrary discrimination, and drastically extends this court\u2019s prior decisions concerning the Mayor\u2019s power with respect to city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>contracts <em>(Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch, </em>62 NY2d 422; <em>Matter of Fullilove v Beame, </em>48 NY2d 376; <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay, </em>39 NY2d 641). I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The conclusion that neither Constitution authorizes the Mayor to limit contracts with the city to entities that do not engage in arbitrary discrimination turns on the concept that the programs contracted for do not involve \u201cState action.\u201d There are a number of problems with that conclusion, however. First, plaintiffs\u2019 challenge is to the facial validity of Executive Order No. 50 insofar as it affects all city contractors. Such contracts cover a broad range of mandated and discretionary services; as to the present plaintiffs alone, from counseling to senior citizen centers to foster care and adoption services. Foster care institutions of the same type as are involved here have, in fact, been found to be engaged in \u201cState action\u201d subject to the requirements of the Federal equal protection clause <em>(Perez v Sugarman, </em>499 F2d 761), and in light of the total control over a child\u2019s life that the city delegates to such institutions (as I have more fully outlined in <em>Torres v Little Flower Children\u2019s Servs., </em>64 NY2d 119, 130-132), the question whether their action is \u201cState action\u201d is not governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rendell-Baker v Kohn </em>(457 US 830) regarding a private day school, which the majority deems controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Second, whether a different standard of State action should apply under the equal protection clause of the State Constitution (art I, \u00a7 11) than the test applied under the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution is not as simple as footnote 6 in the majority opinion would make it appear. While we held in 1949 that the same standard would apply <em>(Dorsey v Stuyvesant Town Corp., </em>299 NY 512, 530-531, <em>cert denied </em>339 US 981), we have not had occasion to consider the question since then<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it should be reexamined in light of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Sharrock v Dell Buick-Cadillac </em>(45 NY2d 152).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">We held in <em>Sharrock </em>that a lesser degree of State involvement was required to trigger the due process clause of the State Constitution (art I, \u00a7 6) than would be required under the 14th Amendment (45 NY2d, at pp 159-161). That holding was based in part on the absence of any reference to State action in the text of the State constitutional provision <em>{id., </em>at p 160). There is a similar absence of any explicit State action requirement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>State equal protection clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, because a long line of authority holds that the protection of a due process clause contains within it the requirement of equal protection <em>(Examining Bd. v Flores de Otero, </em>426 US 572, 601; <em>Weinberger v Wiesenfeld, </em>420 US 636, 638, n 2; <em>Frontiero v Richardson, </em>411 US 677, 680, n 5; <em>Shapiro v Thompson, </em>394 US 618, 641-642; <em>Schneider v Rusk, </em>377 US 163, 168; <em>Bolling v Sharpe, </em>347 US 497, 499), it makes little sense to have differing standards for State action under the State equal protection clause and the State due process clause. Yet, by accepting plaintiffs\u2019 facial challenge to Executive Order No. 50, the court rejects any attempt to apply the State equal protection clause to particular city contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">If, however, it be accepted that neither constitutional provision is controlling, there remains the question whether the Mayor can adopt the policy that the city not contract with those who refuse to agree that they will not discriminate arbitrarily in employment decisions. As the court below makes clear, there can be no question that across-the-board discrimination against homosexuals, unrelated to any bona fide qualification for a particular position, is invidious and irrational. Nor is there any question that Executive Order No. 50 permits a contractor to discriminate as to any of the prohibited categories (race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or affectional preference) if it can be shown to be legitimately related to the requirement of a particular job. Thus, Executive Order No. 50, by barring discrimination against candidates meriting employment for reasons irrational because unrelated to qualification for employment, does no more than enforce merit selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay </em>(39 NY2d 641, <em>supra), </em>we explicitly recognized the Mayor\u2019s right to require selection on the basis of merit. There we struck down an Executive Order mandating affirmative action but were careful to note that, \u201cInsofar as programs do not mandate percentage employment formulas, but only would enlarge the pool of persons eligible for employment based on discrimination-free merit selection, they are permissible under existing law\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 649). Yet, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>majority now rejects that view and reaches the remarkable conclusion that the Mayor has no power to require city contractors to make employment decisions on the basis of merit and fitness for the job. In other words, the Mayor cannot, by removing barriers to employment unrelated to qualification or merit, ensure that the city obtains the best possible services for the money it spends, because that policy has not been authorized or endorsed by appropriate legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In fact, the Mayor \u201cis empowered to enter into contracts * * * and to determine the manner of transacting the city\u2019s business and affairs\u201d <em>(Matter of Bauch v City of New York, </em>21 NY2d 599, 605). In exercising that power, the Mayor\u2019s obligation is to ensure that the city receive the greatest value for the lowest possible cost <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Dairymen\u2019s League Coop. Assn. v Murtagh, </em>274 App Div 591, 594-595, <em>affd </em>299 NY 634). Thus, in <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay </em>(39 NY2d 641, 648, <em>supra), </em>the court held that \u201ccost minimization is a proper consideration in setting government procurement policy,\u201d thereby explicitly recognizing the validity of the social policy embodied in Executive Order No. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The majority holds, however, that notwithstanding the recognition in <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay (supra), </em>and <em>Matter of Fullilove v Beame </em>(48 NY2d 376, 379, <em>supra) </em>of the Mayor\u2019s power to require discrimination-free merit selection, he is permitted to ban particular kinds of discrimination by city contractors only if the State Legislature or City Council has either itself already done so or expressly authorized him to do so. But one searches in vain for any language in these cases, or in the other cases cited by the majority, that limits the Mayor\u2019s power in this manner. <em>Rapp v Carey </em>(44 NY2d 157) invalidated an Executive Order issued by the Governor because it was not only unauthorized by any statute or constitutional provision, but was actually inconsistent with existing legislation <em>(id., </em>at pp 164-165). And the defect in the Executive Order in <em>Subcontractors Trade Assn. v Koch </em>(62 NY2d 422, 429, <em>supra) </em>was that it imposed an affirmative, remedial plan which required that \u201ca certain percentage of city construction contracts * * * be allotted to a particular group or category of business enterprise\u201d. Here, no affirmative action is mandated. There is only a ban on arbitrary discrimination, designed to implement the accepted social policy that the city should seek to get the most for its money.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Finally, in light of the majority\u2019s reliance on separation of powers cases involving the Federal Constitution, it should be noted that a number of Federal courts have upheld presidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Executive Orders barring discrimination in Federally funded projects on the ground that \u201cthe federal government has a vital interest in assuring that the largest possible pool of qualified manpower be available for the accomplishment of its projects\u201d <em>(Contractors Assn. v Secretary of Labor, </em>442 F2d 159, 171, <em>cert denied </em>404 US 854; <em>accord, United States v New Orleans Public Serv., </em>553 F2d 459, 465, <em>vacated on other grounds </em>436 US 942, <em>adhered to </em>638 F2d 899, <em>cert denied </em>454 US 892; <em>Farkas v Texas Instrument, </em>375 F2d 629, 632, n 1). Those decisions were favorably commented on in <em>Matter of Broidrick v Lindsay </em>(39 NY2d 641, 647-648, <em>supra), </em>although they were distinguished on the ground that the Executive Order there in issue applied to the private projects of city contractors as well as their city-funded work and, thus, was intended to promote a social policy far beyond cost minimization in the expenditure of public funds. In the present case, Executive Order No. 50 applies only to contracts that are funded in whole or in part by government moneys appropriated or controlled by the city.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is carefully tailored to the policy of obtaining the best possible work effort from city contractors through a ban on arbitrary employment discrimination and is permissible under the prior decisions of this court. By reversing in this case, the majority adopts a new separation of powers principle that is inconsistent with both its own prior decisions and Federal case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Judges Jasen, Simons, Kaye, Alexander and Titone concur with Chief Judge Wachtler; Judge Meyer dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Order modified, with costs to appellants, in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\">. <em>Matter of Ester v Walters </em>(56 NY2d 306), cited by the majority, dealt with the substantive scope of the protection against discrimination provided by the State Constitution, not with what constitutes State action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\">.

Despite claims by some of the plaintiffs that the Executive Order and its implementing regulations apply to all work, public or private, by city contractors, the scope of the coverage is explained by the following statement from the Director of the City Bureau of Labor Services: \u201cIt is true that section 50.20(A) of the Regulations makes the non-discrimination requirement applicable to \u2018[a]ll contractors doing business with the City without regard to the dollar amount or source of funding.\u2019 However, the phrase \u2018without regard to the dollar amount or source of funding\u2019 was inserted not to expand the nondiscrimination requirement so as to cover programs wholly unrelated to City contract work but rather to clarify that the non-discrimination requirement is fully applicable to programs that the City funds only in part as well as to programs that the City contracts for but does not fund <em>(e.g., </em>City contracts using federal funds). The reference in section 50.20(B) to \u2018[Contractors whose contracts are funded in whole or in part by federal or state funds\u2019 likewise refers to contracts administered by and formally let by the City.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
