Cook </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av_\">I. For purposes of article 28, a joint venture is not separate and distinct from the joint venturers, where the stated intent of the two joint venturers is to provide equipment in the same proportion as their interests in the joint venture and where the two joint venturers in fact provided equipment in the same proportion as their interests in the joint venture. <em>(Ruzicka v Rager, </em>305 NY 191; <em>Caplan v Caplan, </em>268 NY 445; <em>Bathrick Enters. v Murphy, </em>27 AD2d 215, 23 NY2d 664; <em>Matter of Petrolane Northeast Gas Serv. v State Tax Commn., </em>79 AD2d 1043, 53 NY2d 601.) II. Since neither title nor exclusive possession of the equipment passed to the joint venture, and since there was never any definite determination as to the amount of rent to be paid, there cannot be an assessment of sales and use tax for the \u201crentals\u201d. <em>(Feder v Caliguira, </em>8 NY2d 400; <em>American Locker Co. v City of New York, </em>308 NY 264; <em>Matter of Concrete Delivery v State Tax Commn.; </em>71 AD2d 330, 49 NY2d 709; <em>Bathrick Enters, v Murphy, </em>27 AD2d 215; <em>Dubay v Trans-America Ins. Co., </em>75 AD2d 312.) III. The word \u201crental\u201d has a unique meaning within the dredging and marine construction industry. Subjecting petitioner to sales and use tax on \u201crentals\u201d is improper in light of the practice of the industry, the joint venture agreement, and the fact that petitioner would not have been taxed if it had not called the payments \u201crentals\u201d. <em>(Matter of Young v Gerosa, </em>11 AD2d 67; <em>Matter of Purdy v Kreisberg, </em>47 NY2d 354.) IV. In fairness and equity, the transactions in this case should not be taxable. <em>(Matter of Holmes Elec. Protective Co. v McGoldrick, </em>262 App Div 514, 288 NY 635.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b390-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">There is substantial evidence in the record of the proceedings before the State Tax Commission to support the Commission\u2019s determination that designated \u201crental\u201d and \u201clease\u201d payments made by petitioner Great Lakes-Dunbar-Rochester, a joint venture, to the corporate venturers were, in fact, for rentals of vessels and equipment and, thus, subject to the use tax imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>by Tax Law \u00a7 1110. Therefore we reverse the order of the Appellate Division and reinstate the Commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. and Dunbar &amp; Sullivan Dredging Co. formed a joint venture in 1969 to bid on and, if successful, execute a contract to construct a sewer outfall in Lake Ontario for the City of Rochester. The joint venture agreement specifically limited the relationship to the Rochester construction project and required each party to furnish equipment and supervisory personnel to the project in the same proportion, insofar as reasonably possible, as its interest in the joint venture. The parties\u2019 interests in the joint venture were allocated 66% to Great Lakes and 33% to Dunbar. Supervisory personnel and heavy equipment, consisting of marine vessels such as tugs and scows together with clamshells and cranes mounted thereon, were assigned to the project. Each corporate venturer was to be reimbursed from time to time for equipment, tools and/or machinery it furnished for use in the performance of the project at \u201crental\u201d rates set forth in the agreement. These reimbursement payments were characterized in the agreement as \u201crents\u201d and invoiced as such between the joint venture and the corporate venturers. No sales or use taxes were paid on these \u201crental payments\u201d, however. Following an audit conducted by respondent in 1974, a determination was made that over $300,000, plus penalties and interest, was due as use tax on these rentals .and on the purchase of certain parts and supplies charged to the vessels. Petitioner was partially successful in having some of the items on which the tax had been assessed eliminated, but the assessment of use tax due on the amounts that the corporate venturers were reimbursed for the equipment assigned to the project (the \u201crentals\u201d) was sustained by the Commission. An article 78 proceeding, transferred directly to the Appellate Division pursuant to CPLR 7804 (g), ensued. A divided court found that there was no substantial evidence supporting respondent\u2019s conclusion that a lease of personal property took place between the parties, and therefore that there was no rational basis for respondent\u2019s assessment of the tax. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In assessing a use tax on the reimbursement payments, the Tax Commission has treated the joint venture as a partnership, having an existence and entity separate and apart from the partners who comprise it, a treatment found by the majority at the Appellate Division to be contrary to \u201cbasic, established law\u201d (102 AD2d, p 4). However, as pointed out by the dissenting Justice <em>(id,., </em>pp 6-7), this treatment is consistent with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>accorded the relationship by the parties themselves, both in their written agreement and in their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Although terms of the agreement and the conduct of the parties are not determinative, support for the Commission\u2019s view that the partnership is an entity separate and apart from its constituent partners can be found in the Tax Law itself, which specifically defines a \u201cperson\u201d to include a partnership, association or combination of individuals or corporations (Tax Law \u00a7 1101 [a]). Ordinarily, partnerships and joint ventures are not considered persons (General Construction Law \u00a7 37). The inclusion of partnerships in the Tax Law definition of \u201cperson\u201d, therefore, supports the conclusion that the Legislature intended to treat partnerships differently for tax purposes. Further support for this conclusion derives from the fact that the Legislature has only excluded select transactions from the definition of \u201cretail sale\u201d, such as, \u201cdistribution[s] of property by a partnership to its partners in whole or partial liquidation\u201d and \u201ccontribution[s] of property to a partnership in consideration for a partnership interest therein\u201d (Tax Law \u00a7 1101 [b] [4] [iii] [C], [E]). This selective exclusion evinces an intent by the Legislature to tax at least some transactions between partnerships and their members.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Similar treatment of such transactions is found in other tax statutes and regulations. For example, the Department of Taxation and Finance has provided that partnership contributions and liquidating distributions \u201care excluded from the definition of \u2018retail sale\u2019 because while the form of ownership of the property is changed, there is a continuity of interest in the property transferred\u201d (20 NYCRR 526.6 [d] [1]). By contrast, the purchase by a partner of tangible personal property from the partnership is a retail sale (20 NYCRR 526.6 [d] [4] [ii]).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Under Federal tax law, \u201c[i]f a partner engages in a transaction with a partnership other than in his capacity as a member of such partnership, the transaction shall * * * be considered as occurring between the partnership and one who is not a partner\u201d (Internal Revenue Code [26 USC] \u00a7 707 [a]). The Treasury Department\u2019s regulations elaborate: \u201cSuch transactions include, for example, loans of money or property by the partnership to the partner or by the partner to the partnership, the sale of property by the partner to the partnership, the purchase of property by the partner from the partnership, and the rendering of services by the partnership to the partner or by the partner to the partnership. Where a partner retains the ownership of property but allows the partnership to use such separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>owned property for partnership purposes * * * the transaction is treated as one between a partnership and a partner not acting in his capacity as a partner * * * In all cases, the substance of the transaction will govern rather than its form\u201d (Treas Reg [26 CFR] \u00a7 1.707-1 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u201c[C]ourts should defer to the interpretation given a statute by the agency charged with its enforcement if the interpretation is neither irrational, unreasonable, nor inconsistent with the governing statute\u201d <em>(Matter of Trump-Equitable Fifth Ave. Co. v Gliedman, </em>57 NY2d 588, 597; <em>see, Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459). We conclude, therefore, that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Tax Law is rational and its determination that use taxes were due upon these rental transactions is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Jasen, Meyer, Simons, Kaye and Alexander concur in Per Curiam opinion; Judge Titone taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and determination of the State Tax Commission reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
