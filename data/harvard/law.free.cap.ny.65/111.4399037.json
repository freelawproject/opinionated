She, and a friend with whom she had been playing that morning, ran to the victim\u2019s home where her mother telephoned the police. Although defendant was immediately suspected by some of the police due to the information provided by the two young girls, the investigation did not progress until 10 days later, the evening of October 28, 1980, when Detective Matedero received a telephone call from a neighbor of the victim\u2019s family. The caller noted that defendant had been involved in prior incidents with another child in the neighborhood and suggested that he was the sodomist involved in this case as well. The detective thereupon searched the index card file and the arrest book and found that defendant had, indeed, been arrested several months earlier on two separate occasions, April 7, 1980 and May 14, 1980, for public lewdness, a class B misdemeanor (Penal Law \u00a7 245.00). The detective did not at that point attempt to locate the case jackets on those charges or to investigate them further. Rather, he sought immediately to interview the caller and other individuals living in the same neighborhood who were familiar with defendant and the earlier incidents. Consequently, he remained unaware that an information complaint had been filed on the prior charges, that they were still pending, and that defendant had been assigned counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Detective Matedero then proceeded to the neighborhood in question and conducted interviews with several individuals who told of defendant\u2019s repeated bizarre and obscene behavior. The detective then visited the young victim in this case and her friend. He took them to the police station where they each viewed a photographic array. However, neither child was able to identify defendant. Detective Matedero then drove them past defendant\u2019s residence, whereupon both girls identified the automobile parked in the driveway as the same one which, as they had described earlier to the police, was driven on the day of the incident by the man who committed the sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Several hours later, just prior to midnight, Detective Matedero and his partner, Detective Graniello, proceeded to defendant\u2019s home and were admitted into the house by defendant\u2019s father. They advised defendant that they wished to speak with him at the police station about a crime in the neighborhood and would also like him to participate in a lineup. Before leaving defendant\u2019s home, and in the presence of both his parents, Matedero fully advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defendant explicitly responded that he understood, that he did not wish to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>contact a lawyer, and that he was willing to speak to the police at the station unaccompanied by one. Upon arrival at the station, defendant was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and he repeated that he understood his rights and was willing to speak to the police without an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">When Matedero told defendant that he wished to discuss a recent neighborhood incident, defendant asked if the detective was referring to the occurrence in the town park. When the detective answered yes, defendant proceeded to render a full oral confession. Immediately thereafter, defendant was asked to repeat his statement for a tape recording and, following advisement of <em>Miranda </em>rights for the third time, defendant agreed to do so. Finally, defendant\u2019s confession was typed and, after reading and initialling the preprinted <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the top of the first page, defendant signed the written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Later that same night, defendant consented to both visual and voice identification lineups. The young victim and her friend viewed a five-man lineup separately, but neither could identify defendant. When voice identification procedures were conducted, however, each girl separately recognized defendant\u2019s voice among those of five participants as the voice of the man who had confronted them in the park. While statements concerning the voice identification were being prepared, the young victim\u2019s mother confronted defendant while he sat handcuffed in a squad room. Defendant exclaimed to her that he was sorry for what he had done to her daughter and promised not to go near the park again.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">A Grand Jury indicted defendant, charging him with two counts of sodomy in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 130.50). At a pretrial hearing, defendant moved, <em>inter alia, </em>to suppress all evidence of the oral, tape-recorded and written statements made by him on the night of October 28-29, 1980, on the grounds that they were involuntary (CPL 60.45) and in violation of his right to counsel under the New York State Constitution. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion, finding that defendant had voluntarily accompanied the detectives to the police station, that he had understandingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and that he had voluntarily given all the statements in question. Further, the court also found that, although the police were aware that defendant had been arrested and charged with public lewdness in connection with two prior incidents, they were unaware of the status of those charges at the time defendant was questioned, they had no knowledge that defendant was being represented by counsel on those charges, and defendant never mentioned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>them that he already had an attorney despite having been advised by them, on at least three separate occasions, that he had a right to have a lawyer present and appointed if he so desired. In light of these findings, the suppression court held that defendant\u2019s statements had not been \u201cinvoluntarily made\u201d within the meaning of CPL 60.45, and that defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the rule enunciated in <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167) had not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Subsequently, defendant was convicted, upon a jury verdict, of both counts of sodomy in the first degree and was sentenced, as a predicate felon, to two indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 7 to 14 years to run concurrently. A divided Appellate Division affirmed the judgment of Supreme Court. The court unanimously agreed that defendant\u2019s first oral statement, given immediately upon his arrival at the station, was not suppressible, either by reason of involuntariness or violation of his right to counsel, inasmuch as the statement was freely given and defendant had not yet been placed in custody. Likewise, the court was unanimous in holding that defendant\u2019s statement to the victim\u2019s mother was admissible as a spontaneous outburst unaffected by police presence or prior confessions and, in any event, that defendant chose at the suppression hearing to waive any objection to its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">On the other hand, the court divided on the admissibility of the tape-recorded and typewritten statements. There was no disagreement that defendant was repeatedly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that he gave his statements without coercion or inducement, and that the police who questioned him did not in fact know that defendant was being represented on the prior charges or that those charges were still pending at the time of the interrogation. But there was disagreement on the effect of that lack of actual knowledge. The majority of the court believed the officers\u2019 lack of actual knowledge to be dispositive of the correctness of the suppression court\u2019s rulings, but the two dissenting Justices, relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Bartolomeo </em>(53 NY2d 225), were of the view that the interrogating police had a duty to inquire whether defendant was indeed represented by counsel in connection with those previous offenses and that their failure to do so was fatal to the admissibility of the custodial statements obtained in that counsel\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Leave to appeal to this court was granted by one of the dissenting Justices. We now affirm the order of the Appellate Division for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>At the outset of our analysis, it should be noted that the so-called indelible right to counsel as enunciated by this court in <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167, supra) and <em>People v Bartolomeo </em>(53 NY2d 225, supra) applies only to custodial interrogations. Where the police know that a suspect is represented by counsel on pending charges, or where the police know that charges are pending but fail to make inquiry which would disclose that counsel has been assigned or retained, any custodial questioning of the suspect by them in counsel\u2019s absence is barred. <em>(See, People v Lucarano, </em>61 NY2d 138,145-146; <em>People v Fuschino, </em>59 NY2d 91, 98.) By contrast, eliciting inculpatory statements from a suspect under noncustodial circumstances \u201cinvolves no violation of [the] right to counsel even [where] the police are aware that [the suspect] has counsel on a prior unrelated charge\u201d. <em>(People v Farruggia, </em>61 NY2d 775, 777; <em>see also, People v Johnson, </em>61 NY2d 932; <em>People v Hauswirth, </em>60 NY2d 904, <em>affg </em>89 AD2d 357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Here, based upon the suppression court\u2019s findings, the Appellate Division unanimously agreed that defendant was not in custody when he made his first oral statement at the station. This determination was predicated upon defendant\u2019s agreeing in his own home and in his parents\u2019 presence to accompany the police to the station and to speak with them without an attorney. Additionally, defendant was advised at the time that he need not speak with the police and that he was not under arrest, and testimony at the suppression hearing showed that defendant understood and gave his cooperation voluntarily. It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the findings of the suppression court and the factual determination of the Appellate Division predicated thereon were erroneous, as there is sufficient evidence on the record to conclude that defendant\u2019s initial statement was voluntarily given under noncustodial circumstances. <em>(See, People v Johnson, supra, </em>at p 934; <em>People v Barnes, </em>50 NY2d 375, 381; <em>People v Yukl, </em>25 NY2d 585, 588-589.) Consequently, the police did not violate defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the <em>Rogers-Bartolomeo </em>rule when they obtained his first oral confession at the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">While we also hold that the tape-recorded and typewritten statements were admissible, they present different questions. The Appellate Division unanimously determined that defendant was arrested and placed into custody upon making the oral confession, but the court was divided as to whether defendant\u2019s indelible right to counsel attached at that point. The majority were of the view that mere knowledge by the police that defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>dant had twice previously been arrested, without more, did not preclude further questioning inasmuch as defendant was properly advised of his constitutional rights. The dissenters, however, argued that the failure of the police to ascertain that he was presently being represented by counsel on those prior matters required suppression of both custodial confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">On this appeal, as at the Appellate Division, defendant contends that the police were chargeable with the knowledge they would have gained from inquiring as to the status of his prior arrests. He argues that under the <em>Rogers-Bartolomeo </em>rule, the police had an absolute obligation to ascertain whether defendant was represented by counsel on the prior matters, regardless of the police officers\u2019 lack of awareness of the actual pendency of charges and the assignment of counsel thereon, and despite the minor nature of those charges and their remoteness in time. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167, <em>supra), </em>defendant, a robbery suspect, informed the police that he had an attorney on another matter. Thereafter, in the midst of an interrogation, his attorney called and instructed the police to cease further questioning. Under a purported waiver of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, however, the police continued to question him on unrelated activities. After approximately six hours of interrogation and while still manacled, defendant made an inculpatory statement. The majority of this court held that defendant\u2019s statement should have been suppressed at trial as the police were required to stop questioning defendant in his attorney\u2019s absence as soon as they knew that defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached, albeit with regard to a prior unrelated charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In <em>People v Bartolomeo </em>(53 NY2d 225, <em>supra), </em>the rule adopted in <em>Rogers </em>was somewhat extended. There, defendant had been arrested for arson and was represented by counsel at the arraignment. A mere nine days later, defendant was taken into custody for questioning on a murder charge by officers who had actual knowledge of the outstanding prior arson charge, although not of defendant\u2019s representation by counsel thereon. When they questioned defendant, who had already agreed to speak without an attorney, he made incriminating statements which were introduced at the murder trial. This court vacated defendant\u2019s conviction, the majority holding that the police, having actual knowledge of the very recent arrest and the pending arson charge, had an affirmative obligation to inquire whether defendant had obtained representation on that outstanding matter and, having failed to do so, were charged with constructive knowledge that he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Subsequently, this court has further delineated and refined the holdings therein. <em>(See, e.g., People v Lucarano, </em>61 NY2d 138, <em>supra; People v Fuschino, </em>59 NY2d 91, <em>supra; People v Miller, </em>54 NY2d 616; <em>People v Servidio, </em>54 NY2d 951; <em>People v Smith, </em>54 NY2d 954; <em>cf. People v Kazmarick, </em>52 NY2d 323.) In addition to <em>Rogers </em>and Bartolomeo,.defendant relies upon two such progeny: <em>People v Smith (supra) </em>and <em>People v Servidio (supra). </em>In <em>Smith, </em>defendant was interrogated, while in custody as a murder suspect, by a police officer who was aware that defendant had previously been arrested on a felony charge \u2014 sodomy \u2014 approximately eight months earlier. Although the officer did not actually know whether defendant had an attorney, he acknowledged that he had \u201cassumed\u201d defendant was being represented on that still pending matter. The majority of this court held that defendant\u2019s incriminating statements should have been suppressed, reasoning that, since the officer had \u201cactual notice\u201d, he was obligated to question defendant about his counsel on the earlier charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">By contrast, in <em>Servidio, </em>decided concurrently with <em>Smith, </em>this court unanimously refused to impose a duty to inquire on the basis of circumstances deemed significantly different. There, defendant was subjected to custodial questioning by a police officer who was unaware of the prior outstanding misdemeanor charges on which defendant had already obtained counsel. As defendant correctly notes, an important consideration in that case was whether actual knowledge of the pending charges was deliberately overlooked or avoided by the police. But this court, relying upon the minor nature of those earlier matters, concluded that there was no reason to believe that there was such deliberate oversight on the part of the police, \u201ceven though [the charges] were pending within the same county and presumably the same department, and were but two and one-half months old\u201d. <em>(People v Servidio, supra, </em>at p 953.) Consequently, we held that there was no basis for inferring knowledge of prior representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Upon examination of this court\u2019s opinions in the foregoing cases, as well as in others decided shortly before or subsequently, it can be seen that certain factors are critical in determining whether legal representation on prior pending charges bars defendant\u2019s custodial statements elicited in the absence of counsel. The most salient of these are: the extent of the police knowledge; the proximity, severity and notoriety of the prior charges; and the good or bad faith of the police. As this court has clearly stated on a previous occasion, before deciding whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>suppress a defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements, a determination must be made whether the police had <em>\u201cactual knowledge\u201d </em>either that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s right to counsel has attached in a prior, unrelated charge\u201d or that \u201cdefendant has prior, unrelated charges still pending against him.\u201d <em>(People v Fuschino, supra, </em>at p 98.) Where the police are aware that defendant has counsel on other unrelated charges, they may not question the defendant without his attorney being present. Where the police are unaware that defendant has legal representation but are aware that prior charges are pending against him, they must ask defendant whether he has counsel. Absent some actual knowledge, however, of either defendant\u2019s representation by counsel or the pendency of prior charges, the police have no affirmative duty to cease their questioning or inquire whether defendant has an attorney. <em>(Id.; compare, People v Fuschino, supra, </em>and <em>People v Servidio, supra, with People v Smith, supra, </em>and <em>People v Bartolomeo, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Moreover, where the prior charges are relatively recent, police officers aware of the earlier arrest will almost certainly know that the charges are still outstanding. <em>(See, People v Lucarano, supra, </em>at p 146.) Where the earlier charges are remote in time, however, no such presumption is warranted. <em>(People v Fuschino, supra, </em>at pp 98-99 [prior arrest was 14 months earlier]; <em>compare with, People v Bartolomeo, supra </em>[9 days].) Concomitantly, it is reasonable to presume that the police would have cause to know of the continuing pendency of a serious felony charge, even after a considerable time past the arrest. Such is not the case with a relatively minor prior offense which is less likely to have earned notoriety within a police department and is more likely to have been disposed of at an early date. <em>(Compare, People v Servidio, supra </em>[prior charges involved minor misdemeanors, two and one-half months old], <em>with People v Smith, supra </em>[felony offense, i.e., sodomy, eight months earlier].) Indeed, as Justice Niehoff aptly noted in his concurring opinion below, since the People must be prepared for trial in considerably less time as the severity of an offense decreases, it is entirely reasonable for a police officer to assume that minor misdemeanor charges would be disposed more quickly than would serious felonies. <em>(See, </em>CPL 30.30 [1].) Allowing for possible adjournments and other delays which could extend the pendency of prior charges, the speedy trial time limitations are not an unreasonable factor to consider when determining whether a police officer\u2019s belief, that charges have been disposed of, was justified. <em>(See, People v Bertolo, </em>102 AD2d 193, 208 [majority opn], at pp 217-219 [Niehoff, J., concurring].)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Finally, where the police do not actually know that earlier charges are pending, there is no warrant for imputing constructive knowledge that the suspect already has legal counsel absent some measure of bad faith on their part. <em>(See, People v Lucarano, supra, </em>at p 145, n 3; <em>People v Fuschino, supra, </em>at p 99; <em>People v Servidio, supra, </em>at p 953; <em>cf. People v Kazmarick, </em>52 NY2d 322, 328, <em>supra.) </em>It is true, that where the police are guilty of some misfeasance a different result may obtain. So, for example, such knowledge has been imputed by this court where there was a surreptitious effort by the police to accomplish through agents what they could not do directly <em>(see, People v Knapp, </em>57 NY2d 161,173); where the interrogating officer chose to disregard his correct assumption that defendant had obtained an attorney on an outstanding charge <em>(see, People v Smith, supra); </em>where the police officers\u2019 failure to facilitate access by counsel foreclosed the latter\u2019s communication with defendant <em>(see, People v Garofolo, </em>46 NY2d 592, 601); where counsel\u2019s efforts to reach defendant were frustrated by police misinformation and inadequate operating procedures <em>(see, People v Pinzon, </em>44 NY2d 458, 464); and where the police chose to resolve their somewhat questionable doubts against defendant\u2019s having obtained counsel <em>(see, People v Ramos, </em>40 NY2d 610, 617-618). By contrast, however, constructive knowledge that defendant has an attorney on an unrelated pending matter is not chargeable to the police where they have not thus acted in bad faith or without sufficient deference to defendant\u2019s right to counsel. There is simply no justification for imputing such knowledge where the police have conducted their investigation and questioning in good faith and with due regard for defendant\u2019s rights. <em>(See, People v Lucarano, supra, </em>at pp 147-148; <em>People v Fuschino, supra, </em>at pp 97-100; <em>People v Servidio, supra, </em>at p 953; <em>cf. People v Adams, </em>53 NY2d 1, 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Under the circumstances presented in this case, there is no reason to impute knowledge nor, therefore, to suppress defendant\u2019s tape-recorded and typewritten statements. At the time defendant was questioned at the station, the interrogating officers had no actual knowledge that defendant was represented by counsel on prior charges. Indeed, they were not even aware that those prior charges were still pending. Moreover, although they knew that defendant had previously been arrested, the earlier charges involved minor offenses of public lewdness, a class B misdemeanor (Penal Law \u00a7 245.00), and those charges were each several months old \u2014 5V2 and <em>6V2 </em>months respectively \u2014 more than enough time in which to expect their final disposition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Hence, it was entirely reasonable for the officers to believe that those charges were no longer pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Additionally, there is no indication of any misfeasance or deception on the part of the police. Rather, the record shows that the officers specifically asked defendant at least three times whether he wished to contact a lawyer and each time he unequivocally declined. Instead, he volunteered to speak with the police and, moreover, never mentioned having legal representation on the earlier charges or anything about the charges themselves. Further, the courts below found that there was no credible evidence that the officers improperly induced defendant to give his statements or that they discouraged him from seeking counsel, and there is no basis in the record whatsoever that the police avoided knowledge of defendant\u2019s prior legal representation or that defendant\u2019s attorney was in any manner deliberately foreclosed from communicating with him. Rather, the police expeditiously and diligently pursued information on a recent serious felony offense and, in the course of their investigation, conducted an interrogation of defendant while they were wholly unaware that defendant was under pending charges on which he had obtained legal representation, and only after they had dutifully apprised him of all his rights and had obtained his willing and voluntary cooperation. In the absence of some actual knowledge or any bad faith on their part, the police were under no obligation to take additional measures to ascertain whether defendant\u2019s prior unrelated offenses were still pending and whether he was represented thereon by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">With regard to defendant\u2019s final oral statement, his exclamatory outburst to the victim\u2019s mother, no motion to suppress was made at the pretrial hearing. Indeed, the hearing court explicitly inquired whether defendant sought to suppress that statement in addition to the others, and, in response, defendant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that he was making no such motion. As the Appellate Division correctly noted, defendant thereby affirmatively waived any objection he might have raised to the introduction of that statement. (See, <em>People v Schiavi, </em>64 NY2d 704; <em>People v Corales, </em>56 NY2d 767.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Accordingly for the foregoing reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b171-8\">Alexander, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As\">(dissenting). The majority holds today that in spite of having acquired actual knowledge through his own limited investigation that a defendant has been recently arrested on two prior occasions, an interrogating police officer has no duty to inquire whether or not charges resulting from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>arrests are pending and whether defendant is represented thereon by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Because this ruling, in my view, impermissibly diminishes the right to counsel and countenances an uncounseled waiver of that fundamental right, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The facts of this case are amply set forth in the majority opinion and the several opinions at the Appellate Division. From these circumstances the majority concludes that because defendant\u2019s prior arrests were for public lewdness, considered to be a \u201cminor offense\u201d, and had occurred some five to six months previous, it was \u201creasonable\u201d for the officer to \u201cassume\u201d that no charges resulting from these arrests were pending and, therefore, that he was under no duty to make any effort to confirm that \u201cassumption\u201d or otherwise to ascertain whether defendant was represented thereon. Nor, the court holds, is the officer chargeable with the information that he would have obtained had the inquiry been made. In so holding, the majority places undue emphasis on the officer\u2019s lack of actual knowledge as to the pendency of the charges and his subjective view of whether the offenses for which the prior arrests were made were \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cremote\u201d in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In the seminal cases of <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167) and <em>People v Bartolomeo </em>(53 NY2d 225), we held that uncounseled waivers of a custodial suspect\u2019s right to counsel are ineffective when the police either are aware of the suspect\u2019s representation on pending charges <em>(Rogers, </em>supra) or have actual knowledge of a recent arrest and fail to inquire whether the suspect is still represented in the matter <em>(Bartolomeo, supra). </em>The <em>Bartolomeo </em>rule was later applied in <em>People v Smith </em>(54 NY2d 954) in which we held that where an officer knew that a suspect had been arrested by the same police department eight months earlier on a sodomy charge, \u201cthe officer was \u2018under an obligation to inquire whether [the suspect] was represented by an attorney\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Smith, </em>54 NY2d 954,956, <em>supra </em>[quoting <em>Bartolomeo, supra, </em>at p 232]). While in <em>Smith, </em>the officer decided \u201cto disregard his correct assumption\u201d that the defendant would be represented on the prior charge, it seems clear that the operative fact, central to the court\u2019s decision imposing the \u201cobligation to inquire\u201d, was the officer\u2019s <em>actual knowledge </em>of the prior charge. The <em>actual knowledge </em>possessed by the officer here, imposed no less an obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u201cThis court has jealously guarded the individual\u2019s * * * right to counsel, demanding that th[is] fundamental right be accorded the highest degree of respect by those representing the State\u201d <em>(People v Rogers, supra, </em>at p 170). Consciousness of the judici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ary\u2019s vigilant concern for the promotion of this right was imputed to law enforcement personnel by the <em>Bartolomeo </em>court in charging them with the knowledge that would be gained through minimal efforts to ascertain the status of matters already within their knowledge <em>(see, People v Bartolomeo, supra, </em>at p 231). In imposing a duty on the police to utilize information known to them to assist in effectuating the goal of protecting a suspect\u2019s right to counsel, the court has not compelled them to take \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d that would vitiate this benefit by hampering effective law enforcement <em>(see, People v Lucarano, </em>61 NY2d 138, 147). Rather, it has burdened the police only to \u201cmake a simple inquiry of defendant\u201d <em>(People v Lucarano, supra, </em>at p 147). Such an inquiry in the present case would have revealed, despite Detective Matedero\u2019s contrary assumptions and regardless of whether his assumptions were reasonable, that defendant was represented on pending charges and thus could not, on his own, effectively waive his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In balancing the benefit gained in determining that a suspect is represented by counsel against the de minimis burden imposed on the police to ascertain this information in circumstances where they have actual knowledge of two recent arrests of a suspect by their very same department, any doubt should be resolved by requiring the police to inquire about the status of the prior charges. Although there may be situations where a prior charge is so remote in time as to negate the obligation to inquire as to whether or not it is pending, I cannot agree that this is such a case. Here, the officer neglected to either check defendant\u2019s case jackets, which were readily available, after ascertaining defendant\u2019s recent arrests or to ask defendant prior to the custodial interrogation whether charges were pending. \u201cFailing such an inquiry, the police were chargeable with whatever information the inquiry would have disclosed\u201d <em>(see, People v Lucarano, </em>61 NY2d 138,146, <em>supra). </em>Should the suspect \u201cden[y] that he is represented on a pending unrelated charge, the police [would be] under no obligation to make further inquiry, so long as it is reasonable to believe the defendant\u2019s disclaimer of representation\u201d <em>(People v Lucarano, supra, </em>at p 148). The State\u2019s concern for the vindication of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel should not depend on the interrogating officer\u2019s subjective evaluation of the severity of the prior charges or their temporal remoteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">On the facts of this case, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the tape-recorded and typed confessions should have been granted. Although I agree, that suppression of defendant\u2019s noncustodial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>confession, and of his statement to the complainant\u2019s mother was properly denied, admission of the two confessions made while in custody cannot be deemed harmless error <em>(see, People v Garofolo, </em>46 NY2d 592) and requires that the Appellate Division order affirming defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction be reversed, defendant\u2019s motion granted to the extent of suppressing his taped and typewritten confessions, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons and Kaye concur with Judge Jasen; Judge Alexander dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Meyer concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
