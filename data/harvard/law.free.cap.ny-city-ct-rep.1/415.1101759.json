Whether the agreement under which the plaintiff beeame entitled to the commissions be open to the objection of illegality or inmorality, is one which the party paying the fund into court alono can raise, because, if such a transaction injures any one, it is the person paying the money; and where such person does not complain, but waives such defense by admitting his liability, and paying the amount of the claim into court to be contested for by the parties to the record, and the question of illegality as between the plaintiff and his employer may be considered out of the case.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b423-11\">McAdam, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acq\">The plaintiffs and the defendant herein cSiimed \u00a7378.75 for commissions from the George F. Blake Manufacturing Company, a corporation doing business under that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">The plaintiffs thereupon sued the Blake Manufacturing Company, and the company,.upon paying the amount claimed into coiirt, was discharged as a party from the record on an application for interpleader, under the Code, upon the ground that while the company owed the commissions, it was unable to determine whether the plaintiffs or Louis Sahm were entitled' to them, and Sahm was substituted as defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ant in the company\u2019s place. The action thenceforth proceeded between Elias &amp; Betz as plaintiffs on the one hand, and Sahm as defendant upon the other, to determine, that which became the real issue in the matter, <em>i. e., </em>which of the rival claimants, plaintiffs or defendant, were really entitled to the commissions. That the company owed the commissions to one or the other of these claimants was settled when the company admitted the fact, paid the money into court and asked to be discharged from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The main question litigated upon the <em>trial,\u2014i. e., </em>whether the plaintiffs or Sahm were entitled, to the commissions,\u2014turned upon disputed questions of fact, which were settled by the verdict of the jury in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. We do not propose to rehearse the details of this mixed transaction, as they appear in tlie evidence, it is sufficient to refer to the same as printed in the case, and to say that the transaction, as therein described by plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, entitled them, in law, to the commissions, and that this evidence must, in view of the finding of the jury, be taken as true, and as determining the rights of the rival claimants to the fund in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Whether the agreement under which the plaintiffs became entitled to the commissions be open to the ob-. jection of illegality or immorality, raised upon the argument, is one which the Blake Manufacturing Company alone could raise, because, if the transaction injured any one, it was that corporation, and it does not complain of the injury, on the contrary, has expressly waived it by admitting its liability, and by'paying the amount claimed into court to be contested for by the present parties to the record ; so that question may be considered out of the case. (For illustrations of the rule, see <em>Bigelow on Torts, </em>161, 846; Marshall <em>v. </em>Joy, 17 <em>Vt. </em>546 ; Gordon <em>v. </em>Jeffery, <em>2 Leigh, </em>410 ; Hutchins <em>v. </em>Hutchins, 7 <em>Hill, </em>104; Leffer v. Nuttman, 35 <em>Ind. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>384; Harshman <em>v. </em>Payson, 16 <em>Id. </em>512; <em>Burge Suretyship v. </em>218 ; Comstock <em>v. </em>Ames, 1 <em>Abb. Ct. App. </em>411; S. C., 3 <em>Keyes, </em>857.) Besides, a transaction impeachable lor fraud may become unimpeachable by a subsequent ratification, confirmation or release by the person defrauded (Pearsall <em>v. </em>Chapin, 44 <em>Penn. St. </em>9 ; Parsons <em>v. </em>Hughes, 9 <em>Paige, </em>591; Adams <em>v. </em>Sage, 28 <em>N. Y. </em>103).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u201e We have found nothing in the exceptions which requires a new trial. The facts found establish the plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery, and the judgment entered upon the verdict must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Affirmed by the Hew York common pleas, general term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
