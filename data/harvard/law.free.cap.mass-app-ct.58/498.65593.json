See <em>Figueroa-Torres </em>v. <em>Toledo-Davila, </em>232 F.3d 270, 279 (1st Cir. 2000).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In defense, McCabe asserts a claim of qualified immunity; the crux of his argument on appeal is that the judge\u2019s conclusion that there was a survivable genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to Rivera\u2019s conduct was error because McCabe\u2019s actions in redressing Rivera\u2019s conduct were \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d in the circumstances and therefore entitled him to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 200-201 (2001). He also contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>there was no showing sufficient to support the \u201caffirmative causal link\u201d between his conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injuries necessary to establish a claim on the merits in a supervisory liability action. See <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">It is necessary to set out the underlying facts in some detail. McCabe was appointed commissioner in January, 1987. Rivera had been a trooper since 1985. The first complaint against Rivera alleging inappropriate conduct toward a female motorist was in November of 1987 by H.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was examined by two investigators from the office of internal affairs. They found H to be \u201csincere and honest.\u201d H\u2019s complaint precipitated a fuller investigation into Rivera\u2019s conduct and led to the discovery of three prior incidents<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the uncovering of widespread rumors of other incidents involving Rivera and female motorists. The complainants\u2019 allegations ranged from his asking female motorists to go out for drinks, to inappropriate touching, to detention of female motorists for up to an hour, and to threats against a female motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The investigators presented their findings in a report to Mc-Cabe. It stated that Rivera\u2019s actions were \u201ctotally inappropriate and unprofessional\u201d and that Rivera had \u201cat the very least an unstable, emotional attitude in dealing with female motorists.\u201d It concluded that Rivera was \u201cunfit to carry on the affairs of his office in a professional and creditable manner\u201d and recommended that he be \u201cdealt with in a manner that w[ould] show the victims of these incidents and the general public that the Massachusetts State Police will not tolerate, these types of activities.\u201d As was the practice, the report was given to the deputy superintendent of the State police, then Thomas Fitzgerald, for him to make a recommendation regarding the type of disciplinary action to be taken. Fitzgerald reviewed the report and forwarded it to McCabe with his recommendation that Rivera be terminated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> McCabe reviewed the report with Fitzgerald and agreed with that recommendation. Rivera was formally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>charged with \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer\u201d arising from the first four incidents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> McCabe had Fitzgerald draft a letter to Rivera, giving Rivera the option of resigning or going to a court-martial to face the charges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rivera then conferred with union counsel, who brokered an agreement with McCabe that resulted in an alternative solution: to wit, Rivera was suspended for six months and ordered to report to the State police stress unit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">McCabe asserts that his acceptance of the agreement was not in acquiescence to the threat of liability, but was a result of a genuine interest in balancing the needs of the department with the needs of the public and his individual personnel. The record, however, indicates that McCabe acquiesced to the agreement because Rivera\u2019s counsel threatened to bring a racial discrimination suit against the department of State police on the ground that it had never terminated a white officer for \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">As a condition, Rivera agreed, upon his return from suspension, to report to the stress unit for a period of time to be determined by Deputy Superintendent Fitzgerald.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rivera was suspended in August, 1988, and returned to work in January, 1989, with no restrictions on his road duties, no further discipline, no evaluation of his treatment from the stress unit, and no measures instituted to monitor his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In November, 1992, almost four years after Rivera\u2019s suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>sion was imposed, Clancy filed a complaint alleging he had strip searched her and made lewd and suggestive comments to her during the course of a traffic stop.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The record reveals that Rivera threatened Clancy with physical harm if she told anyone about the incident. Criminal charges against Rivera ensued. Clancy then filed this action against McCabe.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">A. <em>Substantive law. </em>The doctrines of supervisory liability and qualified immunity often overlap significantly. In analyzing Mc-Cabe\u2019s claim for qualified immunity, we use an analytical road-map to plot the complex paths leading to the intersection of the doctrine of supervisory liability (the plaintiff\u2019s substantive claim) and the doctrine of qualified immunity (the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense and pretrial procedural exception, see note 5, <em>supra). </em>Thus, in considering a defendant\u2019s pretrial procedural claim of immunity, since the claim is predicated on an assertion of \u201cobjective reasonableness,\u201d a court\u2019s analysis necessarily entails an inquiry into the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s (substantive) supervisory liability claim. See <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that \u201c[t]he inquiry into qualified immunity is separate and distinct from the inquiry into the merits. ... In some circumstances, however, these inquiries overlap. . . . [Djiscerning whether a particular appellant\u2019s behavior passes the context-specific test of objective legal reasonableness to some extent collapses the separate \u2018qualified immunity\u2019 and [supervisory liability] \u2018merits\u2019 inquiries into a single analytic unit.\u201d). We take each path separately (providing various analytical signposts along the way) and then highlight the crossroads at the end.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">1. <em>Supervisory liability under \u00a7 1983. </em>Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code provides a cause of action against a governmental official who, acting under color of law, deprives an individual of rights or privileges secured under the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>States Constitution or the Federal laws.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>112 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997). A \u00a7 1983 cause of action may also in certain circumstances lie against a governmental official\u2019s supervisor for the acts or misdeeds of the subordinate. See <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shroud, </em>13 F.3d 791, 798 (4th Cir. 1994). The doctrine of supervisory liability, however, is distinct from the doctrine of respondent superior. <em>Ibid. </em>A supervisor can only be liable under the doctrine of supervisory liability for acts or omissions that cause a constitutional deprivation. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, a supervisor is not liable merely because the subordinate commits an unconstitutional act. See <em>Febus-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Betancourt-Lebron, </em>14 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 1994). See also <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>282 F.3d 123, 140 (2d Cir. 2002). A showing of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the subordinate\u2019s unconstitutional behavior or of \u201creckless or callous indifference to the constitutional rights of others\u201d is required before the supervisor\u2019s liability can attach. See <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d at 562; <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d at 7. \u201c[A] supervisor may be found liable for his deliberate indifference to the rights of others by his failure to act on information indicating unconstitutional acts were occurring or for his gross negligence in failing to supervise his subordinates who commit such wrongful acts . . . .\u201d <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>282 F.3d at 140. Generally, proof of more than a single instance of a lack of supervision causing a violation of a constitutional right is required before such conduct can be deemed \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Upshur County, Tex., </em>245 F.3d 447, 459 (5th Cir. 2001). \u201cThe plaintiff must generally demonstrate at least a pattern of similar violations.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The Federal circuit courts have employed various analytical tests to address a plaintiff\u2019s claim for supervisory liability.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Recognizing the extreme difficulty in assessing claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>supervisory liability and the inherent need for a practicable analytical framework to facilitate these endeavors, we will use, in applying the principles applicable to such claims, see, e.g., <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d at 562, 573-574; <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d at 6-7, a three-step analysis similar to that utilized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shroud, </em>13 F.3d at 799.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>282 F.3d at 140-142. In order for a plaintiff to succeed on a \u00a7 1983 supervisory liability claim, the plaintiff must show that (1) the supervisor had actual or constructive knowledge that his subordinate was engaged in conduct that posed a \u201cpervasive and unreasonable risk\u201d of constitutional injury to citizens like the plaintiff; (2) the supervisor\u2019s response to that knowledge was so inadequate that it amounted to \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201ctacit authorization\u201d of the subordinate\u2019s behavior; and (3) there was an affirmative causal link between the supervisor\u2019s action or inaction and the particular constitutional injury suffered by the plaintiff. See <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Stroud, </em>supra; <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Leonard, supra. </em>See also <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">2. <em>Immunity under \u00a7 1983. </em>In response to Clancy\u2019s claim for supervisory liability, McCabe asserted a right to qualified immunity. See <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>533 U.S. at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense that shields government officials who are performing discretionary functions from civil lawsuits in their individual capacity if their conduct does not violate \u201cclearly established\u201d statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 517 (1985); <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, 533 U.S. </em>at 200-201. Compare <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Commrs. of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26, 31 (1987), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Forastiere </em>v. <em>Breault, </em>485 U.S. 906 (1988); <em>Howcroft </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 573, 595 (2001) (\u201cqualified immunity principles . . . under \u00a7 1983 apply equally to claims under [the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act]\u201d). \u201cOn a motion for summary judgment, \u2018the relevant question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>whether a reasonable official could have believed his actions were lawful in light of clearly established law and the information the official possessed at the time of his allegedly unlawful conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Febus-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Betancourt-Lebron, </em>14 F.3d at 91, quoting from <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>924 F.2d 386, 389 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">After an immunity claim has been asserted, the court must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional right.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>533 U.S. at 201. If such a violation is found, the court then assesses whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Upshur County, Tex., </em>245 F.3d at 457, in light of the clearly established law at the time of the constitutional deprivation. See <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">As stated above, the objective reasonableness inquiry involves an examination of the facts uncovered from an inquiry into the \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d element of the substantive claim. See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Upshur County, Tex., </em>245 F.3d at 459-460 (\u201c[ejxamples of behavior that does (and does not) constitute deliberate indifference are relevant in assessing the scope of clearly established law and, therefore, are relevant in determining whether the defendants\u2019 actions were objectively reasonable\u201d). This analysis provides for an assessment of the scope of the \u201cclearly established\u201d right or constitutional law allegedly violated, and ultimately lends itself to evaluating the reasonableness of the supervisory official\u2019s conduct. See <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d at 6-8. In short, the determination of a supervisory official\u2019s pretrial immunity claim of objective reasonableness necessarily involves an analysis of the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the substantive supervisory liability claim, including the element of deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">B. <em>Analysis. </em>McCabe contends he was entitled to immunity because his conduct \u2014 the measures he took to redress Rivera\u2019s misconduct \u2014 was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d in the circumstances. The qualified immunity test is a two-step inquiry. See <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>533 U.S. at 201-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">1. <em>Whether constitutional violation clearly established. </em>We address the first prong of the qualified immunity test (whether the rights violated by the defendant were \u201cclearly established\u201d) in summary fashion, as this issue is not in serious dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">It is undisputed that prior to the time of the incident such acts as Rivera\u2019s strip-search of the victim, his propositioning of her for sex, and his threats to her were \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional violations that McCabe knew or should have known he could be liable for in his supervisory capacity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The record persuasively establishes that McCabe knew or should have known, based on Rivera\u2019s past conduct, that Rivera\u2019s conduct posed a \u201c \u2018pervasive and unreasonable risk\u2019 of constitutional injuries to citizens like the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shroud, </em>13 F.3d at 799, 802. See <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>112 F.3d at 3-4; <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d at 6. See also <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>404 Mass. 634, 648-650, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Kehoe </em>v. <em>Dobos, </em>493 U.S. 850 (1989) (police supervisors who had notice of subordinate police officer\u2019s past culpable conduct and failed to prevent its recurrence by removing officer from highway duty could be found liable under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">2. <em>Objective reasonableness. </em>We now move to the second prong of the immunity test, i.e., whether McCabe\u2019s conduct was reasonable in the circumstances. As stated above, the determination of \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d entails an inquiry into the merits of a plaintiff\u2019s supervisory liability claim. Thus, whether McCabe\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable is predicated on (1) whether he had actual or constructive knowledge that Rivera posed a \u201cpervasive and unreasonable risk\u201d of a constitutional injury to a female motorist; (2) whether his response to that knowledge was so inadequate as to have amounted to \u201cdeliber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ate indifference\u201d or \u201ctacit authorization\u201d of Rivera\u2019s unconstitutional behavior; and (3) whether there was an affirmative causal link between McCabe\u2019s inaction and Clancy\u2019s constitutional injury. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Stroud, </em>13 F.3d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">(a) <em>Notice. </em>The first element (notice) is not at issue. McCabe acknowledged that he had actual knowledge of Rivera\u2019s behavior after receiving the investigators\u2019 report. Compare <em>Dobbs </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>404 Mass. at 648-649.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">(b) <em>Deliberate indifference. </em>\u201cA plaintiff may establish deliberate indifference by demonstrating a supervisor\u2019s \u2018continued inaction in the face of documented widespread abuses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shroud, </em>13 F.3d at 799, quoting from <em>Slakan </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>737 F.2d 368, 373 (4th Cir. 1984). The supervisor must have had \u201cthe power and authority to alleviate [the violation]\u201d and would have acted but for his wilful blindness or deliberate indifference. <em>Maldonado-Denis </em>v. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>23 F.3d 576, 582 (1st Cir. 1994). See and compare <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Northern Essex Community College, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 798-799 (2002). \u201cGross negligence can signify deliberate indifference and serve as a basis for supervisory liability if it is causally connected to the actions that work the direct constitutional injury.\u201d <em>Maldonado-Denis </em>v. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>23 F.3d at 582. Based on this summary judgment record, taken in the light most favorable to Clancy, we think that a sufficient showing has been made of the factors for determining deliberate indifference to defeat Mc-Cabe\u2019s motion for summary judgment. See <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shroud, </em>13 F.3d at 799; <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We next determine whether the evidence could establish that McCabe failed to take \u201ceasily available measures to address the risk\u201d that Rivera posed. <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d at 7. Put another way, the issue is whether the measures taken were adequate, in light of the known risks Rivera posed to female motorists, to prevent recurrence of the constitutional violations or misconduct. See <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shroud, </em>13 F.3d at 799. See also <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>404 Mass, at 648-649 (State police supervisors found liable for allowing trooper to return to highway duty and thus failing to prevent recurrence of misconduct); <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>112 F.3d at 4 (finding police supervisor was not entitled to immunity, because of his failure to take adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>remedial actions concerning rogue police officer, which could be found to constitute deliberate indifference).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Clancy, it can be reasonably inferred that McCabe\u2019s supervisory response to Rivera\u2019s behavior was grossly inadequate. Before the incident against Clancy occurred, McCabe had actual knowledge of four prior incidents of Rivera\u2019s abusive behavior<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and of his predilections for abuse of female motorists. After he received the investigators\u2019 report, McCabe learned that Rivera had been orally warned several times by lower supervisors prior to his misconduct against H. Even after those warnings, Rivera continued his misconduct, eventually precipitating the incident against H. Two high-ranking officials recommended that Rivera be terminated, and McCabe initially agreed with that recommendation. However, instead of initiating termination proceedings, McCabe agreed to an arrangement that resulted in Rivera receiving a six-month suspension and referral to the stress unit. The record supports an inference that McCabe agreed to accept this arrangement in the face of a threat of a racial discrimination suit. Although that may have been a legitimate concern, it arguably did not warrant McCabe\u2019s overlooking \u201ca clear risk of future unlawful action by a lower-echelon actor over whom he had some degree of control.\u201d <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Zapata, </em>175 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Although McCabe took some action against Rivera, in light of what he knew, we think that a sufficient showing has been made to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the action taken amounted to tacit condonation of Rivera\u2019s behavior. It thus can be fairly inferred from the summary judgment record that McCabe was \u201cgross[ly] negligen[t]\u201d in his supervisory duty to protect female motorists from the known risks Rivera posed to them. See <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d at 562; <em>Maldonado-Denis </em>v. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>23 F.3d at 582. After his six-month suspension, Rivera was placed back on patrol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>with no restrictions on his activities, and with no measures implemented to monitor or oversee his future behavior toward female motorists. Although McCabe ordered Rivera to attend counseling at the stress unit, there is no showing that the stress unit could or did adequately address Rivera\u2019s specific condition.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There is no showing that McCabe or any of his subordinates evaluated Rivera\u2019s treatment from the stress unit to determine whether Rivera\u2019s behavior had been corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In these circumstances, it may be fairly inferred that McCabe should reasonably have appreciated that there was an unreasonable risk that Rivera would again abridge rights of female motorists. McCabe\u2019s failure to do more provides support for Clancy\u2019s assertion that he was indifferent to persons such as the plaintiff or that he \u201cacquiesced in the constitutionally offensive conduct of his subordinate[].\u201d <em>Slakan </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>737 F.2d at 373.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In addition, the plaintiff has presented the expert opinion of Lou Reiter, former deputy police commissioner of the Los Angeles police department, that McCabe\u2019s conduct showed deliberate indifference to the rights of female motorists by not properly redressing Rivera\u2019s known predilections.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The record supports an inference that McCabe was more concerned with union relations than with ensuring the safety of female motorists from the risks posed by Rivera.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Based on the foregoing, we conclude that, for summary judgment purposes, Clancy has sufficiently established that McCabe failed to take readily available measures necessary to address known risks Rivera posed to female motorists. Such a showing, viewed in the light most favorable to Clancy, could fairly lead a fact finder to conclude that McCabe\u2019s actions were so inadequate that his conduct amounted to deliberate indifference or reckless disregard for the rights of motorists like Clancy. See <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d at 7-8, 10-11 (\u201cfailed to take readily apparent steps to alleviate [the] risk\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">(c) <em>Causal connection. </em>A sufficient showing of deliberate indifference does not end the inquiry. \u201c[A] suitor also must show causation.\u201d <em>Camilo-Robles </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>151 F.3d at 7.

Thus, on a claim that a supervisory official indirectly caused a constitutional injury, the question turns on whether the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinjuries were a natural and foreseeable consequence of the supervisores] indifference.\u201d <em>Slakan </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>737 F.2d at 376. To establish cause, \u201cthe acts or omissions of the supervisor[] must have \u2018played a substantial part in bringing about or actually causing the injury or damage, and ... the injury or damage [must have been] either a direct result or a reasonable probable consequence of the act or omission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d at 569 (citation omitted).

An affirmative or causal link can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>established also by showing that the supervisor indirectly participated in the subordinate\u2019s misdeeds, for example, \u201cif the supervisor knew of, overtly or tacitly approved of, or purposely disregarded the conduct,\u201d or if the supervisor\u2019s conduct amounted to \u201cgross negligence.\u201d <em>Maldonado-Denis </em>v. <em>Castillo-Rodriguez, </em>23 F.3d at 582.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Viewing the materials in the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we conclude that McCabe\u2019s acts and omissions could reasonably have played a substantial part in bringing about Clancy\u2019s injuries and that her injuries were a reasonable probable consequence of those acts and omissions. McCabe had exclusive authority over discipline within the Massachusetts State police department. McCabe was aware of Rivera\u2019s predilections toward female motorists to the extent that he initially agreed to discharge him. Threatened with a racial discrimination suit, he subsequently agreed to suspend him for six months and order him, at the end of the six months, upon his reactivation to duty as a highway patrol officer, to report for counseling to a stress unit that arguably was incapable of dealing with Rivera\u2019s problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">At the end of the six-month suspension, other than the requirement that Rivera report to the stress unit, no restrictions were placed on him or the duties he was to perform. Further, although Deputy Superintendent Fitzgerald was to determine the period of time Rivera was to report for counseling, McCabe did not monitor Rivera\u2019s progress or require an evaluation of him prior to his ceasing participation in the stress program. Instead, he allowed Rivera to continue to perform duties as a highway patrol officer with no evaluation of his condition, no assessment of his potential continuing threat to female motorists, no restrictions, and no measures to monitor his behavior. As a result of these acts and omissions, McCabe tacitly or otherwise permitted Rivera to continue his illegal and improper conduct against female motorists. There thus has been a sufficient showing on this record to establish an affirmative causal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>link between McCabe\u2019s acts and omissions and Clancy\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Based on the foregoing, we conclude for purposes of summary judgment that McCabe has not shown that his conduct was objectively reasonable in the circumstances and that he therefore is not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-17\">Although an order denying a motion for summary judgment is an interlocutory order and is generally not appealable, here the appeal involves the denial of an immunity claim, which is immediately appealable.

We think a fact finder could infer that, in the circumstances presented here, it was just a matter of time before Rivera would strike again. Moreover, aside from the investigation into the four complaints, there has been no showing that McCabe conducted a thorough investigation into Rivera\u2019s motor vehicle stops of female motorists before or after the incident with H to determine whether Rivera\u2019s conduct went beyond the scope of that incident.
