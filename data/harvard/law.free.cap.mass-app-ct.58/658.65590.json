The injury occurred on September 23, 1994, and the plaintiff initially filed an action in the District Court on September 19, 1997. The is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>sue before us is whether the case is controlled by the three-year limitation of G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 18, permitting actions for injuries based upon a defect in a public way, or by G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 21, permitting certain actions against the MBTA only if filed within two years of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">After the plaintiff\u2019s original action was dismissed on the MBTA\u2019s motion, the Appellate Division of the District Court reversed, concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was timely under G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 18. Following a trial, a District Court judge ordered judgment for the plaintiff. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, the MBTA obtained a transfer of the case for trial in the Superior Court. Acting on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment, the Superior Court judge allowed the MBTA\u2019s motion, ruling that the two-year statute of limitations in G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 21, barred the plaintiff\u2019s action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge ruled that G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 18, is a \u201cgeneral\u201d statute that must yield to G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 21, a \u201cspecific\u201d statute. We think the analysis must be otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe law is well established . . . that the <em>\u2018exclusive remedy </em>for a claim of personal injury or property damage against governmental entities responsible for defects in a way is G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 15\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Boston Water &amp; Sewer Commn., </em>408 Mass. 490, 492 (1990), quoting from <em>Huff </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>386 Mass. 582, 585 (1982). In pertinent part, G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 15, states: \u201cIf a person sustains bodily injury ... by reason of a defect. . . in or upon a way, and . . . such defect . . . might have been remedied by reasonable care and diligence on the part of the county, city, town or person by law obliged to repair the same, he may . . . recover damages therefor from such county, city, town or person . . . .\u201d Accordingly, the case is controlled by G. L. c. 84 if the sidewalk in issue is a way.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">While there is no definition of a \u201cway\u201d in G. L. c. 84, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>is no question that the term encompasses a sidewalk open to public travel. It is not disputed that the area where the plaintiff in this case fell is an exterior \u201csidewalk\u201d adjacent to the Maverick Square Station.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With reference to a sidewalk within the limits of a way in <em>Weare </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>110 Mass. 334, 337 (1872), the court stated: \u201c[W]e understand the travelled path to be that which, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the town, is used for public travel, within the located limits of the way.\u201d Compare <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>232 Mass. 111, 115 (1919). In the circumstances of this case, the sidewalk in issue qualifies as a public way under G. L. c. 84 if it is open to travel not only by persons entering and leaving the Maverick Station, but also by other members of the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The summary judgment submissions to the Superior Court establish that there is such general public access. We have examined a plan of the Maverick Square Station area<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from which we make the following observations. The plan shows a concrete platform exterior to the station in an area that extends into what is labeled a \u201csidewalk.\u201d The station and the sidewalk appear as a long, rectangular island whose ends extend toward Sumner and Maverick Streets. It is apparent that there are possible paths for vehicular traffic on either side of the island between Sumner and Maverick Streets, as well as from Henry and Winthrop Streets, which open into the space to the western side of the island. Also possible are numerous paths for pedestrian traffic to and from the station, along the sidewalk, and to and from the nearby streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Given the exclusivity of the c. 84, \u00a7 15, remedy for defects in a way, the two-year limitation of actions under G. L. c. 161 A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>\u00a7 21, is inapplicable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Compare <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Trans. Authy., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 495 (1992), where the plaintiff was injured when she fell over the stump of a signpost in a sidewalk that the MBTA had a duty to maintain. \u201cBy grounding [her] claim on a defect in a municipal way, the plaintiff[] bound [herself] exclusively to the remedial provisions of G. L. c. 84.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Superior Court judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is vacated and the case is to stand for trial in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\">On appeal, neither party raises any issue as to the effect, if any, to be given to the Appellate Division decision. See generally Perlin &amp; Connors, Handbook of Civil Procedure in the Massachusetts District Court \u00a7\u00a7 11.19, 11.21 (2d ed. 1990 &amp; Supp. 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-9\">The MBTA concedes that the plaintiff fell on property under its control, and the parties stipulated that the MBTA was obliged to maintain and repair the sidewalk. \u201cThe MBTA is a governmental entity, G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 2, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>[there is no contention] that it is not a \u2018person\u2019 for the purposes of G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 15.\u201d <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Trans. Authy., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 497 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\">The plaintiff stated that she \u201cexited the station, crossed the sidewalk which was immediately outside the station, stepped [into a hole] and fell.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\">In a general description of the area where the plaintiff fell, the MBTA, in its summary judgment materials, referred to an affidavit, a plan, and a deposition, all of which were not included in the record presented to us. We have obtained and examined these materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The relevant portion of paragraph two of G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 21, as appearing in St. 1964, c. 563, \u00a7 18, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">\u201cThe authority shall be liable in tort to passengers, and to persons in the exercise of due care who are not passengers or in the employment of the authority, for personal injury and for death and for damages to property in the same manner as though it were a street railway company; provided that any action for such personal injury or property damage shall be commenced only within two years next after the date of such injury or damage . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The second paragraph of \u00a7 21 now appears in G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 38, as added by St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 151.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b683-13\">Unlike G. L. c. 161 A, governing the MBTA, the governing statutes of two other public authorities specifically provide for liability, in the manner and subject to the limitations of G. L. c. 84, \u00a7\u00a7 15 and 18, for injuries caused by defects in certain ways. See G. L. c. 81 A, \u00a7 20 (Massachusetts Turnpike Authority); St. 1958, c. 599, \u00a7 11, seventh par. (Massachusetts Port Authority). We conclude that the absence of such a provision in the MBTA statute, however, does not diminish the exclusivity of the remedy provided by G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 15, and we do not rely on the approach of the Appellate Division, which focused on the reference in c. 161A, \u00a7 21, to a street railway company, and the specific implication of G. L. c. 84 in the statute governing the latter. That statute provides for liability for \u201cinjury sustained by any person in the management and use of its tracks ... if notice of such . . . injury is given . . . and an action therefor is commenced in the manner provided by section eighteen of chapter eighty-four.\u201d G. L. c. 161, \u00a7 89.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
