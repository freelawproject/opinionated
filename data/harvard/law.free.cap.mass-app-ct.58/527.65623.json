The funeral director reported to LaCava that the cemetery commission had refused the request, offering instead to provide LaCava a burial plot in Whitmanville Cemetery, another Westminster town cemetery. Upon the refusal, LaCava brought suit in Superior Court. LaCava named the three Westminster cemetery commissioners as defendants, both in their capacity as cemetery commissioners and as individuals. The original complaint contained allegations of civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The defendants removed the matter to Federal District Court, where LaCava then moved to dismiss all claims under Federal law and requested the matter be remanded to the State Superior Court. After remand, LaCava filed an amended complaint in three counts, claiming that the town\u2019s denial (1) infringes upon his equal protection rights under art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (count I); (2) violates G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98, in that he is denied admission to a place of public accommodation (count II); (3) constitutes a violation of Massachusetts\u2019s equal rights statute, G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102 (count II); and (4) constitutes an abuse of discretion, and is arbitrary, capricious, and in excess of the commission\u2019s authority (count III). A Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under Mass.R.Civ.R 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), and later denied LaCava\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Both rulings were entered in simple marginal notation, unaccompanied by findings, memoranda, or comment. LaCava appeals from both the dismissal and the denial of his motion for reconsideration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><em>Background. </em>For context, we set out in the margin the govem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ing statutory provisions, G. L. c. 114, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 22-24, according to which the cemetery was established and operates, and pursuant to which the commissioners were elected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioners, pursuant to \u00a7 23, adopted rules and regulations, reissued July 1, 1999, containing various provisions dealing with perpetual care, foundations, monuments, the allocation of the costs of interment, the disposition of funds, and the like. Regulation B, \u201cSale of Lots/Perpetual Care,\u201d states in part: \u201cThe purchase of a lot or any other interment space gives the purchaser the right of interment. . . and the right to provide an approved memorial. The ownership of the land remains with the Town of Westminster and all lots and graves are subject to Chapter 114 of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d See <em>McAndrew </em>v. Quirk, 329 Mass. 423, 425 (1952) (purchaser of cemetery lot ordinarily does not obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>fee but acquires only right of burial or easement to use lot for burial). It is clear that Woodside cemetery is a public cemetery, governed by and under the provisions of G. L. c. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In refusing LaCava\u2019s request for a burial plot in Woodside, the commission, through its chair, Vilho Lucander, indicated that \u201cthere has been much concern . . . from [LaCava\u2019s] daughters and other[s] in the town\u201d and that \u201cto be fair and sensitive to their concerns, . . . [LaCava] could not be buried in Woodside Cemetery but there is another town cemetery, Whitmanville, where [he] could purchase a grave.\u201d Minutes of an earlier commission meeting include the following entry: \u201c[LaCava] is serving time for the murder of his wife and the family objects to the presence] of his remains in the same area as his wife\u2019s.\u201d Minutes of a subsequent meeting report that \u201cTown coun[sel] has supported our decision to supply/sell a lot to Mr. LaCava in the Whitmanville Cem. and prevent the anguish the family has displayed at the thought he would be buried in an area near his wife\u2019s grave whom he murdered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>In testing claims against a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), \u201ca complaint is sufficient unless it shows beyond doubt that there is no set of facts which the plaintiff could prove in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 679, 683 (1977), quoting from <em>Howard </em>v. <em>G.H. Dunn Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 868 (1976). Complaints should be read indulgently in favor of the pleader when considering a motion to dismiss. \u201c[T]he allegations of the complaint, as well as such inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, are to be taken as true.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977). \u201c[A] complaint is sufficient against a motion to dismiss if it appears that the plaintiff may be entitled to any form of relief, even though the particular relief he has demanded and the theory on which he seems to rely may not be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">We first note that LaCava has, on appeal, specifically waived any claim to a burial plot based on his rights under G. L. c. 114, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u00a7 33,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and accordingly, we exclude from consideration here any possible claim under that section of the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">1. <em>Equal protection. </em>We next consider LaCava\u2019s claim in count I that he was denied equal protection under art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Our review of an equal protection claim is the same under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights as it is under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Rushworth </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>413 Mass. 265, 272 (1992). LaCava makes no claim that the statute enabling the creation of town cemeteries or the town by-law governing their operation violates art. 1. Compare <em>Karchmar </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>364 Mass. 124, 135-136 (1973). Rather, his equal protection claim is based on the commission\u2019s actions denying him burial space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>in the cemetery of his choice. In order to invoke \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d of the commission\u2019s action, see <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 660 (2002), LaCava must show that he was treated differently because of his membership in a suspect class, or that the commission\u2019s actions trammeled on one of his fundamental rights. Absent such showing, we look only to see whether the commission\u2019s action bore a \u201creasonable relationship to some proper object.\u201d <em>Bauza </em>v. <em>Morales Carrion, </em>578 F.2d 447, 450 (1st Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">LaCava does not claim, nor does a generous reading of his complaint suggest, that he is a member of a suspect class, that is, a member of a class that is \u201csaddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 313 (1976), quoting from <em>San Antonio Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973). Suspect classes for equal protection purposes include classifications based on race, religion, alienage, national origin and ancestry, and certain quasi suspect classes, based on gender and illegitimacy. See <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Gotham Ink of New England, Inc., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 923 (1992); <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Ventura County Superior Ct., </em>42 F. Supp. 2d 993, 998 (C.D. Cal. 1999). \u201cAlthough . . . seriously disadvantaged when . . . compared to individuals at liberty and although they are the subject of political hostility, [inmates qua inmates, and not part of another recognized class] do not constitute a suspect class because their status is the result of precise, individualized application of otherwise neutral laws.\u201d <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>648 F. Supp. 298, 301 (S.D. Tex. 1986). See <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>424 Mass. 46, 53 (1997) (prisoners not inherently suspect classification for equal protection purposes); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Governor of N.Y., </em>87 F.3d 55, 60 (2d Cir. 1996); <em>Davis-El </em>v. <em>O\u2019Leary, </em>626 F. Supp. 1037, 1043 (N.D. Ill. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Nor do we think that the right to be buried in a cemetery of one\u2019s choosing is a fundamental right for purposes of equal protection, such that the commission\u2019s actions here would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>subject to the strict scrutiny required when fundamental rights are violated. Fundamental rights generally are those that stem explicitly from or are implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution. <em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 217 &amp; n.15 (1982). Burial in a particular cemetery is not viewed as a fundamental or essential right where not required by the fundamental right of freedom of religious practice. See <em>Mount Elliott Cemetery Assn. </em>v. <em>Troy, </em>171 F.3d 398, 404, 407 (6th Cir. 1999) (Roman Catholic religion does not require burial in Catholic cemetery; court noted proximity of other cemeteries acceptable to religious beliefs of the plaintiff\u2019s members). No such claim of impairment of religion is apparent or inherent in LaCava\u2019s complaint. On its face, LaCava\u2019s complaint alleges facts that preclude a basis for recovery under count I; the allegation that the commission refused his request in order to comply with the wishes of LaCa-va\u2019s daughters and to forestall the anguish they would suffer provides a minimal rational basis supporting the commission\u2019s actions. <em>See Abdulah </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>907 F. Supp. 13, 16 (D. Mass. 1995), quoting from <em>LCM Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>14 F.3d 675, 679 (1st Cir. 1994) (under \u201crational basis\u201d test, no actionable discrimination if \u201cany state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify the [action]\u201d). We conclude that his claim here fails to allege sufficient minimal facts under any legally cognizable equal protection theory, and that dismissal of this count was therefore appropriate. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 6, 12 (1992); <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Kansas City, </em>857 F.2d 690, 696-697 (10th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">2. <em>Public accommodation. </em>We next consider LaCava\u2019s claims that the commission\u2019s action in denying him a burial plot in Woodside cemetery was discriminatory, in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 92A,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 272, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u00a7 98.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this connection, LaCava claims that Woodside cemetery is a place of public accommodation as defined in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 92A. We note in passing that it appears that his claim in this regard may have merit. Although not central to our decision, principles of statutory construction and review of cognate laws in other States suggest that a town cemetery may well be a place of public accommodation. There is no doubt that Woodside cemetery is a \u201cplace.\u201d See <em>United States Jaycees </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>391 Mass. 594, 601-602 (1984). The scope of the term \u201cplace,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 272, 92A, was substantially broadened by St. 1953, c. 437, which added the words \u201cany place . . . which is open to and accepts or solicits the patronage of the general public.\u201d \u201c[T]he enumerated specific examples of \u2018places of public accommodation\u2019 do not restrict the preceding general statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>language, or provide a basis for applying the principle of ejusdem generis.\u201d <em>Local Fin. Co. of Rockland </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>355 Mass. 10, 13 (1968) (extending definition to include loan office). See <em>Concord Rod &amp; Gun Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>402 Mass. 716 (1988) (extending definition to include fishing and hunting club). Contrast <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 90 (1996) (statutory definition limited by the application of the doctrine of ejusdem generis). The statutes and by-laws governing the operation of Woodside can fairly be read as accepting and soliciting the patronage of the general public. Further, several States with similar statutes specifically include cemeteries as places of public accommodation. See, e.g., the Illinois Human Rights Act, 75 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-101 (West 2001); N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \u00a7 44-a (McKinney 1992); the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination, Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 44-1002 (2000). As well, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held, under a statute very similar to ours, that a nonsectarian cemetery was a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d within the purview of Pennsylvania\u2019s Human Relations Act. <em>Pennsylvania Human Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>Alto-Reste Park Cemetery Assn., </em>453 Pa. 124, 129-133 (1973). Any determination in this regard, however, would ultimately be of no help to LaCava. His complaint again does not state facts upon which recovery might be had; he does not claim that the defendants denied him access to Woodside cemetery on any basis prohibited by the public accommodation law, which includes only sex, race, ancestry, or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">3. <em>Equal rights statute. </em>LaCava next claims that the commission\u2019s actions denied him \u201cequal rights\u201d guaranteed to all citizens under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We look to the cognate Federal provision for guidance. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 630, 641-642 (1996). Only discrimination that is both purposeful and based on sex, race, color, creed or national origin comes within the reach of the statute; if any element is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>missing, a claim under the statute fails. See <em>Dartmouth Review </em>v. <em>Dartmouth College, </em>889 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir. 1989) (construing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981). LaCava\u2019s complaint here again must fail. Even a generous reading of his complaint does not permit the possibility of his proving that the commission\u2019s action was based on sex, race, color, creed or national origin, or was purposefully discriminative.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">4. <em>Certiorari. </em>Finally, LaCava\u2019s complaint alleges that the commission\u2019s action constitutes an abuse of discretion, and was arbitrary, capricious, and in excess of its authority. The allegation raises a claim for review of the commission\u2019s actions in the nature of certiorari under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. This claim, too, must fail on a motion to dismiss. Judicial review here \u201cis limited to correcting \u2018substantial errors of law that affect material rights and are apparent on the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gloucester </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>408 Mass. 292, 297 (1990), quoting from <em>Debnam </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>388 Mass. 632, 635 (1983). \u201cA decision is not arbitrary and capricious unless there is no ground which \u2018reasonable men might deem proper\u2019 to support it.\u201d <em>T.D.J. Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of N. Andover, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 124, 128-129 (1994), quoting from <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>329 Mass. 314, 318 (1952). We conclude that the complaint on its face, by alleging that the commission denied LaCava burial space in Woodside cemetery in order to save the family anguish, states facts with respect to the denial that reasonable persons might deem proper, and that any possibility of relief on this score is precluded. That the commission had the authority to determine who should be given space in the cemetery is obvious from the by-laws made a part of LaCava\u2019s pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>As we determine that the motion to dismiss was properly allowed, we need not reach the issue whether the commissioners might be individually hable, or the extent to which the town might be responsible for their action here.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On appeal, LaCava argues that he sought a burial plot both for himself and his deceased infant son. The allegation that he sought a plot for his son is not contained in either his original or amended complaint; other than a single reference to his seeking to \u201cpurchase grave sites at Woodside Cemetery,\u201d all references in LaCava\u2019s complaint and in the prayers for relief relate to a place in the cemetery for his burial only. We consider any issue raised by that argument waived and note that nothing in the cemetery commission\u2019s decision or the trial court\u2019s ruling would adversely affect a request for burial space for the deceased son.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b551-4\">General Laws c. 114, \u00a7 10, provides: \u201cEach town shall provide one or more suitable places for the interment of persons dying within its limits.\u201d While it is doubtful that LaCava will die in Westminster, as he is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole in Walpole, nothing in the statute or the commission\u2019s by-laws limits its sale of burial plots to persons dying in Westminster.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">General Laws c. 114, \u00a7 22, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA town which accepts this and the four following sections or has accepted corresponding provisions of earlier laws may, at any town meeting, elect by ballot a board of cemetery commissioners consisting of three persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">General Laws c. 114, \u00a7 23, provides: \u201cSaid board shall have the sole care, superintendence and management of all public burial grounds in its town, may lay out any existing public burial grounds in its town or any land purchased and set apart by said town for such cemeteries, in lots or other suitable subdivisions, with proper paths and avenues, may plant, embellish, ornament and fence the same and erect therein such suitable edifices and conveniences and make such improvements as it considers convenient; and, subject to the approval of the town, may make such regulations, consistent with law, as it deems expedient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">General Laws c. 114, \u00a7 24, as amended by St. 1948, c. 550, \u00a7 50, provides: \u201cSaid board may, by deed made and executed in such manner and form as it may prescribe, convey to any person the sole and exclusive right of burial in any lot in such cemeteries and of erecting tombs, cenotaphs and other monuments or structures thereon upon such terms and conditions as its regulations prescribe. Such deeds and all subsequent deeds of such lots made by owners thereof shall be recorded in the office of the city or town clerk in books kept for that purpose upon the payment of the fee provided by clause (78) of section thirty-four of chapter two hundred and sixty-two, and said records shall be open to the public at all reasonable times.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">General Laws c. 114, \u00a7 33, the reciprocal of G.

He merely seeks to purchase a grave site in his hometown neighborhood cemetery.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\">LaCava\u2019s amended complaint did not explicitly press a claim under G. L. c. 114, \u00a7 33, which, when read in conjunction with G. L. c. 114, \u00a7 32, grants a husband the right to be buried with his wife. A generous reading of the pleading, see <em>Nader </em>v. Citron, 372 Mass. at 98; <em>White </em>v. <em>Spence, 5 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 683, which claimed that \u201crefusing such right of burial to plaintiff to be fair and sensitive to the concerns of the plaintiff\u2019s daughters and others was an abuse of discretion, arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, [and] in excess of authority of the board,\u201d we think fairly stated facts upon which relief might have been granted. Compare <em>Levine </em>v. <em>E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 976, 977 (1983). Summary judgment proceedings would have established, at the trial level, any claim that LaCava might have made under G. L. c. 114, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 33, and permitted further development as to who had control of the burial site of the wife, see G. L. c. 114, \u00a7 28, and whether, under those circumstances, the commission had the authority to refuse burial in a plot to which LaCava had a right to be buried. Further proceedings would also have established, at the trial level, LaCava\u2019s desire to waive any claim under G. L. c. 114, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 33. We have expressed our preference for allowing a case to advance to the procedural stage best able to have all issues thoroughly developed; in this case, summary judgment proceedings would have offered fuller exposition of the issues.
