He claims that (1) the judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a psychiatric examination of the complainant; and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\"><em>Pretrial motion for examination of mental status. </em>A week before trial, the defendant filed a motion for a competency evaluation of the complainant, pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 19. An accompanying affidavit from trial counsel averred that the complainant \u201cpossibly experiences auditory hallucinations and vague delusions,\u201d and occasionally talks to \u201cspace people.\u201d The Commonwealth opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 19, \u201cenhanc[es] a trial judge\u2019s jurisdiction to determine . . . competency to testify.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Widrick, 392 </em>Mass. 884, 887-888 (1984). \u201c[It] operates as a supplement to a judge\u2019s traditional method of assessing competency, e.g., the voir dire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 888, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fillippini, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 609 (1973). A judge\u2019s decision whether to order such a test is discretionary. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 19; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 659, 665 (1986), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 1005 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Based on the complainant\u2019s responses to questions from the judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel at voir dire, the judge reasonably could have concluded that the complainant knew her name, address, and age; how far she went in school; what an oath is; her obligation to tell the truth; and the consequences of failing to do so. The complainant also acknowledged that she occasionally talked to or about space people, and that she heard their voices. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The judge did not abuse his discretion. His ruling was consistent with \u201c \u2018[t]he tendency . . . except in quite clear cases of incompetency ... to let the witness testify and have the [jury] make any proper discount for the quality of her understanding.\u2019 . . . [U]nder the modem trend, a judge may accept as competent for testimony a witness whose reliability is, in [his] judgment, at most, marginally sufficient.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>428 Mass. 555, 563-564 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 656 (1980). Contrast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monzon, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 245, 252 (2001) (jury should not have been allowed to consider the testimony of a child who said she did not know the difference between the truth and a lie).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Trial. </em>Briefly, the facts disclosed at trial were as follows. The complainant and the defendant apparently met when the defendant helped the complainant start her car when it broke down at a coffee shop the complainant often patronized. Later the defendant performed chores for the complainant, including fixing her roof. They appeared to have a friendly relationship. After an elder services case worker began visiting the complainant once a month to persuade her to accept services, the complainant disclosed to the worker that the defendant poked his front end into her front end, that it hurt, and that she wanted it to stop. Hospital examination disclosed some abnormalities in her perineal area, but their relevance was not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The complainant\u2019s testimony revealed that her memory was impaired. For example, she did not remember whether she still had her car, whether she had gone to the hospital, or that she had been questioned (on voir dire) earlier on the day she testified. Two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, a neighbor and a Department of Mental Health (DMH) employee who performs emergency psychiatric assessments, testified that the complainant talked about space people. The complainant\u2019s testimony about her conversations with space people was guarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\"><em>Closing argument. </em>In his closing argument, defense counsel argued that the complainant was not a reliable witness. He reminded the jury of the DMH employee\u2019s testimony that the complainant had told the DMH employee she talked to space people and wondered whether space people had something to do with her falling down the stairs. Defense counsel made clear he was not arguing that the complainant deliberately lied, but rather that she was not reliable. He also asserted that there was no evidence corroborating the complainant\u2019s confused account and faulted the Commonwealth for failing to have the bed linens tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The prosecutor immediately challenged the defendant\u2019s argument. She argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201c[Defense counsel] tells you, well, she\u2019s not a liar, but she\u2019s mentally ill. How can you believe her? How can you believe her if we don\u2019t have five hundred people to testify about a crime that happens between only two? How can you just believe her alone? Well, she\u2019s mentally ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201cDo you have any evidence from any expert to say she\u2019s been diagnosed with a mental illness? Have you heard any testimony from any expert to say that the fact that she hears space people means that she doesn\u2019t know truth from reality, that means she can\u2019t recall things, that means she\u2019s not based in reality? No, you haven\u2019t heard from one expert, have you, to say anything like that. You heard from [the DMH employee], but he\u2019s only a clinician. He can\u2019t give you that type of expert opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s argument to you, that she\u2019s mentally ill, so she isn\u2019t reliable, is based on an underlying premise of prejudice, bigotry and fear of people whose mental status is different from everyone else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Defense counsel objected, but the judge overruled the objection. The prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">\u201cHe wants to make you believe, just because she hears voices, that somehow she can\u2019t tell you the truth, that she doesn\u2019t know what happened to her and that something bad happened to her. Little children have imaginary friends all the time. Does that mean they can\u2019t tell you if somebody hurt them? Is that not a gigantic leap? It is, and it\u2019s premised on your fears and your prejudice of the unknown and mental illness, a mental illness that we don\u2019t even know what it is and we don\u2019t know that she\u2019s ever been diagnosed with one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">At the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the jury took its morning recess. While the jury were out of the room, defense counsel repeated his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. He contended that the Commonwealth\u2019s argument regarding the need for expert testimony constituted burden shifting. He also claimed the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the defense was based on appealing to prejudice against the mentally ill was improper. The Commonwealth responded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>its argument consisted of fair and reasonable inferences in response to the defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The judge did not rule on the defendant\u2019s objections but merely directed, \u201cOkay. Want to bring down the jury.\u201d He then commenced his instructions to the jury, which consume over thirty pages of transcript. He began with standard admonitions \u2014 instructing the jury to be completely fair and impartial, not to be swayed by prejudice or sympathy, and not to be swayed by the judge\u2019s rulings on motions or objections. He also instructed them that argument is not evidence, that the burden of proof lies with the Commonwealth, that the defendant is presumed innocent, and that the defendant has no burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Then, two-thirds of the way through his instructions, perhaps thinking better of his earlier ruling, the judge advised the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201c[Y]ou may have heard the prosecutor argue that the defense presented no expert witness as to [the complainant\u2019s] mental condition. That argument is improper, and you are to disregard it. The defendant doesn\u2019t have to present any evidence at all in his own defense in this case. It\u2019s the Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">There was no instruction concerning the prosecutor\u2019s argument to the jury that the defendant\u2019s closing argument was based on prejudice against the mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>While acknowledging that the prosecutor\u2019s argument had the \u201cpotential ... of misleading the jury into believing that the defendant should have produced evidence of the complainant\u2019s alleged mental illness,\u201d the Commonwealth argues that the judge\u2019s instructions \u201cprevented the jury from being misled.\u201d The defendant claims the judge\u2019s instruction did not cure the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">\u201cIt was improper for the prosecutor to comment on the absence of the psychiatric [evidence].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silan-skas, </em>433 Mass. 678, 701 (2001). \u201c[T]he Commonwealth may not comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to produce evidence,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>particularly when it was the Commonwealth that opposed the defendant\u2019s motion for the competency examination while acknowledging the victim had \u201cmental infirmities.\u201d See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Haraldstad, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 568 (1983). Defense counsel having objected to the prosecutor\u2019s argument, we consider whether there was prejudicial error, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13-14 n.7 (1999), applying the factors governing such determinations as set out in the case law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 518 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">While a judge\u2019s curative instructions can often save the day, we conclude that in this case they did not. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>(improper final argument must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis; there are no satisfactory bright line rules). Here, as the defendant points out, the expert testimony issue was the first point the prosecutor made in her closing. The argument went to \u201cthe very heart of the case\u201d \u2014 the credibility of the complainant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 253, 264 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 471 (1978). Defense counsel objected immediately, and again at the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing. The judge eventually gave curative instructions, but not until the jury had heard the remainder of the prosecutor\u2019s closing (including more about the need for expert testimony), and approximately two-thirds of the judge\u2019s other instructions. We think this case is one where the timing and placement of the curative instructions was important. See Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1851 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 2003). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silanskas, </em>433 Mass. at 701 (\u201cjudge immediately corrected any mistaken impression about the absence of evidence at the time of the improper remark and admonished the prosecutor before the jury\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, 427 </em>Mass. 642, 646 (1998) (reminding trial judges that they have authority to interrupt improper argument). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 911 n.7 (1983) (as to clear prosecutorial excesses, \u201cpreferable practice is for the judge to intervene then and there\u201d). We also note that the judge did not comment at all on the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to portray the defense as based on prejudice against the mentally ill, an argument we consider also to have been improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Viewing the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in the context of the trial as a whole, we conclude that the improper remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>may have made a difference in the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra, </em>399 Mass. at 518; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. at 14 n.7. The judgment is therefore reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHB\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
