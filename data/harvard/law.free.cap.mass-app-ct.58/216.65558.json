One of them drew a gun and struck him in the mouth with it, while the others seized the bicycle. All three assailants fled (one with the bicycle) in the direction of Boylston and Amory Streets in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston. The robbery took less than a minute. The two defendants, Bryant Zimmerman and Mario Chaparro, were arrested, and those defendants now stand convicted of armed robbery and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The major appellate point for the two defendants is that the judge improperly discharged a deliberating juror (juror 2) without giving the cautionary instruction mandated by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 845-846 (1984). There are subsidiary claims of error relating to the denial of defendant Zimmerman\u2019s pretrial motion for funds for an expert witness on identification, the judge\u2019s instructions on identification, Heaton-Jones\u2019s identification testimony, certain remarks made by the prosecutor in closing argument, and coercion of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AXO\">1. <em>Discharge of a deliberating juror. </em>On the first day of jury deliberations, the judge received a written communication from juror 2, stating that \u201cduring deliberations information came out\u201d that, two days earlier, she had seen the defendant Chap-arro, presumably near his mother\u2019s home not too distant from where juror 2 lived. The juror also recognized Chaparro\u2019s mother, who had appeared as a defense witness the day before jury deliberations began, as someone she had seen before on \u201cpassing occasions.\u201d She concluded the communication by stating that \u201cI am in no way uncomfortable sitting on the jury, since I do not know the defendants or their parents.\u201d What prompted her note was the cautionary suggestion of several fellow jurors, who advised her to inform the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AIZ\">In the presence of the defendants, both defense counsel, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>prosecutor, and the judge conducted a voir dire of juror 2. Mindful of his obligations not to intrude on the deliberative process, the judge limited his inquiry to eliciting the context within which the subject matter of her living in the same neighborhood as the defendant\u2019s mother arose. The juror explained that she was \u201cillustrating relative risk,\u201d which led to the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Judge: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand. . . . Are you suggesting that because you saw these people and they live near you that you felt that there was some kind of risk?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Juror 2: \u201cNo, actually I was illustrating the opposite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The judge then truncated further discussion and suspended deliberations for the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">On the following Monday, the prosecutor asked that juror 2 be excused on the ground that she would have difficulty convicting a neighbor. The judge was not so certain, but decided to conduct an individual voir dire of the jury. There followed a short colloquy with each juror individually during which the judge asked how the subject of juror 2\u2019s living in the same neighborhood as defendant Chaparro\u2019s mother arose. While seven of the deliberating jurors recollected nothing of concern, two indicated that juror 2 had expressed fear or anxiety about convicting a neighbor, one said that juror 2 had stated that \u201cif anyone should be afraid it should be her,\u201d and a third juror said that juror 2 had stated that, because of concerns about neighborhood safety, if she thought someone in her neighborhood had committed a crime, she would want that person convicted, but in fact her proximity would have no impact on her decision at all. None of the questioned jurors indicated that juror 2\u2019s disclosure would in any fashion affect their own ability to decide the case on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">The judge then recalled juror 2 and made a second inquiry concerning the genesis of her disclosure to the other jurors. At this point, she indicated that it arose during their discussion of the evidence. She indicated that \u201cmy proximity was not influencing my decision and I was trying to use that to give my position more strength.\u201d She also stated that she was less likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>to be suspicious of a neighbor, but that this would not affect her impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Over both defense counsels\u2019 objections and for the reason previously assigned by the prosecutor (i.e., that juror 2 would place more credence in a neighbor\u2019s testimony), the judge discharged her from the jury. He made no other findings. After the removal and the substitution of an alternate juror, the judge instructed the jury to begin their deliberations anew, but failed to instruct the jury that juror 2\u2019s discharge had nothing to do with that juror\u2019s opinions about the case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 845-846 (1984). Counsel for both defendants objected in vain to the lapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">General Laws c. 234, \u00a7 26B, provides for the substitution of a deliberating juror if the juror \u201cdies, or becomes ill, or is unable to perform his duty for any other good cause shown to the court.\u201d There is no question that the judge was mindful of his obligation to determine whether there was good cause prior to excusing juror 2. And he patiently conducted the requisite hearing to determine whether there was a meritorious reason she could not serve. On the one hand, juror 2 said that she could function impartially, but then again, she also indicated bias in favor of her neighbor. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>398 Mass. 93, 96 (1986) (determination of potential juror prejudice is within sound discretion of trial judge); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>401 Mass. 390, 405-406 (1987) (jurors\u2019 representations or concerns regarding ability to perform impartially are not dispositive). On this record, we cannot conclude that the judge abused his discretion in dismissing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">It was, however, prejudicial error for the judge to refuse to instruct the remaining jurors, in accordance with the <em>Connor </em>decision, that the reason for juror 2\u2019s discharge was personal and unrelated to her views on the case or her relationship to her fellow jurors. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. at 846. The <em>Connor </em>court warned that \u201c[t]he discharge of a deliberating juror is a sensitive undertaking and is fraught with potential for error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843. In <em>Connor, </em>a juror informed the judge after closing arguments, but before the jury charge, that he would prefer not to deliberate because of the personalities of the other jurors. <em>Id. </em>at 842-843. The judge concluded that discharge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>not warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 843. Eleven hours into deliberation, the judge received a note indicating that the juror said he could not abide by his oath. <em>Ibid. </em>The judge inquired of the juror directly, and the juror affirmed that he could not fulfil his obligation. <em>Ibid. </em>Rather than risk a mistrial, the judge summarily discharged the \u201cproblem\u201d juror and substituted an alternate. <em>Ibid. </em>In its decision requiring a reversal of Connor\u2019s convictions, the court was justifiably concerned that the judge conducted no hearing prior to the discharge and made no findings establishing \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 846. In addition to concern about the discharge itself, the court stated that the remaining jurors must not be left to speculate that the discharge was based on the juror\u2019s views on the merits of the case. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In the instant case, the judge\u2019s failure to inform the remaining jurors that the reason for juror 2\u2019s elimination was entirely personal meant precisely that they were left to speculate that juror 2 had been discharged because of her support for the defendants (if that was the jurors\u2019 understanding of what she had been expressing), or to protect her from feared retaliation by the defendants (if that was the jurors\u2019 understanding of what she had been expressing). Both of these interpretations reflect negatively on the defendants and manifest an impermissible intrusion by the judge, intended or not, on the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">This case differs from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dosanjos, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 534-537 (2001), in which we concluded that it was unnecessary for the judge to give a <em>Connor </em>instruction because it would have been no more than a statement of the obvious. Here, the remaining jurors had given conflicting accounts of juror 2\u2019s statements, leaving the ground for her discharge open to speculation. By handling the situation in the manner that he did, the judge created the very risk he was consciously trying to avoid: that his inquiry and ultimate discharge of this juror could be seen as an objection to (or endorsement of) her views of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">2. <em>Other alleged errors. </em>We turn now to those remaining issues argued by the defendants that may arise in the event of a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Prior to trial, Zimmerman, who is indigent, moved for funds</p>\n<p id=\"ABM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>to hire an expert witness on the subject of identification. The motion judge, who was not the trial judge, conducted a hearing and eventually concluded that the request was \u201cexcessive\u201d because the average defendant would not incur the expense \u201cgiven the questionable admissibility of this type of evidence.\u201d Zimmerman did not take an interlocutory appeal of this order under G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Commonwealth contends that the argument is waived. As noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass. 156, 159-160 (1980), \u201c[o]rdinarily this failure would prevent [the defendant] from raising the issue on [direct] appeal.\u201d Because the motion judge had not advised the defendant of his rights under \u00a7 27D as the statute requires, however, and because the statute had never been construed, the court in <em>Lockley </em>entertained the claim. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, supra </em>at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"AU2Z\">Nothing in the record indicates that the motion judge in the instant case advised Zimmerman of his right to appeal her denial of the requested funds. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, the notification prerequisite cannot be dispensed with on the mere assumption that the defendant was aware of his rights because his counsel cited the <em>Lockley </em>case in support of his mo-tian for funds. That assumption would be too facile. \u201cThe Legislature could, and did, express a definite policy as to the method to be followed,\u201d <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>343 Mass. 397, 402 (1961), to alert defendants of their rights in this matter. To avoid the unnecessary controversy which has arisen here and to \u201cprovide a procedural safeguard,\u201d the Legislature opted to require that defendants affirmatively be advised of their interlocutory appellate rights. \u201cWhat occurred was not a compli-anee and was ineffectual.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Nevertheless, on this record we cannot determine whether funds were properly denied. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass. at 161-164, the motion judge did not conduct a sufficient hearing on the matter before making her determination. She does not appear to have considered the desirability or necessity of the requested evidence to Zimmerman\u2019s case, which must be weighed before a judge rules on a motion under G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, supra </em>at 161. We cannot correctly say as matter of law that expert testimony regarding the reliability of eyewitness identifications generally, or in the specific context of cross-racial identifications, does or does not meet the standard of G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27C. The decision whether to admit such evidence must be made on a case-by-case basis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>419 Mass. 815, 818-819 (1995). Similarly, the appropriateness of a jury instruction on interracial identification is a question that may only be answered on the specific record that develops in the event of a retrial. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-21\">Next, the defendant Chaparro claims that the judge erroneously refused, over co-counsel\u2019s objection, to instruct the jury to consider how well the defendants fit the description Heaton-Jones gave of the assailants immediately after the attack. So particularized an instruction, which may suggest a certain view of the evidence, is not required. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Key, </em>381 Mass. 19, 27 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-28\">Neither is there merit to Chaparro\u2019s claim of error in the judge\u2019s allowance of Heaton-Jones\u2019s testimony of his extreme confidence in his identification of the defendants. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santoli, </em>424 Mass. 837, 846 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drane, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 913, 914 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-32\">We do not address the claimed errors in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument or in the judge\u2019s handling of the jury\u2019s indication that it could not reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-33\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-34\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-34\">Chaparro also pleaded guilty to a charge of illegal ammunition possession, and a conviction of receiving stolen property was dismissed. Neither of these dispositions is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b243-29\">The pertinent part of G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-30\">\u201cIn any case where the court denies a request for. . . payment by the commonwealth of fees and costs,... the applicant may take an appeal as hereafter provided. If the matter arises in the superior . . . court. . . , the appeal shall be to a single justice of the appeals court at the next sitting thereof .... Upon being notified of the denial the applicant shall also be advised of his right of appeal, and he shall have seven days thereafter to file a notice of appeal. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
