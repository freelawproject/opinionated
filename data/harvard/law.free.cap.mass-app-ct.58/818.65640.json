In allowing summary judgment for the plaintiff, a Superior Court judge ruled that the plaintiff was not required to provide a defense or indemnify Trimble because the incident fell within the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion in the policy. On appeal, Button claims that summary judgment was inappropriate because of the existence of material issues of fact and of ambiguities in the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion clause which should have been construed against the insurer. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">We recite those facts that are not in dispute. At the time of the incident, Button and Trimble were employed by CliniTech Services, Inc., where Button worked as a lab assistant and Trimble as a phlebotomist. On September 27, 1995, Button was working at her desk at CliniTech\u2019s facility when Trimble arrived there to deliver lab specimens for processing. After delivering the specimens, Trimble walked past Button, who was engrossed in her work. Trimble poked Button to get her attention and said, \u201cHello.\u201d Startled, Button fell backwards off her chair and suffered a severe back injury. At the time of Button\u2019s injury, Trimble was living in her parents\u2019 home. Her parents were insured through a homeowners\u2019 policy issued by the plaintiff. The pertinent provisions of the policy read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">\u201cSECTION n - LOSSES WE DO NOT COVER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\">\u201c2. bodily injury or property damage arising out of or in connection with your business activities. This exclusion applies but is not limited to an act or omission, regardless of its nature or circumstance, involving a service or duty rendered, promised, owed, or implied to be provided because of the nature of the business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Under the general definition of the policy, \u201c \u2018[business\u2019 or \u2018business purposes\u2019 means: 1. Any full or part time activity of any kind engaged in for economic gain, and the use of any part of any premises for such purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">A liability insurer has a duty to defend its insured in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>underlying action if the complaint in that action is \u201c \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that. . . state[s] ... a claim covered by the policy terms.\u201d <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). There is, on the other hand, no duty to defend a claim that is specifically excluded from coverage. See <em>Camp Dresser &amp; McKee, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 322-323 (1991). The insurer has the burden of proving that the exclusionary clause applies. <em>Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hercules Bldg. &amp; Wrecking Co., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 298, 302 (1993). Here, Button argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because the applicability of the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion presented a disputed material issue of fact, namely whether Button\u2019s injuries \u201carose out of\u201d or were \u201cin connection with\u201d Trimble\u2019s business activities. Button\u2019s argument rests on the premise that, at the time that Trimble poked Button, Trimble was not committing an act in furtherance of her employer\u2019s business. Rather, Button claims that Trimble\u2019s act interfered with Button\u2019s performance of her work for their employer in violation of a prescribed policy of her employer which prohibited conduct that is personally offensive or threatening, or that interferes with the work effectiveness of employees. In making this argument, Button is seeking to apply those principles which govern the determination of vicarious liability of employers for the intentional torts of their employees. We are dealing here, however, with the determination of insurance coverage, which is dependent upon the language of an insurance contract. Under the policy, business activity is defined as activities \u201cengaged in for economic gain.\u201d It also embraces a service \u201cpromised [or] owed\u201d because of the nature of the business. It is undisputed that at the time of the incident Trimble had just delivered lab specimens for processing at her employer\u2019s place of employment. Whether this activity is viewed as a service promised or owed because of the nature of her employment or an activity engaged in for economic gain, it cannot be said that the incident did not \u201carise out of\u201d or \u201cin connection with\u201d Trimble\u2019s engaging in a business activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The terms \u201carising out of\u201d and \u201cin connection with\u201d are not be to be construed narrowly but are read expansively in insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>anee contracts. See <em>Rischitelli </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>423 Mass. 703, 704 (1996); <em>New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 726 (1996). \u201cArising out of\u201d is ordinarily held to mean \u201coriginating from, growing out of, flowing from, incident to or having connection with\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Dinsmoor, </em>892 F.2d. 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1989). \u201cIn connection with\u201d is ordinarily held to have even a broader meaning than \u201carising out of\u201d and is defined as related to, linked to, or associated with. See <em>Cameron Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Skidmore, </em>633 S.W.2d 752, 753 (Mo. App. 1982); <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Nunn, </em>114 N.C. App. 604, 607-608 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Given the expansive meaning of \u201carising out of\u201d and \u201cin connection with,\u201d it is clear that the business pursuits exclusion applies because the alleged battery inflicted by Trimble is associated with, related to, and linked to Trimble\u2019s performing work for her employer. It is incontrovertible that if Trimble had not been performing a task for her employer she would not have been on her employer\u2019s premises at that time and place and the injury to Button would not have occurred. Cf. <em>Worcester Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fells Acres Day Sch., Inc., </em>408 Mass. 393, 412 (1990) (claims against two employees of a child care facility alleging injuries to children as the result of the employees\u2019 negligent failure to protect and prevent injury from sexual molestation to the children under their care fell within the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion of their respective homeowner\u2019s insurance policies); <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Finnell, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 701, 702-703 (1996) (\u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusion under a homeowner\u2019s policy barred coverage for a child\u2019s injuries that occurred while the insured in her own home was babysitting the child but was preparing her own lunch).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Button contends that the \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d exclusionary clause is ambiguous standing alone, when read in the context of the entire insurance contract, or as applied to the subject matter, and must be strictly construed against the insurer. \u201cHowever, an ambiguity is not created simply because a controversy exists between parties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to\u201d the other party\u2019s interpretation. <em>Jefferson Ins. Co. of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Holy-oke, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 475 (1987). The interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the exclusionary clause is a \u201cquestion of law for the trial judge, and then for the reviewing court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982). In our opinion, the words contained in the exclusionary clause are free from doubt standing alone or when the insurance contract is read as a whole or as applied to the subject matter. As such, those words are to be \u201cconstrued \u2018in their usual and ordinary sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 454, 457 &amp; n.2 (1999), quoting from <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Hermitage Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 316, 320 (1995). Business or business purposes is defined in the contract. That definition comports with the usual meaning ascribed to a business activity, namely \u201can activity engaged in for the purpose of gain or profit.\u201d See <em>Newell-Blais Post #443, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., </em>396 Mass. 633, 636 (1986). As noted, when the usual and ordinary meaning is ascribed to the terms \u201carising out of\u201d and \u201cin connection with\u201d set forth <em>supra, </em>in conjunction with business activity, it is clear that Button\u2019s injury arose out of or in connection with Trimble\u2019s business activity, resulting in a lack of coverage under Trimble\u2019s parents\u2019 homeowner\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">At oral argument, Button also argued that the definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d or \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d in the business pursuits exclusion restricts the exclusion to business activity engaged in by the insured on the insured\u2019s premises. However, that construction makes no sense when the contract is read as a whole, for the contract provides optional coverage which, when purchased by an insured for certain business pursuits, specifically excludes therefrom business pursuits for one acting as a member of the faculty or teaching staff of any school or college or providing care anywhere to one or more persons for economic gain. Those exclusions would be redundant or unnecessary if the term \u201cbusiness\u201d under the policy was limited solely to an income earning activity on the insured\u2019s premises. We, thus, reject Button\u2019s interpretation. See <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mamell, </em>398 Mass. 240, 245 (1986), quoting from <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assurance Corp., </em>343 Mass. 354, 357 (1961) (\u201can interpretation [that] gives a reasonable meaning to all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>the provisions of a contract is to be preferred to one which leaves a part useless or inexplicable\u201d). Instead, the definition of \u201cbusiness\u201d or \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d must be read as twofold. It embraces not only \u201c[a]ny full or part time activity of any kind engaged in for economic gain\u201d but also \u201cthe use of any part of any premises for such purposes.\u201d Trimble\u2019s parents had not purchased the optional coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Further, it is a \u201clong-standing rule of construction that the favored interpretation of an insurance policy is one which \u2018best effectuates the main manifested design of the parties.\u2019 Clearly, the manifest design of homeowners\u2019 insurance is to protect homeowners from risks associated with the home and activities related to the home.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>King </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>359 Mass. 46, 50 (1971). Here, the battery resulting in Button\u2019s injury is in no way associated with the home or related to it. Cf. <em>Worcester Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fell Acres Day Sch., Inc., </em>408 Mass. at 412. Accordingly, Trimble could not reasonably have expected protection under her homeowner\u2019s policy from a claim arising out of or in connection with her work. Summary judgment for the plaintiff was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-14\">Patricia Trimble was named as a defendant in the complaint. However, she did not file an appearance or answer in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
