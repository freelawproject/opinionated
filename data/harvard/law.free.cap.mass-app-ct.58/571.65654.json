L. c. 30A appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiffs, Thomas Tierney and Doris Marah, challenge a Superior Court judge\u2019s decision on cross motions for judgment on the pleadings. The judge upheld the decision of the Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) approving the plan of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (JHM) to convert from a privately held mutual insurance company to a publicly traded stock company (plan), John Hancock Financial Services (JHFS). The judge also dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 related claims against the Hancock defendants for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of G. L. c. 93A, the Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">The plaintiffs argue that the commissioner\u2019s approval of the plan violated G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 19E, the statute governing such conversions, for the following reasons: (1) the aggregate compensation provided to policyholders (also called \u201cmembers\u201d) under the plan was inadequate; (2) the formula used in the plan to allocate consideration among policyholders was unfair and effected an unconstitutional taking of their property; and (3) the segregation of members\u2019 policies into a \u201cclosed block\u201d deprived them of possible increases in future dividends. Last, the plaintiffs appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s conversion of the Hancock defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss counts II through X into a motion for summary judgment and the dismissal of those counts. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>In 1998, JHM sought to convert from a mutual company to a stock company, pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 19E, through a process known as demutualization. Accordingly, JHM submitted a reorganization plan to the commissioner. In November, 1998, the commissioner formed a working group of Division of Insurance staff members and outside consultants, including an actuarial firm, an accounting firm, an investment banking firm, and a law firm, to provide independent advice and assistance in evaluating the plan, pursuant to \u00a7 19E. The working group reviewed proposed drafts of the plan and made numerous recommendations to JHM for improvement to the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">On August 31, 1999, JHM\u2019s board of directors adopted the plan and sought approval from the commissioner. The plan proposed made JHM a subsidiary of a holding company and provided eligible policyholders with stock, cash, or policy credits in exchange for their interests in the mutual company. In September, 1999, JHM sent eligible policyholders a demutual-ization package consisting of a policyholder information statement, an information guide, a policyholder record, a ballot, taxpayer identification, and a cash/stock compensation card.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On November 17 and 18, 1999, a public hearing on the plan was held. Both plaintiffs submitted written materials. Tierney spoke, as did counsel for Marah.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">On November 30, 1999, a special meeting of policyholders was held to vote on the plan, as required by \u00a7 19E. JHM reported to the commissioner that 93.72 percent of the votes cast by policyholders were in favor of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">On December 9, 1999, the commissioner issued a decision approving the plan, deeming it in compliance with G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 19E. The commissioner found that the plan provided eligible policyholders with appropriate consideration in exchange for their membership interests in JHM and that the allocation of consideration under the plan was based upon a fair and reasonable formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The plaintiffs brought this complaint on January 7, 2000, seeking judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). JHM implemented the plan on January 27, 2000. Subsequently, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to include damages caused by the plan\u2019s implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>After a hearing, the trial judge allowed the commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, denied the plaintiffs\u2019 cross motion, and allowed the Hancock defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all other counts. The judge concluded that the commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, was not based on an error of law, and was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">2. <em>Aggregate value of JHM </em>\u2014 <em>appropriate consideration. </em>The commissioner concluded that the plan provided all policyholders with appropriate consideration. We agree. There was substantial evidence that there was appropriate consideration based on a fair and reasonable formula. Such evidence included an anti-takeover provision in the demutualization plan as allowed by \u00a7 19E; written and oral testimony that the policyholders received JHM\u2019s entire surplus; and reports by both JHM\u2019s outside financial advisor and the commission\u2019s own independent financial advisor that the policyholders received appropriate, fair, and reasonable consideration. The plaintiffs have failed to present any evidence, beyond mere conclusions, that the plan did not provide them with appropriate consideration. See <em>Pinecrest Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>MacMillan, </em>425 Mass. 70, 75 (1997) (absent powerful evidence to the contrary, expert technical knowledge of an administrative agency should not be disturbed).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The plaintiffs offer two reasons to support their claim that the commissioner erred in concluding that the plan provided appropriate consideration. First, the plaintiffs contend that the plan\u2019s definition of \u201cmember interests\u201d was too narrowly construed under \u00a7 19E(3). Second, the plaintiffs argue that, by determining policyholders\u2019 compensation by means of an initial public offering (IPO), the plan undervalued JHM.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">a. <em>Member interests. </em>The plan compensated members for the loss of their right to elect the directors, and for their portion of the company\u2019s surplus. Members were also assured continued dividends into the future, after demutualization. The plan is consistent with G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 19E(3), as amended by St. 1993, c. 226, \u00a7 14A, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201cIn exchange for all membership interests in the company, such plan shall give each eligible policyholder appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>consideration . . . [which] shall be based upon the insurer\u2019s entire surplus . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The plan defined membership interests as \u201call the rights or interests in respect of each insurance policy and annuity contract of [JHM] including, but not limited to, any right to vote and any rights which may exist with regard to the surplus of [JHM] not apportioned or declared prior to the Effective Date by the Board for policyholder dividends, including any such rights in liquidation or reorganization of [JHM], but shall not include any other benefits, values, guarantees, dividend rights or other rights expressly conferred by an insurance policy or annuity contract.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The plan\u2019s definition of member interests is consistent with independent industry materials submitted by the parties with the record appendix, which consistently describe membership interests as principally including voting rights, a right to surplus, and a right to a share in the assets upon liquidation of the company. See Actuarial Standards Board, Allocation of Policyholder Consideration in Mutual Life Insurance Company Demutualizations, Exposure Draft 2 (April 1999) (Exposure Draft) (\u201c[t]ypical membership rights include liquidation rights and voting rights\u201d); Dye, Distributing Consideration to Policyholders, 648 Practicing L. Inst. 75, 81 (1993) (Dye) (\u201c[s]uch [membership] rights include [i] the right to vote on matters submitted to a vote of policyholders and [ii] the right to share in the distribution of assets of the mutual, after provision for all liabilities, upon liquidation\u201d); Society of Actuaries, Report of the Task Force on Mutual Life Insurance Company Conversion, 39 Transactions 295, 300 n.3 (1988) (SOA Task Force Report) (\u201c[m] ember ship rights include, principally, the right to receive dividends [surplus], to elect directors and to receive the net value of the company in the event of its liquidation\u201d). See also <em>Keystone Auto. Club Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>missioner of Int. Rev., </em>122 F.2d 886, 890 (3d Cir. 1941), cert. denied, 315 U.S. 814 (1942); <em>Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>142 F.2d 344, 346, 348 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 323 U.S. 729 (1944); <em>Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Herold, </em>198 F. 199, 206-212 (D.N.J. 1912), aff\u2019d, 201 F. 918 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 231 U.S. 755 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the plan did not compensate them for <em>all </em>of their membership interests as required by \u00a7 19E(3). Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that the plan failed to provide consideration for their \u201cownership interests,\u201d alternatively characterized as beneficial, equitable, or legal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">There was no error. \u201c[PJolicyholders, unlike stockholders in a corporation, do not have an ownership interest that can be transferred to others[;] they nevertheless have a financial interest in the mutual insurance company. Policyholders are entitled to participate in the annual surplus of the company, which represents excess premiums or overcharges paid by the policyholders.\u201d <em>Harhen </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 793, 808 n.14 (1999), <em>S.C., </em>431 Mass. 838 (2000) (rev\u2019d on other grounds). The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a demutualization is equivalent to a liquidation, and thus, the aggregate distribution should have been larger, is also unavailing. See <em>UNUM Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 F.3d 501, 516 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 810 (1998) (\u201c[t]he very nature of a demutualization fundamentally distinguishes it from a liquidation in that the insurer is still in business after the conversion is complete\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Here, the plan provided policyholders consideration for their membership interests, as required by the statute. We conclude that the policyholders were not entitled to a distribution of assets, because there was no liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">b. <em>Initial public offering. </em>The commissioner approved a process that relied on an IPO containing anti-takeover provisions to determine the aggregate value of members\u2019 interests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>For policyholders receiving their compensation through cash or policy credits, the plan contained a \u201ctop-up\u201d provision, by which the value assigned to their interests was limited to the average IPO stock price paid within the first twenty days of trading, up to a maximum of 120 percent of the IPO price. The plaintiffs contend that these limitations unfairly depressed the value of their interests: the anti-takeover provisions, which prohibited acquisition of a controlling interest in JHFS, thereby removed from the marketplace the value represented by the amount investors would be willing to pay if they could gain control of the company.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To remedy this, the plaintiffs advocate the addition of a premium<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the value established by the IPO in order to achieve a fair aggregate value for their interests. Further, the plaintiffs argue that the market experience in the first twenty days of trading would not be representative of the stock\u2019s true market value, which could not be determined until after the anti-takeover provisions expired. This created what the plaintiffs have called a \u201cmarket discount\u201d of their interests, which, they assert, could be remedied by establishing the company\u2019s value by means of an appraisal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Analogizing themselves to dissenting stockholders of a company being acquired, the plaintiffs refer to case law in which the \u201cfair value,\u201d see G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 92, as amended by St. 1983, c. 522, \u00a7 22, of the dissenting stockholders\u2019 shares is determined by statutory appraisal rights. The plaintiffs cite the \u201cDelaware block\u201d method, which factors market value, eam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ings value, and net asset value, and assigns a percentage to each of these in a manner that fits the particular company, as an appropriate model for determining the \u201cfair value\u201d of a company. See <em>Piemonte </em>v. <em>New Boston Garden Corp., </em>377 Mass. 719, 724 (1979); <em>Sarrouf </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 542, 547-548 &amp; nn.8, 9 (1986); <em>BNE Mass. Corp. </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 194-195 &amp; n.8 (1992). Under this approach, actual market value (i.e., the historic price of stock shares) is a relevant factor in determining \u201cfair value\u201d only if there is an established market for a particular stock. <em>Piemonte </em>v. <em>New Boston Garden Corp., </em>377 Mass. at 725. Since there was no established market for JHFS, the plaintiffs argue that use of the IPO to establish the value of members\u2019 interests was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We note first that, by the terms of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 30(2), the appraisal rights provided for in G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7\u00a7 86-98, are inapplicable to insurance companies. Second, while the Legislature could have required an appraisal to determine the aggregate value to be distributed to policyholders, see, e.g., the California and Wisconsin demutualization statutes, discussed in Dye, <em>supra </em>at 101-103, it did not do so. Rather, our demutual-ization statute requires that eligible policyholders be given \u201cappropriate consideration\u201d for their interests, determined under \u201ca fair and reasonable formula approved by the commissioner.\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 19E(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Although the commissioner found that the plan provided all policyholders with appropriate consideration, she made no explicit findings on the fairness of using an IPO to determine the aggregate value of policyholders\u2019 interests. Nor does it appear that she solicited expert advice on the question in this proceeding. For example, the firm of Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. was retained by the commissioner to provide \u201can opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Eligible Policyholders of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company ... as a group, of the exchange of the aggregate Policyholders\u2019 Membership Interests for shares of Holding Company Common Stock, cash and Policy Credits, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization . . . .\u201d While opining that the plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>was fair to eligible policyholders, Wasserstein Perella\u2019s opinion letter, prepared for the commissioner and dated September 1, 1999, also stated, \u201cYou have not asked for our opinion and we do not express any opinion as to . . . (4) the terms of an IPO, if any, the IPO Price and, in the absence of an IPO, such other price used to determine distributions to Eligible Policyholders pursuant to the Plan, or the fair market value of any shares of Holding Company Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Plan or the price at which the Holding Company Common Stock issued in connection with the Plan or pursuant to the IPO will trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Notwithstanding the absence of any opinion on the fairness of the IPO terms, Wasserstein Perella had provided the commissioner with documentation illustrating what it called an \u201cIPO discount,\u201d which appears to be yet another term for the alleged undervaluing of their interests complained of by the plaintiffs, and which the commissioner had acknowledged in her earlier decision on the demutualization of the State Mutual Life Assurance Company. See the commissioner\u2019s findings, conclusions, and order in Plan of Reorganization of State Mutual Life Assurance Company of America, Docket No. F-95-1, at 29 (Aug. 2, 1995) <em>(State Mutual)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em>: </em>\u201c[Tjhere is often a discount to the market value of a company in the pricing of an IPO . . . .\u201d The reasons for such a discount were listed in the Wasserstein Perella documents,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as was the history of periodic increases in the stock prices of demutualized life insurance companies for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>one year after their initial public offerings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The question of market increases after the date of the IPO offering was addressed in the commissioner\u2019s decision in the instant matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201c[T]he Plan\u2019s \u2018top-up\u2019 provision is beneficial to eligible policyholders because it allows those who receive cash or policy credits to share in the benefit of any short-term appreciation in the stock price without being subjected to the down-side risk of stock ownership. We note that, according to Hancock, it is the only insurer to date to offer such a benefit in its demutualization plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 essential argument that they should receive some sort of premium above the IPO value was addressed by the commissioner, who found that the twenty-day/120 percent \u201ctop-up\u201d provision served that purpose. Whether the period should have been longer, or the percent higher, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>was a matter left to the commissioner\u2019s wide discretion under \u00a7 19E(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">As noted above, the commissioner made no explicit findings on the broader question of the fairness of using an IPO (as against, e.g., an appraisal) as the means to establish the value of policyholders\u2019 interests. However, in her decision in the <em>State Mutual </em>proceeding (which is part of the administrative record before us), the commissioner made extensive findings on the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\u201cAs a means of determining the price per share of the common stock, I find that the IPO is a fair and reasonable basis on which to calculate the policyholder consideration and policy credits under the Plan. The price per share reflects the value that investors are willing to pay for the stock following informational and marketing efforts by management and underwriters, a review of the offering prospectus and other materials, consultation with industry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>experts and research analysts, and a comparison of the Company to comparable companies and alternative investment opportunities as well as taking into account other relevant financial considerations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201cI find that the IPO is a fair and reasonable method of determining the value of the policyholder consideration, both individually and in the aggregate, and the participation of the Division\u2019s financial Consultants<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark> will insure that the pricing process will be conducted in an open manner, consistent with industry practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">We read the commissioner\u2019s decision in the matter at hand as having implicitly adopted her findings in <em>State Mutual </em>that the IPO was a \u201cfair and reasonable method of determining the value of the policyholder consideration.\u201d Thus, the commissioner\u2019s overall finding of fairness is supported by substantial evidence in the record. See <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>408 Mass. 363, 373 (1990) (\u201cthe commissioner\u2019s implicit adoption of the findings [s]he made in [her earlier] decision was [not] impermissible\u201d). Cf. <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>406 Mass. 217, 221 (1989) (in making finding on public convenience and necessity, department of public utilities could rely on finding made in prior department decision regarding benefits of increased competition in radio paging market).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">3. <em>Allocation among policyholders - \u201chistoric-plus\u201d versus \u201chistoric-only\u201d formula. </em>Approximately eighty percent of the consideration distributed to eligible policyholders (the so-called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u201cvariable component\u201d)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was determined using the historic-plus methodology, which, the commissioner explained, \u201ctakes into account each policyholder\u2019s past contribution to [the mutual insurance company\u2019s] surplus as reflected on its most recent annual financial statement, and a projection of that policyholder\u2019s future contribution to surplus.\u201d The same methodology had been used in the <em>State Mutual </em>case and, the commissioner found, \u201cin every major United States demutualization since 1990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the commissioner violated the requirement of \u00a7 19E(3) that the allocation formula be \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d when she approved JHM\u2019s use of the historic-plus formula, and that, in any event, \u00a7 19E(3) requires use of the historic-only formula, which considers only policyholders\u2019 past contributions to surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">a. <em>Fairness. </em>In a footnote to their brief, the plaintiffs argue that, by factoring in expected future contributions to surplus under the historic-plus formula, the plan favored larger, more recent policyholders. Neither JHM nor the commissioner disputes this assertion. However, the commissioner noted that, \u201c[b]ecause the aggregate consideration is constant, any change in the method of allocation would necessarily provide more consideration to some policyholders and less to others.\u201d The commissioner cited her earlier decision in <em>State Mutual, </em>in which she concluded, \u201c[A]ny method of allocation necessarily favors some policyholders over others. . . . The requisite standard under Section 19E[1] is that the Plan be \u2018not prejudicial\u2019 to policyholders, i.e., policyholders as a group. Applying this standard of review to the entire policyholder population requires the Commissioner to harmonize the competing interests of individual policyholders. Therefore, simply because a method of allocation favors some policyholders over others (as do both the historic only and the historic plus prospective methods) does not compel the conclusion that the method is prejudicial to policyholders.\u201d <em>State Mutual, supra </em>at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The commissioner credited the testimony of JHM\u2019s expert, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>who opined that the historic-plus methodology was \u201cintrinsically fair\u201d and \u201cthe only basis that is intellectually supportable as fair.\u201d The commissioner further found that his opinion was supported by the 1999 Actuarial Standards Board Exposure Draft as well as the SOA Task Force Report, which stated that the historic-only methodology was \u201cnot a useful method,\u201d that the task force did not believe the historic-only method \u201cproduce[d] a theoretically correct measure of policyholder contributions, in the aggregate or policy-by-policy,\u201d and that allocation of policyholder consideration should be \u201cbased primarily on the relative contributions of policyholders to the surplus of the company\u201d and such contributions should include both past and anticipated contributions to surplus. The historic-plus method was also endorsed by Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, the actuarial firm retained by the commissioner to review the plan\u2019s proposed allocations to eligible policyholders. Tillinghast advised the commissioner that JHM\u2019s \u201cuse of the contribution principle is consistent with the precedent set in prior U.S. de-mutualizations,\u201d and that, \u201c[although the allocation of the variable component was based solely on historic contributions to surplus in two of the earlier, less significant U.S. demutualiza-tions, historic plus prospective contributions have been used in the more recent conversions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The commissioner found that the evidence offered by the plaintiffs did not refute the conclusion that the allocation formula was fair and reasonable. Even their witness (Hunt) had testified that the plan was not unfair to policyholders as a group. Hunt, the commissioner found, merely testified that he believed the historic-only method was more fair, that use of the historic-plus methodology in other demutualizations did not make it more fair, and that he did not understand how the authors of the SOA Task Force Report had determined that the historic-only method would penalize most of the current individual policyholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In reviewing the commissioner\u2019s decision concerning a choice of methodology, we \u201cgive due weight to [her] experience, technical competence, specialized knowledge, and discretionary authority. Deference to the commissioner\u2019s expertise and discretion is particularly appropriate when reviewing her choice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>methodology.\u201d <em>Automobile Ins. Bureau of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>430 Mass. 285, 296 (1999) (citations omitted).

Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 136, 138-139 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">b. <em>Required use of historic-only formula. </em>The plaintiffs next argue that both the legislative history of the statute and the text of \u00a7 19E(3) require the use of the historic-only formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Section 19E(3) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\u201c[S]uch [demutualization] plan shall give each eligible policyholder appropriate consideration. Said consideration shall be determinable under a fair and reasonable formula approved by the commissioner, and <em>shall be based upon the insurer\u2019s entire surplus </em>as shown by the insurer\u2019s financial statement most recently filed with the Commissioner . . . but . . . <em>without taking into account the value of nonadmitted assets or insurance business in force.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The plaintiffs first point to the 1985 demutualization of the Union Mutual Life Insurance Company in Maine, under a statutory provision similar to \u00a7 19E(3), where the historic-only formula was approved. See Plan of Recapitalization and Conversion of Union Mutual Life Insurance Company, Final Decision and Order (Aug. 8, 1986) <em>(Union Mutual). </em>However, as the commissioner found in her decision, the insurance commissioner in <em>Union Mutual </em>ruled only that the Maine statute <em>permitted </em>use of the historic-only approach to apportion consideration among policyholders, not that such an approach was <em>required. </em>The Maine commissioner ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">\u201c[The conversion statute] permits the relative apportionment of the policyholders\u2019 equity in a mutual insurer based solely upon statutory surplus and requires, at a minimum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>an aggregate distribution to eligible policyholders equal to an insurer\u2019s statutory surplus. <em>[Union Mutual, supra </em>at 8.] . . . Although the contribution to surplus principle permits other approaches ... I find that it is not inappropriate for the Plan to use contribution to statutory surplus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Indeed, in an analysis of the language in H. 390, the House bill that ultimately became \u00a7 19E(3), the Legislature\u2019s Joint Commission on Insurance commented that the methodology approved by the Maine commissioner in <em>Union Mutual </em>\u201cmay not be \u2018appropriate consideration\u2019 in every case. It will depend on the financial condition and post-conversion prospects of the reorganized insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The commissioner adopted her findings in <em>State Mutual, </em>interpreting the statute\u2019s text \u201cshall be based upon the insurer\u2019s entire surplus,\u201d as referring to the aggregate consideration, rather than the allocation to individual policyholders. This is in accord with the Maine commissioner\u2019s interpretation in <em>Union Mutual, </em>noted in the Legislature\u2019s Joint Commission on Insurance report on H. 390, that the statute \u201crequires, at a minimum, an aggregate distribution to eligible policyholders equal to an insurer\u2019s statutory surplus.\u201d In <em>State Mutual </em>at 46-47 n.32, the commissioner examined the language of numerous earlier de-mutualization statutes, finding that they \u201crequired that policyholder consideration be \u2018based upon <em>not less than </em>the insurer\u2019s entire surplus,\u2019 \u201d suggesting that \u201cthe purpose of the \u2018based upon\u2019 language is to ensure that not less than the entire surplus of a company is given to eligible policyholders, and, therefore, requires that aggregate consideration, as opposed to allocation of consideration, be based upon the insurer\u2019s entire surplus.\u201d The plaintiffs have made no argument that the aggregate compensation was based on less than JHM\u2019s entire surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Moreover, even if the term \u201cbased upon\u201d did apply to allocation of consideration, the commissioner observed that the statute does not require that consideration be based <em>\u201conly </em>upon the insurer\u2019s entire surplus.\u201d We agree. If the Legislature had intended such a result, \u201cit presumably would have provided for it with some clarity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. <em>772, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>775 (2000). Thus, the statute leaves to the commissioner\u2019s discretion the allocation of consideration among policyholders under a \u201cfair and reasonable formula,\u201d which we have already addressed. See section 3(a), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Last, the plaintiffs argued to the commissioner that the statute\u2019s exclusion of \u201cnonadmitted assets\u201d and \u201cinsurance business in force,\u201d \u201cprohibits the reliance upon business plan projections, good will, and future profits, and thus precludes the use of the historic-plus methodology.\u201d The commissioner adhered to her decision in <em>State Mutual, </em>where she interpreted this language in the statute to mean that nonadmitted assets and insurance business in force must be excluded from the surplus upon which policyholder consideration is calculated, and found that this proviso was complied with in the demutualization plan.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As this interpretation comports with the statute\u2019s plain meaning, and the commissioner\u2019s interpretation is entitled to substantial deference, there is no reason to disturb it. See <em>Dube </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 21, 23-24 (2000), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">4. <em>\u201cClosed block.\u201d </em>Although not required by \u00a7 19E,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the plan provided for the creation of a \u201cclosed block,\u201d a mechanism, the commissioner explained in her decision, designed \u201cto protect the reasonable policy dividend expectations of individual policyholders with certain dividend-paying policies or contracts.\u201d A closed block segregates the assets and policies therein from the rest of the newly capitalized public company, thus protecting them from market forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The plaintiffs complained to the commissioner that, as proposed in the plan, the closed block was not sufficiently funded. The commissioner found, however, that the plaintiffs produced no evidence to support this contention; the plaintiffs\u2019 sole witness on the issue stated that he was not an expert on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>closed block matters. Moreover, the plan requires Hancock to satisfy its closed block obligations out of the company\u2019s general funds, should the closed block funding be insufficient. In addition, the plan provides for ongoing monitoring of the closed block by the commissioner. The plaintiffs, therefore, have failed to provide evidence sufficient to overcome the commissioner\u2019s finding that the \u201ccomposition, funding, and proposed operation of the Closed Block are fair, reasonable, and not prejudicial to the policyholders or to the insuring public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In their complaint to the Superior Court, the plaintiffs argued for the first time that the plan\u2019s use of a closed block violated their contractual rights because the segregation of their interests would deprive them of the benefits of any cost-cutting or expense reductions in the company that otherwise could result in increased dividends. Now, for the first time on appeal, the plaintiffs argue that this alleged contractual violation, in turn, constituted a violation of \u00a7 19E. Since the latter argument was not raised in the Superior Court, it is waived. <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn, P.C. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>431 Mass. 655, 674 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Even were we to consider the merits of the argument, it would fail, as there was no contract violation. Each member\u2019s policy states that \u201cthe proportion of divisible surplus accruing upon this policy shall be ascertained annually,\u201d and that the policy \u201cwill be entitled to the share, if any, of the divisible surplus as the Company shall annually determine and apportion to it.\u201d The policies do not promise the members that the assumptions on which the dividend expectations are based will never change. See generally <em>White Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>313 Mass. 165, 168-169 (1943). Furthermore, the plaintiffs have not made us aware of any authority to support their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">5. <em>Dismissal of the common-law and statutory claims. </em>In counts II through IX, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief against the Hancock defendants, alleging breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. In count X, the plaintiffs alleged violations of G. L. c. 93A. The defendants moved to dismiss these counts pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). Relying on his rulings on count I (the c. 30A claim), the judge treated the motion as one for summary judgment and allowed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>We agree with the judge that the \u201cclaims in [cjounts II through X are really nothing more than indirect challenges to the [cjommissioner\u2019s [djecision.\u201d In this case, the contract, fiduciary duty, and c. 93A claims were inextricably intertwined with the c. 30A claim, and could not be decided \u201cwithout application of the commissioner\u2019s specialized knowledge.\u201d <em>Liability Investigative Fund Effort, Inc. </em>v. <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assn., </em>409 Mass. 734, 748 (1991) <em>(LIFE).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The contract claims (counts II-VII) allege that the conversion from mutual to publicly-held corporation violated JHM\u2019s charter, and that particular features of the Hancock conversion (e.g., closed block, historic-plus methodology) violated both the charter and the provisions of members\u2019 individual policies. However, by enacting the conversion statute, the Legislature effectively superseded the provisions of the charter and individual policies. Indeed, the JHM charter was itself created by legislation, see St. 1862, c. 125, which provided that the corporation would be \u201csubject to . . . all other [legislative] acts which are or may be in force relative to such companies.\u201d Thus, absent a claim that the conversion statute itself violated their rights, the plaintiffs must focus their contract claims on alleged violations of \u00a7 19E. See <em>Municipal Light Co. of Ashburnham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 171, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 866 (1993), quoting from <em>New Orleans Waterworks Co. </em>v. <em>Louisiana Sugar Ref. Co., </em>125 U.S. 18, 30 (1888) (impairment of contract clause in United States Constitution concerns \u201cthe legislative power of the State, and not. . . [the] decisions of its courts, or the acts of administrative or executive boards or officers, or the doings of corporations or individuals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that particular features of the conversion plan violated their individual policies are merely reiterations of the objections raised in the administrative proceeding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The breach of fiduciary duty claim (count VIII), reduced to its essence, alleges that the conversion plan was unfair to members. This question was, of course, addressed in great detail by the commissioner, as the conversion statute charged her with determining that the plan was \u201cfair and reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>able\u201d before she could approve it. Thus, adjudication of both the fiduciary duty claim and the contract claims is \u201cdependent on the substance of the commissioner\u2019s determinations during the [administrative] proceedings.\u201d <em>LIFE, </em>409 Mass, at 748. The claims were thus properly dismissed. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">As to the c. 93A claim (count X), for the most part, it too boils down to an assertion that the policyholders were not adequately compensated or that the company\u2019s charter or members\u2019 policies were violated. See our discussion, <em>supra. </em>In addition, the complaint asserts that the information packet \u2014 provided by JHM to its members as a basis for the members\u2019 vote on whether to approve the plan \u2014 was misleading, insufficient to allow members to cast an informed vote, and designed to induce a positive vote. (It may be recalled that the plan was approved by 93.72 percent of the votes cast.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">It appears from the record that the plaintiffs complained to the commissioner about the adequacy of the information packet, and that she addressed their criticisms in her decision, finding that the packet was not misleading. We note in particular the commissioner\u2019s responses to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints regarding the adequacy of the packet\u2019s disclosures concerning the percent of policyholders who would receive cash as opposed to stock in the conversion; the specifics of the anti-takeover provision; and policyholders\u2019 entitlement to compensation even if they voted against the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The commissioner was correct in noting that \u00a7 19E \u201cdoes not specify the scope of the notice or information that an insurer seeking to demutualize must provide to its policyholders.\u201d However, the commissioner is not without experience in determining whether information disseminated by an insurance company is misleading or contains misrepresentations. See G. L. c. 176D. Here, because the commissioner\u2019s determinations with respect to the particulars of the information packet disclosures are so intertwined with her statutory mandate to determine whether the plan is fair, reasonable, and nonprejudicial, we conclude that deference to the experience and expertise of the commissioner in these circumstances is appropriate and the c. 93A claim was properly dismissed. Compare <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>377 Mass. 217, 221 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>(1979), quoting from 3 Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 19.01, at 5 (1958) (the court \u201cshould not act upon subject matter that is peculiarly within the agency\u2019s specialized field without talcing into account what the agency has to offer\u201d); <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 290, 304 (1976), quoting from <em>Far East Conference </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 570, 574-575 (1952) (\u201creview by the judiciary . . . more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization, by insight gained through experience, and by more flexible procedure\u201d).

Linhares Co. </em>v. <em>Reliance Ins. Co., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 617, 622 (1976) (court may refer c. 93A allegations to Commissioner of Insurance \u201cfor initial determination whether an unfair practice has been committed\u201d).
