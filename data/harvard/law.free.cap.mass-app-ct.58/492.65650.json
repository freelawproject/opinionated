We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>A jury could have found the following facts. The defendant, a longtime friend of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>parents, moved into the basement of their home in March of 1999. At the request of the parents, the defendant babysat for the victim, Nathan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then six years old, and his two sisters on a number of occasions, including several weekend mornings while the parents looked at property in another town. During the first week of June, 1999, Nathan\u2019s mother noticed that he was \u201cwhiny\u201d and clingy, and that he sought to sleep with his parents, which he had not done since he was younger.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">On June 5, 1999, the defendant was home with Nathan, Nathan\u2019s sisters, and the defendant\u2019s own daughter, while the parents ran errands. When the parents returned, Nathan was lying on their bed, seemed distracted, and told them he was not feeling well. When the mother told Nathan that she and Nathan\u2019s father were going to look at property the next day, Nathan told her that he did not want to be left alone with the defendant and became upset. His parents decided to take all three children with them. During the family\u2019s excursion the next day, Nathan told his mother that he did not want to be left with the defendant anymore and that the defendant had put his mouth on Nathan\u2019s penis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nathan\u2019s mother told his father about the disclosure; when they returned to their house, they told the defendant they wanted to talk to him. The defendant removed his belongings from the house, left with his daughter in his truck, and did not return. Nathan\u2019s mother spoke with the police approximately ten days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">As a result of Nathan\u2019s disclosures, King was indicted on two counts of forcible rape of a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, and two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. After a jury trial in March of 2001, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty only with respect to the indecent assault and battery charges. The jury convicted the defendant on both rape charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">2. <em>Fresh complaint. </em>At trial, Nathan (then eight years old) testified that he and the defendant would play video games in the family\u2019s living room. He testified that, while he was playing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>video games, the defendant pulled down Nathan\u2019s clothes and \u201cput his mouth on my hurt spot.\u201d Nathan testified that the defendant had done this several times when his parents were not at home. Nathan told the defendant he did not want him to do that. The defendant did not answer. The prosecutor asked Nathan if the defendant had told him that something would happen to him if he told anyone, Nathan responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Asked if there was a reason he did not tell anyone, Nathan responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Nathan testified, however, that when the defendant thought he (Nathan) had done something wrong, such as being too noisy in the house, he would have to stand in the comer, a punishment also imposed at times by his parents and his aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Nathan\u2019s mother testified as a fresh complaint witness. She testified that Nathan appeared \u201cscared\u201d at the time he told her that he did not want to be left with the defendant anymore and that the defendant had put his mouth on Nathan\u2019s penis. She testified that Nathan told her that he had tried to tell the defendant to stop, but that the defendant would not. She further testified that Nathan had told her that the defendant \u201cwould punish him,\u201d specifically, \u201c[t]hat if [the defendant] couldn\u2019t put his mouth down there, then [Nathan] would have to stand in the comer or couldn\u2019t play [video games].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The defendant argues on appeal that the mother\u2019s testimony that the defendant had threatened Nathan was improperly admitted because it contradicted Nathan\u2019s testimony, and because it exceeded the scope of proper fresh complaint testimony. In particular, he argues, the mother\u2019s testimony impermissibly supplied an explanation for Nathan\u2019s failure to report the assault at an earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Massachusetts, unlike many other jurisdictions, allows a witness to testify not only to the fact of a complaint but also to the details of the complaint. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>410 Mass. 641, 643 (1991). \u201cBy the \u2018details,\u2019 we mean that the witness may testify to the complainant\u2019s statements of the facts of the assault.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 874 (2001). There are, however, limits to the content of fresh complaint testimony. \u201cWhile fresh complaint testimony need not match the victim\u2019s testimony exactly, it is impermissible for a fresh complaint witness to testify about details of an event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>that the victim had not testified to more generally.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gichel, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 209 (1999). Fresh complaint testimony is limited in scope to those acts testified to by the complainant, but it is not limited as to the details of those acts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 351 (1994). We agree that the mother\u2019s testimony that the defendant threatened Nathan exceeded the scope of his trial testimony, and was erroneously admitted. We do not, however, agree that the improper testimony requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The defendant objected to the admission of this evidence. We therefore determine whether the error was prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, supra </em>at 353. The defendant argues that the testimony was improper because it was used to fill a gap in the prosecution\u2019s case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 396 (1976). Specifically, the defendant argues that the mother\u2019s testimony was used for the impermissible purpose of explaining Nathan\u2019s failure to report the sexual assaults at an earlier time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aspen, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 267 (2001). We are not persuaded that the mother\u2019s testimony filled a gap in the prosecution\u2019s case in this respect, or that it gave rise to prejudice. The mother did not testify that Nathan was threatened by the defendant not to report the assaults. Rather, she testified that Nathan was threatened into <em>allowing </em>the assaults. Moreover, the timing of Nathan\u2019s report of the assault was never an issue at trial. Nathan reported the assaults to his mother while the defendant was still living in his house and while the assaults were ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Fresh complaint testimony cannot be used to fill a gap in the prosecution\u2019s proof of the essential elements of the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. at 396. The mother\u2019s testimony did relate to the element of lack of consent, when she testified that Nathan had been threatened by the defendant. Nathan\u2019s own testimony, however, addressed each of the elements of the crime of forcible rape of a child, including lack of consent. He testified that the defendant pulled his clothes down. He testified that the defendant put his mouth on his penis. He testified that he told the defendant he did not want him to put his mouth on his penis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatro, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 920-921 (1997) (jury instructions that consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>was not an issue because of the child\u2019s age was reversible error); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 192, 201-202 (1998) (lack of consent is an element of the crime that must be proved). See also Nolan &amp; Sartorio, Criminal Law \u00a7 225 (3d ed. 2001). The mother\u2019s testimony was not needed, nor was it used, to fill a gap or add material evidence lacking in Nathan\u2019s testimony. Therefore, it was not needed to satisfy the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof on any element of the crime. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 672 (1992) (no prejudicial error where improper fresh complaint testimony did not relate to an element of the crime of indecent assault and battery). Additionally, a fresh complaint instruction was given prior to the mother\u2019s testimony, and again during the final charge, instructing the jury that her testimony was admitted only for corroborative purposes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morais, </em>431 Mass. 380, 385 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The erroneously admitted testimony neither filled a gap in the prosecution\u2019s case nor inflamed the jury. We conclude, therefore, with fair assurance and because of Nathan\u2019s clear and articulate testimony, that the erroneously admitted evidence had very slight or no effect on the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gichel, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. at 209. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass, at 672. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 507-508 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">3. <em>Motion for mistrial. </em>During redirect examination, the mother was asked when she reported the incidents to the police. She first responded, \u201cWhen Jennifer Haines . . . called me.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moments later, when asked for the date, she responded, \u201cJune 12th.\u201d Following a brief bench conference, the mother was asked, \u201cIn terms of this date that you went to the Brockton police department, are you sure of the date that you went?\u201d The mother replied, \u201cNo, I know it was right after my daughter\u2019s physical.\u201d The defendant objected and moved for a mistrial on the grounds that this impermissibly placed before the jury information that one of Nathan\u2019s sisters had also made allega-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>tians against the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor responded that the mother was merely using the date as a point of reference and that the reference, in context, was benign. After reviewing the trial tape during recess, the judge denied the motion for mistrial, stating that he did not think the remark \u201cstands out as something that the jury would consider as significant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The decision to declare a mistrial is within the judge\u2019s discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>375 Mass. 369, 372-373 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmonds, </em>386 Mass. 234, 241 (1982). \u201cIt is the trial judge who is \u2018most familiar with the evidence and the background of the case on trial. He has listened to the tone of the argument as it was delivered and has observed the apparent reaction of the jurors.\u2019 Consequently, it is the trial judge who was best positioned to determine whether there was prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 384 (1992), quoting from <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 514 (1978). The mother\u2019s testimony that she went to the police \u201cright after my daughter\u2019s physical\u201d appeared to be a fleeting reference to a point in time and nothing more. It was neither inherently inflammatory nor suggestive of anything improper within the context of the mother\u2019s testimony. There were no further references to the daughter\u2019s physical in the testimony of the mother or any other witness. Here, the judge, with appropriate caution, reviewed the recording of the mother\u2019s testimony and concluded that there were no grounds for a mistrial. No showing of an abuse of discretion has been made by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">According to Nathan\u2019s mother, Nathan used the phrase \u201churt spot\u201d to describe his penis, because in an earlier bicycle accident he had injured his penis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\">There was no explanation at that time (or subsequently) that the reference was to Jennifer Hayes, a Brockton police detective; the jurors had heard her identified as such the previous day during jury selection as one of a list of possible witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Defense counsel explained to the judge at sidebar:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201cThere is an allegation of abuse against the daughter by this man, and it was after the investigation of the daughter that they then went back and made the allegations about the son, also.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
