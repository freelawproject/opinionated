Bertocchi accepted an offer to settle his workers\u2019 compensation case. The Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) ruled that the settlement was unenforceable, essentially because it had not been reduced to writing and approved by the DIA reviewing board. The administrator of Bertocchi\u2019s estate appeals from a decision of the single justice of this court affirming the DIA\u2019s ruling. We conclude that there was no error and, therefore, affirm the decision of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\"><em>Background. </em>The facts, in summary and as established by stipulation, are as follows: Bertocchi suffered a work-related injury to his right knee in December of 1986. Aetna Life &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Casualty Company (Aetna), the provider of workers\u2019 compensation insurance to Bertocchi\u2019s employer, acknowledged liability and paid Bertocchi medical and weekly incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 34. On July 24, 1989, Aetna\u2019s agent orally offered to pay a lump sum of $105,000 to settle Bertocchi\u2019s claim, and Bertocchi\u2019s attorney, on the same day, orally accepted that offer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 4, 1989, Bertocchi\u2019s attorney requested that a lump sum conference be scheduled. The DIA scheduled a counseling session for August 29, 1989,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a lump sum conference for September 8, 1989. Bertocchi died on August 19, 1989, as a result of a \u201cmassive coronary.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When notified of Bertocchi\u2019s death, Aetna gave notice that it would not honor its agreement to settle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the counseling session conducted on August 29, 1989, a DIA counselor recommended the approval of the lump sum settlement. On September 8, 1989, counsel for the parties and the administrator of Bertoc-chi\u2019s estate appeared at the lump sum conference. A lump sum agreement form dated September 8, 1989, and signed by the administrator of Bertocchi\u2019s estate and by the attorney who formerly had represented Bertocchi was presented. Counsel for Aetna refused to sign the form and an administrative law judge of the DIA declined to act on the request for approval. After protracted proceedings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the reviewing board of the DIA ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>that the proposed lump sum settlement was unenforceable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The single justice affirmed the decision of the reviewing board and its conclusion that there was no agreement cognizable under G. L. c. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>Bertocchi\u2019s administrator argues that in 1989,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> G. L. c. 152 did not require a lump sum agreement to be in writing. At that time, G. <em>L. c. </em>152, \u00a7 48(1), stated: \u201cUnder the conditions and limitations specified in this chapter, the insurer and employer may by agreement redeem any liability for compensation, in whole or in part, by the payment by the insurer of a lump sum of an amount to be approved by the reviewing board.\u201d Although the word \u201cagreement\u201d was not qualified or defined in that section, among the \u201cconditions and limitations\u201d then in force were those contained in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 19, as inserted by St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 9, which provided in relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>part that \u201cany payment of compensation shall be by <em>written agreement </em>by the parties and subject to the approval of the department\u201d (emphasis supplied). In 1989, payment of a lump sum under \u00a7 48 constituted a \u201cpayment of compensation.\u201d <em>Hansen\u2019s Case, </em>350 Mass. 178, 180 (1966) (\u201cA lump sum agreement has been held to be \u2018an agreement in regard to compensation\u2019 which requires board approval under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 6 [the predecessor to \u00a7 19]\u201d). See <em>Conlon </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>299 Mass. 528, 532 (1938); Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 417 (2d ed. 1981). The 1991 amendment to \u00a7 48(1), see St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 74, which, inter alla, inserted the words \u201cby an agreement pursuant to section 19,\u201d rather than establishing a new requirement as contended by Bertocchi\u2019s administrator, merely gave expression to that which previously was contextually implicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The requirement of a written agreement of the parties could not be satisfied by the filed document separately signed after Bertocchi\u2019s death by his attorney and the administrator of his estate. The document utilized was the printed form generated by the DIA, which called for a signature of the claimant\u2019s counsel in addition to the signature of the claimant. Not only was the administrator of Bertocchi\u2019s estate not a party to the lump sum agreement in the sense that he did not participate in the settlement, but also there is no provision in the legislative scheme of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for the derivative exercise of an employee\u2019s nonvested <em>settlement </em>rights by his estate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cThere is no right to compromise the liability for weekly payments except under the act.\u201d <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>338 Mass. 628, 634 (1959). The only provision for the derivative exercise of an employee\u2019s rights under the act is conferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>on the guardian or next friend of an employee pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">To the extent that Bertocchi\u2019s administrator relies on a common law \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d analysis, it suffices to note that \u201c[s]ince the parties were subject to the [workers\u2019] compensation act \u2018all their rights arising under it are to be settled by the agencies there provided and not as in actions at common law.\u2019 <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 351 [1914].\u201d <em>Conlon </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>299 Mass. at 532. Similarly, while we are mindful that \u201c[t]he Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to be construed liberally for the protection of an injured employee,\u201d <em>Hepner\u2019s Case, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 208, 212 (1990), this guiding principle does not control when the statute prescribes a specific procedure that an administrative agency or tribunal must follow. See <em>Levangie\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 213, 217 (1917); <em>Taylor\u2019s Case, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 498 (1998). Also, although the DIA\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute is not binding upon us, \u201cit is entitled to weight and deference.\u201d <em>Hepner\u2019s Case, supra. </em>In the circumstances, strict enforcement of the requirement of a written agreement called for under c. 152, \u00a7 19, see <em>Weitzel </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Cos., </em>417 Mass. 149, 153 (1994), reflects the reality that oral settlement agreements occasionally unravel before formal presentation to a tribunal or court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the single justice affirming the decision of the reviewing board that there was no settlement agreement cognizable under G. L. c. 152 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Although the stipulation of the parties, filed with the DIA, does not describe the offer and acceptance as having been made orally, the single justice\u2019s memorandum describes the settlement communications as being oral and the parties\u2019 arguments proceed on that assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">At the time, a review by the office of education and vocational rehabilitation of the DIA \u201c[pjrior to approval of any lump sum settlement,\u201d was statutorily required under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48, as inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 52. That requirement was eliminated by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Neither party claims that Bertocchi\u2019s death was in any way related to his industrial injury. An injury-related death under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is governed by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The stipulation indicated that at this time, payments under \u00a7 34 were terminated by agreement of the parties. This agreement merely reflected the fact that the death of an employee terminates an insurer\u2019s obligation to continue payments under \u00a7 34. For current statutory authority for discontinuation of payments in the event of an employee\u2019s death, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(2)\u00a9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\">This case has a regrettably long history. Following the declination by the administrative law judge to act in 1989, another administrative judge, on May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>24, 1993, denied a request for an order establishing rights in the previously negotiated settlement. That decision was summarily affirmed by the reviewing board on February 17, 1995. On March 27, 1996, the single justice of this court issued a judgment affirming the decision of the reviewing board. On May 27, 1997, this court in an unpublished decision pursuant to our rule 1:28, <em>Bertocchi </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 1122 (1997), reversed the judgment of the single justice and remanded the case to the DIA for consideration and answer of stated questions, including whether the documentation before the court was sufficient to constitute an agreement under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 19. After remand, another administrative judge of the DIA responded to the questions set forth in this court\u2019s rule 1:28 memorandum and order and in October, 1998, found that the record did not contain any documents which would constitute an agreement under \u00a7 19. A second reviewing board, by decision filed on February 16, 2000, affirmed the decision of that judge. The single justice of this court, by judgment entered on June 5, 2002 (00-J-153), affirmed the decision of that reviewing board. The appeal of the 2002 judgment rendered by the single justice is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We note that, while this court concluded in its rule 1:28 memorandum and order that the DIA erred in deciding that Aetna had the unilateral right to refuse to honor the settlement agreement, that conclusion was premised on the sufficiency of the settlement documentation filed with the DIA. Therefore, even if we were to accord precedential effect to the decision, it would not compel a result contrary to that reached here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The statutory scheme leaves actual enforcement of DIA orders and decisions to the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The parties agree that the controlling date is September 8, 1989, the day the proposed settlement was presented to the DIA. See St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7\u00a7 74, 106-107 (1991 amendment to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48[1], is \u201cprocedural in character\u201d); <em>Eastern Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 626-627 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Once an employee\u2019s rights are vested under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48(1), by virtue of properly having been exercised during his life, the representative of the employee\u2019s estate may seek to enforce them. See, e.g., <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Arrow Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 633 (1983) (before employee\u2019s death, lump sum agreement signed by both employee and insurer was presented to DIA and recommended for approval by single member of DIA after hearing conference). Similarly, an employee\u2019s right to compensation payments under c. 152 may be enforced by his estate or by certain named family members (see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A) after his death. See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 469 (2d ed. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
