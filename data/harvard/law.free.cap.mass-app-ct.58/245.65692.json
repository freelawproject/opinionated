The Williams family was thereafter awarded $1.5 million. Each of the present plaintiffs was a Gas-ton partner at the time of the events giving rise to the malpractice claim and was personally required to pay about $250,000 to satisfy the award. They then brought this action in tort for legal malpractice against Bingham, Dana &amp; Gould (Bingham), their counsel in the action brought by the Williams family. Concluding that the undisputed facts showed that Gas-ton\u2019s unforeseen bankruptcy was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 losses, the judge allowed Bingham\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On February 4, 1988, the Williams family brought an action against Gaston and its former partners in which they alleged that they had incurred a substantial Federal gift tax liability because of Gaston\u2019s negligent advice to them in 1975 and 1976. The issue of liability was separated from that of damages. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In 1975 and 1976, Messrs. Ely, Schmidt, Howe, Jones, Lefkowitz, and Storey (see notes 1 &amp; 2, supra) were Gaston partners. With the exception of Mr. Schmidt, however, all had left Gaston no later than September, 1987. Mr. Schmidt departed in early 1988. All that aside, none of the plaintiffs had personal knowledge of the facts involved in the <em>Williams </em>case. Rather, their liability on the damages ultimately awarded the Williams family was based upon their partnership in Gaston at the time of the alleged malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">2. <em>The undisputed facts. </em>We recite the undisputed facts, all of which have support in the materials placed in the record on Bingham\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Sometime in 1986, Gaston retained Bingham as counsel in anticipation of the action ultimately brought by the Williams family on February 4, 1988. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. at 468. In October and November of that year, 1986, but before the plaintiffs had left Gaston, its insurers disclaimed coverage on any claims brought by the Williams family against the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">On November 18, 1987, about one year after Gaston\u2019s receipt of notice that its insurers had disclaimed coverage, Mr. William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Kehoe of Gaston informed Mr. Zachary Karol of Bingham about the insurance disclaimers. In the meantime, but no later than September, 1987, all the plaintiffs had left Gaston except for Mr. Schmidt. As earlier noted, he remained at Gaston until early 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">On February 18, 1988, about two weeks after the Williams family commenced suit against Gaston, Mr. Roger Feldman, the then managing partner of Gaston, directed a letter to thirty-seven former partners of Gaston, including the plaintiffs. In that letter, he asked the former partners whether they wished Bing-ham to represent them in the Williams family\u2019s action against Gaston. He made no mention of the fact that Gaston\u2019s insurers had disclaimed coverage. The letter provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><em>\u201cTo the extent not covered by insurance, </em>the expense of defending this action and any judgment or settlement will be borne by the present partners of [Gaston]. If you agree to be represented by [Bingham], you will not be asked to pay anything toward their legal fees or expenses.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">All the plaintiffs elected to be represented by Bingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Sometime in late 1987 or early 1988, but prior to Mr. Feld-man\u2019s letter of February 18, 1988, counsel for the Williams family informed Bingham that they might be willing to dismiss their claim against Gaston\u2019s former partners on the condition that they (the Williams family) could use the depositions of the former partners for any purpose, as if they were parties to the litigation. Bingham rejected the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">On February 23, 1988, Mr. Alan Lefkowitz directed a letter to the managing partner of the law firm with whom he, Mr. James Storey, and Mr. Richard Ely were then engaged in the practice of law. In this letter, Mr. Lefkowitz stated, in part, that he understood that \u201cthere are two separate insurance policies applicable at different times during the relevant period but that both insurers have disclaimed liability. I understand that the deductible in each case is $1,000,000.\u201d Mr. Lefkowitz sent copies of his letter to Mr. Jones, Mr. Storey, and Mr. Ely.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">In August or September of 1988, counsel for the Williams family again informed Bingham that they might be amenable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>dropping their claims against former Gaston partners under certain conditions. Mr. Karol, of Bingham, presented the Williams family\u2019s proposal to Gaston in a letter dated September 14, 1988. In that letter he stated that \u201c[s]ince we [Bingham] represent both present and former partners, we must report [the] proposal to the former partners and solicit their reactions.\u201d Toward that end, he drafted a letter, dated September, 1988, and advised Gaston that it be sent to Gaston\u2019s former partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">According to Mr. Karol\u2019s draft letter for Gaston\u2019s former partners, the Williams family would consider dismissing Gas-ton\u2019s former partners from the pending litigation on three conditions: (1) that the Williams family would retain the various procedural advantages arising out of the fact that Gaston\u2019s former partners were named as parties to the action, especially the right to pursue discovery from them and to use their statements as admissions of party-opponents; (2) that the Williams family would be allowed to conduct direct, ex parte interviews with those former Gaston partners willing to speak with them; and (3) that Gaston\u2019s current partners would be totally responsible for any judgment in favor of the Williams family. In Mr. Karol\u2019s opinion, the second and third conditions \u201cpresented] no problem but the first required further consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5A\">Although the record is silent as to whether Gaston sent the draft letter to the former partners, it is undisputed that Gaston rejected the Williams family\u2019s proposal before the plaintiffs learned of it. Indeed, it was not until December 5, 1988, that Mr. Feldman advised the plaintiffs by letter that Gaston had rejected the Williams family\u2019s proposal. As explained by Mr. Feldman in his letter, Gaston\u2019s rejection was based upon the \u201csubstantial\u201d procedural advantages sought by the Williams family in exchange for any settlement. At the same time, he reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201cWe wish to reassure you, as I stated in my letter of February 18, 1988, that the present partners of [Gaston] will bear all the expenses of defending this action, including the amount of any judgment or settlement, to the extent not covered by insurance. ... If you have any questions . . . please do not hesitate to contact me or [Mr. Karol].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>None of the plaintiffs contacted Mr. Feldman, Mr. Karol, or counsel for the Williams family in response to this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">On June 19, 1991, a Superior Court judge made findings and rulings and ordered judgment for the Williams family on the issue of Gaston\u2019s liability on their claims. Four months later, on October 10, 1991, Gaston, one of the oldest law firms in Boston, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">There was no discussion of bankruptcy at Gaston until September, 1991. Indeed, just two years prior to its petition for bankruptcy, Gaston had reported a net income of more than $22 million.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, there were no rumors about an impending bankruptcy until shortly before the Chapter 11 filing. Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy meant that both its current and former partners faced personal liability on any damages awarded the Williams family unless they availed themselves of the protection of the Bankruptcy Court. Although given the opportunity to participate in Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy plan under the same terms as the current partners, the plaintiffs chose not to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">As a result of the change in Gaston\u2019s circumstances and the potential conflict between the interests of the plaintiffs and Gas-ton, Bingham withdrew from its representation of the plaintiffs, except as to those issues of common interest on which the former partners, including the plaintiffs, had agreed to be represented by Bingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy plan was confirmed on September 20, 1993. Under the plan, the Williams family retained their claims against Gaston\u2019s former partners, including the plaintiffs. On March 11, 1994, the Williams family was awarded damages. Each of the plaintiffs paid about $250,000, and, contrary to Mr. Feldman\u2019s letters of assurance, Gaston was unable to reimburse them. The plaintiffs then brought this action against Bingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">3. <em>The plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 claim of legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>malpractice is based on two grounds: (1) Bingham failed to disclose that Gaston lacked insurance on the <em>Williams </em>action; and (2) Bingham violated its ethical obligations to them in rejecting the Williams family\u2019s settlement offer without disclosing it or its terms to them and without recommending that they seek independent representation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As noted at the outset, the judge concluded that there was nothing in the record before her to show that Bingham\u2019s actions rather than Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the motion for summary judgment should not have been allowed because Bingham\u2019s \u201cmalpractice and the damages that flowed from it are inseparably intertwined factual issues.\u201d More specifically, they argue that the materials submitted on the motion for summary judgment showed that (1) not all the plaintiffs received Mr. Lefkow-itz\u2019s letter of February 23, 1988; (2) even if all the plaintiffs received that letter, it was inconclusive about Gaston\u2019s insurance coverage; (3) Mr. Feldman\u2019s letter of December 5, 1988, reiterated the assertions in his February 18, 1988, letter and thereby affirmed the plaintiffs\u2019 belief that there was insurance coverage when, in fact, Gaston and Bingham knew there was not; (4) the plaintiffs\u2019 understanding of the letters concerning the availability of insurance coverage was a question of fact<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; and (5) Bingham\u2019s ethical violations, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>evidence of negligence. See <em>Fishman </em>v. Brooks, 396 Mass. 643, 649 (1986) (although violation of canon of ethics or disciplinary rule is not actionable breach of duty to client, it may be \u201csome evidence of the attorney\u2019s negligence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AL4\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>We will assume without deciding that there were factual disputes about whether Bingham negligently failed timely to advise the plaintiffs of the insurance disclaimers and the Williams family\u2019s offer of settlement and, instead, pursue the question whether, on the undisputed facts, the motion judge correctly concluded that Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy and not Bing-ham\u2019s alleged negligence was the cause of their damages.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At0\">\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates, by reference to materials listed in Mass.R.Civ.R 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), that the nonmoving party, who will have the burden of proof at trial, lacks sufficient evidence to establish an essential element of his or her claim. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). When asserting a claim for legal malpractice, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving that its attorney committed a breach of the duty to use reasonable care, that the plaintiff suffered actual loss, and that the attomey\u2019s negligence proximately caused such loss. <em>Colucci </em>v. <em>Rosen, Goldberg, Slavet, Levenson &amp; Wekstein, P.C., 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 107, 111 (1987). Proximate cause is an essential element of that proof. See <em>Jernigan </em>v. <em>Giard, </em>398 Mass. 721, 723 (1986); <em>Meyer </em>v. Wagner, 429 Mass. 410, 424 (1999); <em>Girardi </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 560 (1995).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-32\"><em>Atlas Tack Corp. </em>v. <em>Donabed, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 221, 226 (1999). Cf. <em>McCann </em>v. <em>Davis, Malm &amp; D\u2019Agostine, </em>423 Mass. 558, 560 (1996) (\u201cevidence fully warranted the finding . . . that the firm\u2019s negligence caused no damage to the plaintiff \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Aok\">Although Gaston, while represented by Bingham, never expressly advised the plaintiffs that insurance coverage existed, it did twice assure them (on February 18 and December 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>1988) that it would indemuify them \u201cto the extent not covered by insurance\u201d and bear all the expenses of defending against the Williams family action. Even assuming that the plaintiffs construed the letters to mean that insurance coverage was available and that they did not know that Gaston\u2019s insurers had disclaimed coverage, there is nothing in the record to show what the plaintiffs could or would have done to protect themselves from personal liability on any judgment other than to accept Gaston\u2019s promises to indemnify them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Colucci </em>v. <em>Rosen, Goldberg, Slavet, Levenson &amp; Wekstein, P.C., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 111; <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>SmithKline Bio-Science Labs., Inc., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 363-365 (1994); <em>Girardi </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 560 (1995).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See also 1 Mallen &amp; Smith, Legal Malpractice \u00a7 8.5, at 806 (5th ed. 2000) (\u201cThe causal link between the lawyer\u2019s conduct and the injury must be based on more than speculation. A logical explanation or theory of how the lawyer\u2019s conduct <em>may </em>have caused the loss is still speculation\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">This reasoning is equally applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Bingham violated the canons of ethics by its dual representation of them and Gaston with respect to the offers of settlement made by the Williams family. As earlier related, the undisputed chronology of events is as follows: (1) the plaintiffs knew about the proposed offer of settlement from Mr. Feld-man\u2019s letter of Decembers, 1988; (2) on June 19, 1991, a Superior Court judge concluded that Gaston was liable on the Williams family\u2019s claim; (3) there was no discussion about bankruptcy at Gaston until September, 1991; (4) Gaston sought bankruptcy protection on October 10, 1991; and (5) the plaintiffs did not seek new counsel during this three-year hiatus, nor did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>they choose to participate in Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy plan which was confirmed in 1993. Even were we to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions that they would have sought new counsel had they known of the settlement offer prior to December 5, 1988, they presented nothing to show what any newly retained counsel would or could have done to negotiate a favorable settlement agreement with the Williams family on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Bingham also asserts that, based on the undisputed facts, Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy was the intervening and superseding cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages. Once again and as earlier noted, the plaintiffs offered nothing to dispute the facts that there were neither public rumors nor in-house discussion about Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy until September, 1991; that as of February 28, 1989, Gaston closed its fiscal years with gross revenues of about $70 million and a net income of about $22.5 million; and that the plaintiffs chose not to participate in Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy plan that was ultimately confirmed on September 20, 1993. See notes 5 &amp; 6, <em>supra. </em>Instead, they argue that causation is a jury question. See <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, 399 </em>Mass. 790, 794 (1987) (\u201cGenerally, questions of causation, proximate and intervening, present issues for the jury to decide\u201d), citing <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Atlantic Works, </em>111 Mass. 136, 140 (1872), as well as other authorities. The plaintiffs make their argument without consideration or discussion of the question of foreseeability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cThe general rule is that \u2018[t]he act of a third person, intervening and contributing a condition necessary to the injurious effect of the original negligence, will not excuse the first wrongdoer, if such act ought to have been <em>foreseen. </em>The original negligence still remains a culpable and direct cause of the injury. The test is to be found in the probable injurious consequences which were to be anticipated, not in the number of subsequent events and agencies which might arise.\u2019 <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Atlantic Works, supra </em>at 139-140.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\"><em>Jesionek </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy., </em>376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978). See <em>Wilborg </em>v. <em>Denzell, 359 </em>Mass. 279, 285 (1971) (\u201cdefendant is liable for the foreseeable intervening conduct of a third party whether that conduct is negligent or not\u201d); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, Inc., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 370 (1992), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>from <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. at 795-796, quoting from <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Snelling, </em>14 Allen 290, 296 (1867) (\u201cissue of superseding cause is resolved \u2018not in the number of intervening events or agents, but in their character, and in the natural and probable connection between the wrong done and the injurious consequence\u2019 \u201d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 442 (1965) (setting out relevant factors to be considered in determining whether intervening act is superseding cause).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The plaintiffs offered nothing to refute or even to suggest that Gaston\u2019s bankruptcy was reasonably foreseeable to Bingham at the time they claim they first heard of the Williams family\u2019s offer of settlement, December 5, 1988. For all that appears from the undisputed facts in the materials before us, the plaintiffs would have suffered no harm had Gaston not declared bankruptcy.
