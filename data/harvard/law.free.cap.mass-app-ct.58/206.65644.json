See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>431 Mass. 340 (2000); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, </em>437 Mass. 809 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeSorbo, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 910, 911 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In the present case, a Superior Court judge advised the defendant at a plea colloquy that his conviction \u201ccould result in deportation or other action under the immigration laws.\u201d Later facing deportation, the defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea and now appeals from the denial of his motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The plea judge\u2019s warning did not conform to the language of G. L. c. 286, \u00a7 29D,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it is undisputed that the defendant now faces one of the immigration consequences enumerated in the statute. However, in contrast to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soto, supra </em>at 341-342, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, supra </em>at 812-814, the colloquy in the present case warned the defendant of the precise immigration consequence he now faces. In that respect, this case closely resembles <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 662 (1989).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In <em>Lamrini, </em>the plea judge warned the defendant of the potential for deportation, but not of the possibility of exclusion or denial of naturalization. <em>Id. </em>at 666. When the defendant subsequently faced deportation, she sought to vacate the judgment against her and to withdraw her guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 663. We affirmed the denial of her motion because the plea judge\u2019s warning \u2014 though not citing all three immigration consequences specified in the statute \u2014 \u201csufficiently advised [the defendant] of possible immigration consequences of her guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <em>667.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The defendant in the present case contends that, though he</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>currently faces only deportation, he may face exclusion or denial of naturalization at some time in the future. However, we construe the statute to authorize withdrawal of a guilty plea only when a defendant actually faces an immigration consequence of which he was entitled to be warned but was not warned. The statute includes, as a separate element for relief, a requirement that a defendant \u201cshow[ ] that his plea and convic-tian may have one of the enumerated consequences.\u201d To vacate a judgment of conviction and to allow withdrawal of a guilty plea for consequences that a defendant may face only in some hypothetical future would make relief automatic in the event of a defective warning. Such a construction would eliminate any purpose for the additional statutory requirement that the defendant face one of the enumerated consequences in order to obtain relief and would, accordingly, violate settled canons of statutory construction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 196, 197 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967) (\u201c[Njone of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-23\">We conclude that, though \u201cbarely adequate,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 667, the plea judge\u2019s immigra-tian warning advised the defendant of the immigration law consequence that he now faces (deportation), and that the defendant is therefore not entitled to relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. We nevertheless take this occasion to reiterate that a judge conducting a plea colloquy should administer the warning required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, in strict conformity with the statutorily prescribed form. The denial of the defendant\u2019s mo-tian to withdraw his guilty plea is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-33\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-10\">The plea colloquy predated the guidance contained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soto, supra </em>at 342.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-11\">The defendant\u2019s signature on a \u201cWaiver of Defendant\u2019s Rights\u201d form (which contained reference to the three immigration consequences specified in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D) was insufficient to overcome any deficiencies in the oral warning issued at the plea colloquy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, supra </em>at 815.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b229-13\"><em>Lamrini </em>was decided before the court\u2019s decisions in <em>Soto </em>and <em>Hilaire, </em>but both decisions cite <em>Lamrini </em>with apparent approval. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soto, supra </em>at 342 (invalidating warning where defendant was warned of deportation but later faced exclusion, and distinguishing <em>Lamrini </em>because \u201cLamrini knew the exact consequences of her plea\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, supra </em>at 814 (invalidating warning where colloquy did not \u201cidentify the immigration consequence that the defendant is now suffering\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
