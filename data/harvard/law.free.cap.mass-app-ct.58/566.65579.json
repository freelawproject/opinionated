Donovan, III, notwithstanding that Donovan died before the agreement was signed by Liberty and formally approved by the DIA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\"><em>Background. </em>The relevant facts and procedural background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are as follows: Donovan, having sustained a work-related back injury in 1989, received partial disability benefits from Liberty, the workers\u2019 compensation insurer of Donovan\u2019s employer. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>order dated June 26, 1997, an administrative judge of the DIA denied Donovan\u2019s claim for total disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34. On July 8, 1997, Donovan appealed that decision. During the pendency of his appeal, Donovan and Liberty engaged in settlement discussions which culminated on July 16, 1997, in an oral agreement to settle Donovan\u2019s case for $50,000. This agreement was memorialized in a letter of Donovan\u2019s counsel to Liberty dated July 16, 1997. On the same date, Donovan withdrew his appeal of the administrative judge\u2019s denial of total disability benefits and, through counsel, submitted a request for a lump sum conference to the DIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">On August 15, 1997, the date scheduled for the lump sum conference, Donovan took ill and the conference was postponed to September 5, 1997. On August 25, 1997, Donovan, while hospitalized, signed a lump sum settlement agreement form and other related documents in preparation for presentation to an administrative law judge for approval on September 5, 1997, without the necessity of Donovan\u2019s appearing. Donovan died in the hospital on August 29, 1997, of causes unrelated to his industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The parties stipulated<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that \u201c[a]ll forms necessary and required by the [DIA] and [G. L. c.] 152 . . . were submitted and such requirements satisfied, except that the [l]ump [s]um [settlement [agreement did not bear the signature of [Liberty\u2019s] counsel.\u201d \u201cThe attorney for [Liberty] has refused or declined to sign the lump sum settlement agreement forms because of [Donovan\u2019s] death.\u201d At no time prior to September 5, 1997, the date of the rescheduled conference, had Liberty withdrawn its offer to settle the case for $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Ultimately,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the reviewing board decided that, in the circumstances, the lump sum agreement was enforceable without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Liberty\u2019s signature. Accordingly, it approved the agreement and ordered Liberty to pay the settlement amount. Liberty appealed, and the single justice reported the case for decision by a full panel of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Among the circumstances relied on by the reviewing board in approving the lump sum agreement was the withdrawal by Donovan of his appeal of the order denying him total disability benefits. The reviewing board stated: \u201cThe insurer\u2019s $50,000.00 offer induced [Donovan] to withdraw his appeal . . . which fact was made known to the insurer, and which forbearance to appeal could only be remedied by the enforcement of the promise to pay $50,000.00.\u201d This interrelationship of Liberty\u2019s offer and the withdrawal of the appeal is well supported in the record by the July 16, 1997, letter of Donovan\u2019s counsel to Liberty, which confirmed the receipt of the offer and at the same time indicated \u201c[t]he employee [ac]cepts that offer subject to approval of the [DIA], and . . . will withdraw the appeal and request lump sum proceedings.\u201d In support of its decision, the reviewing board relied on <em>Lor-anger Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>E.F. Hauserman Co., 316 </em>Mass. 757, 760 (1978), in which the following quotation from \u00a7 89B(2) and illustration 6 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (Tent. Drafts Nos. 1-7, 1973) appears: \u201cAn offer which the off-eror should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a substantial character on the part of the offeree before acceptance and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding as an option contract to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.\u201d Compare Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 90 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We agree with the result reached by the reviewing board and conclude that the circumstances call for the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The effective application of that doctrine \u201crequires: (1) \u2018[a] representation or conduct amounting to a representation intended to induce a course of conduct on the part of the person to whom the representation is made[;] (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>[a]n act or omission resulting from the representation, whether actual or by conduct, by the person to whom the representation is made[;] (3) [and detriment to such person as a consequence of the act or omission.\u2019 <em>Cellucci </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 728 (1974)[, <em>S.C., </em>368 Mass. 811 (1975)].\u201d <em>Boylston Dev. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>22 Boylston St. Corp., </em>412 Mass. 531, 542 (1992). In the context of a lump sum offer, the induced act or omission must be something more than an ordinary agreement to redeem liability pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Here, it is uncontroverted that Donovan agreed to withdraw his appeal in response to Liberty\u2019s offer of settlement. The detriment he suffered was the abandonment of his claim of \u00a7 34 benefits in an administrative appeal. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A(3). That detriment is not made moot by Donovan\u2019s death in that the appeal, claiming \u00a7 34 benefits to the date of death, could have been pursued by his estate. See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 469 (2d ed. 1981) and \u00a7 14:6 (Nason, Koziol &amp; Wall Supp. 2002). While we are mindful of the limits of the doctrine of estoppel with respect to the statutorily defined authority of an administrative agency such as the DIA, see <em>Le-vangie\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 213, 217 (1917); <em>Hayes\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 447, 452-453 (1965), we endorse the reviewing board\u2019s remedy as both within the jurisdiction of the DIA and consistent with the settled proposition that c. 152 is \u201cto be construed liberally for the protection of the injured employee.\u201d <em>Meley\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 136, 139 (1914). <em>Hepner\u2019s Case, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 208, 212 (1990). See <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 267 (1985) (citations omitted) (\u201cThe [DIA] is not bound by . . . legal technicalities, but, rather, governed by the practice in equity. The term \u2018in equity\u2019 is consonant with the liberal construction to be given to c. 152 and has been \u2018applied to supply a remedy [even] where there [may be] a gap in the statute.\u2019 Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 29, at 34\u201d). The remedy here is to regard Liberty as estopped from relying on the absence of its signature from the lump sum settlement agreement signed by Donovan before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>he died and to treat that agreement as enforceable. Compare <em>Bertocchi\u2019s Case, ante </em>at 563-56S.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In its decision, the reviewing board noted that \u201c[t]he parties stipulated at oral argument. . . that the only argument [Liberty] maintained for its refusal to honor the lump sum agreement was the lack of its signature.\u201d Accordingly, there is no issue, and none is argued to us, as to whether the agreement was in Donovan\u2019s best interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The decision of the reviewing board is affirmed. Donovan\u2019s estate is awarded reasonable costs and fees pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-15\">The recited background is based upon the stipulation of the parties, elements of which are quoted, and uncontroverted explanatory matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The quoted material is from the hearing judge\u2019s decision and was included in his statement of the parties\u2019 stipulation. While it is not part of the stipulation contained in our supplemental record, neither party has objected to its inclusion in the judge\u2019s version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The attorney for Donovan and his estate and the attorney for Liberty appeared at the lump sum settlement conference on September 5, 1997. An administrative law judge, over the objection of the attorney for Donovan and his estate, withdrew the case from the conference list because the lump sum settlement agreement had not been signed by Liberty\u2019s attorney. Another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>administrative judge, after hearing, decided he lacked authority to enforce the parties\u2019 agreement and, therefore, denied Donovan\u2019s request for approval or enforcement of the agreement. The matter was then appealed to the reviewing board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In light of our decision, we do not address the issue of the legal status, absent estoppel, of the lump sum agreement signed only by Donovan. Compare <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Arrow Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 633 (1983), and <em>Bertocchi\u2019s Case, ante </em>at 564.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In any event, the record amply supports that the agreement was in his best interest. An addendum to the lump sum agreement signed by Donovan indicates that he had begun receiving monthly social security disability benefits as of July, 1997, and that those benefits would be subject to a larger offset for periodic workers\u2019 compensation benefits than would be the case if he accepted the lump sum offer. See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 620(3) (2d ed. 1981) and \u00a7 23:11(3) (Nason, Koziol &amp; Wall Supp. 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
