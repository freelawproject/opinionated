Pepyne, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b733-13\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ass-dedup-0\">The defendant appeals from his conviction of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, third offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant argues on appeal that the trial judge erred in (1) conducting an inadequate voir dire of a potentially biased witness; (2) disallowing the defendant\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge; and (3) restricting the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. Because we conclude that the trial judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge was reversible error, we do not need to reach the defendant\u2019s other claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">The defendant was authorized six peremptory challenges. Prior to commencement of the defendant\u2019s trial, the trial judge conducted individual voir dires of the venire to inquire whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the prospective jurors, their families, or their close friends had personal or professional relationships with any of the witnesses. During the individual voir dires, the defendant exercised three of his peremptory challenges. When one prospective juror (Juror X) was called, she stated that she knew the names of town police officers who would be testifying during the trial, probably because she lived in a very small town. The defendant attempted to challenge Juror X for cause. The judge accordingly inquired of Juror X to determine whether she could remain impartial. He concluded that she was indifferent, and seated her. The individual voir dires continued until the remaining jurors were seated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the last juror was selected, the judge recessed for lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Upon the jurors\u2019 return from lunch, and before they were sworn, the prosecutor revealed to the judge that he had discovered that Juror X had a closer relationship with one of the Commonwealth\u2019s police witnesses than previously discussed, more than just mere acquaintance from living in the same small town. It was revealed that the arresting officer, Officer Mousseau, had been a tenant of Juror X\u2019s in-laws (Juror X\u2019s husband\u2019s brother and the brother\u2019s wife) and that Officer Mousseau\u2019s wife was currently working for Juror X\u2019s in-laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record reveals that defense counsel again attempted to strike Juror X for cause, but the judge insisted that his earlier inquiry of the juror during the first individual voir dire had sufficiently satisfied him to conclude again that the juror was indifferent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After expressing to the judge his concerns about the juror, defense counsel attempted to exercise one of his three remaining peremptory challenges to exclude her. The judge disallowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the challenge. Defense counsel timely objected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant was subsequently convicted and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The defendant contends the trial judge abused his discretion in disallowing him use of the peremptory challenge. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Under Mass.R.Crim.P. 20(c)(2), 378 Mass. 891 (1979), a peremptory challenge \u201cshall be made before the jurors are sworn and may be made after the determination that a person called to serve as a juror stands indifferent in the case.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>426 Mass. 617, 626-627 (1998). A judge\u2019s erroneous disallowance of a peremptory challenge is reversible error even without a showing of prejudice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>389 Mass. 552, 564 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Somers, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 920, 922 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The only pertinent issue here is whether the judge\u2019s disallowance of defense counsel\u2019s challenge was based on defense counsel\u2019s failure to comply with Mass.R.Crim.P. 20(c)(2),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> i.e., whether defense counsel\u2019s peremptory challenge was timely. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 627 (explaining that \u201cif the juror has not yet been sworn, then there may be a peremptory challenge even after there has been a determination of that juror\u2019s indifference\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>435 Mass. 463, 470-471 (2001) (defense counsel\u2019s request for peremptory challenge was untimely). The Commonwealth concedes that the judge\u2019s decision was error. The record is unequivocal: defense counsel\u2019s attempt to exercise his peremptory challenge was prior to the time the jury were sworn and, therefore, was timely. The judge abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-15\">See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Twelve jurors and two alternates were selected. Juror X was juror number eight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The in-laws owned a child daycare center in which Officer Mousseau\u2019s wife was working.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">We note that at the time the judge conducted the first individual voir dire of Juror X and found her indifferent, defense counsel did not have knowledge of Juror X\u2019s relationship to Officer Mousseau. However, the record reveals that defense counsel, after learning of the relationship, stated that if he had known of that relationship at the time of the first individual voir dire, he would have exercised his peremptory challenge to exclude her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The judge stated, \u201cWell, I understand you might have chosen to exercise your right to challenge, but because the juror in my view did not conceal information, because I don\u2019t believe the questions I asked should have elicited this information, I don\u2019t believe the juror has concealed anything and therefore I\u2019m not going to be opening the issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\">As there was no insinuation that defense counsel\u2019s exercise of his peremptory challenge was motivated by discrimination against a member in a discrete group, such as a race, see generally Brown, McGuire &amp; Winters, The Peremptory Challenge as a Manipulative Device in Criminal Trials: Traditional Use or Abuse, 14 New Eng. L. Rev. 192 (1978), Juror X\u2019s relationship to the case needed only to raise a spectre of individual bias to serve as a basis for peremptory challenge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 485 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>439 Mass. 460, 463 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
