The grievance was dismissed as \u201cclearly without merit\u201d by the committee that performs the preliminary screening of faculty grievances. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought suit claiming that the committee exceeded its powers in dismissing the grievance. As we conclude that the conduct he grieved contravened neither the language nor the purpose of the appointment handbook, and that the committee was expressly authorized to screen out and dismiss claims that were \u201cclearly without merit,\u201d we reverse the trial court order denying the university\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. We further conclude that the trial court erred in allowing the plaintiff to amend his complaint to allege an appointment handbook violation that had never been subjected to the university\u2019s internal grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">I. <em>Background. A. The appointment handbook. </em>The appointment handbook (handbook) provides that \u201c[tjenured professorial appointments are reserved for scholars of the first order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>eminence.\u201d It includes procedures for a multifaceted review of a tenure candidate and comparison of the candidate with other distinguished scholars. When a candidate (also referred to as a nominee) is being considered for tenure, the candidate\u2019s academic department \u201cevaluates relevant scholars and ordinarily reduces the number to a short list of [five] or [six] leading contenders who, as much as possible, are comparable in ability, distinction, and career stages.\u201d When considering names for the short list, the department is not to exclude scholars \u201con an assumption, or direct knowledge, that they will not be available.\u201d The department then sends the short list to other outstanding scholars in the field, requesting that they rank and compare those on the list, and soliciting suggestions for additions to the list. Minority outreach is also ongoing. The department then votes on the candidate. Thereafter, the department chair prepares an extensive dossier on the candidate. Included in the dossier, along with the nominee\u2019s publications and curriculum vitae, the department vote, information on the other scholars on the short list and extensive additional materials, is \u201ca confidential letter from each voting member of the department.\u201d Each voting member of the department is authorized and expected to submit such a letter regarding the nominee. The dossier is forwarded to the university\u2019s office of the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences (dean).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">After receiving the complete dossier, the dean asks the president of the university (president) to convene an ad hoc committee. \u201cThe purpose of the ad hoc committee review is to assure that the [u]niversity takes the broadest possible view of opportunities to recruit the ablest people and to make certain that nominees are judged strictly on their merits as scientists, scholars and teachers. The committee is ordinarily composed of [three] or [four] scholars (\u2018generalists\u2019 as well as \u2018specialists\u2019) from outside the [u]niversity, [two] tenured members of the [\u00b6] acuity from outside the department, and (ex officio) the [d]ean and the [president.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The ad hoc committee, after reviewing the dossier and hearing departmental witnesses, advises the president on:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u201c1. the importance of the [nominee\u2019s] field to the long-term development of the department; and</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u201c2. the quality of the proposed nominee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The final decision on tenure is made by the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">As provided in appendix X of the handbook (\u201cGuidelines for the Resolution of Faculty Grievances\u201d), \u201c[a]ny faculty member may bring forward for resolution . . . any grievance . . . which contends that proper procedures have not been followed in decisions regarding promotion.\u201d Pursuant to section 3(b) of appendix X, grievances are submitted \u201cto the elected members of the [d]ocket [c]ommittee of the [\u00b6] acuity for preliminary screening.\u201d The section provides that the elected members of the docket committee<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are \u201cempowered to dismiss the complaint if it is found to be clearly without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">B. <em>The plaintiff\u2019s grievance. </em>In April, 1997, the president denied tenure to the plaintiff, an associate professor in the university\u2019s department of government. The plaintiff thereafter filed a grievance pursuant to the handbook. In the grievance letter sent to the docket committee and referenced in the complaint, the plaintiff claimed bias on the part of Dennis F. Thompson (Thompson), an associate provost and professor of government. The plaintiff also claimed bias on the part of some members of the ad hoc committee and claimed that the committee lacked specialists in his field. He \u201cemphasize[d] that these grievances \u2014 both concerning the composition of the ad hoc committee and concerning . . . Thompson\u2019s participation in [his] tenure review \u2014 focus[ed] on procedural flaws and [did] not address the motives or character of those involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In particular, the plaintiff asserted in his grievance that Thompson \u201ccompromised the integrity of the tenure review process in [his] case by taking part in deliberations in the [department of [g]ovemment and by participating by means of [Thompson\u2019s] confidential letter to the [d]ean in the deliberations of the [o]ffice of the [d]ean, the ad hoc committee, and the president.\u201d In regard to the ad hoc committee, the plaintiff claimed that the provision stating that the committee will \u201cordinarily\u201d be composed of both specialists and generalists was violated. He contended that the committee lacked specialists who could consider his primary field, the history of political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>philosophy; his book, \u201cNietzsche: The Ethics of an Immoralist\u201d; and his manuscript, \u201cVirtue and the Making of Modem Liberalism.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also claimed bias against him on the part of committee members due to their professional contacts with Thompson. One member had attended graduate school with Thompson and had written a favorable blurb for a book cover of an author that the plaintiff had sharply criticized. Another, as codirector of \u201cthe Program in Mind, Brain, and Behavior,\u201d was a member of the offices of the provost and president, and therefore an administrative colleague of Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">After reviewing the plaintiff\u2019s grievance, the handbook, and the docket committee\u2019s collective understanding regarding the tenure process at the university, and after consulting with legal counsel and \u201cgather[ing] additional information that [the docket committee] felt was necessary ... to reach a decision,\u201d the docket committee concluded the grievance was \u201cclearly without merit.\u201d In regard to Thompson\u2019s participation in the tenure review process, the docket committee wrote: \u201cWe are not aware of any published rule . . . that requires a member of a departmental faculty who also holds an official position in the [ujniversity to excuse himself or herself from the obligation imposed on members of a department to express their views regarding tenure candidates in their department.\u201d Moreover, the docket committee understood that \u201cprofessors who hold official posts traditionally consider their role as members of their home departments to be paramount. They therefore routinely express themselves regarding tenure cases when those cases are discussed in their departments, and write the letters for ad hoc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tenure review committees and the [president that are required by the [handbook].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The docket committee also concluded that Thompson\u2019s dual role did not improperly intrude on the decision-making of the dean or the president. The docket committee concluded that as associate provost, Thompson had \u201cno formal or informal supervisory function over the Deans.\u201d In regard to the president, the docket committee emphasized that the president has the \u201csole discretion\u201d to decide tenure cases, and that discretion included the right to consult with whomever the president pleased.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">As for the composition of the ad hoc committee, the docket committee stated that \u201ceven if the facts were as you state, that would not present a case of a procedural error in the formation of your ad hoc tenure review committee.\u201d The docket committee rejected the contention that \u201cscholarly differences\u201d alone could amount to prohibited bias or conflict of interest. It also concluded, after review of the university\u2019s rules and practices, that it was \u201cnot aware of any requirement that any member of an ad hoc tenure review committee, much less the committee as a whole, be expert in the narrow subject-matter areas of the tenure candidate whom they review.\u201d The docket committee explained, \u201cuniversities in general, and Harvard University in particular, hold the view that information is not tethered to a particular narrow field of expert knowledge, but exists in a way that can be assessed by others in different fields, who can tell exceptional quality when they see it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">C. <em>The complaint. </em>In the complaint he filed in Superior Court, the plaintiff alleged breaches of contract and common law duty by the university. He claimed that his \u201cgrievance presented meritorious, reasonable and credible complaints\u201d that proper procedures were not followed in the decision to deny him tenure. He further claimed that the bias, lack of expertise and conflicts of interest among members of the ad hoc committee prevented him from being judged strictly on his merits as required by the handbook. He contended that these \u201cplain violations\u201d of the handbook could not have been properly dismissed as \u201cclearly without merit\u201d by the docket committee. He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>alleged that the docket committee exceeded its expressly limited mandate by undertaking an investigation, rather than a \u201cpreliminary screening,\u201d of the grievance, thereby \u201cusurping\u201d the role of the ad hoc grievance committee, which would have performed the review in the next step in the grievance process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The handbook provides that one of the three members of the ad hoc grievance committee would have been selected by the plaintiff. The plaintiff would also have had a right to appear before the committee, and if the committee allowed, to have access to confidential documents. Finally, he would have had the right to receive and respond to the committee\u2019s draft report before the report was sent to the dean. The dean could take whatever action he believed the ad hoc grievance committee\u2019s report warranted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">By his motion to amend his complaint, filed two years after his grievance and nine months after his original complaint, the plaintiff sought to add counts alleging violation of the \u201cshort list\u201d provision of the handbook. He claimed that the short list on which his name appeared did not include scholars comparable in \u201cdistinction and career stages\u201d because \u201cseveral of the short list scholars had advanced substantially further in their careers\u201d than he had, having received their doctorates while he was in either high school or college. Six of the seven had also been tenured. He further alleged that comparable scholars were excluded from the list. He stated he was unable to learn the names on the short list until after he filed his grievance, because the university kept the list confidential. The plaintiff never presented the docket committee a grievance concerning the short list.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">A Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiff to amend his complaint to include the short list claim, and denied the university\u2019s motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), to dismiss all claims. On the university\u2019s request for a report to this court, the judge found that his denial of the university\u2019s motion to dismiss so affected the merits of the case that the propriety of his order should be reviewed here. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>result he stayed further proceedings in Superior Court and reported his order to this court for determination. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111; Mass.R.Civ.P. 64(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">II. <em>Discussion. </em>In interpreting a university contract,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we are guided by two fundamental principles set out in <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. 474 (2000). First, we employ the \u201cstandard of \u2018reasonable expectation \u2014 what meaning the party making the manifestation, the university, should reasonably expect the other party to give it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, quoting from <em>Cloud </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Univ., </em>720 F.2d 721, 724 (1st Cir. 1983). See <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Salve Regina College, </em>565 F.2d 200, 202 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 971 (1978). Second, we \u201cadhere to the principle that \u2018[c]ourts are chary about interfering with academic . . . decisions made by private colleges and universities.\u201d <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. at 482, quoting from <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 23, 26 (1999). See <em>Beitzell </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>643 F.2d 870, 875 (1st Cir. 1981) (\u201cGiven the university\u2019s overall mission, the creation and transmission of knowledge, the very need for strong procedural protections to prevent the wrongful dismissal of a tenured teacher concomitantly suggests a need for wide discretion in making an initial tenure award\u201d); <em>Kumar </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, Univ. of Mass., </em>774 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1097 (1986) (Campbell, C.J., concurring) (\u201c[C]ourts must be extremely wary of intruding into the world of university tenure decisions. These decisions necessarily hinge on subjective [judgments] regarding the applicant\u2019s academic excellence, teaching ability, creativity, contributions to the university community, rapport with students and colleagues, and other factors that are not susceptible of quantitative measurement\u201d). Therefore, in the absence of a violation of a reasonable expectation created by the contract, see <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. at 478, or arbitrary and capricious conduct by the university, see <em>Coveney </em>v. <em>President &amp; Trustees of the College </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>of the Holy Cross, </em>388 Mass. 16, 19-20 (1983), courts are not to intrude into university decision-making.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In considering a motion to dismiss under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), we accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint, as well as any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts therein alleged.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cHowever, we do not accept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.\u201d <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. at 477. The interpretation of the contract itself generally presents a question of law for the court. <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lanco Scaffolding Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 729 (1999). Whether or not a contract is ambiguous is also a question of law for the court. <em>Fashion House, Inc. </em>v. <em>K Mart Corp., </em>892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">A. <em>Allegations in grievance. </em>In order to determine whether the docket committee improperly dismissed the grievance, we need to consider the underlying alleged procedural violations that the docket committee was being asked to address involving Thompson and the ad hoc committee, and then determine whether the docket committee, in a preliminary screening, could properly determine that the claims in the grievance were clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">1. <em>Participation of Thompson. </em>As the docket committee recognized, no provisions in the handbook prevented Thompson, because of his part-time position as associate provost, from submitting a confidential letter. Indeed, the handbook stated that each faculty member in the nominee\u2019s department should submit a confidential letter giving the writer\u2019s view of the nominee. The purpose of such letters is to inform the president fully of each member\u2019s views; there was no disqualification for the nominee\u2019s friends or foes in the department. As an associate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>provost, Thompson did not give up his rights or obligations as a department member.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Moreover, the handbook sets out a rigorous tenure review process designed to generate for the president\u2019s consideration a comprehensive range of opinions about the nominee as well as comparisons to other distinguished scholars. As the ultimate decision maker, the president was not beholden to the associate provost or anyone else. The president was as free to consider, accept, or reject Thompson\u2019s views as he was those of others inside and outside the university. In sum, nothing in the contract language or purpose supports exclusion of Thompson from participating in the tenure review process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Bennington College Corp., </em>72 F.3d 1017, 1024 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 822 (1996); <em>Romer </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges, </em>842 F. Supp. 703, 709 (W.D.N.Y. 1994).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">2. <em>Ad hoc committee claims. </em>We likewise conclude that the docket committee did not violate the handbook when it screened out and dismissed as clearly without merit the grievance regarding the composition of the ad hoc committee. In his amended complaint, and similarly in his grievance, the plaintiff alleged that \u201cnone of the members of the [a]d [h]oc [cjommittee . . . were specialists with respect to the writings of Nietzsche or contemporary liberal political theory.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, when \u201cwe employ the standard of reasonable expectation \u2014 what meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the party making the manifestation, the university, should reasonably expect the other party to give it,\u201d <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. at 478 (quotation omitted) \u2014 we find no reasonable basis for his contractual interpretation of the meaning of specialists.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The alleged violation is based on the handbook provision that states \u201cthe [ad hoc] committee is ordinarily composed of [three] or [four] scholars (\u2018generalists\u2019 as well as \u2018specialists\u2019).\u201d The handbook contains no further definition of specialists. In determining its meaning in this context, we consider that the ad hoc committee\u2019s review of the candidate\u2019s work is only one of several provided for the president pursuant to the handbook. The department\u2019s faculty members also weigh in, as well as outside scholars consulted to review the short list. The ad hoc committee is therefore not the sole source of specialized review of the nominee.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The docket committee concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s claim regarding the absence of appropriate specialists on the ad hoc committee was clearly without merit, as there was no requirement that any member of the ad hoc tenure review committee, much less the committee as a whole, be expert in the \u201cnarrow subject-matter areas\u201d of the tenure candidate. It further concluded that its inquiry into the customs and traditions of the university had not disclosed such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">We conclude that the handbook language and structure could create no reasonable expectation to support the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation. Moreover, the question of who is or is not a specialist is an area that courts are particularly ill-suited to judge in the absence of clear direction from the university itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim of bias based on scholarly differences can be disposed of with dispatch. There is no basis to consider such differences to be grounds for disqualification. We are therefore left with his claims of bias arising out of the association between various members of the ad hoc committee and Thompson. The plaintiff claims that these relationships <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>prevented the ad hoc committee from \u201cmak[ing] certain that nominees [were] judged strictly on their merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">As we have concluded that Thompson\u2019s participation was not precluded by the contract, other committee members were likewise not precluded because of association with Thompson. The purpose of the \u201cstrictly on the merits\u201d provision that the plaintiff relies on is to assure the broadest possible input into a rigorous selection process. Academic adversaries, as Thompson is alleged to be, are not meant to be excluded from the process. Nor are the associates of the nominee\u2019s adversaries. The docket committee\u2019s decision to dismiss this grievance as \u201cclearly without merit\u201d pursuant to a preliminary screening did not violate the appointment handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">B. <em>Scope of docket committee review of plaintiff\u2019s grievance. </em>The plaintiff argues that the dismissal of his grievance was improper in that the docket committee exceeded the permissible scope of a \u201cpreliminary screening.\u201d He objects to the decision by the docket committee to conduct an inquiry to make sure that there were no rules or even customs that it was not aware of concerning the composition of the ad hoc committee and the associate provost\u2019s participation. We conclude that the plaintiff reads undue restrictions into the handbook provision that states grievances are submitted to the docket committee \u201cfor preliminary screening.\u201d Appendix X of the handbook sets out a multistage review process for grievances that contend \u201cproper procedures have not been followed.\u201d The first formal screening is performed by the docket committee and the second by an ad hoc grievance committee. In its preliminary screening, the docket committee filters out grievances that are \u201cfound to be clearly without merit,\u201d leaving those grievances that it believes raise meritorious issues for the ad hoc grievance committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The plaintiff contends that the inquiry undertaken by the docket committee exceeded its powers. The docket committee\u2019s investigation included hiring outside legal counsel, interviewing witnesses, and gathering and weighing evidence and interviewing the plaintiff and his tenure advisor. The scope of the inquiry contemplated in the docket committee\u2019s preliminary screening is not defined or in any way limited in the handbook. The docket committee is simply charged with determining whether proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>procedures have been followed and screening out those grievances that are \u201cfound\u201d to be clearly without merit. There is nothing to suggest that a preliminary screening, particularly in regard to a tenure process, where the stakes on both sides are very high, cannot be a careful and conscientious one to ensure that the grievance is clearly without merit. Requiring a finding to this effect further supports this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The plaintiff argues that a grievance is not \u201cclearly without merit\u201d if it requires such extensive follow-up inquiry, and that such a grievance belongs in the ad hoc grievance committee. This grievance, however, involved a tenure decision, which is by definition an important, and often fiercely contested one. It was also \u201cthe first [written, formal grievance] ever presented to the [e]lected [m]embers [of the docket committee] under the [handbook\u2019s] [guidelines\u201d and therefore the committee was not \u201cable to rely on established precedents.\u201d The docket committee therefore proceeded deliberately and undertook some follow-up inquiry. In the absence of handbook language expressly limiting the docket committee\u2019s powers of inquiry, we are reluctant to read in restrictions that limit the university\u2019s discretion. See <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. at 481 (\u201cIt is not the business of lawyers and judges to tell universities what statements they may consider and what statements they must reject\u201d). See also <em>Holert </em>v. <em>University of Chicago, </em>751 F. Supp. 1294, 1301 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (\u201cBecause the relationship . . . was strictly contractual in nature, [the plaintiff] was entitled only to those procedural safeguards that the University agreed to provide\u201d); <em>Romer </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges, </em>842 F. Supp. at 709 (\u201cThe question before this court. . . is whether the Handbook <em>expressly </em>limits or precludes the Colleges\u2019 right to consider such matters\u201d). We also do not interpret the existence of the additional procedures assigned in the handbook to the ad hoc grievance committee to preclude further inquiry by the docket committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Finally, our task is simplified by the clear lack of merit of the underlying grievances themselves, which has been explained above. Where the underlying grievances being preliminarily screened are without support in the contract, we discern no prejudice to the plaintiff arising out of the docket committee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>double-checking of its work through further inquiry. See <em>Holert </em>v. <em>University of Chicago, </em>751 F. Supp. at 1301 (university conducted its proceedings in substantial compliance with university standards); <em>Romer </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges, </em>842 F. Supp. at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">C. <em>Short list claim. </em>The plaintiff also contends that the university violated the handbook provision regarding the preparation of the short list, which states: \u201cThe department evaluates relevant scholars and ordinarily reduces the number to a short list of [five] or [six] leading contenders who, as much as possible, are comparable in ability, distinction, and career stages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The problem for the plaintiff is that the short list claim has never been grieved. In <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>422 Mass. 686, 695 (1996), the court required that a plaintiff exhaust internal grievance procedures before resorting to the courts. That case involved contractual rights arising out of a personnel manual in a corporate setting. Its reasoning was applied by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>King, </em>139 F.3d 258, 270 (1st Cir. 1998), to a tenure dispute at a university that had established an internal grievance procedure in its faculty handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Although in both of those cases the employees skipped the grievance procedure altogether and sought to go directly to court with all of their claims, we conclude that the logic of the cases applies here as well. Where employment rights are contractual, and the contract establishes an internal grievance procedure for resolving disputes, the procedure ought to be followed. This is true for individual claims, even when the claimant has already grieved and commenced litigation on other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">There are a number of reasons for the exhaustion requirement. First and foremost, it is part of the contractual bargain and defines the rights themselves. Second, it allows the contracting parties to educate each other as to their respective conceptions of the meaning of the contract. Finally, it allows the contracting parties an opportunity to work out their differences, and preserves scarce judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The motion judge, without directly addressing the exhaustion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>requirement, found that \u201c[i]n light of [the] conclusion . . . that the remainder of the amended complaint states a claim, it would be impractical to dismiss the short list claim and would elevate form over substance to require the parties to engage in the grievance process at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The parties, however, contracted for a process requiring that claims go before the docket committee to determine whether they are clearly without merit. The parties have not yet had an opportunity to address this issue outside the litigation forum. Finally, the courts should not be interpreting the short list provision without the benefit of the docket committee\u2019s interpretation \u2014 or for,.that matter, any interpretation of the contract by the university itself, except that first advanced by its litigators. With the docket committee\u2019s interpretation, all parties to the dispute and the respective trial and appellate courts interpreting the matter would be better informed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We recognize that the university\u2019s decision to keep the short fist confidential disadvantaged the plaintiff. A particularly cautious plaintiff might have contested that decision before the docket committee and forced the issue. However, we think that requires too much of the plaintiff, who was without the benefit of hindsight. Nevertheless, once the claim was discovered, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>plaintiff had a choice: he could move forward in court with the other claims or seek a stay of the judicial proceedings, while returning to the docket committee. Instead he sought a third way, which was to seek to amend the complaint to add a claim that has not been considered by the docket committee and to seek relief that would skip the docket committee. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision to allow an amendment of the complaint and to deny a motion to dismiss based on failure to exhaust was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">III. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, the motion judge\u2019s orders denying the university\u2019s motion to dismiss and allowing the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend are vacated, and an order shall enter allowing the university\u2019s motion to dismiss the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-11\"> Although the President and Fellows of Harvard College, a corporation, is the named defendant in this action, for convenience we refer to the defendant as the university.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The docket committee is elected by the university faculty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In his grievance the plaintiff described the five committee members as follows. Ellen Kennedy, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, was a co-editor of \u201cWomen in Western Political Philosophy: Kant to Nietzsche.\u201d Isaac Kramnick, a professor of government at Cornell University, was the \u201cauthor of many books dealing with the history of Anglo-American political thought from the eighteenth century to the present.\u201d The plaintiff recognized that Kramnick \u201c[brought] relevant expertise to bear on [the plaintiff\u2019s] work on liberalism but not on [his] work on Nietzsche.\u201d Leon Kass, a professor of social thought at the University of Chicago, was a leading scholar on ethics. The plaintiff alleged that the two professors from the university \u2014 Jerome Kagan, a professor of psychology, and Maria Tatar, a professor of German \u2014 had no relevant expertise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Although not explicitly stated in the handbook, there is no doubt that the decision concerning tenure remains with the president.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">For the purpose of the motion to dismiss, the university assumed that the handbook constituted a contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">This is not a case in which a plaintiff alleges discrimination based on prohibited classifications such as age, sex or race, where the courts owe no deference to the university.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Although not physically attached to the complaint, the grievance and docket committee decision were referenced in the complaint and are considered part of it. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Westpoint-Pepperell, Inc., </em>945 F.2d 40, 44 (2d Cir. 1991); <em>Paulemon </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>30 F.3d 307, 308-309 (2d Cir. 1994). Cf. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Stratus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 667, 672 (2001). These two documents are central to the breach of contract claim alleged against the docket committee, as they define the grievance being considered by the docket committee and the docket committee\u2019s action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The plaintiff also claimed in his grievance that Thompson\u2019s involvement was improper because Thompson was married to the university\u2019s associate dean for academic affairs, Carol J. Thompson, who the plaintiff alleged was \u201cadministratively connected to [his] tenure review in a variety of potentially decisive ways.\u201d We see no basis for disagreement with the docket committee\u2019s conclusion that Associate Dean Thompson\u2019s connection to Thompson did not violate any handbook provisions and did not affect the outcome of the proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The plaintiff also argued in his grievance that the university has violated its own practices in this regard. His grievance referred to a statement made by a former provost of the university that while serving as provost, he declined to participate in the affairs of his department. As the docket committee recognized, however, the full-time position of provost is different from a part-time associate provost. Moreover, there was nothing in the handbook precluding the provost\u2019s involvement in department affairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The grievance further clarifies the narrowness of the plaintiff\u2019s definition of the word \u201cspecialist.\u201d He recognizes that one member of the committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>brought \u201crelevant expertise to bear on [the plaintiff\u2019s] work on liberalism but not on [his] work on Nietzsche.\u201d Professors of ethics, German, and government he also considered too far afield.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The plaintiff argues that the provision is clear on its face and means that contenders on the short list must be comparable at least in terms of the number of years they have been scholars since receiving their doctorates. The purpose and language of the provision, however, call into question the interpretation proposed by the plaintiff. The purpose of the provision is to promote the objective of granting tenure to \u201cscholars of the first order of eminence.\u201d To promote that objective, the short list is not meant to be limited by the availability or even interest of the scholars included on the list. The university has also not defined its objective as picking the best of that year\u2019s class of tenure candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The language itself is not procrustean. The handbook states that the list \u201cordinarily\u201d should include scholars, who \u201cas much as possible\u201d are \u201ccomparable in ability, distinction, and career stages.\" Ability, distinction, and career-stages each bring to bear different considerations. The three criteria also allow different types of comparisons, particularly when they are mixed and matched: proven ability versus early promise, recognized distinction versus even greater possibility, rapid trajectories versus steady ascents, bursts of activity followed by relative \u201cburnout.\u201d The university can compare scholars at different career stages. The university in this provision has not limited itself. The overall objective is not picking people like the plaintiff, but picking the best person for tenure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
