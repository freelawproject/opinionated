The children involved were three of his nephews. He received a sentence of eighteen years and one day at M.C.I., Concord.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paroled in 1987, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>returned to prison on November 15, 1993, for a violation of its conditions. His scheduled release date from custody was May 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">On May 2, 2001, pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 8, the Commonwealth filed a petition for commitment of Boyer as a sexually dangerous person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the preliminary hearing, probable cause was found and Boyer was temporarily committed for a sixty-day evaluation at the Massachusetts Treatment Center at Bridgewater for the purpose of examination and diagnosis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Two examiners filed written reports of their examinations, diagnoses, and recommendations. The Commonwealth, in a timely fashion, moved for trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a jury-waived trial, the judge found the defendant a sexually dangerous person and committed him to a treatment center for an indeterminate period of time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Boyer appeals, alleging the judge erred by applying the incorrect statutory definition of sexually dangerous person and erred by admitting unlimited substantive hearsay. He also alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>that the civil commitment violates due process principles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>General Laws c. 123A. </em>The definition of a sexually dangerous person is divided into three separate prongs. The Commonwealth is obligated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that only one prong applies to a defendant. A sexually dangerous person is one who has been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">(i) \u201cconvicted of or adjudicated as a delinquent juvenile or youthful offender by reason of a sexual offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility;\u201d or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">(ii) \u201ccharged with a sexual offense and was determined to be incompetent to stand trial and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes such person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility; or\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">(iii) \u201cpreviously adjudicated as such by a court of the commonwealth and whose misconduct in sexual matters indicates a general lack of power to control his sexual impulses, as evidenced by repetitive or compulsive sexual misconduct by either violence against any victim, or aggression against any victim under the age of 16 years, and who, as a result, is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury on such victims because of his uncontrolled or uncontrollable desires.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The trial judge, in writing his findings, believed that the probable cause determination, made pursuant to \u00a7 12(c), qualified as a prior adjudication of sexually dangerous, and applied the third prong. This was error, as the Commonwealth concedes. The determination that probable cause exists, made pursuant to \u00a7 12(c), is not an adjudication that he is a sexually dangerous person. Rather, it is the first step of a multi-step process that includes, as stated above, the finding of probable cause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>temporary commitment to a treatment center, psychological examinations and trial. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Boyer argues that since the improper standard was used (the third prong), automatic reversal is mandated. Conversely, the Commonwealth asserts that, although the judge utilized the wrong standard, there was undisputed evidence presented at trial that met the correct standard (the first prong) and therefore the determination that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The position of the Commonwealth has some validity. It is clear upon reading the transcript that the Commonwealth indeed focused upon, presented evidence to, and argued the proper standard, that a \u201csexually dangerous person is one who has been . . . convicted of ... a sexual offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in sexual offenses . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. It is uncontested that the defendant (1) had a prior conviction for a sexual offense and (2) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The road now, however, turns bumpy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The first prong asks whether that \u201cmental defect or personality disorder . . . makes the person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility?\u201d The judge found Boyer\u2019s behavior repetitive and compulsive in accordance with defining a sexually dangerous person under the third prong. However, in doing so, the judge also found Boyer\u2019s risk of reoffending \u201cmoderate.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, it is unclear what impact the judge\u2019s erroneous belief of a prior finding of sexually dangerous had upon his ultimate decision. What is clear is that the judge placed emphasis on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>evidence that was improperly admitted, an issue that we now address.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><em>Hearsay. </em>The judge in his findings gave special weight to a statement contained in a parole report indicating that Boyer asked his girlfriend\u2019s two year old daughter, as she was sitting on his lap, if she \u201cwas homy.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commonwealth asserts that the evidence was admissible under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The use of hearsay evidence is guided, in part, by \u00a7 14(c). That section lists a litany of classic hearsay evidence, e.g., probation records, police reports, psychiatric reports, etc., which \u201cshall be admissible.\u201d While parole reports are not listed specifically, they fit comfortably within the catch-all phrase found at the end of the statute \u2014 \u201cand any other evidence tending to show that such person is or is not a sexually dangerous person . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">While \u00a7 14(c) trumps a hearsay objection to the admission of the report, still remaining is the issue of hearsay within the report. Traditional rules of evidence apply. When there is hearsay within hearsay it is commonly referred to as totem pole hearsay. \u201cGenerally, evidence based on a chain of statements is admissible only if each out-of-court assertion falls within an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>400 Mass. 639, 643 n.8 (1987) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">If there is not an exception for each statement, the hearsay is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>not admissible substantively, so long as an objection is lodged.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, it may be admissible if used for an alternative purpose, i.e., by an expert in forming his opinion. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13(\u00a3)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 339 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court was confronted with the issue whether hearsay contained in police reports and witness statements from a nol pressed complaint was admissible at trial pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(c), either directly or through expert opinion. The court held \u201cthat G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(c), does not render police reports and witness statements from nol prossed cases admissible at trial. They may be provided to a qualified examiner, and a qualified examiner may rely on them as the basis for an expert opinion, consistent with the requirements and limitations of <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>[398 Mass. 516 (1986)].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, supra </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\"><em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile </em>counsels that an expert is permitted \u201cto base an opinion on facts or data not in evidence if the facts or data are independently admissible and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We cannot ascertain, as we do not have the parole report, the source of the hearsay. If it were an identifiable individual, the statement would appear to be independently admissible through the appropriate witness (e.g., the child\u2019s mother or whoever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>heard the comment). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, supra </em>at 337. Whether, then, the statement served as a permissible basis for the expert to consider appears, in this case, to be a given. Indeed both experts considered the statement, which helped them form their respective opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">In sum, that hearsay contained in a report may be used for one purpose \u2014 here, as a basis for the expert\u2019s opinion \u2014 does not necessarily mean that it may be used for all substantive purposes by a factfinder who has to make a finding beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 391, 393-395 (1987). Assuming independent admissibility, if the admission of the totem pole hearsay contained in the report was for the purpose of ascertaining the basis of the examiners\u2019 opinions, and not for the substantive facts set forth, there is no error. See <em>id. </em>at 395. However, it is error where, as here, the judge, over objection, relied upon the statement as proven and substantive. It was improper for the judge to consider it in the manner he did.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>\u201cWith respect to the weighing and crediting of testimony admitted at trial, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact. We do, however, scrutinize without deference the propriety of the legal criteria employed by the trial judge and the manner in which those criteria were applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>438 Mass. 274, 275-276 (2002) (citation omitted). The trial judge employed the wrong definition of sexual dangerousness, using the third, rather than the first, prong of the statute. He additionally weighed hearsay evidence that should not have been admitted substantively. As such, the judgment in this matter is vacated and the case is \u201cremanded to the trial judge to determine whether the evidence, in the context of the particular facts and circumstances of the case, supports a finding that [Boyer] would reasonably be expected to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>at 281. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bladsa, 362 </em>Mass. 539, 540-542 (1972); <em>Thompson, petitioner, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 282, 284 (1977).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Pending that determination, the trial judge\u2019s order of confinement shall stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-14\">\u201cThe Concord sentence was, until its abolition by the Truth-in-Sentencing Act, St. 1993, c. 432, \u00a7 20 (see 120 Code Mass.
