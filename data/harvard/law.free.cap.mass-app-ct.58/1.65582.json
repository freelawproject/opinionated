L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. See <em>Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette Corp. </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Worcester, </em>436 Mass. 378 (2002) <em>(Worcester I). </em>The file contains materials compiled during an investigation of a citizen complaint filed by Shawn Wilder against Patrolman Michael A. Tarckini following an incident on May 1, 1999 (the Wilder file).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">The city of Worcester appeals from a judgment requiring the release, as public records, of the entire, unredacted contents of the Wilder file, excepting only documents containing information protected as criminal offender record information (CORI) by G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 167 et seq. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that materials in an internal affairs investigation are different in kind from the ordinary evaluations, performance assessments and disciplinary determinations encompassed in the public records exemption for \u201cpersonnel [file] or information,\u201d the sole exemption at issue. Accordingly, we agree with the judge\u2019s decision, except as it authorizes release of a memorandum from the chief of police of Worcester (chief) to Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Tarckini notifying him of the conclusions and disciplinary determinations of the internal affairs investigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\"><em>Background. </em>Earlier skirmishes in the newspaper\u2019s attempt to obtain the Wilder file focused upon the method for determining whether the materials sought were exempt from public disclosure. In <em>Worcester I, supra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court observed that \u201callowing the [city] to decide unilaterally, without any oversight, what documents are subject to disclosure and what documents are exempt is wholly inconsistent with the purpose of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385. The court upheld an order permitting access to the disputed \u201cpublic records\u201d under a protective order so that counsel might \u201cparticularize their arguments to the judge, citing specific materials, or portions of materials, that are exempt or subject to disclosure.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>419 Mass. 852, 868-869 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">After review of the disputed \u201cpublic records\u201d pursuant to the protective order, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. A judge of the Superior Court reviewed the contested documents, heard arguments, and entered the challenged judgment. On appeal by the city, a single justice of this court stayed the judgment and reported the case for decision by a panel. See Mass.R.A.P. 5, as amended, 378 Mass. 930 (1979); Rule 2:01 of the Rules of the Appeals Court, as amended, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 805 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">1. <em>The public records law. </em>The primary purpose of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, is to give the public broad access to governmental records. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 436 (1983). \u201c[Disclosure is favored by the \u2018presumption that the record sought is public.\u2019 G. L. c. 66, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u00a7 10(c).\u201d <em>Worcester I, </em>436 Mass. at 383. Notwithstanding the presumption favoring disclosure, the statute provides a number of specific exemptions from the definition of \u201cpublic records.\u201d See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(a) </em>through <em>(f). </em>The burden is upon the custodian of the requested record to prove, with specificity, the applicability of the relevant exemption. <em>Worcester I, supra. </em>\u201cTo the extent that only a portion of a public record may fall within an exemption to disclosure, the nonexempt \u2018segregable portion\u2019 of the record is subject to public access.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The city contends that all the material in the Wilder file is categorically exempt \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d because it is part of a disciplinary report. See <em>Wakefield Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. 792, 796-797, 799 (2000) <em>(Wakefield). </em>Materials falling within that category are absolutely exempt without need to consider the impact of disclosure upon the privacy rights of a specifically named individual. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Chief Med. Examiner, </em>404 Mass. 132, 135 (1989); <em>Wakefield, supra </em>at 797. The city posits that because internal affairs is an investigatory process that leads to officer discipline, documents and reports in an internal affairs file are \u201cdisciplinary documentation\u201d and \u201cdisciplinary reports\u201d within the ambit of <em>Wakefield, supra </em>at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The newspaper, on the other hand, contends that <em>all </em>material in the Wilder file should be subject to disclosure because none is the type of routine personnel information that the categorical exemption for \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d is intended to encompass. To buttress its argument the newspaper asserts that the public nature of the office and the awesome powers exercised by police create a compelling need for public oversight and review of a police department\u2019s internal investigations. See <em>Rotkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, </em>431 Mass. 748, 753 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Prescinding from the extreme positions offered, we view the issue more narrowly, whether as a matter of statutory interpretation the particular material in the Wilder file falls within the sole exemption claimed, under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>for \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The city asserts no claim that the materials are exempt under the second category of clause Twenty-sixth <em>(c), </em>for \u201cother materials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy\u201d (the privacy exemption). Nor does the city assert that the materials are exempt under the \u201cinvestigatory exemption\u201d set forth in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(f).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However cogent the parties\u2019 arguments might be as a matter of competing policy choices, the Legislature has determined what records should be public and what exempt from disclosure. \u201cThe Legislature clearly balanced competing public policy considerations that we shall not second-guess.\u201d <em>Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">While exempting \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d from the broad definition of \u201cpublic record,\u201d the statute does not define \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d Decisions suggest that the term is neither rigid nor precise and that the determination is case-specific. \u201cWhile the precise contours of the legislative term \u2018personnel [file] or information\u2019 may require case-by-case articulation, it includes, at a minimum, employment applications, employee work evaluations, disciplinary documentation, and promotion, demotion, or termination information pertaining to a particular employee. These constitute the core categories of personnel information that are \u2018useful in making employment decisions regarding an employee.\u2019 It would distort the plain statutory language to conclude that disciplinary reports are anything but \u2018personnel [file] or information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 798 (citation and footnote omitted). The custodian\u2019s designation of materials as \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d is not dispositive of the point any more than the custodian\u2019s placement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>material in a repository called a \u201cpersonnel file.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797 n.13 (\u201cMaterial within the \u2018personnel [file] or information\u2019 category is not limited to, nor does it extend to, all \u2018files or information\u2019 that are located physically in an individual employee\u2019s personnel file\u201d). \u201cThere is no \u2018blanket exemption\u2019 to public disclosure for records kept by police departments or for investigatory materials.\u201d <em>Worcester I, </em>436 Mass, at 383. \u201cWhat is critical is the nature or character of the documents, not their label.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386. With these imprecise guidelines in mind, we turn to the materials at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">2. <em>The Wilder file. </em>The Wilder file materials fall into three broad groups. Group I consists of exchanges between the city and the complainant Wilder or his attorney. These include the complaint itself, a notice of claim under the tort claims act, and letters from the chief to Wilder advising of the start of the internal affairs investigation and then of its results.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Group II consists of police reports, incident reports, cards reflecting police details and rosters, arrest logs, a commercial phone book listing, and a computer printout from a hockey league website. Group III consists of documents from the internal affairs investigation proper, including memoranda from the chief to Officer Tarckini and other officers requiring information about the incident, their responses, summaries of witness interviews, a report and supplemental report, and a memorandum from the chief to Officer Tarckini detailing the results of the internal affairs investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The Group I and Group II documents do not even arguably fall within any accepted interpretation of the term \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d These materials do not include Tarckini\u2019s employment application, any internal evaluations, payroll records, injury reports or performance assessments. Nor do they include information about his education and qualifications for employment. See <em>Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. at 798-799. These also do not constitute disciplinary reports, disciplinary documentation, or promotion, demotion, or termination information and hence \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d <em>Ibid.; Worcester I, </em>436 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Mass. at 386. In nature and character the Group I documents essentially constitute notice \u2014 to the city of a complaint and possible legal action, and to Wilder of the city\u2019s commencement of a formalized process for review and the results of the investigation. Group II consists of documents generated independently of the internal affairs investigation \u2014 some under different protocols for routine recording of police business, others by entities other than the city, its employees, or the complainant. The mere placement of these materials in an internal affairs file does not make them disciplinary documentation or promotion, demotion, or termination information. See <em>Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. at 797 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Group III presents a closer question. The officers\u2019 reports, the witness interview summaries, and the internal affairs report itself clearly bear on the ultimate decision by the chief to discipline or to exonerate Officer Tarckini based upon the investigation. However, that these documents bear upon such decisions does not make their essential nature or character \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d Rather, their essential nature and character derive from their function in the internal affairs process.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">An internal affairs investigation is a formalized citizen complaint procedure, separate and independent from ordinary employment evaluation and assessment. Unlike other evaluations and assessments, the internal affairs process exists specifically to address complaints of police corruption (theft, bribery, acceptance of gratuities), misconduct (verbal and physical abuse, unlawful arrest, harassment), and other criminal acts that would undermine the relationship of trust and confidence between the police and the citizenry that is essential to law enforcement. The internal affairs procedure fosters the public\u2019s trust and confidence in the integrity of the police department, its employees, and its processes for investigating complaints because the department has the integrity to discipline itself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A citizenry\u2019s full and fair assessment of a police department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>internal investigation of its officer\u2019s actions promotes the core value of trust between citizens and police essential to law enforcement and the protection of constitutional rights. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>419 Mass. at 863, 866. Disciplinary action is but one possible outcome; exoneration and protection of the officer and the department from unwarranted criticism is another.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">We reject the city\u2019s contention that, viewed as a whole, the entire internal affairs file is exempt \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d because it is a \u201cdisciplinary report\u201d relative to a specific complaint about a specific police officer\u2019s actions. See <em>Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. at 798. Definitional alchemy is not a substitute for particularized review. That the internal affairs process might lead to discipline, or even criminal action, does not transmute all materials in an internal affairs investigation into a disciplinary report, disciplinary documentation, or promotion, demotion or termination information. Such a broad construction ignores the essential directive that the legislative term \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d derives its meaning from the nature or character of the document, not from its label or its repository. See <em>Worcester I, </em>436 Mass. at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The formalized nature and unique purpose of the internal affairs citizen complaint process serve to distinguish this case from <em>Wakefield, supra, </em>in which the court determined a disciplinary decision and report of a school superintendent regarding a public school teacher to be exempt \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 792-793.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It would be odd, indeed, to shield from the light of public scrutiny as \u201cpersonnel [file] or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>information\u201d the workings and determinations of a process whose quintessential purpose is to inspire public confidence. Accordingly, we consider the officers\u2019 reports, the witness interview summaries, and the internal affairs report itself to be substantially different from the single, integrated report held to be \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d in Wakefield.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The nature and character of these materials, and the context in which they arise, take them beyond what the legislature contemplated when exempting \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Standing on different footing, and more like the disciplinary report in <em>Wakefield, </em>is the September 10, 1999, memorandum from the chief to Officer Tarckini detailing the findings of the internal affairs investigation and the conclusion that no disciplinary action was to be taken. The document is a notice from the disciplining authority to the particular employee advising of the disciplinary decision (that disciplinary action was not warranted). The nature and character of this document makes it part of \u201cthe core category] of personnel information that [is] useful in making employment decisions regarding the employee.\u201d <em>Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. at 798 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the question is close, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>we conclude that this is a disciplinary report exempt from disclosure as \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We acknowledge that, at first glance, the distinction drawn between the records seems an unlikely splitting of hairs: the memorandum from the chief to Officer Tarckini constitutes exempt \u201cpersonnel [file] or information,\u201d while documents from the internal affairs investigation proper, including the interviews, the reports, the conclusions and recommendations, and the documenting of its results to the complainant are not so exempt. However, when considered in light of the purpose of the public records law, it is not at all illogical that the Legislature would intend the bricks and mortar of the investigation and the documenting of its results to the complainant to fall outside the exemption for \u201cpersonnel [file] or information,\u201d but would intend the actual order and notice of disciplinary action issued as a personnel matter from the chief to the target of the disciplinary investigation to be exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">That the information contained in the chiefs memorandum to Officer Tarckini is essentially identical to that contained in the letter to Wilder\u2019s attorney does not make the memorandum to Officer Tarckini a public record any more than it makes the letter to Wilder\u2019s attorney exempt \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d The exemption for \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d is not dependent upon whether the same information may be available, or discernible, through alternative sources. Rather, the nature and character of the document determines whether it is \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d See <em>Worcester I, </em>436 Mass. at 386. Put differently, the same information may simultaneously be contained in a public record and in exempt \u201cpersonnel [file] or information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">We need not dwell upon the city\u2019s alternative contention that if the Wilder file materials are to be released, then the proper names and other identifying information of the complainant, the witnesses, and police officers (both those investigating and the subject of investigation) should be redacted. The city has emphasized that the sole issue on appeal is the applicability of the \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d exemption. See <em>Globe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>419 Mass, at 856-857. Accordingly, we do not consider the privacy exemption or interests protected by the investigatory exemption, to encourage \u201cindividual citizens to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation, and the creation of initiative that police officers might be completely candid in recording their observations, hypotheses and interim conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 859, quoting from <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 62 (1976).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_a\">With the exception noted, we conclude that the Superior Court judge did not commit any error of law in treating the material in the Wilder file as a public record. See <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. at 61.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The city failed in its burden of proving, with specificity, the applicability of the \u201cpersonnel [file] or information\u201d exemption. See <em>Worcester I, </em>436 Mass. at 383. We reverse so much of the judgment as provides for the public release of the September 10, 1999, memorandum from the chief of police of Worcester to Officer Tarckini (denoted document number 33 in the record). The judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\">In a separate proceeding in which the newspaper sought release of 111 internal affairs files covering the years 1997 and 1998, the parties entered a stipulation agreeing to be governed by the ruling in this case. Our decision governs only the Wilder file. As explained in <em>Worcester I, </em>\u201cthe applicability of <em>[Wakefield Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. 792 (2000),] and the \u2018personnel files\u2019 exemption to public records disclosure can only be ascertained <em>after </em>the \u2018records\u2019 have been reviewed to determine their precise nature.\u201d 436 Mass. at 386.
