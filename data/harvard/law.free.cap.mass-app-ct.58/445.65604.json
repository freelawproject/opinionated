L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 12-14, as amended by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 3-8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Judicial Court expressly declined comment on the issue in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. McLeod, 437 Mass. 286, 293 n.10 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In <em>McLeod, </em>the court dealt with a defendant who had been convicted in 1998 and 1992 of \u201csexual offenses\u201d (rape and indecent assault and battery of a child and aggravated rape) as defined in the statute, G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. McLeod served the sentences imposed for those sexual crimes and was released into the community. In 2000, he was convicted, placed on parole, and reimprisoned (upon probation violation) for crimes (assault, assault and battery, threatening to commit a crime, and drug possession) not falling within c. 123A. As McLeod\u2019s date of ultimate release from prison on account of the sentences imposed for those nonsexual crimes approached, the Commonwealth petitioned for his civil commitment as a person who remained sexually dangerous. McLeod moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the statute applied only to persons who were incarcerated for an enumerated sexual offense at the time the petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The court agreed that, since McLeod was not then serving a sentence for a defined sexual offense, he was \u201cnot eligible for potential civil commitment\u201d under c. 123A. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 292. The court stressed that McLeod had \u201ccompleted his sentences for [his sexual offense] crimes\u201d years before and held that the commitment statute could not have been intended to be applicable to \u201cany defendant serving a sentence for any crime who had ever in the past committed an enumerated sexual offense, no matter how temporally distant.\u201d <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 292. The court did not, however, address the meaning of the word \u201crelease\u201d as used in \u00a7 12(a) of the statute and explicitly refused to extend its holding to the situation of a defendant whose sentence for a statutorily enumerated sexual offense had expired but who remained incarcerated on account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>of a sentence for a nonenumerated offense that had been imposed either concurrently or consecutively. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 293 n.10. See note 5, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">That situation is now before us. The defendant, Paul F. Shed-lock, Jr., was indicted by a Plymouth County grand jury on May 26, 1976, on counts of rape and unnatural acts stemming from an April 1, 1976, incident during which he raped and sexually assaulted a female hitchhiker after threatening to cut out her tongue. On February 17, 1977, shortly before trial, the defendant defaulted and fled to Texas. On September 2, 1978, while in Texas, he forced his way into a young couple\u2019s hotel room, where he raped and sexually assaulted the woman occupant and robbed the couple, threatening their lives with a gun. He was arrested a short time later, and on October 16, 1978, he pleaded guilty in Texas to aggravated sexual abuse, aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, and attempted burglary of a building, and was sentenced to six years in the custody of the Texas Department of Corrections. He was paroled in September, 1981, but was returned to prison in December, 1981, to serve a two-year sentence for the attempted burglary of a transmission parts store. He was released from Texas custody in October, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The defendant was eventually returned to Massachusetts by interstate rendition proceedings and tried by a jury on the 1976 charges. He was found guilty of rape and unnatural acts, and, on June 16, 1986, sentenced to not less than eight nor more than fifteen years on the rape conviction and not less than three nor more than five years for the unnatural acts conviction, the latter sentence to run concurrently with the rape sentence. The defendant\u2019s original release date based on these sentences was October 21, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">In September, 1989, the defendant escaped and remained at large for 121 days. He was recaptured in New Jersey and was returned to custody in Massachusetts. His maximum release date on the rape conviction was revised to February 19, 2001, on account of his 121 days out of custody. As a result of his escape, he was tried, convicted, and (in March, 1990) sentenced to not less than two nor more than three years, to be served \u201cconsecutive to\u201d his rape sentence. These two sentences were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>aggregated according to Department of Correction regulations to determine a revised maximum release date of February 19, 2004. As a result of \u201cgood time credits\u201d earned for participation in certain programs, pursuant to G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129D (not including a sex offender program, in which the defendant refused to participate), his maximum release date was subsequently adjusted to December 13, 2002. The defendant never received a certificate of discharge for the rape sentence and has remained in custody continuously since his June, 1986, rape conviction, except for the time he was an escapee.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">On November 8, 2002, the Commonwealth filed a petition for the defendant\u2019s civil commitment as a sexually dangerous person, pursuant to the provisions of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>After some procedural skirmishing, the defendant responded with a motion to dismiss the petition. His argument was that the petition had to have been brought prior to his \u201crelease\u201d from his sentence for rape and was untimely and not maintainable thereafter, on the theory that G. L. c. 123A does not allow the commitment of an individual who, though continuously incarcerated, is no longer serving the sentence imposed for his sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">A Superior Court judge agreed with the defendant and denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for his temporary commitment pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(e), pending a probable cause hearing. Basing his decision on what he saw as \u201cthe logic\u201d of <em>McLeod, </em>the judge thought that because the defendant was not serving a sentence for an enumerated sexual offense at the time of the petition\u2019s filing, he could not be in the class of individuals eligible for civil commitment as a sexually dangerous person. The judge acknowledged, however, that the question was \u201cnot free from doubt\u201d because of the <em>McLeod </em>disclaimer. 437 Mass. at 293 n.10. He therefore decided to address the underlying issue, whether the Commonwealth had made a sufficient showing for a temporary commitment of the defendant pending a probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The judge focused on the defendant\u2019s repeated and vicious sexual assaults, his long and violent criminal record, his history of substance abuse, his refusal to engage in a sex offender program while incarcerated, his high score on a statistical measure of recidivism, his history of flight based on his lengthy default on the Plymouth County charges and his 1989 escape, and a report as to the likelihood of his reoffending filed by the Commonwealth\u2019s expert. On the basis of those facts, the judge concluded that he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that the Commonwealth had made a \u201csufficient showing,\u201d \u00a7 12(e), for a temporary commitment pending a probable cause hearing. Further, the judge found, that \u201c[wjere [the defendant] a person eligible under [c. 123A] [the judge] would grant the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>a temporary commitment.\u201d In light of that conclusion, the judge ordered that the defendant remain in custody while the Commonwealth filed an interlocutory appeal to a single justice of this court, who in turn stayed the defendant\u2019s release pending the Commonwealth\u2019s expedited interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The Commonwealth contends the judge\u2019s extension of \u201cthe logic\u201d of <em>McLeod </em>was contrary to the plain language, legislative intent, and rational operation of the statute. In particular, the Commonwealth attacks the practical consequence of the ruling for proceedings under G. L. c. 123A. It argues that the judge erred in effectively construing the word \u201crelease\u201d in \u00a7 12(a) as the defendant proposed, which would require the Commonwealth to file its notice and petition for the civil commitment of a defendant such as Shedlock at the expiration of that portion of the defendant\u2019s period of incarceration specifically attributable to his conviction of a sexual offense, rather than at the end of his continuous period of incarceration when he will actually be released into the community. The Commonwealth points out that, under that reading, the prisoner\u2019s release (as here) may be years after the formal end of his sexual offense sentence and the filing of the Commonwealth\u2019s \u00a7 12(A) petition. The defendant asserts that such a requirement is precisely what <em>McLeod </em>envisioned (a proposition difficult to reconcile with the specificity with which the <em>McLeod </em>court refused to address whether its holding applied to facts such as those presented here).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the Commonwealth for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>McLeod </em>itself furnishes the fundamental principle of our analysis. \u201c[Statutory language should be given effect consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result.\u201d <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass, at 290, quoting from <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). Both the plain meaning of the operative word \u201crelease\u201d and the clearly stated purposes of the Legislature in promulgating the present civil commitment process for sexually dangerous persons support the Commonwealth\u2019s position: \u201crelease\u201d as used in \u00a7 12(a) must mean a sexual offender\u2019s release into general society at the end of a continuous period of incarceration that began with his conviction for a sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Every dictionary definition of both the verb and the noun forms of \u201crelease\u201d states, as their primary meaning, the action of liberation or setting free from confinement or restraint. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1917 (1993); the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1524 (3d ed. 1992); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1292 (7th ed. 1999). An inmate who reaches the date of the technical completion of his sentence for a sexual offense cannot be deemed to have been \u201creleased\u201d as of that date, as that word is \u201cunderstood in accordance with its generally accepted plain meaning\u201d and with approved usage and common understanding, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>438 Mass. 274, 276, 279, 281 (2002), if he continues to be incarcerated for years thereafter on a sentence for a nonenumerated offense imposed to follow immediately on the heels of the prior sentence. See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, cl. Third (\u201cIn construing statutes . . . [w]ords . . . shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Legislature\u2019s expectation that the \u201ccourts [would] apply the plain and ordinary meaning\u201d of the language used in the civil commitment provisions of G. L. c. 123A, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>435 Mass. 527, 530 (2001), was manifested by the unmistakably explicit statement of primary legislative purpose set forth in the preamble to St. 1999, c. 74: \u201c[I]ts purpose . . . is to protect forthwith the vulnerable members of our communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ties from sexual offenders,\u201d i.e., \u201cto protect the public from sexually dangerous persons.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 500 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">It would appear evident beyond the need for demonstration that the public requires no protection from potentially dangerous sexual predators so long as they remain incarcerated, for whatever reason, after their sexual offense sentence has come to an end. Nor is such protection needed at any time prior to their actually being reintegrated into the community on the occasion of their physical release from all restraint and confinement. As <em>McLeod </em>itself pertinently observed: \u201cThe thrust of the statutory scheme is that commitment petitions should be brought against persons . . . <em>who are about to be released into the community </em>but who, because they are sexually dangerous, are likely to commit another sexual offense, and, therefore, should not be released\u201d (emphasis added). 437 Mass, at 291.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Were further reinforcement of the Legislature\u2019s intended meaning for the word \u201crelease\u201d in \u00a7 12(a) needed, it can be seen in the other recognized purpose of St. 1999, c. 74: \u201cto provide [sexually dangerous persons] treatment, and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass, at 500. It is again evident that commitment for treatment as a sexually dangerous person cannot begin, much less be effective, until the date of the defendant\u2019s physical release from incarceration and transfer to the treatment center. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 <em>14(d) </em>(\u201cThe order of commitment . . . forwarded to the treatment center . . . shall become effective . . . on the date of discharge from jail, the house of correction, [or] prison\u201d). Compare <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>435 Mass, at 530-531 (equating the terms \u201cdischarge\u201d and \u201crelease\u201d as used in c. 123A).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">As demonstrated by the case of Shedlock himself, the important legislative goal of treatment for the purpose of achieving rehabilitation and reentry into society \u2014 the potential success of which the entire statutory scheme presumes, see <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, 154 (1996) \u2014 would be rendered a nullity by the defendant\u2019s construction of the statute. The Commonwealth would be required futilely to commence commitment proceedings with respect to a defendant who is impervious to meaningful rehabilitation while he continues serving a lengthy sentence in prison where he is able to frustrate any such efforts by refusing to undergo sex offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Even if we were of the view that the word \u201crelease\u201d as used in \u00a7 12(a) suffered from some imprecision or ambiguity requiring judicial interpretation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rather than being clear from its plain meaning read in light of its explicit legislative intent and the workable result such a reading yields, see <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 286 (1996), we would still agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s position. The frustration of the legislative objectives animating St. 1999, c. 74 \u2014 public protection and rehabilitative treatment \u2014 that would result from construing \u201crelease\u201d as the defendant desires compels an interpretation that not only is reasonable but also makes the operation of the statute meaningful, useful, and practical. See <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 190 (1976) (where a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201clacks precision . . . [or] the draftsmanship is faulty ... the duty devolves upon us to give [it] ... a reasonable construction [so as] . . . to carry out the legislative intent\u201d [internal citations omitted]); <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996) (we cannot construe a statute in such a manner that \u201c[t]he legislative effort would have ... no practical effect . . . [or that] will defeat [the legislative] purpose\u201d); <em>Milton Commons Assocs. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 111, 116-117 (1982) (when interpreting a statute, we must \u201cavoid[] a construction which would negate legislative intent or defeat its intended utility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Judicial gloss on the 1999 amendments to c. 123A further demonstrates that the meaning the defendant urges for the word \u201crelease\u201d would hinder, if not defeat, legislative intent. As earlier noted, adoption of the defendant\u2019s position would have required the Commonwealth to commence the civil commitment process against him by notice and petition at the end of his original rape sentence, despite the fact that his escape and additional sentence kept him imprisoned for several years thereafter. In <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass, at 498, the Supreme Judicial Court made it clear that \u201cthe conduct triggering the statute\u2019s application is not the prior conviction of a sexual offense, but the <em>current mental condition of a defendant. . . . The focus of ... the statute\u2019s </em>various sections relating to the procedures governing commitment <em>is a defendant\u2019s current mental condi</em>tion\u201d (emphases supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Given that statutory focus \u2014 particularly in light of the pellucid intent of the statutory scheme to authorize commitment petitions against sexually dangerous persons who pose an actual danger to society because they \u201care about to be released into the community,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass, at 291 \u2014 the defendant\u2019s position makes little sense. To require the Commonwealth to have filed its petition against him prior to the end of his rape sentence \u2014 which, as it turned out, was over two years before his scheduled release into the community \u2014 would do nothing but create duplicative, wasteful proceedings that could not have been intended by the Legislature. It is unlikely to the point of implausibility that the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>could have then filed such a petition in good faith, ethically, or in compliance with <em>Bruno. </em>It would have had to aver that it had \u201csufficient facts to support\u201d the allegation that the defendant \u201cis a sexually dangerous person,\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(\u00bf&gt;), based not only on his then \u201ccurrent mental condition\u201d but also on the dubious assertion \u2014 whether express or implied \u2014 that he would continue into the future to have the requisite mental condition, however long it took for him finally to complete serving his consecutive sentences. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass, at 504-506 (the fact the defendant was adjudicated not to be a sexually dangerous person several years earlier did not collaterally estop the Commonwealth from subsequently bringing a new commitment petition just prior to his release from prison, because \u201cwhether Bruno is currently a sexually dangerous person[] is [a] quite different [issue] from whether he was sexually dangerous\u201d at that earlier time).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Had the Commonwealth been compelled and able to prove as of the end of his rape sentence that the defendant then had the requisite \u201ccurrent mental condition\u201d to warrant committing him for treatment as a sexually dangerous person (although he could not have been so committed while remaining in prison) and then subsequently sought on that basis to commit him immediately upon his final discharge from confinement several years later, its earlier effort would have been fruitless. The defendant justifiably could challenge that subsequent commitment not only on basic due process grounds, <em>id. </em>at 502-504, but also by virtue of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(e) (person named in the petition may move court for relief at any time prior to probable cause determination). The Commonwealth would thereupon have the obligation of expending additional resources to undertake a second petitioning effort before his December, 2002, release date to justify the commitment on the basis of \u201ccurrent\u201d facts, in effect starting all over again. The Legislature could not have intended the Commonwealth to bear the burden of pursuing multiple proceedings against a defendant, particularly given that the word \u201cpetition\u201d is stated in the singular whenever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>mentioned in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">In addition to generating wasteful and unnecessary proceedings, it is foreseeable that the defendant\u2019s construction of \u201crelease\u201d would adversely affect prison discipline by encouraging sexual offenders to commit new, nonsexual crimes while imprisoned. They could thereby reduce the risk that they might ultimately be found sexually dangerous persons under G. L. c. 123A (which would make them subject to institutionalization for an indeterminate period up to life, G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14[df]) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>simply because their additional crimes could extend their periods of incarceration until long after the termination of the underlying sexual offense sentence. During that extension they could decline sexual offender treatment while exhibiting no conduct indicating sexual dangerousness because of their confined and strictly regulated situation, so that at such future time as the Commonwealth would have to address its burden of proof, it might well be much more difficult to satisfy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">We thus conclude that, whether the meaning of G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12(a), appears clear on its face or is deemed to be ambiguous,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the notice and petition authorized by G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, are appropriately filed at the time of the defendant\u2019s imminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>release into the community, at the end of all of the continuous sentences he is serving, and not at the end of that portion of his ongoing incarceration technically attributable to his sexual offense. The Commonwealth\u2019s \u00a7 12(6) petition with respect to Shedlock was therefore timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Accordingly, we hold that for purposes of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, the Commonwealth\u2019s November 8, 2002, petition for temporary commitment of the defendant pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(e), was timely. In the circumstances of this case, the release date that triggered G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(a)-(e), was in December, 2002. Further, in view of the motion judge\u2019s finding that the Commonwealth made a sufficient showing for temporary commitment of the defendant pending a probable cause hearing, see <em>supra </em>at 449-450, the order of the Superior Court denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(e), is reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The defendant\u2019s temporary commitment to the Massachusetts Treatment Center shall be in accordance with the guidelines set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass, at 511-513, except that the defendant shall be accorded the opportunity to appear in person at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 1, defines \u201csexual offenses\u201d for which a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d may be civilly committed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-14 after \u201crelease\u201d from incarceration.

L. c. 123A in <em>McLeod </em>is distinguishable and not controlling not only because of the court\u2019s explicit disclaimer, but also because the sentence McLeod was serving when the c. 123A proceeding was initiated was for a crime that occurred many years after his sexual offense and was entirely unconnected to that offense and the sentence therefor. See <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass, at 287, 292. By contrast, a logical nexus existed between the sentence for escape Shedlock was serving at the time of the petition at issue here and his original sexual offense sentence, because the imposition of the subsequent sentence was entirely attributable to his effort to escape from the earlier sexual offense sentence and a direct consequence of his having to serve that sentence. The two sentences were thus causally related. At the time the instant petition was filed, Shedlock was arguably incarcerated by reason of the sexual offense sentence, but for the existence of which he would not have been imprisoned. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 289.

See <em>Vigeant </em>v. <em>Postal Tel. Cable Co., </em>260 Mass. 335, 343-344 (1927); <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 719 n.11 (1990); <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Pires, </em>438 Mass. 96, 101 n.5 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>46 Mass.

Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 561-563 (2001) (defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3[9][/], prohibiting unfair \u201csettlements of claims\u201d by insurers, to mean that a single ongoing act cannot constitute an actionable violation, was rejected because it would inevitably produce unnecessary, complex and contentious lawsuits). Shedlock\u2019s view of the statute would produce an even greater multiplicity of proceedings, for he asserts that had the petition been brought at the termination of his sexual offense sentence, he could have taken advantage of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9. That provision gives a person determined to be sexually dangerous the right to file a petition for discharge, with jury trial demand, every twelve months. Such a filing puts the Commonwealth to the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner currently remains a sexually dangerous person. <em>Wyatt, petitioner, </em>428 Mass. 347, 351-353 (1998). The likelihood of further proceedings is also enhanced because not only does the \u201cstatute [allow] an SDP continually to challenge his status as sexually dangerous, [but also provides that] ... the Commonwealth may assure the legal correctness of each such adjudication by invoking appellate review.\u201d <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass, at 155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Shedlock also suggests an \u201calternative\u201d interpretation of the statute that would require the Commonwealth to file its petition at the end of the sexual offense sentence but postpone all proceedings on that petition, including the probable cause determination, until the end of his consecutive sentence. In addition to entailing similar duplicative effort on the part of the Commonwealth, this interpretation violates the clear language of G. L. c. 123 A, \u00a7 12(6) &amp; (c), as well as the requirement that the petitioner allege and prove the defendant\u2019s \u201ccurrent mental condition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s potential difficulty is reflected in <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass, at 157, where the court reversed the dismissal of the Commonwealth\u2019s sexually dangerous person petition because the trial judge had relied on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to produce \u201crecent evidence\u201d of \u201ccontemporaneous\u201d or \u201crecent conduct\u201d indicating sexual dangerousness. The court observed, \u201cExamples of recent conduct showing sexual dangerousness may often be lacking where the individual\u2019s dangerous disposition is of a sort that there will be no occasion for that disposition to manifest itself in a secure environment. . . . [I]t cannot be the case that an individual\u2019s refusal to submit to an examination or to participate in treatment, in which his current dispositions might manifest themselves, will more or less automatically guarantee himself a favorable determination [in the sexually dangerous person hearings].\u201d The court noted, \u201cThat the subject refused to cooperate, however, does not lighten the Commonwealth\u2019s burden\u201d; it was up to the trier of fact to weigh such evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The motion judge and the defendant both relied upon the so-called \u201crule of lenity\u201d to support their position that the Commonwealth should have filed its notice and petition for civil commitment prior to the end of the rape sentence, when the defendant was supposedly \u201creleased\u201d from his sex offense sentence, and has lost its power to do so by waiting to file until the defendant completed serving the remainder of his sentence for a nonsexual offense. Their reliance is unfounded in this case. That rule applies to criminal statutes defining criminal conduct. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George, </em>430 Mass. 270, 278-279 (1999). General Laws c. 123A is a civil, not a criminal statute (except with respect to the \u201csufficient showing\u201d standard of proof required to justify the deprivation of liberty resulting from temporary commitment, which, undefined in the statute, has been authoritatively construed in accordance with due process requirements). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass, at 500, 507-510. Even were G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, deemed criminal (including the word \u201crelease\u201d), it is appropriately read and applied in accordance with its plain meaning and the explicit statement of statutory purpose. \u201cWhere the legislative purpose is expressed in clear statutory language, we must construe the statute in accordance with its terms and need not apply the rule of lenity on which the defendant relies.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 708 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>(1993). Moreover, the rule is only \u201ca guide for resolving ambiguity [in the defendant\u2019s favor and against the Commonwealth], rather than a rigid requirement that we interpret each [criminal] statute in the manner most favorable to defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707-708. It applies only to the substantive conduct covered by criminal statutes, to the end that \u201ca penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George, </em>430 Mass, at 278, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twitchell, </em>416 Mass. 114, 123 (1993). The rule is not applicable to the circumstances here presented, because any ambiguity in the meaning of the word \u201crelease\u201d in \u00a7 12(a) is unrelated to the definition of any criminal conduct and \u201conly concerns matters of procedure which do not involve . . . substantive or fundamental rights.\u201d <em>Charles C. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 58, 70 (1993). Statutes, such as G. L. c. 123A, that are procedural \u201cdo not define criminal conduct, are not penal statutes, and may not be subject to such strict construction against the Commonwealth,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George, </em>430 Mass, at 278-279; and even under the strict construction rule we do not reject \u201can available and sensible interpretation ... in favor of a fanciful or perverse one.\" <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotan, </em>422 Mass. 740, 743 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
