PPA sued FUMIC, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Wilhelm, and Montana Farmers Union Insurance Agency (MFU) when FUMIC denied coverage on a claim made by PPA. This case was consolidated with a third-party claim by Wilhelm against Whitefish Insurance Agency, Inc., but that claim is not a subject of this appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of FUMIC and Wilhelm, and in denying PPA\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b64 In 2001, PPA, through its sole owner, Whitefish attorney William Hileman, began investigating the purchase of a 24-unit apartment complex at 601 Park Avenue in Whitefish. Hileman had the property appraised, and the market value of the complex was estimated to be $750,000. The complex consists of a long, rectangular apartment building, a carport running along the length of the building, and a small laundry and storage building on the opposite side of the carport. The $750,000 estimate included a value of $46,200 for the carport. In connection with the purchase, Hileman contacted Wilhelm, whom he had known for a decade and from whom he had previously purchased insurance. Hileman requested full casualty and liability coverage for the property, which he described as FUMIC\u2019s standard \u2018business pack\u201d of insurance products for commercial property owners. The policy limit was set at the appraised value of $750,000. Wilhelm filled out the application for insurance form on Hileman\u2019s behalf, and listed the twe buildings (the 24-unit apartment building, and the laundry building^ on the \u2018Declarations\u201d page. When shown the completed application, Hileman asked Wilhelm what the \u201csecond\u201d building (meaning the laundry building) was. Wilhelm informed Hileman that listing the laundry building was not a <em>necessary </em>step, as \u201call buildings and structures on the property were covered,\u2019\u2019but that FUMIC \u2018liked to see those buildings to which people were coming and going specifically identified.\u201d With Hileman\u2019s approval, Wilhelm submitted the application, both men believing that coverage had been obtained foi the entire property. Hileman signed the application on PPA\u2019s behalf oi May 1, 2001, the closing date for the purchase of the complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">\u00b65 The policy was renewable annually, and PPA renewed its policy each year without any further inquiry as to the amount or scope o coverage. In 2005, Wilhelm retired, and his practice was assumed by Monte Sparby. PPA continued to renew through Sparby. Also in 2005 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>a reference to \u2018BOP-54\u201d was inserted into the policy. BOP-54, an \u201camendatory endorsement,\u201d was included in a long list of other such endorsements on the renewal declaration. BOP-54 stated that the policy, as modified by the endorsement, covered only those buildings and structures separately listed on the Declarations page for which a limit of coverage was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">\u00b66 On February 10, 2008, heavy snow fell throughout the Whitefish area. But while the conditions were wonderful for the ski hill, they dealt a fatal blow to PPA\u2019s carport, which collapsed under a massive accumulation of snow and ice, burying numerous vehicles. Hileman submitted a claim under PPA\u2019s policy for the damages, and FUMIC claims adjuster Rial Gunlikson responded that the loss was covered. Shortly thereafter, however, Gunlikson contacted Hileman to inform him that the carport was in fact <em>not </em>covered by the policy. Gunlikson stated that the change in policy due to the adoption of BOP-54 had excluded the carport as of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b67 On April 4, 2008, after speaking with Gunlikson, Hileman wrote to FUMIC and demanded payment on the claim or a written explanation of why coverage was being denied. Four days later, Hileman received a letter in response from Thomas E. Barker, Assistant Vice President of FUMIC\u2019s claims department. Barker reiterated Gunlikson\u2019s assertions, explaining that the carport was not listed separately on the Declarations page, and due to BOP-54\u2019s exclusion of \u2018buildings for which no limit of insurance is shown in the Declarations,\u201d the carport had not been covered since 2005. Having never heard of the endorsement, Hileman contacted Sparby and met with him at Sparby\u2019s office, where the file for PPA was kept. BOP-54 was not in the file dedicated to PPA, nor was any notice that the coverage for PPA was being reduced to exclude the carport. The parties dispute whether notice of BOP-54 was ever provided to Hileman or Sparby besides its incorporation by reference on the declaration renewal. Sparby and Wilhelm attest that it was their practice to keep copies of any official communication between FUMIC and insureds, which would have included changes to the policies, and FUMIC employees testify that it was their practice to send out copies of any new endorsements to the insured parties. No parties have specific records or memories of correspondence concerning BOP-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b68 On November 13,2008, PPA filed suit in Cascade County, naming FUMIC and Wilhelm as defendants. FUMIC moved to change venue to Flathead County based on the convenience of witnesses, notably Wilhelm, who was suffering from various health problems. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Cascade County District Court granted FUMIC\u2019s motion on February 26,2009, over PPA\u2019s objection, and the Flathead County District Court assumed jurisdiction. After several months of pre-trial activity, FUMIC moved for summary judgment. It argued that the policy listed only the apartment building and laundry building on the Declarations page as insured premises and that the carport was therefore never covered. Wilhelm also moved for summary judgment, arguing that he was no longer working at the agency at the time the current policy was renewed and was thus not a proper party to the suit, and that PPA\u2019s request for full coverage was not sufficiently specific to give rise to a duty on his part to insure the carport.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b69 PPA filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. In its brief opposing FUMIC\u2019s motion and in support of its own, PPA argued that the plain language of the policy covered all buildings and structures at the address listed on the Declarations page. At best, PPA maintained, the policy contained contradictory definitions of the \u201cinsured premises,\u201d creating an ambiguity which must be construed in favor of coverage. PPA also sought summary judgment against Wilhelm, contending that if the carport was <em>not </em>covered, then Wilhelm\u2019s negligent failure to procure coverage subjected him and FUMIC to liability. After the briefing of these motions, PPA amended its complaint to add MFU as a party, alleging that MFU was vicariously liable for Wilhelm\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b610 Argument was heard on all of the above motions on December 10, 2009. Several months later, the District Court entered an order granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and dismissing all of PPA\u2019s claims. The District Court held that the \u2018language of the policy was clear and unambiguous and provided for coverage of the property described in the Declarations,\u201d and because the carport was not listed, it was not covered. The District Court also held that Wilhelm had no duty to provide coverage for the carport absent a specific request that the carport be insured, and that PPA\u2019s request for full coverage was \u2018hot sufficiently specific to give rise to a duty.\u201d The District Court did not reach the issue of the amendatory endorsement, as it concluded that no coverage had ever existed on the carport. The District Court also did not reach the issue of whether FUMIC or MFU was liable for Wilhelm\u2019s negligence as it did not find Wilhelm negligent. PPA timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>summary judgment de novo. <em>State v. Butte-Silver Bow County, </em>2009 MT 414, \u00b6 17, 353 Mont. 497, 220 P.3d 1115. Applying the criteria contained in M. R. Civ. P. 56, we determine whether the moving party has established both the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Goettel v. Estate of Ballard, </em>2010 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 356 Mont. 527, 234 P.3d 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">\u00b612 The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. <em>Cusenbary v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>2001 MT 261, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 238, 37 P.3d 67 (citing <em>Babcock v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2000 MT 114, \u00b6 5, 299 Mont. 407, 999 P.2d 347). When a court reviews an insurance policy, it is bound to interpret its terms according to their usual, common sense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of insurance products. <em>Counterpoint, Inc. v. Essex Ins. Co., </em>1998 MT 251, \u00b6 13, 291 Mont. 189, 967 P.2d 393. Exclusions from coverage are to be narrowly and strictly construed because they are contrary to the fundamental protective purpose of an insurance policy. <em>Swank Enters., Inc. v. All Purpose Servs., Ltd., </em>2007 MT 57, \u00b6 27, 336 Mont. 197, 154 P.3d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b613  When an insurance policy is ambiguous, it is to be interpreted most strongly in favor of the insured and any doubts as to coverage are to be resolved in favor of extending coverage for the insured. <em>Mitchell v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 102, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 281, 68 P.3d 703. An ambiguity exists where the insurance contract, taken as a whole, is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b614 The parties agree on the material facts, and thus the instant case presents only questions of law. At issue is whether PPA\u2019s insurance policy included coverage for the carport, and if not, whether Wilhelm was negligent in not procuring such coverage. If the policy did include coverage for the carport, of course, we will not reach the issue of Wilhelm\u2019s negligence. Thus, we must determine whether the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the insurance contract was correct. We first note that because FUMIC contends that the coverage was not affected by the amendatory endorsement (BOP-54), we will consider the language of the contract as unmodified by the endorsement, and will not inquire into whether the carport would have been covered but for modifications to coverage made by the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b615 FUMIC\u2019s fundamental argument is that only buildings and structures listed on the Declarations page are covered by the policy, and because the carport is not listed, it is not covered. FUMIC points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>to language in the Businessowner\u2019s Coverage Form, the operative policy document, in support of this contention. The Form provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akd\">Covered Property. Covered property includes Buildings as described under Paragraph a. below ... a. <em>Buildings, meaning the buildings and structures at the premises described in the Declarations, </em>including: (1) Completed additions; (2) Fixtures, including outdoor fixtures; (3) Permanently installed: (a) Machinery; and (b) Equipment; (4) Your personal property in apartments, rooms or common areas furnished by you as landlord; ....\u2019\u2019[Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">FUMIC ties this definition to the Declarations page, which contains the following section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">INSURED PREMISES:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">LOG # BLDG # ADDRESS IF DIFFERENT FROM ABOVE BUSINESS DESCRIPTION: APARTMENT - 24 UNITS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASa\">1 1 601 PARK AVENUE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">WHITEFISH MT 59937</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">BUSINESS DESCRIPTION: LAUNDRY ROOM &amp; STORAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI-\">1 2 601 PARK AVENUE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">WHITEFISH MT 59937</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">\u00b616 As the carport is not listed under the \u2018insured premises\u201d section in the Declarations, FUMIC maintains, it is not covered by the policy, which is limited to \u201cthe buildings and structures at the premises described in the Declarations.\u201d The District Court concurred with this argument. In its opinion accompanying the grant of FUMIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the lower court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">The language of the insurance contract at issue here is clear and unambiguous. The Business Owner\u2019s Coverage Form, which is the basic policy form, provides that property, whether it is personal property or a building, is covered if it is at the premises described in the Declarations. The Declarations page describes the property insured as two buildings, the 24 unit apartment building and a building containing laundry facilities and storage space. There is no mention of the carport....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">\u00b617 The lack of coverage, argues FUMIC, is confirmed by the fact that no limit of insurance is listed for the carport. FUMIC observes that the Businessowner\u2019s Coverage Form provides that covered property only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>includes property \u201cfor which a Limit of Insurance is shown in the Declarations ....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As no limit of insurance is separately listed for the carport, FUMIC asserts, the carport is not included in the policy. The District Court also found this argument convincing. It held, \u201c[additionally, the policy provides for limits of coverage for the apartment building and the laundry building, but not the carport. If the carport was covered because it is a part of the premises at 601 Park Avenue, then there would be a limitation of coverage for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\">\u00b618 PPA refutes both of these arguments. It contends that the insured premises are defined as the property address, and that in any case, the limit of insurance for the apartment building included the carport. At best, PPA contends the policy is ambiguous, and it is entitled to judgment because ambiguities must be resolved in favor of greater coverage, not lesser coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b619  We agree with PPA that whether the carport is covered by the policy is at best ambiguous, and that this ambiguity entitles PPA to an entry of judgment in its favor. Based on the reasoning set out below, we conclude that the carport was covered by the policy, as of the date of the purchase of the policy, as a matter of law. We will thus not reach the issue of Wilhelm\u2019s negligence or of FUMIC or MFU\u2019s responsibility for Wilhelm\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b620 Our initial inquiry concerns whether the carport is logically included in the definition of the insured premises. The definition of \u201ccovered property\u201d in the Businessowners\u2019 Coverage Form includes \u2018buildings, meaning the buildings and structures at the premises described in the Declarations ....\u201d The logic behind FUMIC\u2019s interpretation of this phrase does not stand up to scrutiny. FUMIC contends, in essence, that the phrase means that coverage is limited to the <em>buildings and structures described in the Declarations, </em>as opposed to buildings and structures <em>at the premises described in the Declarations. </em>FUMIC\u2019s interpretation skips over the words \u201cat the premises\u201din the definition of covered property, and would render them meaningless. It is a basic rule of construction that we must, if at all possible, interpret a contract so as to give effect to every part of the contract. <em>Milltown Addition Homeowner\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Geery, </em>2000 MT 341, \u00b6 11, 303 Mont. 195, 15 P.3d 458 (citing \u00a7 1-4-101, MCA). FUMIC\u2019s interpretation requires that the words \u201cdescribed in the Declarations\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>refer only to the \u201cbuildings and structures,\u201d and not \u201cthe premises.\u201d PPA\u2019s interpretation of the phrase4hat coverage extends to all buildings and structures which are at the premises described in the Declarations-strikes us as the more reasonable interpretation. If FUMIC\u2019s interpretation is correct, it is certainly not unambiguously so. \u00b621 The Declarations provide no clarity on the matter. On the first page, the subsection entitled \u2018insured premises\u201d contains data fields for \u201cLOC #\u201d (location number) and \u2018BLDG #\u201d (building number), and lists two buildings: (1) the apartment building at 601 Park Avenue and (2) the laundry/storage building at 601 Park Avenue. The section titled \u2018insured premises\u201d does not list a street address as \u201cthe premises,\u201d instead only listing the two buildings, each with separately stated (although identical) addresses. This seems to lend credence to FUMIC\u2019s interpretation. On page three of the same document, however, the following language appears: \u201cPREMISES: AS PER LOCATION ADDRESS(S) SHOWN ONTHE DECLARATION.\u2019TPA advances this definition of the premises as the operative one. Yet it is located at the end of the \u2018forms/endorsements applicable\u201d section, and it is unclear why insured premises would be defined anywhere besides the \u2018insured premises\u201d section. Moreover, it is unclear whether the definition is meant to apply to the entire policy, or only to endorsement \u201cB0211-Limit. Cov. to Desg. Prem.\u201d listed immediately above it. In sum, it is unclear what exactly the \u201cpremises: as per location address\u201d is meant to signify, especially as it is common practice to define the scope of coverage simply by stating the address of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b622  It <em>is </em>clear, however, that the \u2018Insured premises\u201d cannot be limited <em>only </em>to the buildings listed in the \u2018insured premises\u201d section, as coverage very clearly extends beyond the buildings specifically listed in this section-for example, the policy covers machinery, equipment, and outdoor fixtures on the property, despite the fact thai those items are not listed on the Declarations page and do not have <em>z </em>separate limit of insurance listed. This is underscored by the fact thai only buildings would be specifically listed in the Declaration\u2019s \u201cinsurec premises\u201d section, as the section asks for \u2018BLDG #\u201d. As FUMIC\u2019s policies are obviously not necessarily limited to buildings alone, the \u201cinsured premises\u201d section cannot be interpreted to set out the full scope of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b623 If the \u201cpremises\u201d are rightly considered to be \u201cas per location address,\u201d as PPA asserts, then the carport would be covered because the Businessowner\u2019s Policy states that coverage includes \u201cbuilding! and structures at the premises.\u201d But the location of this definition- <em>no </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>in the Insured premises\u201d section, and arguably only intended to describe a specific endorsement-severely weakens this interpretation. \u00b624 While we need only conclude that the policy is ambiguous to decide the resolution of the present case, we note that the most reasonable interpretation, in our view, is that the portion of the policy attributable to the apartment building is meant to include the carport. Thus, the carport is \u2018listed\u201d on the Declarations page by virtue of the listing of the apartment building. As an initial matter, it is doubtful that a carport is considered a \u2018building\u201d at all. The Businessowners\u2019 coverage form states that \u201calthough the words \u2018building\u2019 and \u2018 structure\u2019 are not defined in the coverage form, a structure may be thought of as property erected on and attached to land that is not walled and roofed and a building is generally thought of as a walled, roofed structure.\u201d The \u2018insured premises\u201d section of the Declarations page on which FUMIC places so much weight asks only for buildings, not structures, and thus the carport\u2019s omission from the section is not as important as it is in FUMIC\u2019s analysis. Furthermore, Wilhelm testified that attached structures such as the carport are often accounted for by simply stating the buildings to which they are attached on the Declarations page. While the carport here was not physically attached, it was located very close to the building and it seems logical that it was considered an add-on to the apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b625 This conclusion finds support in the appraisal which accompanied the initial purchase of the complex, which included a specific amount for the carport. The carport\u2019s value was estimated at $46,200, which was then accounted for in the total value of the apartment building, estimated at $750,000. FUMIC asserts that no coverage existed because a limit of insurance for the carport was not separately stated on the Declarations page. But as the apartment building was insured for $750,000, an amount which included the full value of the carport, it stands to reason that the carport was covered in the $750,000 policy purchased by PPA. The carport would not be separately listed on the Declarations page if the apartment building was already insured for an amount which included the value of the carport, as this would lead to an illogical \u201cdoubling-up\u201d of coverage. FUMIC\u2019s contention that PPA would have had to pay an additional premium were it to have insured the carport is similarly unpersuasive. As detailed above, the apartment building was insured for a dollar amount which included the value of the carport, and premiums are calculated based on the total amount insured, not the number of buildings insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b626 We are also convinced that the policy is at best ambiguous because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>all external evidence supports PPA\u2019s position rather than FUMIC\u2019s. We note three such pieces of evidence here. First, FUMIC\u2019s interpretation of the policy would lead to the unsupportable conclusion that the adoption of BOP-54 had no effect whatsoever on the very aspects of the policy which it was intended to modify. Second, the understanding, intent, and actions of the parties involved simply do not support FUMIC\u2019s version of events. Third, and perhaps most convincingly, FUMIC\u2019s own internal guidelines would not even permit the sale of the policy which FUMIC claims was issued here.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b627 First, FUMIC\u2019s contention that the carport was <em>never </em>covered and that BOP-54 therefore did not reduce coverage does not withstand logical scrutiny. There would have been no reason for BOP-54 to be created and added to the policy if its principal goal was not accomplished-feo add, under \u2018Property Not Covered\u201d in the Businessowners Coverage Form, \u2018Buildings for which no limit of insurance is shown in the Declarations.\u201d If there were any doubt that this changed the policy, the language in BOP-54 clears up any such doubts, stating that \u201cTHIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his endorsement modifies insurance provided under the ... Businessowners Coverage Form.\u201d Given that BOP-54 modified the policy to provide that only \u201cbuildings for which a limit of insurance is shown in the Declarations\u201d are covered, it follows that prior to BOP-54\u2019s adoption, at least some buildings for which <em>no </em>limit of insurance was shown in the Declarations <em>were </em>covered by the policy. This inference sweeps the legs out from underneath FUMIC\u2019s argument that the policy <em>always </em>limited coverage to buildings for which a limit of insurance was separately stated in the Declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b628 Second, the actions of FUMIC\u2019s own employees illustrate how disingenuous it is for FUMIC to now claim that coverage for the carport never existed. Rial Gunlikson, FUMIC\u2019s claims adjuster on this case, initially informed Hileman that the carport was covered, but then stated that the carport was in fact <em>not </em>covered, <em>due to a change in the policy. </em>When Mr. Hileman demanded that FUMIC identify why, exactly, the carport was not covered by the policy, FUMIC\u2019s Vice President Thomas Barker explained that BOP-54 had modified the policy to exclude buildings for which no limit of insurance was shown. Not until much later, presumably when legal problems surrounding the requirement to provide notice of any reduction in coverage were discovered, did FUMIC ever contend that the original policy did not include coverage for the carport.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b629 Furthermore, the intent of Hileman and Wilhelm was clearly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>include the entire property in the policy, and the understanding of both Hileman and Wilhelm was that coverage had been secured for the entire property. As Wilhelm agreed, it would have been illogical and without precedent to insure both of the other buildings on the property but not the carport. According to Hileman, when he inquired as to why the laundry building was separately stated on the original application, Wilhelm responded that all buildings and other structures on the property were covered and that it would not be necessary to separately list the buildings, but that FUMIC \u2018liked to see those buildings to which people were coming and going specifically identified.\u201d Wilhelm testified that he never would have intentionally insured a property without insuring the entire property, never would have excluded a building without specifically mentioning it to the insured, and that he assumed the carport was covered. Hileman obviously intended to procure coverage for the entire property, and both he and his insurance agent believed he had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">\u00b630 No common sense interpretation of the request made of Wilhelm to procure coverage for Hileman\u2019s property would possibly exclude the carport in the scope of coverage requested. A \u201creasonable consumer of insurance products,\u201d from whose perspective we must analyze the terms of the policy, could not possibly conceive that the carport would be excluded after requesting normal, standard businessowners\u2019 coverage for the property. The authorities relied on by FUMIC and the District Court suggesting that Hileman needed to <em>specifically </em>request insurance for the carport are simply inapposite to scenarios such as the instant case, where <em>all </em>standard commercial property insurance products would include the carport in coverage of the complex. It quite literally went without saying that the parties intended the carport to be included in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b631 Lastly, FUMIC\u2019s own internal guidelines for commercial policies <em>would not even permit </em>the issuance of the policy which was allegedly sold to Hileman. FUMIC\u2019s Businessowners Policy Manual states that coverage must be included for all buildings on the property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">1. MANDATORY COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">A. The Businessowners Policy must be written to provide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">(1) Coverage on All business building and personal property, except property that may not be eligible which is located at the same premises or premises elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The hyper-legalistic view espoused by the District Court that specifically listing two of the three \u2018buildings\u201d on the property omitted the third by inference cannot withstand scrutiny in light of this simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>fact. FUMIC does not offer policies which do not do insure all buildings on a commercial property, and being a longtime FUMIC commercial insurance customer, Hileman cannot be faulted for interpreting the terms of the insurance policy as conforming to the guidelines of all other FUMIC policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b632  The insurance policy is much more reasonably interpreted to include coverage for the carport. But we need not go this far-we need only conclude that the contract was ambiguous in the eyes of a reasonable consumer of insurance products. It is a sisyphean task even for a trained professional to determine the precise scope of coverage from the policy\u2019s confusing and contradictory provisions. As any ambiguity in an insurance policy must be construed in favor of extending coverage, and as an ambiguity exists \u201cwhere the contract... is reasonably subject to two different interpretations,\u201d we conclude that PPA\u2019s policy must be interpreted to include coverage for the carport as a matter of law. <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b633 We reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to FUMIC.
