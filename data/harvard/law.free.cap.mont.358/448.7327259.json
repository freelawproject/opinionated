Keller contends that the settlements were premised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>on a mutual mistake of fact. The WC Court denied Keller\u2019s request to reopen her settlement agreements on the basis that Keller failed to prove that Liberty Northwest (Liberty), her insurer, had no knowledge of the correct diagnosis of her injury at the time the parties entered into the agreements. Keller timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b62 Keller raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b63 <em>1. Whether the WC Court erred in requiring Keller to prove that Liberty had no knowledge that Keller\u2019s medical condition included either scapular winging or long thoracic nerve injury at the time the parties entered into settlement agreements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b64 2. <em>Whether the WC Court properly rejected Keller\u2019s request for rescission of her two workers\u2019 compensation settlements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b65 Kimberly Keller began working at A Full Life Agency in 2003. She served as the county coordinator for A Full Life\u2019s in-home care services in Superior, Montana. On January 3,2005, a coworker called in sick, and Keller filled in as an in-home care provider. The client was a large, partially paralyzed woman, and Keller\u2019s back was injured when she attempted to break the client\u2019s fall. Keller felt a \u201csearing pain\u201d in her neck and back at the time. When the pain failed to abate, Keller saw Jennifer Strine, a physician\u2019s assistant in Thompson Falls, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">\u00b66 Strine examined Keller on February 8, and found that Keller had a \u2018thoracic strain and right scapular dysfunction secondary to \u00a1muscular weakness.\u201d Strine informed Keller that she should no longer \u00a1work due to her injury. Keller saw physical therapist Honani JPolequaptewa soon afterwards, who found \u201cacute low back pain\u201d and Itight scapular winging.\u201d Keller continued to suffer from severe lower foack pain, headaches, and tenderness in her upper spine. Strine was called in to Keller\u2019s physical therapy appointment on March 4 when Keller experienced muscle spasms and pain in her lower back and Buttocks. Strine noted that Keller\u2019s scapula had continued to \u201cwing\u201d ji.e., stick out), and diagnosed her with lumbrosacral and gluteal Ipasm secondary to physical therapy, and scapular winging \u201cmost likely due to a long thoracic nerve inflammation or damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AaU\">i[7 Strine referred Keller to Dr. Maurice Brown of Mission Valley fcrthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine on March 10, 2005. Strine provided her notes to Dr. Brown, including her observance of Keller\u2019s Bight scapular winging. Keller went to Dr. Brown\u2019s office on April 6, H005. At this appointment, Keller was initially examined by Cody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Brown (Cody), a physician\u2019s assistant working under Dr. Brown. Cody\u2019s report listed a number of issues, including chronic headaches, mid and lower back pain, sciatica, right lower extremity paresthesias, and right scapular winging. Cody noted that \u201cexcessive winging of the scapula\u201d was present when Keller was asked to lean forward with outstretched arms. Cody reported that his findings were \u201cconsistent with nerve entrapment of the cervical spine/thoracic spine, resulting in scapular winging.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b68 Dr. Brown saw Keller on April 27, 2005, after reviewing the results of an MRI he had ordered several days prior. The MRI revealed four distinct \u2018^paracentral disk protrusions\u201din Keller\u2019s spine. Dr. Brown also noted Keller\u2019s raised scapula, observing that \u201cthe right scapula and shoulder are intermittently raised in a protective position causing the appearance of scapular winging; however, this was noted to be absent several times during today\u2019s evaluation.\u201d In late May, Dr. John Hatheway also saw Keller. After a physical examination, and review of Keller\u2019s MRI results, Hatheway concluded that Keller\u2019s back pain was related to one of the disk protrusions detected by the MRI and Dr. Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b69 Keller saw Dr. Carter Beck in September. Dr. Beck evaluated Keller and found that she suffered from a \u201ccomplex pain syndrome,\u201d focused in her mid-spinal region. Dr. Beck attributed the pain to problems with Keller\u2019s disk protrusions, identifying a specifi protrusion as the likely cause of many of Keller\u2019s problems. Dr. Bee recommended that Keller seek out a \u201ccomprehensive multidisciplina: pain clinic.\u201d He also stated that Keller was not a candidate for surger to relieve her symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b610 Keller continued to experience severe pain and continued seekini medical attention. In November 2005, she was evaluated by Drl Randale Sechrest. Dr. Sechrest noted that Keller had seen severa physicians, including Drs. Brown, Hatheway, and Beck. Dr. Sechres reviewed Keller\u2019s prior records and exam results, and performed hi own physical exam. He concluded that Keller had a combination o| \u201cchronic pain and possible disk pathology\u201d in her thoracic spine. I: June of 2006, Keller again saw Dr. Sechrest, who opined that she ha&gt; reached maximum medical improvement. Keller also saw Dr. Patrie Johnson in late 2005, who attributed Keller\u2019s pain to botl \u201cpsychological factors and a medical condition including chronic mid] back pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b611 In August 2006, Keller was evaluated by Dr. John Schumper] Dr. Schumpert performed an independent medical evaluation (IM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>of Keller, and noted that physician\u2019s assistant Strine had found right scapular winging, right thoracic strain, and right scapular dysfunction. Dr. Schumpert also noted that Cody Brown had observed right scapular winging in his examination in April 2005, but that no physicians had made the diagnosis. After his own physical evaluation, Dr. Schumpert concluded that although Keller\u2019s right scapula was \u201cprominent,\u201d he did not observe scapular winging. Instead, Dr. Schumpert diagnosed Keller\u2019s raised scapula as a symptom of dextroscoliosis. He noted that Keller had \u201cchronic thoracic region myofascial pain, and chronic right thoracic nonverifiable radicular complaints.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b612 Keller returned to physician\u2019s assistant Strine in September 2006. Strine again found scapular winging, and informed Keller of her findings. Strine noted forward curvature and retraction of Keller\u2019s scapula, revealing \u201csignificant right scapular winging.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b613 Keller\u2019s pain continued unabated. In late 2006, she retained attorney David Sandler for settlement negotiations. On January 12, 2007, Keller settled her indemnity benefits in the amount of $27,582.64, reserving settlement of medical benefits. She saw Dr. Ray Nelson in March of 2007, who noted Keller\u2019s extensive injury history and failure to control her pain despite several cortisone injections in the areas of disk protrusion. Dr. Nelson also noted that several of the medical personnel who had evaluated Keller recommended breast reduction surgery as a possible source of pain relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b614 In August 2007, no longer represented by Sandler, Keller settled her medical benefits for $7,500.00. The settlement reflected the parties\u2019 dispute over whether Keller\u2019s proposed breast reduction surgery was a medical necessity. It was approved in early September by the Department of Labor and Industry. Keller\u2019s pain had still failed to lessen as of the date of this settlement, and she testified that she was still experiencing the same pain symptoms at the time of | settlement as she was experiencing at the time of her injury. Keller [underwent breast reduction surgery, but the surgery provided her with Ino relief of her pain symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">|\u00b615 In August 2008, Keller was referred to Dr. Dean Ross. Dr. Ross Iperformed an electrodiagnostic test to investigate the cause of Keller\u2019s Iraised scapula, which he described as \u201cstriking cosmetically.\u201d The Itesting produced evidence of a \u201cchronic right long thoracic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>neuropathy,\u201d which caused \u201cprofound serratus anterior weakness and scapular winging.\u201d Dr. Ross found \u2018Very prominent winging of the right scapula seen at rest and certainly provoked most completely with shoulder abduction and protraction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b616 Dr. Ross reviewed physician\u2019s assistant Strine\u2019s initial treatment notes from 2005, and testified that the scapular winging noted by Strine was 'inore probably than not\u201d caused by a \u2018long thoracic nerve injury.\u201d He concluded that the symptoms noted in Keller\u2019s medical records indicated that Keller\u2019s long thoracic nerve injury was present from the date of the initial injury, and had simply been ignored or missed by other treating physicians. Keller returned to Dr. Beck for another evaluation in October 2008. Dr. Beck studied the results of Dr. Ross\u2019s nerve conduction study, and noted that the study verified the diagnosis of\u2018long thoracic nerve palsy.\u201d He concluded that Keller\u2019s continued pain in her neck and right shoulder was attributable to the nerve palsy, and remarked that he had never seen a patient exhibit such pronounced symptoms from this type of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b617 Dr. Beck testified that scapular winging is one sign of long thoracic nerve palsy, and that long thoracic nerve radiculopathy (a problem with the long thoracic nerve root) is essentially synonymous with scapular winging. Dr. Beck reconfirmed that he had not identified scapular winging in his initial examination of September 2005, but acknowledged that Dr. Brown\u2019s records had included a mention of a raised right scapula giving the appearance of winging, although Dr. Brown had concluded that the winging was not actually present. Dr. Beck opined that the raised scapula in Dr. Brown\u2019s 2005 diagnosis was more likely than not the result of Keller\u2019s long thoracic\u00a1 neuropathy, which remained undiagnosed until Dr. Ross\u2019s 2008 test.</p>\n<p id=\"AbX\">\u00b618 Keller petitioned the WC Court for reinstatement of her medical! benefits and rescission of the two settlement agreements (the indemnity benefits and the medical benefits). Trial was held in| October 2009 before the Hon. James J. Shea in Missoula. Kelle: testified that she was unaware that her condition included righ scapular winging or long thoracic nerve injury at the time o: settlement. Because the settlement negotiations were premised o: mistaken diagnoses, she argued, the settlements were entered into o: the basis of a mutual mistake of fact. Given this mutual mistakei Keller contended, the settlements were neither valid nor enforceable and should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b619 The WC Court denied Keller\u2019s request for rescission. It conclude^ that to demonstrate a mutual mistake of fact, Keller had to show tha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Liberty had no knowledge of Keller\u2019s actual injuries (scapular winging and long thoracic neuropathy) at the time of settlement. Although the court found Keller\u2019s testimony credible, it ruled that Keller\u2019s testimony that she was under a mistaken impression as to the true cause of her injury only showed a <em>unilateral </em>mistake of fact, rather than a <em>mutual </em>mistake. Concluding that Keller had presented no evidence that Liberty was unaware of Keller\u2019s true injury, the court held that she had failed to carry her burden of proof. Having determined that the settlement agreements should not be set aside, the court did not reach the issue of whether Keller\u2019s request for rescission was time-barred by the statute of limitations in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, as was argued by Liberty. Keller timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b620 We review the WC Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Schmill v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2009 MT 430, \u00b6 8, 354 Mont. 88, 223 P.3d 842; <em>Lanes v. Mont. St. Fund, </em>2008 MT 306, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 10, 192 P.3d 1145. We review the WC Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Schmill, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>Lanes, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Van Vleet v. Montana Ass\u2019n of Counties Workers\u2019 Comp. Trust, </em>2004 MT 367, \u00b6 9, 324 Mont. 517, 103 P.3d 544. Substantial credible evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Lanes, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>S.L.H. v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2002 MT 362, \u00b6 42, 303 Mont. 364, 15 P.3d 948).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b621 If there is conflicting evidence, we consider whether \u201csubstantial evidence supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, not whether the evidence might support contrary findings.\u201d <em>Schmill, </em>\u00b6 8 (quoting <em>Caekaert v. State Compen. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>268 Mont. 105, 110, 885 P.2d 495, 498 (1994)). In conducting our review, we do not resolve evidentiary conflicts or consider whether evidence supports factual findings that the WC Court did not make; rather, our inquiry is [restricted to \u201cdetermining whether substantial credible evidence supports the findings <em>actually made </em>by the [WC Court].\u201d <em>Gamble v. </em>Sears, 2007 MT 131, \u00b6 20, 337 Mont. 354, 160 P.3d 537 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b622 Our review today requires us to examine two issues rooted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>contract law. We apply contract law to determine whether settlement agreements are valid and enforceable. <em>Kruzich v. Old Republic Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 205, \u00b6 24, 344 Mont. 126, 188 P.3d 983 (citing <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 24). While Keller seeks \u201crescission\u201d of her agreements, the doctrine of mutual mistake prevents effective formation of a contract, and so Keller\u2019s argument is actually that no contract ever existed. <em>Gamble, \u00b6 </em>26 n. 4, <em>Kruzich, </em>\u00b6 24. We have long used the term \u201crescind\u201d to describe the appropriate remedy in mutual mistake cases, however, and will do so here as well. Keller argues that no contract existed because the parties\u2019 consent to the agreement was not effective, as consent cannot be given effectively when based on a mistake. <em>Kruzich,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZ2\">\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b623 Mistakes may be either mistakes of law or mistakes of fact. <em>Id. </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"A55\">\u00b6 25. Keller contends that the parties entered into the settlement agreements under a mistake of fact, specifically, the nature and extent of her injury. Section 28-2-409, MCA, sets out the applicable definition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">28-2-409 What constitutes mistake of fact. Mistake of fact is a mistake not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake and consisting in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">(1) an unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact, past or present, material to the contract; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">(2) belief in the present existence of a thing material to the contract which does not exist or in the past existence of such a | thing which has not existed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Thus, parties to a contract can make a mutual mistake if they are j \u201cunconsciously ignorant\u201d or \u2018forgetful\u201d of a fact material to the contract. A fact is material when it is a \u201cvital fact upon which the , parties based their bargain.\u201d <em>South v. Transportation Ins. Co., </em>275 Mont. 397, 401, 913 P.2d 233, 235 (1996) (internal quotation marks! omitted). We have described a mutual mistake regarding a material j fact as \u201cso substantial and fundamental\u201d a mistake \u201cas to defeat the object of the parties in making the contract.\u201d <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 401, 913 P.2d at 235 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).| Unsurprisingly, contract law does not uphold agreements which defeat the object of the parties. Consent is not considered effective when the parties\u2019 agreement is premised on a mutual mistake, and thus thd settlement agreement maybe set aside. <em>Kienas v. Peterson, </em>191 Mont. 325, 328-30, 624 P.2d 1, 2-3 (1980); <em>Weldele v. Medley Dev., </em>227 Mont. 257, 260, 738 P.2d 1281, 1283 (1987); <em>Kimes v. Charlie\u2019s Family Dining &amp; Donut Shop, </em>233 Mont. 175, 177, 759 P.2d 986, 988 (1988); <em>Wolfe v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Webb, </em>251 Mont. 217, 223-28, 824 P.2d 240, 244-46 (1992); <em>South, </em>275 Mont. at 401, 913 P.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b624 Given the subject matter of workers\u2019 compensation settlement agreements, the most commonly alleged mutual mistakes predictably relate to mistaken beliefs as to the claimant\u2019s injuries. In several prior cases, we have determined that the nature and extent of a claimant\u2019s physical condition can constitute a fact that is material to an agreement settling an injury claim. <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont. at 330, 624 P.2d at 3; <em>Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 261, 738 P.2d at 1283; <em>Kimes, </em>233 Mont. at 178, 759 P.2d at 988; <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 231, 824 P.2d at 248; <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>Kruzich, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b625 In the seminal <em>Kienas </em>case, we rescinded a settlement agreement on the basis of mutual mistake as to the claimant\u2019s medical condition. The claimant, Kienas, injured his back in a workplace accident. Unbeknownst to the parties at the time, the incident severely aggravated Kienas\u2019 existing cerebral palsy (of which the parties were aware). Nine months after the injury, he settled with the State Fund. After settlement, however, Kienas sought to rescind the settlements on the basis of mutual mistake, arguing that the agreements had failed to take into account the aggravation of his cerebral palsy. The WC Court denied his petition, but we reversed on the basis of mutual mistake, concluding that \u201c[n]either party at the time of entering the full and final compromise settlement knew of the exact nature or extent of the injury suffered by claimant.\u201d <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont. at 329, 624 P.2d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b626 In <em>Weldele, </em>the claimant suffered from shoulder, wrist, and elbow Ipain. Treating physicians noted the possibility of thoracic outlet [syndrome, but ultimately dismissed it as a cause of the claimant\u2019s [injuries. The agreed-upon diagnosis was carpal tunnel syndrome and rotator cuff syndrome. The parties settled. After settlement, the claimant was, in fact, diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome resulting from his on-the-job injury. We upheld a finding of mutual Inistake, concluding that the parties \u201cwere mistaken\u201d as to the nature j)f the claimant\u2019s injury, which amounted to \u201can unconscious ignorance If a material fact on the part of both parties upon which the final lettlement was based.\u201d <em>Weldele, </em>227 Mont. at 261, 738 P.2d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"AFYW\">B27 We need not set out our entire catalogue of workers\u2019 compensation lases involving mutual mistake here, as we have recently had occasion lo do so. <em>See Kruzich, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-38 <em>(discussingKienas, </em>at \u00b6 32; <em>Weldele, </em>at \u25a0 33; <em>Kimes, </em>at \u00b6 34; <em>Wolfe, </em>at \u00b6 35-36; <em>South, </em>at \u00b6 37-38). The rule \u25a0istilled from these cases is that if parties to a workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>settlement agreement are mutually mistaken as to a material fact concerning the nature and extent of the claimant\u2019s injury-as in the case of a misdiagnosis-then the settlement agreement may be set aside. Of course, threshold requirements must still be met, and in <em>Kruzich, </em>we rejected a similar claim because the parties were not mistaken as to a fact that existed <em>at the time of settlement. Kruzich, </em>\u00b6 40 (concluding that no mutual mistake existed at the time of settlement because the claimant\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease was not present until ten years after the settlement). Liberty claims that our holding in <em>Kruzich </em>precludes Keller\u2019s claims. The opinions of Dr. Ross and Dr. Beck, however, make abundantly clear that Keller\u2019s scapular winging and long thoracic nerve injury were in existence at the time the parties entered into the settlement agreement, and were caused by Keller\u2019s workplace injury. Thus, <em>Kruzich </em>does not dispose of Keller\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AbW\">\u00b628 Liberty also claims that the standard of review set out in <em>Gamble </em>prohibits this Court from consideration of the merits of Keller\u2019s claims. <em>Gamble, </em>as quoted in the standard of review section above, reiterated that we do not disturb the factual findings made by the WC Court, and do not consider whether the evidence might support factual findings not actually made by the WC Court. <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 20. Liberty asserts that Keller\u2019s argument can be summarized as offering evidence in rebuttal of factual findings made by the WC Court. This argument is plainly inapposite. Keller disputes conclusions of law made by the WC Court, not findings of fact. The factual findings made by the WC Cou: concern Keller\u2019s injury and treatment history, and are not in dispute\u00a1 Keller argues that the WC Court erred in its legal conclusions, b; using an incorrect legal standard for mutual mistake, and i: determining that no mutual mistake existed on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b629  We agree with Keller that the WC Court erred in imposing a: incorrect burden of proof. The court opined, \u201c[i]n order to find that tin alleged material mistake was mutual to both Keller and Liberty, must find that Liberty had no knowledge that Keller\u2019s medicaj condition included either scapular winging or long thoracic nerv injury at the time the parties entered into the settlement agreements.| This is an incorrect statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b630 Both statutory and case law confirm that mutual mistake mal still exist when parties know about a theory of injury, if that theory i[ disregarded, forgotten, or not considered even though raised as possibility. In <em>Weldele, </em>for example, the thoracic outlet syndrome w. initially suspected, but was disregarded as a possibility by t consensus of treating physicians. The parties were certainly <em>aware </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the thoracic outlet syndrome, as it was mentioned repeatedly in the medical records. The parties\u2019 knowledge of the disregarded claim was clearly not a dispositive factor. The statutory definition of \u201cmutual mistake\u201d further reveals the inaccuracy of the WC Court\u2019s litmus test, as the statute contemplates that parties might be merely \u2018forgetful\u201d of a fact-which assumes, of course, that they <em>knew of the fact at one time. </em>Similarly, the statute contemplates that parties might be \u201cunconsciously ignorant,\u201d whereas the WC Court\u2019s test seems to require that the parties be <em>entirely </em>ignorant, not just unconsciously so. The test for mutual mistake is an inquiry into whether the parties considered or relied on a fact in making their bargain, not a mere chronological examination into whether parties knew of a fact prior to entering into the agreement. Put simply, the parties\u2019 reliance on a misdiagnosis can suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b631  Here, even if the parties were mutually aware of the contents of Keller\u2019s medical records, which contain references to scapular winging and at least some nerve-related complaints in the thoracic region, it is entirely possible that they entered into the settlement agreements under a mistaken impression as to the nature and extent of Keller\u2019s injuries. In <em>Kienas, </em>we examined the factual findings made by the WC Court and reversed the lower court, concluding that the findings conclusively demonstrated that a mutual mistake had occurred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, however, the WC Court halted its analysis before making the necessary findings to support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b632 Our standard of review does not permit us to engage in the necessary fact-finding on which to base a conclusion of mutual mistake. \u2018We do not resolve conflicts in the evidence, and we do not consider whether evidence supports findings that are different than those made by the WC Court; rather, we confine our review to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the [findings <em>actually made </em>by the WC Court.\u201d <em>Gamble, </em>\u00b6 20 (emphasis added). Although there was undoubtedly a misdiagnosis of some degree in Keller\u2019s case, this Court is not the proper forum to settle the factual inquiry as to what were the \u201cvital facts\u201d on which the parties based their settlement agreements. Thus, we must remand this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>back to the WC Court, so that court can make the necessary factual findings, and can apply the correct standard for mutual mistake to these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b633 The WC Court also did not reach the question of whether the alleged mutual mistake as to the nature and extent of Keller\u2019s injuries constituted a <em>material </em>fact. As we have observed above, the \u201cexact nature and extent of the injury suffered\u201d can certainly be a fact material to the contract. <em>Kienas, </em>191 Mont. at 329, 624 P.2d at 7. This is not <em>necessarily </em>the case, however, and we conclude that whether the mistake was material is a determination properly made by the trial court. It is difficult, from this Court\u2019s vantage point, to evaluate the dissimilarities, or lack thereof, between the different diagnoses of Keller\u2019s medical condition. It is conceivable that the fact that the parties relied on Keller\u2019s incorrectly diagnosed injuries rather than her correctly diagnosed injuries would not rise to the level of a material fact, were the treatment, prognosis, and symptoms of the injuries identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b634 In <em>Sollie v. Peavey Co., </em>212 Mont. 197, 686 P.2d 920 (1984), for example, the claimant (Sollie) injured his back while attempting to raise an overhead door at a grain elevator. He was diagnosed with a degenerative lumbar disc disease and a defect in his lowest lumbar vertebrae, and was assigned a permanent partial impairment rating of 20%. After settlement, Sollie sought rescission of the settlement agreements. Basing his argument on similarity to the facts in <em>Kienas, </em>he contended that the treating physicians had failed to take into account aggravation of his preexisting disc disease caused by the accident, just as the parties in <em>Kienas </em>had failed to take into account aggravation of the claimant\u2019s preexisting cerebral palsy. Becaus there was no substantial difference between Sollie\u2019s diagnosis treatment options, and impairment levels, however, no mutual| mistake of material fact was found, and the parties were held to havi effectively consented to the agreements. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 686 P.2d at 924. In the instant case, it is conceivable that the parties may not haw specifically considered long thoracic nerve injury or scapular wingin in entering into the settlement agreements, but nonetheless had sufficiently clear picture of the treatment, prognosis, and likelj| symptoms of Keller\u2019s injury. The misdiagnosis might thus be rendere immaterial. The WC Court must be afforded the opportunity t( consider these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b635 We need not consider any further arguments of the parties. W&lt; leave determination of any outstanding issues, such as Liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>statute of limitations argument, to the judgment of the WC Court. We conclude that the question of whether the statute of limitations bars Keller\u2019s claim is a triable issue and will allow the WC Court to evaluate this claim on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b636 We conclude that the WC Court erred by applying an incorrect burden of proof. Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> \u2018Radicular\u201d pain is pain which is \u201cradiated\u201d along the sensory distribution of a lerve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> Whether a mutual mistake exists seems to be at least partially a question of fact, properly resolved only by the trial court, unless the trial court\u2019s record contains all the lecessary factual findings to support a conclusion by an appellate court which does not mgage in fact-finding. In <em>Wolfe, </em>251 Mont. at 231, 824 P.2d at 248, for example, we \u2022eferred to the WC Court\u2019s \u2018finding\u201d as to mutual mistake, suggesting that we lonsidered the question of whether a mutual mistake existed to be a question of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
