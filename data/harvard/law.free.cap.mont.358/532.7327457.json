Keller (Keller), the Judicial Standards Commission (JSC) filed its recommendation with this Court. The JSC recommends that Not Afraid be sanctioned for violating the Montana Constitution and the Code of Judicial Conduct by a public reprimand and the imposition of proceeding costs. Not Afraid objects to the recommendation and requests dismissal of the complaint. Keller has responded to Not Afraid\u2019s objections. We conclude that the complaint must be dismissed. <em>We </em>state the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AHl\">p2 <em>Is the office of Crow Tribal Chairman an \u201celective public office\u201d for Purposes of Article VII, Section 10?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">I FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">\u25a0[3 Not Afraid was duly elected Justice of the Peace for Big Horn Bounty in November 2006, and he began his term of office on January ., 2007. Pursuant to Article III, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution ind \u00a73-10-202, MCA, he took the constitutional oath of office before ssuming his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">[4 Not Afraid is an enrolled member of the Crow Tribe of Indians. In larch 2009, Not Afraid filed as a candidate for the office of Crow 'ribal Chairman while maintaining his office as Justice of the Peace, \u2019he Crow Constitution and Law and Order Code define the Chairperson as an executive position. Crow Const, art. IV, \u00a71; Crow nw &amp; Order Code. tit. 21, art. Ill, \u00a7 1(1) (2005). The JSC sent two \u00a1tters to Not Afraid and his attorney, advising Not Afraid of the \u25a0revision of Article VII, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution ftquiring a holder of a judicial position to forfeit that position upon \u25a0ling for a non-judicial elective public office. Not Afraid did not forfeit Hs position and campaigned for the tribal office. Not Afraid advanced fcer the primary tribal election held on March 28, 2009, but he was B)t elected Tribal Chairman in the general tribal election held on April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>18, 2009. In December 2009, Keller filed a complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against Not Afraid alleging violations of Article VII, Section 10 as well as Rules 1.1, 1.2, and 3.1 of the 2008 Montana Code of Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AD9\">\u00b65 Not Afraid sought dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that the JSC lacked jurisdiction; violated his Crow constitutional rights federal supremacy, Montana law, Crow tribal sovereignty and triba law; and improperly interpreted \u201celective public office.\u201d Not Afraid argued that the alleged violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct were illusory because of the erroneous application of Article VII, Section 10</p>\n<p id=\"AI-o\">\u00b66 In March 2010, the JSC denied Not Afraid\u2019s motion to dismiss concluding that Article VII, Section 10 and the Code of Judicia Conduct applies to Not Afraid for his actions as Justice of the Peace and that the Crow Tribal Chairman position is included within th&lt; common definition of an \u201celective public office.\u201d The JSC furthei determined that the Code of Judicial Conduct would serve as ai independent basis for sanctions against Not Afraid which would not b mooted by the completion of the tribal election.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b67 Ahearing on the complaint was held on June 25,2010. Not Afraii testified about state offices he had resigned upon his election as Justic of the Peace, and about the counsel he had sought and receive* regarding the necessity of resigning his Crow legislative seat. H testified that, based upon this advice, it was his belief that he was n&lt; required to resign his Crow legislative seat, and that he was also fr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>to pursue election as Crow Chairman while maintaining his state judicial position. After hearing, the JSC concluded that Not Afraid violated Article VII, Section 10, as well as Rules 1.1,1.2, and 3.1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. The JSC viewed the advice against resignation which Not Afraid had received as a mitigating factor and recommended to this Court that Not Afraid be publicly reprimanded instead of forfeiting his office, and that he pay the costs of the proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The JSC indicated that a subsequent violation of this nature by Not Afraid would result in its pursuit of Not Afraid\u2019s immediate suspension from his judicial position. Not Afraid filed objections to the JSC\u2019s recommendations, renewing his argument that the JSC had no legal authority and had erred by denying his motion to dismiss. This Court requested and received a response from Keller to Not Afraid\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b68 We review the Judicial Standard Commission\u2019s proceedings <em>de novo.

The JSC\u2019s recommendations are not binding on this Court. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b69 As a preliminary matter, we address Not Afraid\u2019s broadly-stated arguments challenging jurisdiction. Not Afraid argues that the \u2018imposition of Article VII, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution upon [him] constituted a violation of and interference with the Crow Constitution[] and Crow sovereignty ....\u2019\u2019First, though not specifically raised by Not Afraid, it is clear that Not Afraid cannot raise the lefense of sovereign immunity. Indian tribes, and tribal officials acting n their official tribal capacity, have sovereign immunity from suit in state courts unless Congress authorized the suit or the tribe has mequivocally waived its immunity. <em>Thompson v. Crow Tribe of Indians, </em>1998 MT 161, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17, 23, 289 Mont. 358, 962 P.2d 577. lowever, individual tribal members can be sued for personally Hdolating state law, regardless of whether the tribe itself is determined Ho be immune from suit. <em>Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Dept. of Game of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>Wash., </em>433 U.S. 165, 171-72, 97 S. Ct. 2616, 2621 (1977). Not Afraid has been subjected to this proceeding for his individual acts, so he cannot personally raise the defense of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b610 Subject matter jurisdiction pertains to the fundamental power of a court to hear and decide a case. <em>Pinnow v. Mont. St. Fund, </em>2007 MT 332, \u00b6 16, 340 Mont. 217, 172 P.3d 1273. The issue of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time. <em>Wippert v. Blackfeet Tribe of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, </em>260 Mont. 93, 102, 859 P.2d 420, 425 (1993). While state and tribal jurisdiction is complex, certain principles have consistently been recognized. \u2018Essentially, absent governing Acts of Congress, the question has always been whether the state action: infringed on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\u201d <em>Williams v. Lee, </em>358 U.S. 217, 220, 79 S. Ct. 269, 271 (1959). Additionally, \u2018ttjhe cases in this Court have consistently guarded the authority of Indian governments over thei: reservations.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>358 U.S. at 223, 79 S. Ct. at 272. Tb jurisdictional tests employed by this Court have recognized thes foundational principles. See <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker. </em>448 U.S. 136, 142, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 2583 (1980) (quoting <em>Williams </em>fo: the second prong of its test); <em>First v. State Dept. of Soc. &amp; </em>Rehab. <em>Servs., </em>247 Mont. 465, 471, 808 P.2d 467, 470 (1991) (adopting tb <em>White Mountain Apache </em>test in Montana); <em>State ex rel. Iron Bear v. Dist. Ct., </em>162 Mont. 335, 339-40, 346, 512 P.2d 1292, 1295-96, 1299 (1973) (adopting a three-part test based, in part, on Williams); <em>see also In re Marriage of Skillen, </em>1998 MT 43, \u00b6\u00b6 42-47, 287 Mont. 399, 956 P.2d 1 (differentiating between and clarifying the <em>White Mountan Apache </em>and <em>Iron Bear </em>tests). This Court has recognized trib sovereignty and the right of tribal self-government. <em>See Skillen, </em>\u00b6 4 (citing In <em>re Custody of Zier, </em>230 Mont. 464, 750 P.2d 1083 (1988); <em>In re Marriage of Limpy, </em>195 Mont. 314, 636 P.2d 266 (1981); <em>State ex rel Stewart v. Dist. Ct., </em>187 Mont. 209, 609 P.2d 290 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b611  We have also acknowledged that, generally, \u201c\u2018[tjhe exercise state jurisdiction over activities occurring entirely on Indian lands i| an infringement on inherent tribal authority and is contrary principles of self-government and tribal sovereignty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter Hanna, </em>2010 MT 38, \u00b6 17, 355 Mont. 236, 227 P.3d 596 (quoting <em>Fla Ctr. Farms, Inc. v. State Dept. of Revenue, </em>2002 MT 140, \u00b6 13, 31 Mont. 206, 49 P.3d 578). However, when substantial activities occur Oj the reservation, the state may generally assume jurisdiction. <em>Matte of Bertelson, </em>189 Mont. 524, 531, 617 P.2d 121, 125 (1980) (citatio: omitted); <em>see also Little Horn State Bank v. Stops, 170 </em>Mont. 510, 51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>555 P.2d 211, 214 (1976); <em>Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, </em>411 U.S. 145, 148-49, 93 S. Ct. 1267, 1270 (1973) (citations omitted). Montana courts have jurisdiction over a tribal member whose actions involve \u201c \u2018significant contacts with the state outside reservation boundaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Balyeat Law, PC v. Pettit, </em>1998 MT 252, \u00b6 38, 291 Mont. 196, 967 P.2d 398 (quoting <em>Crawford v. Roy, </em>176 Mont. 227, 230, 577 P.2d 392, 393 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b612  We disagree with Not Afraid\u2019s contention that the JSC is attempting to regulate \u2018lndian[s] running for tribal office.\u201d The state has made no effort to regulate candidates for tribal office. The Crow Tribe may qualify its own candidates and conduct its own elections. Here, the state is seeking to enforce the qualifications for a state office which was sought and obtained by an individual Crow tribal member. Not Afraid\u2019s actions, in filing and running for state office, involved much more than \u201csignificant contacts with the state.\u201d He became a state official and took a constitutional oath of office to support, protect, and defend the Montana Constitution. Therefore, the state is not impermissibly interfering with tribal sovereignty or self-governance, and has jurisdiction to pursue the complaint against Not Afraid.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b613 <em>Is the office of Crow Tribal Chairman an \u201celective public office\u201dfor purposes of Article VII, Section 10?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b614 Article VII, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution states that \u2018ta]ny holder of a judicial position forfeits that position by either filing for an <em>elective public office </em>other than a judicial position or absenting himself from the state for more than 60 consecutive days.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Not Afraid argues that the definition of \u201celective public office\u201d in the constitution and in statute does not include elective tribal offices, and thus he did not violate the provision by filing as a candidate for tribal office. He argues that Keller failed to establish that a \"public\u201d office includes an office filled by qualified tribal members voting in an election on their own reservation. Evidence introduced at the hearing indicated that the number of votes cast in the Crow \u25a0Chairman primary election was about 3,500, and the number of votes \u25a0past in the Crow Chairman general election was approximately 3,400. \u25a0Keller responds that \u201celective public office\u201d includes the Crow Chairmanship because the position is defined as an executive office in Che Crow Constitution, is elected by a public vote of eligible voters, and Boreign authority has held that tribal council members are \u201celected public officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u25a0115 \u2018The same rules of construction apply in determining the meaning IBf constitutional provisions as apply to statutory [construction.\u201d <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>170 Mont. 399, 404, 553 P.2d 1002, 1006 (1976) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>omitted). \u201cIn determining the meaning of a given provision, the intent of the framers is controlling.\u201d <em>Keller, </em>170 Mont. at 405, 553 P.2d at 1006 (citations omitted). \u2018Such intent shall first be determined from the plain meaning of the words used, if possible, and if the intent can be so determined, the courts may not go further and apply any other means of interpretation.\u201d Keller, 170 Mont. at 405, 553 P.2d at 1006 (citations omitted). If the language itself is not clear, \u201cwe must resort to extrinsic rules of construction.\u201d <em>Keller, </em>170 Mont. at 406, 553 P.2d at 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b616 Using this framework as a guide, we first look at the words of the constitution. Constitutional language should be given its natural or ordinary meaning. <em>Gen. Agric. Corp. v. Moore, </em>166 Mont. 510, 516, 534 P.2d 859, 863 (1975) (citations omitted). However, the language of Article VII, Section 10 does not indicate whether the term \u201cpublic office\u201d includes only offices of the state or would include the offices of another sovereign. The provision does not reference tribal offices. It| provides no guidance regarding what constitutes a \u201cpublic\u201d office, as opposed to an office elected by a group whose membership is narrower] than the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b617 \u2018The rule is that when the framers\u2019 intent cannot be determined] from the Constitution\u2019s plain words, recourse may be had to tb proceedings of the Constitutional Convention.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Racicot </em>v. <em>Dist. Ct., </em>243 Mont. 379, 386-87, 794 P.2d 1180, 1184 (1990) (citatio: omitted). Unfortunately, our constitutional history offers little help i: discerning the intent of this provision. The explanatory notes of tb 1972 Constitutional Convention regarding Article VII, Section 10 state, in their entirety: \u2018New provision. A judge may not run for any othe: public office, or be out of the state for more than 60 days.\u201d Tb Convention transcripts include comments by the delegates that thi; provision would prohibit a judge from \u201cfiling for <em>any </em>other office durini his term of office.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbati: Transcript, February 29,1972, p. 1120 (emphasis added). The purpose was \u2018to prevent what we think is political ambition\u201d and preven \u201cusing the courts as stepping-stones in fulfillment of a politica] ambition,\u201d and the tone of the discussion revealed an understanding that \u201cany office\u201d meant any \u2018political office.\u201d Montana Constitutional] Convention, Verbatim Transcript, February 29, 1972, p. 1120. Agai: there is no particular guidance with regard to the application of thj provision to tribal offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b618 We may also consult the Legislature\u2019s determination constitutional intent. \u201cWhile such determination is not binding on thi] Court, it is entitled to consideration.\u201d <em>Keller, </em>170 Mont. at 407, 55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>P.2d at 1007. The Attorney General has opined that \u00a7\u00a73-1-607 and 3-1-608, MCA, are implementing statutes for Article VII, Section 10. Mont. Atty. Gen. Op. 21, 44 Op. Atty. Gen. Mont. 21 at *4 (Oct. 22, 1991).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 3-1-607(1), MCA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">Supreme court justice or district court judge candidacy for nonjudicial office-resignation required. (1) If a person occupying the office of chief justice or associate justice of the supreme court or judge of a district court of the state of Montana becomes a candidate for election to any elective office under the laws of the state of Montana other than a judicial position, the person shall immediately, or in any event at or before the time when the person is required to file as a candidate for the office in any primary, special, or general election, resign from the office of chief justice, associate justice, or district court judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">This provision requires a judge to resign from his office upon becoming \u2018a candidate for election to any elective office <em>under the laws of the state of Montana </em>....\u2019\u2019Section 3-1-607(1), MCA (emphasis added). This anguage applies the prohibition to only those offices governed by state aw and thus excludes tribal offices, which are created and governed )y tribal law. Keller correctly notes that this provision does not include ustices of the peace, addressing only district court judges and supreme :ourt justices. We acknowledged the same in regard to the predecessor ersion of the statute in <em>Committee for an Effective Judiciary v. State, </em>209 Mont. 105, 679 P.2d 1223 (1984), noting that the statute revent[s] only district judges and supreme court justices from eeking other judicial office without forfeiting their office.\u201d <em>Comm. for n Effective Jud., </em>209 Mont. at 113, 679 P.2d at 1227. However, we iso explained that the prohibition as stated in Article VII, Section 10 broader than the statute in this regard, as it \u201capplies to all judges in .is state.\u201d <em>Comm. for an Effective Jud., </em>209 Mont. at 113, 679 P.2d at 227.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the Constitution reaches justices of the peace though the atute does not. We look to the statute here only for its guidance on e meaning of \u201cpublic office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u00b619 Not Afraid notes that tribal offices are not mentioned with the other offices included within the definition of \u201cpublic office\u201d provided by the election statutes, and he urges that we make the same distinction. Section 13-1-101(28), MCA, provides that \u201c\u2018[plublic office\u2019 means a state, county, municipal, school, or other district office that is filled by the people at an election,\u201d and tribal offices are notably missing from this listing. There is also legislative history regarding the election statutes which supports Not Afraid\u2019s position. In 2003, the Legislature considered a bill to generally revise the election code. The sponsor proposed an amendment which was eventually adopted anc is currently codified at \u00a713-10-201(1), MCA: \u201cA candidate may not file for more than one public office....\u201d During the discussion of thi provision, Rep. Windy Boy asked the sponsor if he, as a tribal member would be affected by the rule against running for two position! simultaneously. Mont. H. State Admin. Comm., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on H. Bill 190, </em>58th Legis., Reg. Sess. 3 (Jan. 29, 2003). Rep. Wind; Boy was also a Chippewa-Cree Tribal Councilman. In response, th sponsor stated that the proposed statute would not affect Rep. Wind; Boy because \u201ctribal government is sovereign.\u201d Mont. H. State Admin Comm., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on H. Bill 190, </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b620 Keller argues that this definition of \"public office\u201d should h restricted to Title 13 of the MCA and not applied to issues arisin under the Montana Constitution or the Code of Judicial Conduct. Hi notes that \u00a7 13-1-101, MCA, states \u201c[a]s used in this title, unless th context clearly indicates otherwise, the following definitions apply... We have held, however, that \u201cwhen a word is defined in the code, th: definition is applicable to other parts of the code except where t contrary is plainly indicated.\u201d <em>SJL of Mont. Assocs. Ltd. Partn. v. Cit of Billings, </em>263 Mont. 142, 147, 867 P.2d 1084, 1087 (1993) (citing \u00a7 2-107, MCA; <em>Dept. of Revenue v. Gallatin Outpatient Clinic, </em>234 Mon 425, 430, 763 P.2d 1128, 1131 (1988)). We see no clear indication th the statutory definition of \u201cpublic office\u201d cannot be referenced fc issues arising outside of Title 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b621 This Court has previously addressed the issue of what constitu\u00ed a \u2018^public office.\u201d We have noted that <em>\u201c </em>\u00a3[t]he American concept of public office is that of a public trust or agency created for the bene: of the people, and in which the incumbent has not a property right, be administered under legislative control in the interest of t] people.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Hollibaugh v. State Fish &amp; Game Commn., </em>1 Mont. 384, 390, 365 P.2d 942, 946 (1961) (quoting <em>State ex rel. Nag v. Sullivan, </em>98 Mont. 425, 437, 40 P.2d 995, 997-98 (1935)). In <em>For Second Legislative Assembly v. Lennon, </em>156 Mont. 416, 481 P.2d 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>(1971), we were called upon to determine whether delegates to the constitutional convention were \u2018\u201cstate officer[s]\u2019 holding a public office of a civil nature\u201d for purposes of the constitutional prohibition on holding more than one office. In doing so, we articulated the following standards for resolving the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">After an exhaustive examination of the authorities, we hold that five elements are indispensable in any position of public employment, in order to make it a public office of a civil nature: (1) It must be created by the Constitution or by the legislature or created by a municipality or other body through authority conferred by the Legislature; (2) it must possess a delegation of a portion of the sovereign power of government, to be exercised for the benefit of the public; (3) the powers conferred, and the duties to be discharged, must be defined, directly or impliedly, by the Legislature or through legislative authority; (4) the duties must be performed independently and without control of a superior power, other than the law, unless they may be those of an inferior or subordinate office, created or authorized by the legislature, and by it placed under the general control of a superior officer or body; (5) it must have some permanency and continuity and not be only temporary or occasional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>Forty-Second Legis. Assembly, </em>156 Mont. at 422-23, 481 P.2d at 333-34 (quoting <em>State ex rel. Barney v. Hawkins, </em>79 Mont. 506, 528-29, 257 P. 411, 418 (1927)). We have explained that if any one of the five elements is missing, then the particular position is considered employment, and not a public office. <em>State ex rel. Running v. Jacobson, </em>140 Mont. 221, 225, 370 P.2d 483, 485 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">nI22 Applying the above test, the position of Crow Tribal Chairman is pot created by the Montana Constitution nor by the Legislature, so element (1) is not satisfied. The powers and duties of Crow Tribal Chairman are not directly or impliedly defined by the Montana Legislature, thereby negating element (3). At least two elements would pot be satisfied. While this test may not have been designed for the particular issue before us, it nonetheless provides guidance with regard to the factors we have considered to be significant in deciding Jhe contours of a \u201cpublic office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">1123 Keller\u2019s argument emphasizes the following language from <em>Committee for an Effective Judiciary:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5p\">The judicial article is clearly the most restrictive-it imposes severe sanctions on office-seeking by judicial office holders. Any judge holding office in this state forfeits his office if he files for any office-other than a judicial position.\u201d (Art. VII, Section 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>supra.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><em>Comm. for an Effective Jud., </em>209 Mont. at 115, 679 P.2d at 1228. This language is concededly broad, indicating that a judge who files for \u201cany office\u201d forfeits his judicial position. It could be considered dictum, given that the issue in that case was the Legislature\u2019s prohibition on judges filing for other <em>judicial </em>offices. Perhaps more important, for the purposes of this case, is the incongruity between this statement and the language of Article VII, Section 10. The constitutional prohibition extends, not to \u201cany office,\u201d but to an \u201celective public office,\u201d and the opinion in <em>Committee for an Effective Judiciary </em>provided no analysis of this phrase. Rather, it focused on the phrase \u201cother than a judicial position\u201d within Article VII, Section 10: \u2018The language, \u2018other than a judicial position,\u2019 shows that the delegates intentionally left the door open for judicial office holders to file for other judicial office without forfeiting their offices as a condition to seeking other judicial office through the election process.\u201d <em>Comm. for an Effective Jud., </em>209 Mont. at 115, 679 P.2d at 1228. Thus, we do not believe the language quoted above from <em>Committee for an Effective Judiciary </em>determines the issue before us today-whether \u201celective public office\u201dincludes tribal offices. \u00b624 Keller also offers <em>Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon v. Employment Department, </em>995 P.2d 580 (Or. App. 2000) which, in part, determined whether Siletz Indian tribal counci\u2019 members were \u201celected public officials\u201d under Oregon statutes. In] <em>Confederated Tribes, </em>an unemployment compensation dispute aros when three members of the Siletz tribal council were removed fro office and claimed unemployment benefits. <em>Confederated Tribes, </em>995 P.2d at 582. The Siletz tribe had previously elected to be subject t Oregon\u2019s employment statutes. <em>Confederated Tribes, </em>995 P.2d at 582 The Tribe argued the former tribal council members should b considered \u201celected public officials,\u201d under a statute, rendering the: ineligible for unemployment coverage. <em>Confederated Tribes, </em>995 P.2d at 584-85. After analyzing the statutory text, statutory context, an legislative history, the court concluded that the language excludin coverage for elected public officials was intended only to apply to stat| and local government employees-not to any other category of electe public officials such as tribal officials-and awarded unemploymen benefits to the former council members. <em>Confederated Tribes, </em>995 P.2 at 585-89. Keller argues that \u201cauthority exists\u201d to conclude the Cro chairmanship is an elective public office, relying on the Oregon Court| comment that, under a dictionary definition, \u201cthe ordinary meaning the term \u2018elected public official\u2019 would appear to include Siletz\u2019s tribj council members.\u201d <em>Confederated Tribes, </em>995 P.2d at 585. However, tl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>holding in the Oregon case was actually the opposite. Consequently, we do not find <em>Confederated Tribes </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b625 We acknowledge there is little authority to assist in deciding this question. However, it is clear that nothing within the constitutional language, the delegates\u2019 statements, statutory provisions, legislative history or case precedent reveals any indication to include tribal offices within the concept of \u201celective public office\u201d under Montana law. All indications point to the opposite conclusion-that tribal offices are creations of another sovereign and not considered public offices of the state. Here, the office of the Crow chairmanship was created by the Crow Tribe and only tribal members are eligible to run for or to vote for the position. Members of the Montana public at large are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b626  Therefore, we conclude that the phrase \u201celective public office\u201d in Article VII, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution does not include the tribal office of Crow Tribal Chairman. Consequently, Not Afraid did not violate this provision by becoming a candidate for election as Crow Tribal Chairman. Because Not Afraid was not in violation of Article VII, Section 10, we also conclude that he was not in violation of Rules 1.1,1.2, or 3.1 of the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct. We further order that each party is responsible for its own legal costs and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b627 The complaint against Not Afraid is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">DATED this 30th day of December, 2010.</p>\n<judges id=\"b565-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\"> Pursuant to authority granted by Article VII, Section 11(2) of the Monta Constitution and by \u00a73-1-1105(2), MCA, the JSC adopted Rule 10(b), which provide! fa] complaint shall not be a prerequisite to action by the Commission.

Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">|\u00b629 The most fundamental problem with this case is evident from its (caption: <em>Inquiry Concerning Complaint of: Judicial Standards ICommission v. Leroy Not Afraid. </em>While the Court correctly observes Sthat questions of jurisdiction may be raised at any time, Opinion, P 10-indeed, courts have an \u2018independent obligation\u201d to determine Ivhether jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from bny party, <em>see Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643-and while the Court then addresses the question of Ivhether the Judicial Standards Commission (JSC) is interfering with tribal sovereignty or self-governance, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, the Court Inexplicably ignores the threshold question of whether the JSC has authority to file complaints against judicial officers on its own motion. \u25a0The Court does not address this important issue directly but, rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>in a footnote containing no analysis, cites a JSC rule and a prior decision of this Court as support for the JSC\u2019s action. Opinion, \u00b6 4 n. 1. Neither of these, however, is valid authority for the JSC to proceed as it has in this matter; and, in fact, I conclude that the JSC does not have such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b630 The JSC is established by the Montana Constitution, and its power and authority are delineated by the Constitution. In particular, \u2018Tt]he commission shall investigate <em>complaints, </em>and make rules implementing this section. It may subpoena witnesses and documents.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 11(2) (emphasis added). Significantly, this provision does not grant the JSC authority to commence investigations into any matter it deems interesting or worrisome. It says, rather, that the JSC shall investigate \u201ccomplaints.\u201d The implication of this language is that the JSC does not act on its own motion but, rather, acts only pursuant to a \u201ccomplaint\u201dbrought by someone <em>other than the JSC itself.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u00b631 This interpretation is supported by the statutes implementing Article VII, Section 11. Section 3-l-1106(l)(a), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">The commission, upon the filing of a written complaint <em>by any\\ citizen of the state, </em>may initiate an investigation of any judicia officer in the state to determine if there are grounds fo: conducting additional proceedings before the commission. If tb commission\u2019s investigation indicates that additional proceeding; before the commission may be justified, the commission shal' require <em>the citizen who filed the original written complaint </em>to sij <em>a verified written complaint </em>before conducting additional proceedings. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Likewise, subsection (l)(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">The commission shall give the judicial officer written notice o: <em>the citizen\u2019s complaint </em>and of the initiation of an investigation! Notice must also be given if <em>a verified written complaint </em>is file' and must include the charges made, the grounds for the charges) and a statement that the judicial officer may file an answer. Thi notice must be signed by the commission. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asde\">Also, \u00a7 3-l-1126(l)(a), MCA, directs the JSC, in its reports to thi Legislature, to identify \u201ceach complaint, whether or not verified] <em>received </em>by the commission\u201d (emphasis added). There is no suggestio: that complaints may be filed by the JSC itself. To the contrary, thes provisions recognize only complaints filed by <em>citizens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">\u00b632 This interpretation of Article VII, Section 11(2) is also supportej by the comments of the 1972 Constitutional Convention delegate Delegate Aronow observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>this article provides for three district judges, one lawyer and one layman, a committee of five, to investigate and look into any complaints that are made or any information that comes to the attention of the commission that a judge, either because of old age, other disability, is not attending to duties properly and provide for his retirement or removal from office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, Feb. 29, 1972, p. 1123.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Delegate Aronow further explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">we\u2019ve never had a commission of this type to which a practicing lawyer could go. The only way that you can get rid of a judge was through impeachment or wait until the next election and try to get somebody to run against him. <em>This is a procedure where a letter can be written or a charge filed with this commission and ask them to look into it, investigate it, </em>and, if the facts were found to be true, then to take such action as [they] might deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1126 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">133 Likewise, Delegate Berg noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">[w]e are particularly interested in seeing to it that District judges and Supreme Court justices have some protection, not only of themselves in the case of senility or alcoholism, but frequently charges are made against judges which, of course, they are almost powerless to answer. If there is a commission before whom those charges can be filed, the judge has an opportunity to defend himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A11\"><em>d. </em>at 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">\u00b634 The delegates contemplated that the JSC\u2019s proceedings would be t the behest of an aggrieved citizen. Indeed, it is notable that the elegates adopted the current language of Article VII, Section l(2)wvhich, as noted, grants the JSC authority to \u2018investigate omplaints\u201d-over language that would have granted the JSC \u201cthe ower to investigate . . . upon complaint by any citizen <em>or on its own lotion.\u201d See id. </em>at 1122 (emphasis added). Section 3-1-1106(1), MCA, irrespondingly, refers to a complaint filed by a <em>citizen, </em>not by the JSC <em>i its own motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">\u25a035 In the present case, however, the official record filed with the Blerk of the Supreme Court in Case No. PR 09-0639 does not contain \u25a0written complaint by a citizen-let alone a <em>verified </em>-written complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>by a citizen. Rather, the so-called \u2018Formal Complaint\u201d upon which this action is premised was filed by the JSC itself. To be sure, it was signed by an individual (Geoffrey R. Keller). But Keller signed in his capacity as \u2018Prosecuting Attorney,\u201d and the first paragraph of the complaint states that Keller was \u201cappointed by the Judicial Standards Commission\u201d and is proceeding \u201con behalf of\u2019the \u201cJudicial Standards Commission,\u201d which is the named \u2018Complainant.\u201d In other words, the JSC hired Keller as prosecutor and then directed him to file, in the JSC\u2019s name, the complaint against Not Afraid, which the JSC ther heard and decided.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b636 While not a matter of record, it appears that the JSC\u2019s action wai prompted by an unverified letter from the Commission on Courts o: Limited Jurisdiction (COCLJ) dated May 5,2009 and addressed to the Chief Justice and myself, with copies to Not Afraid and the JSC. Thii letter was intended to \u201cnotify! ]\u201d this Court and the JSC of \u201can issue that may result in the disqualification of a sitting Justice of th&lt; Peace.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is doubtful that this letter qualifies as a <em>citizen </em>complain filed with the JSC. But assuming, for the sake of argument, that it i: \u00a73-1-1106, MCA, required the JSC to follow these steps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">1. Upon the filing of the written complaint, initiate ai investigation to determine if there are grounds for conductin additional proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">2. If the investigation indicates that additional proceedings maj be justified, then \u201crequire the citizen who filed the origin; written complaint to sign a verified written complaint befo: conducting additional proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">3. After an investigation, and upon a finding of good cause, do an| of the following: (a) order a hearing to be held before the JS concerning the censure, suspension, removal, or retirement of t' judicial officer; (b) confidentially advise the judicial officer a: this Court that the complaint will be dismissed if the judici officer files a letter stating that he or she will take correcthl action satisfactory to the JSC; or (c) request that this Couj appoint one or more special masters to hear and take evidem and to report to the JSC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>4. If after a hearing or after considering the record and the report of the masters the JSC finds the charges true, then recommend to this Court the censure, suspension, removal, or disability retirement of the judicial officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\u00b637 Again, assuming the COCLJ letter constituted a citizen complaint, the JSC was permitted to initiate an investigation to determine whether grounds existed to conduct additional proceedings. If such grounds existed, the JSC was required to obtain a verified written complaint before conducting the additional proceedings. According to the record filed in this case, however, that procedure was not followed. There is no verified written complaint by a citizen. Rather, the JSC proceeded based solely on its own complaint against Not Afraid. The JSC held a hearing on the complaint in June 2010 (step 3(a) above) and filed a recommendation with this Court in August 2010 (step 4) that Not Afraid receive a public reprimand. Basically, everything the JSC did after receiving the letter and completing a preliminary investigation (step 1) was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u00b638 There is no authority for the JSC to charge, hear, and then adjudicate the merits of its own complaint. That approach is contrary \u00a1to the intent of Article VII, Section 11(2) and the dictates of \u00a73-1-1106, MCA. The JSC in this case has plainly overstepped its authority. Moreover, I note that this procedure-under which the JSC has anointed itself complainant, investigator, and adjudicator-raises the same concerns which prompted this Court to enact structural changes to the Commission on Practice. <em>See Goldstein v. Commn. on Practice o</em>f <em>the Supreme Court, </em>2000 MT 8, 297 Mont. 493, 995 P.2d 923; <em>In re Creation of Office of Discipline Counsel, </em>2001 MT 257, 307 Mont. 210, 153 P.3d 861. These structural changes included separating the Investigative authority, the reviewing authority, the charging (authority, and the adjudicatory authority so that all four are not conducted by the same individuals. But here, in contrast, all four of these functions were conducted by the same members of the JSC. Burely judges who are subject to discipline are entitled to the same due process rights as those enjoyed by attorneys who are subject to discipline. As perhaps the most basic component of due process, Not |\\fraid had the right to be judged by an impartial tribunal, not by the pery body that filed the charges against him. <em>See Goldstein, </em>\u00b6 64 iNelson, Leaphart, &amp; Trieweiler, JJ., dissenting). As James Madison Ibserved, \u2018No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because ids interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, iorrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of Bien are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time ....\u201d <em>The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Federalist No. 10, </em>at 79 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\u00b639 The Court does not deny that the constitutional and statutory requisites for the JSC\u2019s proceedings were not met in this case. Rather, in a footnote, the Court merely cites to the JSC\u2019s Rule 10(b) and our decision in <em>State ex rel. Smartt v. Jud. Stands. </em>Commn., 2002 MT 148, \u00b6 30, 310 Mont. 295, 50 P.3d 150, as support for the JSC\u2019s action here. Opinion, \u00b6 4 n. 1. Yet, as stated at the outset, neither of these is valid authority for the JSC to initiate formal proceedings on its own complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u00b640 First, <em>Smartt </em>is distinguishable on its facts in that the proceedings there were initiated at the behest of a citizen (Samuel Harris) who filed first an unverified complaint, and later a verified complaint, against Smartt with the JSC. <em>See Smartt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 21. Notably, the JSC conceded that the First Judicial District Court Vas correct to enjoin the Commission from instituting formal proceedings [against Smartt] before it had obtained a verified complaint [from Harris].\u201d <em>Smartt, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u00b641 Furthermore, the question under consideration in \u00b6 30 of <em>Smart\\ </em>was whether the JSC had overstepped its authority by investigation allegations which had come to the JSC\u2019s attention in the course o: investigating Harris\u2019s complaint and which had been leveled by different individual who had not filed a complaint with the JSC. <em>Se&gt; Smartt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 22. We stated that the JSC may act on its own motion and in the absence of a verified complaint, to investigate allege judicial misconduct based upon information otherwise received) <em>Smartt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Yet, although I signed our opinion in <em>Smartt, </em>upo: further research I cannot agree with the proposition that the JSC ma; file charges against a judge or justice on its own motion and then sij in judgment of its own case. That is not what the delegates had i: mind; indeed, as noted, they declined to adopt language that woul have granted the JSC \u201cthe power to investigate ... on its own motion.] Also, it is not what the applicable statutes say.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\u00b642 In this regard, this Court has held that the JSC may not adopl rules which conflict with the statutory provisions implementing Articl) VII, Section 11. <em>State ex rel. Shea v. Jud. Stands. Commn., </em>198 Mon 15, 30-34, 643 P.2d 210, 218-20 (1982). At issue in <em>Shea </em>were charg against then-Justice Shea arising out of (1) an unverified letter fro: a retired district judge alleging that automobiles registered in thj name of Justice Shea\u2019s wife had accumulated 60 unpaid parki: tickets and (2) an unverified complaint by the JSC itself that Justi Shea had used \u2018intemperate\u201d language in a dissenting opinion. <em>See i </em>at 19-20,30-32,643 P.2d at 212-13,218-19. As authority for proceedinl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>without a verified complaint, the JSC had relied on its Rule 9(b), which stated: \u2018The commission, without receiving a verified statement, may make such a preliminary investigation on its own motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, 643 P.2d at 215. We held this rule invalid, however, because it conflicted with the statutory requirement (under \u00a73-1-1106(1), MCA) that the JSC\u2019s investigations be conducted pursuant to a \u201cverified written complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 643 P.2d at 219. We observed that the JSC, in proceeding under Rule 9(b), was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\">assuming unto itself the right to ignore legislatively enacted provisions governing its procedure, and even its own rule requiring a verified complaint, in its perception and under the assumption that it is now acting and will act for the public good. The question, however, is not one of motives but of constitutional authority, for which the best of motives is not a substitute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 32, 643 P.2d at 219. We concluded that the JSC was powerless to set aside the statutory requirement that it proceed against judicial officers only by verified written complaint-Rule 9(b) and the JSC\u2019s rulemaking authority notwithstanding. <em>Id. </em>at 34, 643 P.2d at 220. \u00b643 It should be noted here that at the time we decided <em>Shea, </em>\u00a7 3-1-1106(1), MCA, contemplated that the JSC could initiate an investigation by filing its own verified written complaint. The statute provided: <em>\u201cThe commission </em>or any citizen of the state may, upon good cause shown, initiate an investigation of any judicial officer in the state by filing a verified written complaint with the commission.\u201d Section 3-1-1106(1), MCA (1981) (emphasis added). But in 1983, the Legislature revoked that authority, requiring instead that a complaint be filed by a citizen. The revised statute provided (and still provides):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJg\">The commission, upon the filing of a written complaint <em>hy any citizen of the state, </em>may initiate an investigation of any judicial officer in the state to determine if there are grounds for conducting additional proceedings before the commission. If the commission\u2019s investigation indicates that additional proceedings before the commission may be justified, the commission shall require <em>the citizen who filed the original written complaint </em>to sign <em>a verified written complaint </em>before conducting additional proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Ejection 3-l-1106(l)(a), MCA (1983 &amp; 2009) (emphases added). This is lurther evidence that the JSC has no authority to commence proceedings against a judge or justice on its own complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">B44 This Court was unanimous in <em>Shea </em>with respect to Issue 3, where She Court held that a verified written complaint is a requisite for JSC proceedings, despite the JSC\u2019s attempt through Rule 9(b) to expand its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>authority to conduct investigations in the absence of such a complaint. Justice Sheehy authored the opinion of the Court, in which Justices Daly and Morrison concurred; and Justice Weber, through a special concurrence, provided the essential fourth vote as to Issue 3. <em>See Shea, </em>198 Mont. at 40, 643 P.2d at 224 (Weber, J., specially concurring). Significantly, however, Justice Weber did <em>not </em>join Justice Sheehy s opinion as to Issue 4, thus making that part of the decision a plurality. Under Issue 4, Justice Sheehy considered whether the charges made against Justice Shea, relating to unpaid parking tickets and \u2018intemperate\u201d language in a dissenting opinion, constituted \u201cwillful misconduct in office.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 34-39, 643 P.2d at 220-23 (plurality opinion). He concluded that they did not amount to \u201cwillful misconduct in office\u201d and that the JSC, therefore, had acted \u2018in excess of its jurisdiction\u201d by pursuing these charges. <em>Id. </em>at 39, 643 P.2d at 223. Justice Weber, however, noted that it was unnecessary to reach Issue 4 given the threshold determination under Issue 3 that the proceedings against Justice Shea were barred due to the lack of a verified complaint. <em>See id. </em>at 40-41, 643 P.2d at 224 (special concurrence).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u00b645 The significance of Justice Weber\u2019s vote was overlooked by the Court in <em>Smartt. </em>We asserted that the <em>Shea </em>Court \u201cdid not issue the writ of prohibition solely because the Commission proceeded agains' Justice Shea without the statutorily required verified complaint, but, rather, primarily because the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction in| investigating a charge that did not amount to \u2018misconduct in office. <em>Smartt, </em>\u00b6 17. This is a complete misstatement of the <em>Shea </em>decision. The fact is that the writ of prohibition did issue <em>solely </em>because the JS1 proceeded against Justice Shea without the statutorily require^ verified complaint. That was the one-and only-ground that commanded a majority of the Court. Only a plurality reached th&lt; conclusion that the JSC had also exceeded its jurisdiction b; investigating charges that did not amount to \u201cmisconduct in office,\u2019! and the entire discussion under Issue 4 of <em>Shea </em>was, therefore, dictaj</p>\n<p id=\"A05\">\u00b646 For the foregoing reasons, the suggestions in <em>Smartt </em>that the JS' may initiate an investigation and file charges on its own motion am that we did not squarely hold to the contrary in <em>Shea </em>are simply wron; and should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u00b647 As a final matter, the Court notes that the JSC adopted Rule 10( pursuant to authority granted by Article VII, Section 11(2) an| \u00a7 3-1-1105(2), MCA. The former authorizes the JSC to \u201cinvestigat&lt; complaints, and make rules implementing this section,\u201d while thj latter states that the JSC \u201cshall make rules for the conduct of i <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>affairs and the enforcement of confidentiality consistent with this part.\u201dYet, the authority to make rules is not also authority for the JSC to delineate or expand its own jurisdiction. In this regard, it should not be forgotten that jurisdiction is conferred \u201conly by the Constitution or statutes adopted pursuant to the Constitution\u201d and that administrative rules are not a source of jurisdiction. <em>Pinnow v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2007 MT 332, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, 340 Mont. 217, 172 P.3d 1273. Furthermore, for the reasons just discussed, the JSC may not, through its rulemaking authority, ignore legislatively enacted provisions setting forth the requisites for JSC proceedings. <em>Shea, </em>198 Mont. at 32-34, 643 P.2d at 219-20. Those provisions require that JSC proceedings be founded upon the verified written complaint of a citizen. Any statutory authority the JSC may have had to proceed on its own motion-assuming such authority was valid in the first place-was revoked in 1983 with the amendments to \u00a73-1-1106, MCA. Regardless of how much power and authority the JSC has purported to confer unto itself under Rule 10(b), the JSC\u2019s jurisdiction is constrained by the Constitution and statutes adopted pursuant to the Constitution, and those provisions authorize the JSC to act only upon citizen complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">1148 Accordingly, the JSC\u2019s action here is legally unfounded, and I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s ratification of it. The JSC has no luthority to charge, hear, and adjudicate the merits of its own complaint. The JSC may proceed against a judicial officer only by the rerified written complaint of a citizen. I thus would hold that the JSC tad no jurisdiction over this action, and I would dismiss the JSC\u2019s omplaint on this basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">II. \u2018Elective Public Office\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">49 Because the Court has proceeded to analyze the merits of the SC\u2019s complaint against Not Afraid, I will explain my disagreement rith the Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">50 First, the Court\u2019s entire discussion commencing at \u00b6 17 and Dncluding at \u00b6 26 is premised on the notion that Article VII, Section 0 is ambiguous. (As the Court concedes, if a provision is nambiguous, we simply apply the provision according to the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>meaning of its words and do not resort to extrinsic sources as the Court does here. Opinion, \u00b6 15; <em>see also State v. Turbiville, </em>2003 MT 340, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 451, 81 P.3d 475.) The Court\u2019s premise, however, is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u00b651 Article VII, Section 10 states: \u201cAny holder of a judicial position forfeits that position by either filing for an elective public office othei than a judicial position or absenting himself from the state for more than 60 consecutive days.\u201d The term at issue is \u201celective public office.\u201d These words have a plain and unambiguous meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\u00b652 A \u201cpublic office\u201dis \u201c[a] position whose occupant has legal authority to exercise a government\u2019s sovereign powers for a fixed <em>periodBlack\u2019i Law Dictionary </em>1351 (Bryan A. Gamer ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009). This, in substance, is the same definition of \u201cpublic office\u201d that existed when Article VII, Section 10 was adopted. <em>See Black\u2019s Lau Dictionary </em>1235 (rev. 4th ed., West 1968) (\u2018The right, authority, anc duty created and conferred by law, by which for a given period ... ai individual is invested with some portion of the sovereign functions o government for the benefit of the public.\u2019). Likewise, this Court ha; recognized that \u201cthe creation and conferring of an office involves ; delegation to the individual of some of the sovereign functions government, to be exercised by him for the benefit of the public.\u201d <em>Stat ex rel. Running v. Jacobson, </em>140 Mont. 221, 225, 370 P.2d 483, 48 (1962) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also State ex rel. Barne, v.

Baugh v. Bradley, </em>231 Mon 46, 52, 753 P.2d 857, 861 (1988). Even the test cited by the Court \u00b6 21 recognizes that a \u201cpublic office\u201d is a position that involves thj exercise of a government\u2019s sovereign powers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">1.

The <em>Barney </em>Court synthesized this five-prong test from various non-Montana authorities. <em>See Barney, </em>79 Mont. at 515-29, 257 P. at 413-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u00b653 Here, the position of Crow Tribal Chairman clearly meets the definition of \u201cpublic office.\u201d The position is created by the Crow Constitution under Article IV of that document (\u2018Executive Branch of Government\u201d). The position possesses a delegation of a portion of the sovereign power of the Crow tribal government to be exercised for the benefit of the public. The powers and duties of the position are defined in Article IV-thus eliminating the need for definition by the tribal legislature. <em>See Barney, </em>79 Mont. at 523, 257 P. at 416 (stating the inquiry simply as, \u201cAre his duties prescribed by law?\u201d-not necessarily \u2018by the legislature\u201d). The duties are performed independently and without control of a superior power other than the law. And the constitutionally created position has permanency and continuity. There can be no doubt that Crow Tribal Chairman is a \u2018^public office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVD\">\u00b654 The Court asserts that the first and third elements of the five-prong test are not met here because the position of Crow Tribal Chairman \u2018is not created by the Montana Constitution nor by the Legislature\u201d and the powers and duties of the position \u201care not directly or impliedly defined by the Montana Legislature.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 22. But these observations miss the mark. The fact that the position is not created by the Montana Constitution or the Montana Legislature and the fact that its powers and duties are not defined by the Montana Legislature establish nothing except that the position is not a \u201cpublic office\u201d <em>of this state. </em>That is not the relevant question, however. The juestion, rather, is whether the position is a \u201cpublic that is what the constitutional language says, d, for the reasons just discussed, it plainly is a \u201cpublic office\u201d-albeit, i created by a different sovereign, but no less a \u201cpublic office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Afgd\">5 Next, is the position \u201celective\u2019? An \u201celective office\u201d is \u2018ta]n office it is filled by popular election rather than by appointment.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s w Dictionary </em>596 (9th ed.); <em>accord Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>610 (rev. l ed.) (\u2018One which is to be filled by popular election. One filled by the ect exercise of the voters\u2019 franchise.\u201d). Here, Article IV, Section 1 of ! Crow Constitution states that the position of Tribal Chairman all be elected by the qualified voters.\u201d Thus, there can be no doubt it the position of Crow Tribal Chairman is an \u201celective public office.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Article VII, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution states that a holder of a judicial position forfeits that position by \u2018filing for an elective public office other than a judicial position.\u201d Not Afraid filed for an \u201celective public office\u201d that was an executive position. Hence, he forfeited his judicial position.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">\u00b656 The Court circumvents this plain-meaning interpretation of the unambiguous constitutional language by manufacturing an ambiguity where there is none. The Court asserts that Article VII, Section 10 is ambiguous-thus justifying resort to extrinsic sources-because it does not expressly state whether it applies to an \u201celective public office\u201d <em>of another sovereign. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 16. I disagree with this \u2018failure by omission\u201d approach. We can always criticize a statute or constitutional provision for using a general term in lieu of listing every specific object to which the provision is intended to apply. But that does not make the general provision ambiguous; it simply makes the provision broad and nonexclusive. This issue came up during the 1972 Constitutional Convention with respect to the jurisdiction of the district courts. The 1889 Constitution articulated a laundry list of cases and writs ovei which the district courts had jurisdiction. However, the delegates eschewed that approach in favor of general language so as not to imply that any cases or writs not specifically identified in the constitutiona' provision were excluded from the district courts\u2019 authority. <em>Compan </em>Mont. Const, art. VIII, \u00a711 (1889), <em>with </em>Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a74(1)] (1972).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\u00b657 Likewise here, the language is general: Any holder of a judicial position forfeits that position by filing for \u201can elective public offio other than a judicial position.\u201d The delegates chose this broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>nonexclusive, and unqualified language. It thus was not necessary for them to state that the term \u201celective public office\u201d includes elective public offices \u201cof another sovereign.\u201d If anything, they should have qualified the language which they actually used if they intended for it to be limited to \u201celective public offices <em>of this state.'\u201d </em>Indeed, had they wanted to limit the scope of \u201celective public office\u201d to <em>state </em>offices, they certainly could have included the \u201cof the state\u201d language which the Court wrongly inserts into Article VII, Section 10. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 25 (asserting that \u201ctribal offices are creations of another sovereign and not considered public offices <em>of the </em>state\u201d~even though \u201cof the state\u201d is not part of Article VII, Section 10\u2019s language (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">\u00b658 In short, although constitutional language \u201cshould be given its natural or ordinary meaning,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16, the Court fails to abide by this directive and instead inserts words (\u201cof the state\u201d) that do not appear in Article VII, Section 10. This approach violates Montana\u2019s blackletter law-\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>wvhich is so often invoked by every member of this Court that it would be silly to provide pages of string-cites for the principle. The Court errs in reading into the Constitution language that is not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\u00b659 Lastly, I do not believe the extrinsic sources cited by the Court support its ultimate construction of Article VII, Section 10. First, with regard to the January 29, 2003 hearing on HB 190, the Court in effect attributes constitutional significance to the remarks made in response to a question about the scope of a proposed statute. Opinion, \u00b6 19. This approach sets bad precedent, not only because the remarks had absolutely nothing to do with the meaning of Article VII, Section 10, but most fundamentally because it is the province and duty of <em>the judiciary, </em>not speakers at legislative hearings, to interpret the Constitution and say what the law is. <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803); <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Crumleys, Inc., </em>2008 MT 2, \u00b6 57, 341 Mont. 33, 174 P.3d 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u00b660 Likewise, I do not find the Title 13 election statutes cited by the Court to be of any persuasive value. The Court considers it \u201cnotabl[e]\u201d that tribal offices are missing from the definition of \u201cpublic office\u201d in \u00a7 13-1-101(28), MCA, which states: \u201c \u2018Public office\u2019 means a state, county, municipal, school, or other district office that is filled by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>people at an election.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 19. I find this, however, to be quite unsurprising. The Legislature does not dictate the procedures for electing candidates to tribal offices-a point the Court makes in \u00b6 12-and thus there would be no reason for the Legislature to include tribal offices in the definition of \u201cpublic offices\u201d in Title 13. Title 13, after all, sets forth the procedures for electing candidates to <em>state </em>offices, not tribal offices. Moreover, Title 13 does not purport to implement Article VII, Section 10, and thus its definition of \u201cpublic office\u201d affords no insight whatsoever. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">\u00b661 On the other hand, the Attorney General has opined-in a 1991 decision which focused on a different issue-that \u00a73-1-607 and -608, MCA, are implementing statutes for Article VII, Section 10. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Yet, I am aware of no occasion on which the Attorney General has opined that these statutes <em>fully </em>implement the constitutional provision; and the language of the statutes themselves indicates that they do not purport to do so, but rather are directed at three specific state judicial offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u00b662 To summarize, then, the Court takes unambiguous constitutional language, manufactures an ambiguity, and then uses extrinsic sources of limited or no probative value to rewrite the constitutional language-in violation of the canons of construction-from \u201can elective public office other than a judicial position\u201d to \u201can elective public office <em>of the state </em>other than a judicial position.\u201d I strongly dissent from this approach and from the Court\u2019s corresponding conclusion that Crow Tribal Chairman is not an \u201celective public office\u201d under Article VII, Section 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">III. \u2018Forfeits\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\u00b663 Having concluded under the foregoing analysis that Not Afraid! filed for \u201can elective public office other than a judicial position,\u201d the j question arises as to what consequences flow from this action. I</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\u00b664 As noted, Article VII, Section 10 states that the holder of a judicial! position \u2018forfeits that position\u201d either by filing for an elective public I office other than a judicial position or by absenting himself from the! state for more than 60 consecutive days. This language is both! mandatory and prohibitory. It dictates that forfeiture occurs upon! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>either of the two stated events. Correspondingly, it deprives the officeholder of his or her power to act in a judicial capacity. As Delegate Dahood observed during the Constitutional Convention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aei\">[Constitutions are based on the premise that they are presumed to be self-executing, particularly within the Bill of Rights. If the language appears to be prohibitory and mandatory,... then in that event, the courts in interpreting the particular section are bound by that particular presumption and they must assume, in that situation, that it is self-executing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, Mar. 7, 1972, p. 1644. Thus, once it is clear that either of the two events described in Article VII, Section 10 has occurred, then forfeiture of the judicial position is automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">\u00b665 We interpreted this language in one case, <em>Comm. for an Effective Judiciary v. State, </em>209 Mont. 105, 679 P.2d 1223 (1984), where we held unconstitutional two statutes which, in direct contradiction to the language of Article VII, Section 10, required a district court judge or a Supreme Court justice to resign from his or her office in order to run for any elective office under the laws of Montana, including another judicial position. Importantly, for purposes of the present discussion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">The judicial article is clearly the most restrictive-it imposes severe sanctions on office-seeking by judicial office holders. Any judge holding office in this state forfeits his office if he files for any office-1' <em>other than a judicial position.\u201d </em>(Art. VII, \u00a710, supra.) <em>Though it does not mention filing for a legislative or an executive office, the crystal clear message of this provision requires a judge to forfeit his judicial office if he files for either a legislative or an executive office.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\"><em>Comm. for an Effective Judiciary, </em>209 Mont. at 115, 679 P.2d at 1228 (first emphasis in original, second emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\u00b666 Our determination that a judge forfeits his judicial office if he files for an executive office is in accord with the intent of the delegates, as evidenced by the following exchange which occurred when Article VII, Section 10 was recommended for adoption as it is now written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">CHAIRMAN GRAYBILL: I take it that this means that he\u2019s-he forfeits if he does either of these two things which were contained in two separate paragraphs above; namely, files for another elective office or absents himself for 60 days. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">DELEGATE SCHILTZ: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, Mar. 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>1972, p. 2187.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\u00b667 Thus, it is clear from the plain language of Article VII, Section 10, as confirmed by the delegates\u2019 comments, and from our interpretation of this language in <em>Comm, for an Effective Judiciary </em>that when a judge files for a nonjudicial elective public office, the judge forfeits his judicial position. That is precisely what the Constitution says.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\u00b668 To \u2018forfeit\u201d means \u201cto lose or lose the right to by some error, offense, or crime.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>457 (10th ed., Merriam-Webster 1997). \u2018Forfeiture\u201d has a well-understood meaning in the law. It involves \u201c[t]he loss of a right, privilege, or property because of a crime, breach of obligation, or neglect of duty.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>722 (9th ed.). In other words, forfeiture means that a person loses a right or privilege as a consequence of having done or omitted to do an act. It is a divestment as a consequence of default or offense; a loss by reason of misdeed or transgression. In the usual context, forfeiture occurs simultaneously with the act, error, omission, or violation of the condition precedent. Examples of these principles appear repeatedly in our cases. <em>See e.g. State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6 45, 327 Mont. 196, 113 P.3d 281 (juror might have to forfeit airline tickets that he held for a flight which was scheduled to depart the following morning); <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 47, 341 Mont. 240, 177 P.3d 444 (criminal defendant forfeits his constitutional right to confront the victim at trial when he admittedly and deliberately kills the victim); <em>State v. Cotterell, </em>2008 MT 409, \u00b6 88, 347 Mont. 231, 198 P.3d 254 (a person convicted of unlawfully taking, killing, possessing, or transporting a deer, antelope, elk, or mountain lion \u201cshall forfeit\u201d his or her license for 24 months); <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, </em>2009 MT 426, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230 (contract provided that doctors forfeit accounts receivable and interest in surgery center if they violate covenant not to compete).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u00b669 The JSC, however, construes the <em>forfeiture </em>provision as a <em>resignation </em>provision that works prospectively, where a judge has violated Article VII, Section 10 but refuses to give up his judicial position during his campaign for the nonjudicial office. The JSC acknowledges that Not Afraid did not resign his judicial position when he filed for Crow Tribal Chairman; and, for that, the JSC recommends that we publicly reprimand him. Then, given that Not Afraid ultimately did not win the Tribal Chairman position in the April 2009 general election, the JSC states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">Should [Not Afraid] file for non-judicial elective public office in the future (tribal or non-tribal), and <em>refuse to forfeit </em>any judicial position held at that time, the Judicial Standards Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>will immediately file a formal complaint with the Montana Supreme Court and request immediate suspension from office while the complaint is pending. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">\u00b670 Setting aside the fact that the JSC has no authority to file complaints for the reasons already discussed, the JSC\u2019s approach contemplates that if either of the two events described in Article VII, Section 10 occurs, then the judge must affirmatively resign his or her position in order for the forfeiture to take effect and the office to become vacant. The JSC\u2019s theory appears to be that forfeiture is not automatic but, rather, requires a resignation or some sort of proceeding to declare the judge\u2019s office vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">\u00b671 This approach is wrong and in contradiction to the unambiguous language of the Constitution. Article VII, Section 10 does not give the officeholder the choice or option of whether to resign-and when. The Constitution does not state that the holder of a judicial position \u201cmust resign\u201d that position if he either files for a nonjudicial elective public office or absents himself from the state for more than 60 consecutive days. The JSC\u2019s approach reads into the Constitution language that is not there, and ignores the plain language that is there, in violation of this Court\u2019s precedent. <em>See Montanans for Equal Application of Initiative Laws v. State, </em>2007 MT 75, \u00b6 46, 336 Mont. 450, 154 P.3d 1202 (setting out the rules of constitutional construction); <em>see also </em>\u00b6 58 n. 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\u00b672 The JSC\u2019s approach would allow a justice of the peace to file and run for the office of Governor while continuing to sit on the bench-so long as the justice refuses to resign, and until he is formally removed from office. Just as untenable, the JSC\u2019s approach would require a resignation or some sort of proceeding to declare a judicial position vacant if the judge leaves the state for six months to take up residence in Argentina with his mistress. That the JSC\u2019s approach would countenance such a result in either case is nonsensical. With respect to the latter situation, moreover, the JSC\u2019s approach is contrary to statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-16-501(6), MCA (\u201cAn office becomes vacant <em>on the happening </em>of any one of the following events before the expiration of the term of the incumbent:... except as provided in 10-1-1008, absence of the incumbent from the state, without the permission of the legislature, beyond the period allowed by law.\u201d (emphasis added, paragraph breaks omitted)). It should be noted, as well, that by the time the machinery to remove the intransigent judge comes to bear, he will have continued to render decisions-some, perhaps, in cases affecting his campaign contributors and the voters of the county or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>district over which he presides.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He will have shaken hands with, and made campaign promises to, some of the very people who appeared in his court seeking justice or requiring punishment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is not what the Constitution allows; it is not what the delegates intended; and it is not how this Court interpreted Article VII, Section 10 in <em>Comm, for an Effective Judiciary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\u00b673 The fact is that the judge\u2019s formal resignation, or refusal to do so, is completely immaterial. His forfeiture of office occurs by reason of, and coincidentally with, the prohibited act of filing for a nonjudicial elective public office or absenting himself from the state for more than 60 consecutive days. Accordingly, when Not Afraid filed for a nonjudicial elective public office, he immediately forfeited his position as justice of the peace. His office became vacant at the time of filing, without more.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">\u00b674 I recognize that there may be instances in which the officeholder claims that he or she did not file for a nonjudicial elective public office or was not absent from the state for more than 60 consecutive days. In that situation, a fact-finding proceeding may be necessary. But that is not situation here, as it is undisputed that Not Afraid filed for Crow Tribal Chairman-which, under my analysis above, is a nonjudicial elective public office. In this regard, I note that Not Afraid, in response to letters from the JSC directing him to resign, not only refused to do so but also, in blatant defiance of the Constitution, asserted that if he again ran for a tribal office, he would not resign his position as justice of the peace. This is a good example of why forfeiture under Article VII, Section 10 is automatic. A defiant judicial officer must not be allowed, as here, to thumb his nose at the Constitution by refusing to '\u201cresign\u201d his already forfeited office with the challenge, \u2018Remove me if you think you can!\u201d |</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">\u00b675 Indeed, reflecting this sort of contumaciousness, Not Afraidj argues that his tribal political activities are beyond the reach oil Montana law. Such argument, however, is unavailing and withouij merit. While neither the JSC nor this Court has jurisdiction over the! Crow tribal government and its elected officers, that is not the point! Both the JSC and this Court unquestionably <em>do </em>have jurisdiction oveil Not Afraid as an elected justice of the peace in Big Horn County and! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>accordingly, must require him to follow Montana\u2019s Constitution and laws in the conduct of his state judicial office. In this regard, Article VII, Section 10 prohibits the holder of a state judicial position from filing for a nonjudicial elective public office (lest he forfeit his current position) without any distinction as to the sovereign to be served. It prohibits him from filing for a Montana nonjudicial elective public office, a federal nonjudicial elective public office, a tribal nonjudicial elective public office, or a nonjudicial elective public office in another state or country. To the extent Not Afraid believes that serving simultaneously in his state judicial office and a tribal executive office are compatible, that argument has already been rejected by the Constitutional Convention delegates. As the Attorney General has pointed out, compatibility is not a factor under Article VII, Section 10. <em>See </em>Mont. Atty. Gen. Op. 44-21, 1991 Mont. AG LEXIS 21 at **7-8 (Oct. 22, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">\u00b676 In sum, the forfeiture provision of Article VII, Section 10 is self-executing. The act causing the forfeiture-filing for a nonjudicial elective public office or absenting himself or herself from the state for more than 60 consecutive days-immediately and automatically creates a vacancy in the office, which must then be filled according to law. <em>See e.g. </em>Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a78(2) (Supreme Court justices and district court judges); \u00a73-10-206, MCA (justices of the peace). The language of Article VII, Section 10 requires neither a resignation nor a proceeding to declare the office vacant. The prohibited filing or absence creates the forfeiture, and the forfeiture creates the vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\u00b677 The Court\u2019s Opinion today is incredibly far-reaching-and, in my view, patently wrong on any number of levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\u00b678 First, the Court does not adequately address the jurisdiction of the JSC over this case. The JSC\u2019s procedure of hiring its own prosecutor to file a complaint in its own name is contrary to the unmistakable intent of Article VII, Section 11(2) and the dictates of \u00a73-1-1106, MCA, which require that judges and justices be charged and disciplined based upon a complaint filed by a citizen, <em>not the JSC itself. </em>The Court errs in not following these constitutional and statutory mandates. Instead of acknowledging and condemning the JSC\u2019s unlawful process in this case, today\u2019s Opinion blesses the abuse. I cannot agree. After today\u2019s decision, it appears that if the JSC feels the language I have used in this dissent is too \u2018intemperate,\u201d <em>Shea, </em>198 Mont. at 20, 643 P.2d at 213, then the JSC may file a complaint against me sua sponte, land I will be forced to defend in a proceeding where my accuser is also |my judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\u00b679 Second, while the Court, in one breath, waxes eloquent about the sovereignty of the Crow Tribe as a separate government, the Court then, in the next, demeans that same sovereignty by equating the Crow Tribe to \u201ca group whose membership is narrower than the general public\u201d-not unlike a social club or a sporting group-and by refusing to recognize the offices of the Crow tribal government as \u201celective public offices.\u201d No doubt the Crow Tribe will be surprised, if not insulted, to learn that its government and its elective public offices are not on the same par as Montana\u2019s. Again, I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">\u00b680 Third, it is now apparently lawful for a sitting Montana justice of the peace, at least, to hold both his or her tribal executive office and his or her Montana judicial office at the same time. This holding perverts another fundamental principle of judicial ethics and conduct enshrined in Article III, Section 1 (Separation of Powers) and Article VII, Section lOmamely, that one cannot serve two masters. AMontana judge or justice cannot serve the master of the judicial branch and the master of the legislative or executive branch at the same time. A judge or justice owes his or her exclusive loyalty and obligation of duty to one branch of government-the judicial branch-4o the exclusion of any loyalty or obligation of duty to either of the other two branches. That is what the doctrine of separation of powers and the prohibition of Article VII, Section 10, read together, require. That fundamental, core principle is written into the 2008 Montana Code of Judicial Conduct, in the Preamble and Rules 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, and 3.2-demanding the independence, impartiality, and integrity of the judiciary, and eschewing any appearances of impropriety and conflicts of interest. A sitting Montana judge cannot possibly serve simultaneously as aj publicly elected official in another branch of government, much less inj another sovereign government, and comply with the Constitution and! the Code of Judicial Conduct. A sitting Montana judge cannot owe his! or her professional allegiance to two different sovereigns. He or she! cannot serve two masters-until today. Again, I cannot agree. \u00a3</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\u00b681 In sum, I would hold that the JSC had no jurisdiction over thisl action, and I would dismiss the case on this basis. But as to the merit J of the JSC\u2019s complaint, which the Court proceeds to address, I would! hold that Not Afraid forfeited his judicial position on March 6, 2009| when he filed for the office of Crow Tribal Chairman and that hiJ judicial office has been vacant since that date. I would further hole! that any judicial act which Not Afraid performed during his unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>tenure is, therefore, void <em>ab initio.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finally, I would order that his successor be appointed in accordance with applicable law. Again, I cannot agree with our contrary approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">\u00b682 Today\u2019s decision establishes bad policy, bad precedent, and a bad result. I cannot agree. I have no doubt that Montana\u2019s judges will be shocked by the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\u00b683 I concur in the result but dissent from the reasoning.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-11\"> The composition of the JSC was later amended to be <em>two </em>district judges, one ;omey, and <em>two </em>laypersons. <em>See id. </em>at 1126.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> I believe the JSC also compensated Keller for his time and trouble on behaUj his client, the JSC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> It is unfortunate that this Court, itself, did not intervene in this matter at tf point.
