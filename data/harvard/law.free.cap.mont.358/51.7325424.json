We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b63 <em>I. Whether Brooks\u2019s sentence violates the prohibition on double jeopardy under the Montana Constitution (Article II, section 25); and</em></p>\n<p id=\"At\">\u00b64 <em>II. Whether the District Court erred by not holding a hearing (pursuant to \u00a746-13-108(3), MCA) to determine the truth of allegations on which Brooks\u2019s PFO status was predicated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u00b65 The issues on appeal center on sentencing, but some additional background is necessary. In September 2007 Brooks was pulled over and arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). The State charged Brooks, <em>inter alia, </em>for DUI.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This was a felony charge because Brooks had more than three prior DUI convictions. Before trial the State filed notice of its intent to seek enhanced punishment against Brooks as a PFO on account of a 2004 conviction for assault with a weapon (a felony). The case went to trial, and Brooks was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">\u00b66 For the felony DUI conviction, the District Court sentenced Brooks to five years of incarceration (all suspended) and a thirteen-month commitment to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for placement in a specific alcohol-treatment program, WATCh (Warm Springs Addictions Treatment and Change). Under the PFO statute, the court sentenced Brooks to ten additional years of incarceration, with five suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">\u00b67 Brooks appealed his conviction. This Court dismissed the appeal as wholly frivolous. Brooks subsequently moved the District Court to clarify his sentence because he believed that the personnel at the Montana State Prison and DOC were attempting to illegally extend his sentence. Over opposition from the State, the District Court amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the sentence, replacing the specific reference to WATCh with a general thirteen-month commitment to DOC. Also, tracking the language of \u00a761-8-731(l)(a), MCA, the court added that upon completion of an approved treatment program, Brooks would serve the remainder of the commitment on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b68 Brooks then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus (or in the alternative, mandamus) with this Court to challenge the amended sentence. In an order, we concluded that the sentence, as amended, was ambiguous and remanded the case to the District Court to clarify the sentence to comply with the law. On remand the State argued that the District Court should sentence Brooks under the PFO statute only. Brooks, representing himself, countered that the District Court should dismiss the PFO sentence, modify his sentence for felony DUI to a thirteen-month commitment to DOC with two years suspended, and credit him with time served. Brooks advanced that a PFO sentence would violate the constitutional bar on double jeopardy. He also challenged the constitutionality of the prior assault conviction that served as the predicate for the PFO designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b69 Adopting the State\u2019s position, the District Court sentenced Brooks exclusively under the PFO statute to ten years at MSP with five suspended and recommended that the DOC place Brooks in an alcohol treatment program prior to releasing him on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b610 On appeal, Brooks once more challenges his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u00b611 A double jeopardy claim presents a question of constitutional law over which we exercise plenary review. <em>State v. Dodson, </em>2009 MT 419, \u00b6 31, 354 Mont. 28, 221 P.3d 687. The question of whether a district court followed the proper procedure in designating a criminal defendant as a PFO is a question of statutory interpretation, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>2005 MT 336, \u00b6 16, 330 Mont. 65, 125 P.3d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">\u00b612 <em>I. Whether Brooks\u2019s sentence violates the prohibition on double jeopardy under the Montana Constitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">\u00b613 Brooks contends that his sentence violates the Montana Constitution\u2019s bar against double jeopardy. Relying on <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312, Brooks advances that the District Court unconstitutionally enhanced his sentence twice on account of prior convictions. This argument does not withstand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b614 The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution reads: \u2018lN]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d This bar against double jeopardy Vas designed to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense.\u201d <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187, 78 S. Ct. 221, 223 (1957). Among other things, this bar protects against multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 129, 101 S. Ct. 426, 433 (1980). Nevertheless, the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected double jeopardy challenges to recidivism statutes and recognized recidivism as a generally legitimate basis for enhanced punishment-% stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.\u201d <em>Witte v. United States, </em>515 U.S. <em>389, </em>400, 115 S. Ct. 2199, 2206 (1995) (quoting <em>Gryger </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>334 U.S. 728, 732, 68 S. Ct. 1256, 1258 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b615 Article II, section 25 of the Montana Constitution (on which Brooks\u2019s challenge rests) reads: \u2018No person shall be again put in jeopardy for the same offense previously tried in any jurisdiction.\u201dWe have construed this provision to provide greater protection to criminal defendants than does the analogous clause in the federal constitution. <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, \u00b6 13, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312. Specifically, we have interpreted this provision to exemplify \u201cthe legal and moral concept that no person should suffer twice for a single act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17. Nevertheless, like our federal counterpart, we recognize the general legitimacy of enhanced punishment for recidivism. <em>State v. Shults, </em>2006 MT 100, 332 Mont. 130, 136 P.3d 507. The resolution of the present case lies in its crucial dissimilarity with <em>Guillaume.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATe\">\u00b616 In <em>Guillaume </em>the defendant (Guillaume) threatened the victim with a raised hammer. <em>Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 3. The State charged Guillaume with felony assault (\u00a745-5-202(b), MCA, (1995)) because he used a weapon (the hammer). <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. The jury convicted Guillaume. <em>Id. </em>The district court then sentenced him to ten years in prison for the felony assault. <em>Id. </em>It then sentenced him to an additional five years under the weapon enhancement statute (\u00a746-18-221(1), MCA (1995)) because Guillaume used a dangerous weapon (the hammer). <em>Id. </em>The issue on appeal was whether this violated double jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 2. We held that it did: \u2018f Application of the weapon enhancement statute to felony convictions where the underlying offense requires proof of the use of a weapon violates the double jeopardy provision . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u00b6 16. Applying the general principle that \u201cno person should suffer twice for a single act,\u201d the Court explained that Guillaume\u2019s use of the hammer was the predicate for both the enhancement of his charge from misdemeanor to felony assault and the additional sentence under the weapon enhancement statute. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. This was an impermissible double punishment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b617  Unlike <em>Guillaume, </em>the two sentence \u201cenhancements\u201d of which Brooks complains (felony DUI, and PFO) were not predicated on the same act. The State charged Brooks with felony DUI because Brooks had more than three prior DUI convictions. The State then sought an enhanced sentence for Brooks as a PFO on account of his prior felony conviction for assault with a weapon. While the enhanced charge of felony DUI and the enhanced PFO sentence were both based on Brooks\u2019s recidivism, they were not based on the same prior conviction. Therefore the double jeopardy rule from <em>Guillaume </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"AfJ\">\u00b618  Brooks\u2019s sentence does not violate the Montana Constitution\u2019s bar on double jeopardy. An enhanced sentence under \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA, does not supplement, but supplants the sentence for the underlying felony. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 54, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74 (Aug. 16, 2010). As such, it does not constitute a double punishment subject to the double jeopardy bar. <em>See Shults, </em>\u00b6 26 (explaining that \u2018PFO statutes ... do not constitute double jeopardy because \u2018[a] sentence as an habitual offender criminal is not to be viewed as a new jeopardy.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>State v. Wardell, </em>2005 MT 252, \u00b6 19, 329 Mont. 9, 122 P.3d 443)). This Court has also held that a felony DUI conviction under \u00a761-8-731, MCA, is a legitimate trigger for a PFO designation. <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 40, 328 Mont. 276, 119 P.3d 1194. Here, however, the District Court only sentenced Brooks as a PFO pursuant \u00a746-18-502, MCA. This enhanced sentence was predicated on Brooks\u2019s conviction for felony DUI and his prior felony conviction for assault with a weapon. While the sentence was certainly harsher than it would have been if Brooks had had no prior felony conviction, the legislature at present has determined that such punishment is the proper means of dealing with repeat offenders. Brooks\u2019s sentence as a PFO here does not violate the double jeopardy bar of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b619 <em>II. Whether the District Court erred by not holding a hearing to determine the truth of allegations on which Brooks\u2019s PFO status was predicated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b620 Brooks next argues that he should have received a hearing to dispute the validity of the assault with a weapon conviction that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the basis of his PFO designation. This argument merits only brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b621 To seek PFO treatment of a criminal defendant, a prosecutor must file notice to do so \u201cat or before the omnibus hearing.\u201d Section 46-13-108(1), MCA. The notice must state the prior felony convictions on which the request for PFO treatment is premised. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a746-13-108(1). If a defendant objects to the allegations in the notice (i.e., challenges the alleged prior felonies), \u201cthe judge shall conduct a hearing to determine if the allegations in the notice are true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a746-13-108. While this statute expressly states a deadline by which the prosecutor must file the notice to seek PFO treatment, it provides no pre-sentencing deadline by which the defendant must object to the designation of prior felonies. Nevertheless, we have held that when a defendant, subsequent to sentencing, makes his request for a hearing for the first time on appeal, it is too late. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>2005 MT 336, \u00b6\u00b6 30-33, 330 Mont. 65, 125 P.3d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b622 Here, Brooks did not even challenge the prior assault with a weapon conviction until after his post-conviction habeas corpus petition-well after his initial sentence and appeal. It matters not that Brooks raised the issue on remand after we concluded that the sentence initially imposed by the District Comet was not legal. When, in response to Brooks\u2019s petition for habeas relief, we remanded to the District Court, we did not remand for resentencing. Instead we remanded the case with the specific instruction that the District Court clarify or modify Brooks\u2019s sentence (which had improperly blended \u00a746-13-502, MCA, and \u00a761-8-731, MCA). The District Court properly clarified the matter by sentencing Brooks solely under \u00a7 46-13-502, MCA. The District Court was not required to hold a hearing on Brooks\u2019s challenge to his prior felony conviction at this late date. \u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b78-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-12\"> The State also charged Brooks for two misdemeanors, operating a motor vehicle the wrong way on a one-way street and failure to carry proof of liability insurance. These charges are irrelevant to the present appeal and will not be addressed further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
