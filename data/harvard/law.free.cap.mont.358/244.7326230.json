We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">\u00b62 In March, 2008, the State charged Ferris with felony distribution of dangerous drags after he sold hydrocodone to an undercover informant. Law enforcement officers electronically monitored the transaction through a body wire worn by the informant. The monitoring was not authorized by a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\u00b63 The State filed notice of its intent to treat Ferris as a persistent felony offender based upon a prior felony drug conviction. Ferris, with representation by counsel, subsequently pled guilty to felony criminal distribution of dangerous drugs. He executed a document captioned \u201cAcknowledgement of Waiver of Rights by Plea of Guilty\u201d in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>acknowledged, among other things, that the plea was voluntary and that \u201cI fully understand what I am doing.\u201d His attorney signed a separate certification that Ferris had been advised of his rights to go to trial and that he was voluntarily entering the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b64 Ferris also executed a written plea agreement which provided in part that \u201c[e]ach party understands and agrees that a plea of GUILTY entered to any charge pursuant to this agreement cannot be subsequently withdrawn.\u201d The State agreed to recommend a ten-year sentence at the Montana State Prison with five years suspended, to run concurrently with Ferris\u2019 sentence for his prior conviction. The State also agreed to not seek designation as a persistent felony offender, even though Ferris had numerous prior felony convictions. \u00b65 The District Court conducted a change of plea hearing on August 7, 2008. The District Court examined Ferris in detail as to his understanding of the plea agreement and of the rights he waived by pleading guilty. Ferris testified that he was pleading guilty voluntarily and that he understood the proceedings. The District Court specifically inquired into the factual basis for the plea. Ferris acknowledged that he sold drugs to an undercover informant who was wearing an electronic transmitting device. The District Court accepted Ferris\u2019 guilty plea. At a subsequent sentencing hearing Ferris\u2019 attorney noted that Ferris was \u201cwilling to enter into this [plea agreement] rather quickly so that he can get this resolved, which I think is a benefit to the State and to all of us.\u201d The District Court sentenced Ferris according to the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b66 After Ferris entered his guilty plea but before he was sentenced this Court decided <em>State v. Goetz, </em>2008 MT 296, 345 Mont. 421, 191 P.3d 489. That case held that a search warrant was required for electronic monitoring of a defendant\u2019s conversations with an informant in his home notwithstanding the informant\u2019s consent. Neither the attorneys nor the District Court mentioned <em>Goetz </em>at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b67 In May, 2009, Ferris requested appointment of counsel to raise <em>Goetz </em>issues. The Public Defender appeared for Ferris and on June 29, 2009, filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea so that Ferris could seek suppression of the surveillance evidence based upon <em>Goetz. </em>After briefing, the District Court denied the motion to withdraw the plea based primarily upon Ferris\u2019 failure to raise any <em>Goetz </em>issue prior to sentencing. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b68  A district court may permit a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea upon good cause, \u00a746-16-105(2), MCA. An involuntary plea can justify withdrawal, but is not the only basis for establishing good cause. <em>State v. Wise, </em>2009 MT 32, \u00b6 9, 349 Mont. 187, 203 P.3d 741. Good cause analysis has been based upon the adequacy of the district court\u2019s interrogation at the time the plea was entered; the promptness with which the defendant attempts to withdraw the plea; and whether the plea resulted from a plea bargain in which the guilty plea was given in exchange for dismissal of another charge. <em>State v. Boucher, </em>2002 MT 114, \u00b6 25, 309 Mont. 514, 48 P.3d 21. The fundamental purpose of allowing withdrawal of a plea is to guard against conviction of an innocent person. <em>Id. </em>This Court reviews a denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea de novo. <em>State v. Usery, </em>2009 MT 227, \u00b6 12, 351 Mont. 341, 212 P.3d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b69 <em>Issue 1: Whether the District Court erred by denying Ferris\u2019 motion to withdraw his guilty plea. </em>This case is controlled by our recent decision in <em>State v. Andrews, </em>2010 MT 154, 357 Mont. 52, 236 P.3d 574. In that case this Court held that a guilty plea is made on the basis of the law applicable at the time the plea is accepted by the district court, and that the plea may not be withdrawn if a later judicial decision changes the law. <em>Andrews, </em>\u00b6 12. The <em>Goetz </em>decision that changed the law here was decided after Ferris entered his guilty plea, and therefore does not provide the necessary good cause for withdrawing the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"Ato\">\u00b610  Ferris argues in his reply brief on appeal that notwithstanding <em>Andrews, </em>his guilty plea was not voluntary or \u201cat the very least, the fact that he was not informed of <em>Goetz </em>undermines the voluntariness of his plea.\u201dAs noted above, the written plea agreement as well as the colloquy conducted by the District Court at the time the plea was accepted clearly indicated that the plea was entered voluntarily. In addition, he admitted he sold drugs to an undercover informant and he received the benefit of the plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The basis for Ferris\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>argument is the assertion that Ferris\u2019 trial attorney had the obligation to advise him that the <em>Goetz </em>appeal was pending but undecided at the time of his guilty plea. Ferris cites no law in support of this proposition. We decline to adopt a standard that requires trial counsel to be aware of the issues in all cases pending on appeal, and to advise clients on how each of those cases might affect his situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b611  <em>Issue 2: Whether Ferris\u2019 attorney provided ineffective assistance. </em>Ferris contends that his attorney provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise the <em>Goetz </em>issue at the time of sentencing and that no record review is necessary because no plausible justification exists for the failure to do so. This Court reviews ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the principles set out in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). The defendant must establish that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Baca v. State, </em>2008 MT 371, \u00b6 16, 346 Mont. 474, 197 P.3d 948. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient if it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 20, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. The defendant must overcome a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s actions were within a broad range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Baca, </em>\u00b6 17. The defendant must demonstrate prejudice by showing a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b612  Ferris\u2019 attorney could have asserted <em>Goetz </em>as a ground for withdrawing the guilty plea at the time of the sentencing, assuming that Ferris would have chosen to try to withdraw his plea at that time. However, the District Court could have denied a motion to withdraw on the ground that the plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered, and could have decided, as this Court did in <em>Andrews, </em>that a change in the case law is not a sufficient ground for withdrawing a plea. So, while Ferris\u2019 attorney could have raised <em>Goetz </em>at the time of sentencing, Ferris cannot demonstrate prejudice or that there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different and that he would be allowed to withdraw his plea. Absent a conclusion that the result would have been different, we cannot determine that Ferris\u2019 attorney was ineffective for failing to raise <em>Goetz </em>at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\"> As in <em>Andrews, </em>even if <em>Goetz </em>applied to Ferris\u2019 case, the State could still have had evidence to convict based upon the testimony of the confidential informant, the drugs recovered and the observations of the officers. Ferris argues on appeal that there was \u2018ho indication in the record that the Cl ever agreed to testify\u201d and that it is unlikely that the Cl would be called as a witness. To the contrary, the Information charging Ferris with the offense specifically listed the Cl as a witness for the State and nothing appears to indicate that the Cl would not or could not testify. <em>See State v. Schwartz, </em>2009 MT 234, 351 Mont. 384, 212 P.3d 1060.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"A2O\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b614 I dissent. I would conclude that Ferris\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to timely raise <em>Goetz </em>in an effort to withdraw Ferris\u2019s guilty plea, and would reverse and remand to allow Ferris to renew his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b615 The majority concludes that this case is controlled by our decision in <em>State v. Andrews, </em>2010 MT 154, 357 Mont. 52, 236 P.3d 574 (Leaphart, Cotter &amp; Nelson, JJ., dissenting). In <em>Andrews, </em>we held that a court decision which changes the law, and which is rendered after a defendant voluntarily changes his plea to guilty, does not provide the necessary good cause for withdrawing a guilty plea. <em>Andrews, </em>\u00b6 12. In dissent, Justices Leaphart and Cotter argued that, under <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 19, 326 Mont. 214, 108 P.3d 500, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Brison, </em>2009 MT 200, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 136, 210 P.3d 164, \u2018intervening circumstances or any other reason for [a defendant] withdrawing his guilty plea that did not exist when he pleaded guilty\u201d constituted good cause for withdrawing a plea, and that a change in the law occurring after a change of plea was just such a circumstance justifying the withdrawal of the guilty plea. <em>Andrews, </em>\u00b6 17 (Leaphart &amp; Cotter, JJ., dissenting). Justice Nelson, writing separately, opined that \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S. Ct. 708, 716 (1987)), and that because Andrews\u2019 conviction was not yet final when the new rule was announced, there was \u201cgood cause\u201dfor him to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b616 I appreciate that the foregoing analyses in <em>Andrews </em>were minority positions. I submit, however, that our recent decision in <em>State v. Reichmand, </em>2010 MT 228, 358 Mont. 68, 243 P.3d 423, underscores the correctness of the minority positions in <em>Andrews </em>and compels us to reverse Ferris\u2019s conviction and remand to allow Ferris to raise <em>Goetz </em>and <em>Reichmand </em>in support of a renewed motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b617 In <em>Reichmand, </em>Reichmand was found guilty of two counts of criminal endangerment. <em>Reichmand, </em>\u00b6 1. At trial, the jury heard the taped conversations of a confidential informant (Cl) buying drugs from Reichmand, thanks to a warrantless recording of those conversations arranged by a drug task force. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3. After the verdict but before sentencing, our decision in <em>Goetz </em>came down, and in response, Reichmand filed a motion to set aside the jury verdict. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>District Court denied the motion, concluding that because Reichmand failed to assert a Goefe-type claim prior to or during trial, he was not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to the defendant in <em>Goetz, </em>as required under our decision in <em>State v. Foster-DeBerry, </em>2008 MT 397, 347 Mont. 164, 197 P.3d 1004. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b618 On appeal in <em>Reichmand, </em>we reversed, and in so doing, overruled <em>Foster-DeBerry. Reichmand, </em>\u00b6 11. We concluded that one need not have objected below in order to gain the retroactive benefit of a new rule of criminal procedure. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12. We endorsed the retroactivity principles announced in <em>State v. Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. 114, 125, 900 P.2d 260, 267 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Montana v. Egelhoff, </em>518 U.S. 37, 116, S. Ct. 2013 (1996), and argued by Justice Nelson in his <em>Andrews </em>Dissent at \u00b6 26, to the effect that \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state and federal, pending on direct review or not yet final.\u201d <em>Reichmand, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 125, 900 P.2d at 267).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b619 As the Court notes, Ferris had pled guilty but had not yet been sentenced when we announced our decision in <em>Goetz. Supra </em>\u00b6 6. Thus, his conviction was at that point \u2018hot yet final.\u201d The Court here concludes that although his counsel could have raised <em>Goetz </em>in an effort to withdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing, his failure to do so is not ineffective assistance, as the District Court <em>could have </em>denied the motion in any event. <em>Supra </em>\u00b6 12. Respectfully, I disagree with the Court\u2019s logic. Had Ferris\u2019s attorney timely raised <em>Goetz </em>in an effort to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing, there is surely a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different, as it is evident from its order that the District Court considered Ferris\u2019s failure to raise <em>Goetz </em>prior to sentencing critical to its decision to deny the later motion to withdraw the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b620 The implications of <em>Goetz </em>undermine the voluntariness of Ferris\u2019s plea, and establish the requisite \u201cgood cause\u201dfor withdrawal of a guilty plea under \u00a746-16-105(2), MCA. As we have held, any doubts as to whether good cause exists to withdraw a guilty plea should be resolved in favor of a trial on the merits. <em>State v. Tweed, </em>2002 MT 286, \u00b6 25, 312 Mont. 482,59 P.3d 1105, <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>State <em>v. Deserly, </em>2008 MT 242, \u00b6 12 n. 1, 344 Mont. 468, 188 P.3d 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b621 I would conclude that in failing to raise <em>Goetz </em>in support of a timely motion to withdraw his guilty plea before Ferris was sentenced, Ferris\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Given that the <em>Goetz </em>decision was potentially dispositive of Ferris\u2019s case and widely heralded among attorneys and in the press, it strains credulity that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Ferris\u2019s counsel would not have known of it or understood its implications for his client. In this connection, I would conclude that because there was no plausible justification for counsel\u2019s failure to raise <em>Goetz </em>and its binding warrant requirement before sentencing, the error is reviewable on direct appeal. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095. <em>See also Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Lawhorn v. Allen, </em>519 F.3d 1272, 1275 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u2018Tactical or strategic decisions based on a misunderstanding of the law are unreasonable.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b622 Finally, for the reasons implicit in this argument, I would further conclude that Ferris was prejudiced by this failure. Thus, the requisites of <em>Strickland </em>are met here. While the Court is correct that there is no guarantee Ferris would have ultimately been successful in his efforts to withdraw his plea, all that is needed under <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Baca </em>is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Baca, </em>\u00b6 17. That reasonable possibility exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b623 I would reverse Ferris\u2019s conviction and sentence on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, and remand to allow counsel to raise <em>Goetz </em>and <em>Reichmand </em>in support of a renewed motion to withdraw Ferris\u2019s guilty plea. I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-6\">JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART join in the Dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
