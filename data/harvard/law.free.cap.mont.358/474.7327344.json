Stevens alleged that Novartis failed to properly warn that its drug, Zometa, causes osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in patients who undergo dental surgery while taking the drug. The District Court [denied Novartis\u2019 motions for summary judgment, ruled against [Novartis on several evidentiary issues, and denied post-trial motions [for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. Novartis appeals [these rulings. Stevens cross-appeals, claiming that the trial court erred [in denying Stevens permission to file an amended complaint, in [dismissing a Novartis sales representative from the action, and in offsetting social security disability benefits against the jury award.</p>\n<p id=\"AYK\">H2 We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u25a0Q3 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">114 <em>1.

At the time, Stevens served as the house supervisor at Community Medical Center, where she had been employed for nearly 20 years. In Apr! 2002, Dr. Schmidt prescribed Novartis\u2019 drug Zometa to Stevens after finding lymphoma in Stevens\u2019 spine, pelvis and ribs. Zometa, like oth\u00ae drugs in the 'bisphosphonate\u201d family, is administered intravenously to cancer patients who are at risk of bone fractures and other bone related problems due to cancer-weakened skeletal systems. Zomet; works by attacking cells called \u201costeoclasts\u201dthat normally dissolve old bone, which has the result of hardening bones to make them mon resilient. At the time Dr. Schmidt prescribed Zometa to Stevens h April 2002, the drug had only recently been approved by the FederaB Drug Administration (FDA), and no serious reports of any negativB side effects had arisen. B</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">\u00b614 Experts soon began to take note, however, of the large number cfl ONJ patients who were also taking bisphosphonates. Several monthfl after Stevens began taking Zometa, Dr. Robert Marx, a leadinfl national expert, published an award-winning medical textbook whicfl first mentioned the possible link between ONJ and bisphosphonatefl Novartis responded in September 2003 by changing the Zometa labfl to include a mention of ONJ, stating that \u201ccases of [ONJ], primarily cfl the jaws, have been reported since market introduction.\u201dThe label alsfl stated, however, that ONJ has \u201cother well-documented risk factorsfl and \u201cit is not possible to determine if [cases of ONJ] are related ifl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Zometa.\u201d The label pointed to chemotherapy and smoking as the more likely and more well-established canses of ONJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\">\u00b615 Dr. Marx continued to sound the alarm, writing of a \u201cgrowing epidemic\u201d of ONJ in bisphosphonate patients. In December 2003, Novartis convened an advisory panel on the subject in coordination with the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The panel included Dr. Marx and another expert, Dr. Salvatore Ruggiero, who had echoed Dr. Marx\u2019s reports of ONJ-bisphosphonate linkage. In March 2004, a second panel was convened at Novartis headquarters, again with Dr. Marx, Dr. Ruggiero, and other leading national figures present. A main goal of this second panel was to draft a \u201cwhite paper\u201d on the topic, which was eventually published in June 2004. The white paper was met with heavy criticism from Dr. Marx and others. They asserted that the paper failed to admit the clear causal relationship between bisphosphonates and ONJ, and that it misleadingly identified other factors such as chemotherapy and smoking as the more likely causes of ONJ in bisphosphonate patients. In the same month the paper was released, Novartis again changed its Zometa label, adding that the majority of reported cases of ONJ were \u2018in cancer patients attendant to a dental procedure\u201d and advising that \u201calthough causality cannot be determined, it is prudent to avoid dental surgery as recovery may be prolonged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">|\u00b616 Stevens continued visiting Guardian Oncology for treatment, although her relationship with Dr. Schmidt no longer included active consultation. Instead, Stevens interacted with the nursing staff and visiting physicians at the clinic. She began having pain in her jaw in [August 2004, and was subsequently advised that her tooth was \u00a1cracked and she would need to have surgery to remedy the problem. \u00a1Stevens called Guardian Oncology on August 31, 2004, in connection \u00a1with the upcoming dental procedure. She advised clinic staff and locum jtenens physicians that she needed to have dental work done and was planning on having her tooth extracted (a much less expensive procedure than alternative possibilities such as root canal therapy and Irown lengthening) in the near future. No concerns regarding ONJ |vere raised, and Stevens made an appointment with Dr. Eugene Ivlorris, an oral surgeon, for the procedure. Dr. Morris was unaware \u25a0hat Stevens was taking Zometa, but testified that even if he had \u25a0mown, it would not have made a difference as he was unaware of the lelationship between Zometa and ONJ until 2006. Dr. Morris performed the extraction on September 27, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">17 Within days, Stevens began having additional pain at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>extraction site. She went on an antibiotic regimen, but the pain failed to abate. Stevens reported the continuing problem to Dr. Schmidt, who ordered an MRI in early 2005. The MRI suggested that Stevens had contracted ONJ, which was confirmed by further testing. Stevens stopped taking Zometa around this time, although the drug was still present in her body as it has a half-life of over a decade. While Stevens\u2019 ONJ continued to develop into a serious problem, her cancer was in remission, as it has been ever since. In October 2006, exposed bone first became visible at the extraction site. In April 2007, Stevens took what was intended to be a temporary break from work, but could not return to work without pain medication. Because Community Hospital requires its employees to abstain from all narcotics while on duty, however, Stevens was forced to abandon her position. She has been out of work ever since. ONJ has no cure and is progressive, and thus Stevens\u2019 condition will only deteriorate as more of her jawbone dies Like all ONJ patients, Stevens suffers from chronic pain and constant infection, and manages her condition with antiseptic mouthwash, antibiotics, and powerful narcotics for pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b618 The growing recognition of a link between ONJ and bisphosphonates caused reverberations in the courtroom as well as the medical community. On September 15, 2005, three class action suit: were filed against Novartis in federal court in Tennessee. In one o: these suits, <em>Susan Becker, et al. v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>No. 3:05-0719 (M.D. Tenn.), counsel for the named plaintiffs sought to represen a worldwide class of plaintiffs who contracted ONJ after using Zometa] The suit alleged failure to warn, among other claims, and sough damages for personal injuries. Class certification was eventual! denied and claims were ordered severed on November 14,2007. Durinj the pendency of the suit, the linkage between bisphosphonates, denta| surgery, and ONJ had become widely accepted. Novartis had lonj since sent a \u2018Dear Doctor\u2019Tetter to doctors regarding Zometa and othe: bisphosphonates, admitting that the ONJ-bisphosphonate link was n| longer an unproven hypothesis, but rather an established medic conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b619 In August 2007, Stevens brought an action against Dr. Schmii and Dr. Morris before the Montana Medical Legal Panel (MMLPj alleging failure to warn of the risk of contracting ONJ as a result dental surgery while on Zometa. Dr. Schmidt responded that she di| not have knowledge of these risks, and Dr. Morris responded th\u00a1 there were no other feasible options available to Stevens. In Janua: 2008, after the conclusion of the MMLP proceedings, Stevens filed s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>in Missoula County District Court against Dr. Schmidt, Guardian Oncology, and several fictitious defendants, claiming that they knew of the risk of ONJ but negligently failed to warn her. Stevens substituted Novartis and its sales representative, Patrick Doyle, for the fictitious defendants named in the complaint in January 2009. Novartis immediately raised a statute of limitations defense and moved for summary judgment. The District Court denied Novartis\u2019 motion on the basis that the complaint was timely filed as to the fictitious defendants, and that Novartis had failed to show that it was not properly substituted. Novartis had failed to show that the substitution was improper, explained the court, because \u201cthe nature of Novartis\u2019 alleged culpability may have been unknown at the time of Plaintiff s original complaint.\u201d A protective and confidentiality order was entered in May 2009, and the case proceeded to discovery. Stevens settled her claims against Dr. Schmidt and Guardian Oncology in June 2009, and they were dismissed from the case in July. Numerous motions were filed refining the scope of issues at trial. The parties were both denied leave to amend the pleadings, and additional cross-motions seeking to postpone the trial date were denied as well. Novartis again moved for summary judgment on its statute of limitations defense, but was again denied. The case proceeded to trial on October 13, 2009, before the Hon. John Larson.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\">\u00b620 Eight days later, a Missoula County jury returned a verdict of $3,200,000.00 in Stevens\u2019 favor. Ahearing on potential offsets was held in January 2010, after which the District Court entered an order reducing the award to $2,657,257.32. The offsets included the amount Stevens received in settlement with Dr. Schmidt and Guardian Oncology, the amount she received in short-term disability for six months in 2007, and the social security disability benefits she had received and would receive in the future. Stevens was awarded her costs. Novartis filed post-trial motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law, which were denied. Novartis timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b621 We held oral argument on September 23, 2010, directing the parties\u2019 attention to two issues: Stevens\u2019 alleged statute of limitations violation and Novartis\u2019 duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">|\u00b622 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for pummary judgment de novo. <em>State v.

Whether the District Court erred in denying Novartis\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b626 Novartis has strenuously argued over the life of this litigation that Stevens\u2019 claims are time-barred. Montana\u2019s three-year statute oi limitations for personal injury actions, \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, ostensibly began to run on March 18, 2005, when Stevens was first informed she had ONJ as a result of undergoing dental surgery while taking Zometa. Stevens filed a timely complaint in January 2008 against Dr.B Schmidt, Guardian Oncology, and John Does one through four. SheH amended the complaint to substitute Novartis for one of the fictitious defendants in January 2009, three years and 10 months after ths statute of limitations began to run. Stevens maintains that Novartis was timely served because parties who are fictitiously named pursuant to \u00a7 25-5-103, MCA, are considered part of the action from itsfl inception. M. R. Civ. P. 4(E)(2). Novartis counters that the fictitious name statute applies only when the plaintiff is unaware of thfl defendant\u2019s identity. Given that Stevens was fully aware of Novartis name and that Zometa had caused or contributed to her ONJ, NovartiH contends, she cannot escape her failure to timely name Novartis as J9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">\u00b627 In the alternative, Stevens argues that the statute of limitations was tolled by the <em>Becker </em>class action suit. In this suit, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sought class certification for a worldwide class of patients who took Zometa and later contracted ONJ. <em>Becker, </em>No. 3:05-0719 (M.D. Tenn.). The suit contained claims for strict product liability and negligence for failure to warn doctors and consumers of the danger of Zometa-induced ONJ. Plaintiffs sought medical monitoring, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. The suit was pending from September 15, 2005, until November 14, 2007, when the district court denied class certification and ordered that the claims be severed and individual amended complaints filed. Stevens asserts that because the <em>Becker </em>class action contained a request for worldwide class certification, and contained a claim for failure to warn against the dangers of Zometa-induced ONJ, the statute of limitations was tolled as to Stevens, along with all other potential class members, under the \u201cclass action tolling\u201d rule. Because the statute of limitations was tolled for over two years during the pendency of the <em>Becker </em>class action, argues Stevens, the amended complaint was timely filed as to Novartis regardless of whether it relates back to the original complaint via the fictitious name statute. Novartis replies that the class action tolling rule ought not apply to the current situation for a variety of reasons, most notably that the class action suit in question was filed in a different jurisdiction than the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">28 In reviewing the District Court\u2019s conclusions on whether Stevens\u2019 laims are barred by the statute of limitations, we are mindful that we ill uphold a district court when it reaches the correct result, egardless of the court\u2019s reasoning. <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 37, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615. Thus, we will uphold the District ourt here if we find that Novartis was properly substituted as a ctitious defendant <em>or </em>that the limitations period was tolled during the endency of the <em>Becker </em>class action suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">29 After careful consideration of the principles at issue, we are ersuaded that the class action tolling rule logically applies here. We |hus conclude that Stevens\u2019 amended complaint was timely filed. We ill therefore not reach the issue of whether Novartis was properly lubstituted for a fictitious defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b630 Class action tolling is a matter of first impression in Montana. The octrine was first established by the United States Supreme Court in e landmark <em>case American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co. v. Utah, </em>414 U.S. 538, 94 S. Ct. 756 (1974). In <em>American Pipe, </em>several companies were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>accused of antitrust violations for the alleged price-fixing of steel and concrete pipe projects, and faced both criminal and civil complaints filed by the federal government. After the conclusion of the criminal case and the filing of a consent judgment in the civil case, the State of Utah filed suit, professing to represent a class consisting of various state and local governmental bodies damaged by the companies\u2019 price-fixing scheme. Utah\u2019s suit was filed in federal district court within eleven days of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Seven months later, the court denied class certification, concluding that the class was not so numerous as to be impracticable-fehus failing the numerosity requirement for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). When more than 60 governmental bodies that had been claimed as members of the original class filed motions to intervene as plaintiffs eight days after class action status was denied, the court denied their motion on the basis that the statute of limitations had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b631 The Ninth Circuit reversed. It concluded that \u201cas to the members of the class Utah purported to represent, and whose claims it tenderec to the court, suit was actually commenced by Utah\u2019s filing,\u201dreasoning that \u201c[t]he claims of appellants were then before the court and the only question was as to the manner in which they should be entertained o: the merits.\u201d <em>Utah v. American Pipe &amp; Constr. Co., </em>473 F.2d 580, 584 (9th Cir. 1973). The United States Supreme Court granted certiorar| to \u201cconsider a seemingly important question affecting thi administration of justice in the federal courts.\u201d <em>American Pipe, </em>414 U.S. at 545, 94 S. Ct. at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b632 The Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit, holding that \u201cthi commencement of the [class action suit] satisfied the purpose of th] limitation provision as to all those who might subsequently participat] in the suit as well as for the named plaintiffs.\u201d The Court pinned itj reasoning on the furtherance of judicial economy. \u2018To hold to thi contrary,\u201d the Court opined, would invite \u201cprecisely the multiplicity o] activity\u201d that the federal rules of procedure were designed to avoid, individual plaintiffs would be forced to file preventative motions to joi or intervene as parties if the class action status was still pending the expiration of the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 551, 94 S. Ct. at 76 Furthermore, continued the Court, \u201cno different a standard shou apply to those members of the class who did not rely upon ti commencement of the class action (or who were even unaware th; such a suit existed),\u201d and who thus \u201ccannot claim that they refraine| from bringing timely motions for individual intervention or joind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>because of a belief that their interests would be represented in the class suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned that \u201c[n]ot until the existence and limits of the class have been established and notice of membership has been sent does a class member have any duty to take note of the suit or to exercise any responsibility with respect to it,\u201d and thus, it would be illogical to require active participation before such point for other purposes such as class action tolling. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 94 S. Ct. at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\">\u00b633 The Court also noted that class action tolling \u2018is in no way inconsistent with the functional operation of a statute of limitations.\u201d The Court explained that limitation periods are designed to ensure justice by preventing surprise, but no surprise exists where defendants are already on notice of the substantive claims being brought against them, as they may be when a class action suit has been filed. <em>Id. </em>at 554-55, 94 S. Ct. at 766-67. \u201cWithin the period set by the statute of limitations,\u201d the Court concluded, \u201cthe defendants have the essential information necessary to determine both the subject matter and size of the prospective litigation, whether the actual trial is conducted in the form of a class action [or not].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 94 S. Ct. at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b634 Recognizing that it was stepping into unknown territory, the Court limited its holding to instances in which the plaintiffs seek to <em>intervene </em>in a class action where class certification has been denied. The Court broadened this narrow holding, however, in <em>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co. v. Parker, </em>462 U.S. 345, 103 S. Ct. 2392 (1983), making clear that the statute of limitations is tolled not only as to those class members seeking to intervene in the class action, but also as to <em>individual </em>actions filed by members of the putative class.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rule established by these two decisions is instructive, but gives little guidance as to the outer limits of the doctrine, as has been noted by courts and secondary sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b635 For example, the rule applies to cases filed in federal court, but states are free to fashion their own class action tolling rules and are not bound by <em>American Pipe. </em>Another open question is whether the pile should apply equally to all class actions, or whether distinctions \u00a1should be recognized, such as between mass tort class actions and \u25a0securities class actions. Most importantly for the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>authorities conflict as to whether the rule applies when the individual action is filed in a different jurisdiction than the class action. So called \u201ccross-jurisdictional tolling\u201d has rarely been addressed, and the few state courts and secondary sources to have considered the doctrine have expressed widely divergent viewpoints.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b636 Novartis urges this Court not to adopt class action tolling in Montana in the present case for two principal reasons. First, Novartis argues that the doctrine is premised on the provision of fair notice to defendants through the claims made in the class action, and that no such notice was provided in the present case. It contends that the type of class action suit at issue today-a mass tort-is generally unsuited for class action tolling. Second, Novartis argues that the more well-reasoned and widely adopted view of the doctrine rejects cross-jurisdictional tolling, and therefore, as the class action suit was filed in Tennessee, it should not toll Montana\u2019s statute of limitations. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b637 We first consider the contention that the doctrine should not apply because Novartis was not afforded proper notice of Stevens\u2019 claims. Novartis advances both generic and specific arguments on this point. In general, Novartis argues that mass torts are unsuited for classj action tolling, because a central principle of the tolling doctrine-notice to defendants-is not present. Specifically, Novartis argues that it did not receive effective notice of Stevens\u2019 claim through the <em>Becker </em>clasi action suit. Novartis contends that the policy of affording notice ti defendants through statutes of limitation is not satisfied where neithe: the individual plaintiffs\u2019 injuries nor the facts necessary to the claim; are substantially similar. Advocates of this view draw a contrast wit] other class action suits, such as for securities offerings, where the fact; constituting the individual claims are all but identical. Several court; have found this distinction persuasive. In <em>Bell v. Showa Denko K.K. </em>899 S.W.2d 749 (Tex. App. 1995), a Texas court declined to extend it; existing class action tolling rule to a personal injury class action sui concluding that the distinction between personal injury class action; and other class actions \u2018is important in determining whether tb defendants have received fair notice of the existence of a claim by tb filing of a class suit,\u201d especially given \u201cthe variety of claims necessarily involved in [personal injury cases].\u201d <em>Bell, </em>899 S.W.2d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b638 Similarly, in <em>Jolly v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>751 P.2d 923 (Cal. 1988), thl California Supreme Court reversed a lower court\u2019s application of tb| class action tolling rule in a suit for personal injuries caused by defective pregnancy drug. While the decision turned on the fact th; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the individual suit sought damages for personal injury while the class action suit did not, the court offered a variety of reasons why it considered <em>American Pipe </em>inapposite. The court noted that the elements of personal injury claims \u201cvary widely from claim to claim,\u201d and that personal injury class action suits might be \u201cpresumptively incapable of apprising defendants of the substantive claims being brought against them\u201d as a result. <em>Id. </em>at 937 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The court concluded that the class action suit did not \u201csufficiently put defendants on notice of the substance and nature of plaintiffs claims,\u201d and that such notice was \u201ca prerequisite, in our view, to the application of <em>American Pipe.\u201d Id. </em>at 936-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\">\u00b639 Novartis contends that the present facts parallel those in <em>Jolly, </em>and do not support the rationale behind <em>American Pipe </em>because the class action suit failed to put Novartis on sufficient notice of Stevens\u2019 claims. While we may later encounter a situation in which a class action suit does not afford sufficient notice to the defendants of subsequent plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we do not believe we are faced with such an instance today. Novartis\u2019 alleged failure to warn, and the injury caused as a result, serve as the underpinning for both the class action suit and Stevens\u2019 claim, and the warnings issued by Novartis to healthcare professionals around the country were presumably the same or substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">140 More importantly, it is not necessary that the claims be identical. <em>Tosti v. L.A., </em>754 F.2d 1485, 1489 (9th Cir. 1985) (Tw]e find no persuasive authority for a rule which would require that the individual suit must be identical in every respect to the class suit for the statute Ko be tolled.\u201d). We are not convinced that the nature of the individual Plaintiffs\u2019 claims in <em>American Pipe </em>and its progeny were of substantially greater variance than the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims Hn the <em>Becker </em>class action. Under modern pleading rules, Novartis is Rnly entitled to be noticed of the <em>nature </em>of claim, rather than the \u25a0amages alleged, which need not be pleaded specifically. The Hxgument that mass torts are unsuited for class action tolling seems Ho afford too little weight to the critical distinction between variance Hcl damages and variance in the nature of claims. We are unpersuaded \u25a0bat mass torts are unsuitable for class action tolling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>that Novartis was effectively put on notice of Stevens\u2019 claim by the <em>Becker </em>suit, and allowing class action tolling in this context would not unfairly prejudice Novartis for lack of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b641 We next consider Novartis\u2019 argument that class action tolling should not be applied here because the class action suit and Stevens\u2019 suit were filed in different jurisdictions. Novartis correctly observes] that state courts have rarely adopted cross-jurisdictional tolling, an that the doctrine has been rejected by courts in several states. Th large majority of courts to consider the issue, however, have stoppe short of outright adoption or rejection. While Novartis claims that the doctrine has been \u201cwidely rejected,\u201d in reality the doctrine has seldom been squarely addressed, and it is clear that its outlines are still in the process of developing. Many of the cases Novartis cites as \u201crejecting\u201d the doctrine, for example, are merely circuit court decisions looking tc existing state law, finding no authority one way or the other, am declining to decide the issue without guidance from the state\u2019s higl court. In <em>Clemens v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>534 F.3d 1017, 1025 (9th Cir. 2008), for example, the Ninth Circuit declined to import th&lt; doctrine to California law, observing that \u201c[t]he California Supreim Court has not adopted such cross-jurisdictional tolling,\u201d and deferring to \u2018California\u2019s interest in managing its own judicial system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b642 Two recent decisions rejecting the doctrine shed light on th rationale behind limitation of the class action tolling rule to action| filed in the same jurisdiction. In <em>Portwood v. Ford Motor Co., </em>70 N.E.2d 1102 (Ill. 1998), the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed th] dismissal of state court claims brought by plaintiffs, who sought to rel| on a federal class action suit to toll the statute of limitations. The cou: reasoned that while class action tolling in the <em>same </em>court syste: furthered judicial economy and was sound policy, tolling aero; jurisdictional boundaries \u201cmay actually increase the burden\u201d on th court system of the state adopting cross-jurisdictional tolling, \u201cbecaui plaintiffs from across the country may elect to file... in that state sole' to take advantage of the generous tolling rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1104. The Illino court thus rejected the doctrine, claiming that \u2018tb]y rejecting cros.| jurisdictional tolling, we ensure that the protective filings predicted plaintiffs will be dispersed throughout the country rather th; concentrated in Illinois.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b643 In <em>Maestas v. Sofamor Danek Group, Inc., </em>33 S.W.3d 805 (Ten] 2000), the Tennessee Supreme Court rejected cross-jurisdiction| tolling for essentially the same reason. \u201cAdoption of the doctrin opined the court, \u201cwould run the risk that Tennessee courts woui <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>become a clearinghouse for cases that are barred in the jurisdictions in which they otherwise would have been brought ... [w]e cannot sanction such forum shopping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808. Fearing a \u2018brass exodus of rejected putative class members from federal court to Tennessee,\u201d the court affirmed a lower court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was time-barred. <em>Id. </em>at 809. The court also expressed distaste at a perceived lack of state sovereignty, observing that adoption of the doctrine would give federal courts control over the running of Tennessee state statutes of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">\u00b644 Nearly all other negative treatments of the doctrine have either declined to extend it in the limited circumstances in which it was presented, or have ruled based on existing precedent established in cases such as <em>Portwood </em>and <em>Maestas.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is clear that the main reason state courts decline to adopt cross-jurisdictional tolling is the fear that doing so while the doctrine is not yet widely accepted will trigger a rush on the courts of that state. Courts rejecting the doctrine have paid scant attention to any perceived unfairness to defendants, with rare exceptions. <em>See e.g. Bell v. Showa Denko </em>K.K., 899 S.W.2d at 758. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the reasons for rejection of cross-jurisdictional tolling do <em>not </em>generally include a perceived incompatibility with principles underlying statutes of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b645  We conclude that the <em>Becker </em>class action fairly put Novartis on notice of the substance of Stevens\u2019 claims. This is doubly true because Stevens\u2019 complaint was filed ten months after the alleged expiration of the limitations period-in stark contrast to drastic scenarios such as that confronted by the <em>Portwood </em>court, where the plaintiffs sought to get around a limitations failure of over a decade through a class action suit that had been pending for a full nine years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AX_r\">\u00b646 We are convinced that the decisions adopting cross-jurisdictional tolling more effectively balance the considerations at issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Vaccariello v. Smith &amp; Nephew </em>Richards, Inc., 763 N.E.2d 160 (Ohio 2002), the Ohio Supreme Court heard the claims of a plaintiff, Vaccariello, injured by a medical device known as a \u201cpedicle screw,\u201d implanted in her spine to relieve back pain. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motionfor summaryjudgment, concluding that the statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of a nationwide class action against the device manufacturer filed in Pennsylvania federal district court, of which Vaccariello was a potential class member. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>intermediate court reversed, and the Ohio Supreme Court allowed a discretionary appeal. Noting that Ohio\u2019s own class action rule was virtually identical to the federal rule, the court concluded that \u201ca class action filed in federal court serves the same purpose as a class action filed in Ohio,\u201d and Tw]hether a class action is filed in Ohio or in the federal court system, the defendant is put on notice of the substance and nature of the claims against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162-63. \u2018Therefore,\u201d concluded the court, \u201callowing the filing of a class action in the federal court system to toll the statute of limitations in Ohio does not defeat the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">\u00b647 The <em>Vaccarie.Uo </em>court then proceeded to discuss <em>Portwood, </em>explaining why it did not find the holding persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">In <em>Portwood v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1998) (citation omitted), the Supreme Court of Illinois rejected cross-jurisdictional tolling \u2018because plaintiffs from across the country may elect to file a subsequent suit in that state solely to take advantage of the generous tolling rule,\u201d thereby burdening Illinois\u2019 court system. We are not persuaded that this is a realistic potential problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">Our holding today merely allows a plaintiff who could have filed suit in Ohio irrespective of the class action filed in federal court in Pennsylvania to rely on that class action to protect her rights in Ohio. To do otherwise would encourage all potential plaintiffs in Ohio who might be part of a class that is seeking certification in a federal class action to file suit individually in Ohio courts to preserve their Ohio claims should the class certification be denied. The resulting multiplicity of filings would defeat the purpose of class actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"><em>Id. </em>We agree with these considerations. We do not expand access to Montana\u2019s courts beyond the access to which out-of-state plaintiffs are already entitled. Our state\u2019s policy is plainly stated in the Montana Constitution: \u201c[c]ourts of justice shall be open to every person, and speedy remedy afforded for every injury to person, property, or character.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a716. The right of access to our court system is \u201cunrestricted by reference to residence or citizenship,\u201d and an out-of-state plaintiff has \u201cthe same rights and duties as a citizen of this state.\u201d <em>LaBella v. Burlington </em>N., 182 Mont. 202, 207, 595 P.2d 1184, 1187 (1979) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); \u00a7 19-1-204, MCA. Any citizen of the United States may file suit in Montana\u2019s courts, provided that jurisdiction may properly be asserted &gt;ver the defendant. Thus, our decision today does not expand the class &gt;f potential plaintiffs in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u00b648 We concede, however, that in adopting cross-jurisdictional tolling we may well create the incentive complained of in <em>Portwood </em>and <em>Maestas, </em>for out-of-state plaintiffs to file suit in Montana courts when their claims are time-barred in other jurisdictions. We do not dismiss this concern lightly. While the <em>Vaccariello </em>court opined that \u201c[o]ur holding does not invite plaintiffs who have no relationship to Ohio to file suit in our courts,\u201d we acknowledge that our holding today may indeed encourage plaintiffs with \u201cno relationship to Montana\u201d to file suit in our courts, if their claims are stale elsewhere. <em>Vaccariello, </em>763 N.E.2d at 163. But as we have observed above, <em>all </em>plaintiffs, regardless of residency, are constitutionally guaranteed the right to file suit in Montana. We conclude that the best judge of these competing arguments will be experience. As we have noted when faced with similar situations, \u2018if a substantial increase in this type of litigation is called to our attention in the future we will reexamine the situation in light of what we have herein stated.\u201d <em>Labella, </em>182 Mont. at 207, 595 P.2d at 1187 (quoting <em>State ex rel. Great N. Ry. v. Dist. Ct., </em>139 Mont. 453, 457, 365 P.2d 512, 514 (1961), and concluding that Montana\u2019s open court policy, as set out in Mont. Const, art II, \u00a7 16, guarantees out-of-state plaintiffs the right to file in Montana state courts.).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b649 Thus, although avoiding the possibility of a rush of out-of-state plaintiffs filing in our court system is concededly a valid policy objective, we consider this objective less compelling than competing considerations. We suspect that a greater burden on the court system will be imposed by <em>not </em>adopting the rule, as plaintiffs would be required to file protective individual suits in Montana courts to avoii limitations defenses, while otherwise relying on a pending class actio: suit filed elsewhere. This directly conflicts with the rational underlying the class action tolling rule: to promote judicial economy b; encouraging individual plaintiffs to defer to class action suits to protec their claims. We see no reason why jurisdictional boundaries shoul operate as a bar to the application of this policy. Where, as here, th defendants are already on fair notice of the claims against the: through a timely class action suit, the policies underlying thi limitations period are not subverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b650 We recognize that in some instances a class action suit may <em>no\\ </em>fairly put the defendants on notice. Our adoption of the rule i therefore limited to situations in which defendants are fairly put 0]| notice of the substantive claims against them. Were we confronte* with a case such as that faced by the California Supreme Court i <em>Jolly, </em>where the individual claim sought damages for personal injuri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>but the class action suit sought only monitoring, we would likely not see fit to extend the doctrine. <em>Jolly, </em>751 P.2d at 936. Similarly, the present case involved an alleged limitations failure of under a year. Were we to confront a situation such as the one faced by the <em>Portwood </em>court-where the class action suit was alleged to have tolled the statute of limitations for <em>over a decadente </em>might find the principles of notice and fairness to defendants not met and the doctrine inapplicable. Thus, before tolling the statute of limitations during the pendency of a class action suit, we must examine the circumstances present in the case to ensure that defendants are not unfairly prejudiced, regardless of the jurisdictions in which the actions are filed. On the facts before us today, we conclude that tolling our state statute of limitations best upholds the competing policies at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\">\u00b651 Because we determine that the statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of the <em>Becker </em>suit, we conclude that Stevens\u2019 complaint was timely filed. We thus do not reach the question of whether Novartis was properly named as a fictitious defendant under \u00a725-5-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b652 <em>2. Whether the District Court erroneously instructed the iury as to Novartis\u2019 duty to warn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b653 Novartis contends that it is entitled to a new trial because the District Court incorrectly instructed the jury that it had a duty to warn realth care professionals other than Stevens\u2019 prescribing physician. Jnder the \u2018learned intermediary\u201d doctrine adopted by Montana in <em>Hill v. Squibb &amp; Sons, E. R., </em>181 Mont. 199, 206, 592 P.2d 1383, 1387-88 (1979), Novartis argues, its duty to warn extends <em>only </em>to the describing physician-in this case, Dr. Schmidt. Stevens counters that Novartis misrepresents the holding in <em>Hill, </em>and that the District Court iorrectly stated the duty to warn as set out in the Restatement (Third) f Torts (hereafter, \u2018the Restatement\u201d), which provides that warnings aust be provided to \u201cprescribing and other healthcare providers who re in a position to reduce risks of harm.\u201d <em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: \u2019roducts Liability </em>\u00a7 6(d)(1) (1998). Novartis asserts that the lestatement\u2019s version of the doctrine is in conflict with the majority iew, which has been adopted by Montana. Novartis supports this ontention by noting that Montana has not adopted this latest version f the Restatement. Stevens responds that the distinction made by iovartis between Montana law and the Restatement is a false one, pid that the particular facts surrounding Stevens\u2019 care support the expression of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"pACEG\">The learned intermediary doctrine has been widely accepted, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>some form, for the better part of the past century. Although Novartis asserts that we adopted a controlling interpretation of the doctrine in <em>Hill, </em>that case was decided on entirely different grounds and containec no discussion, or even specific mention, of the learned intermediary doctrine. We thus agree with Stevens that Novartis ascribes improper weight to dicta in <em>Hill, </em>and conclude that the greater body of common law offers a fuller, more perspicacious perspective on the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"AIP\">\u00b655 Despite its wide acceptance, the doctrine has constantly been under attack, and has evolved through the years to confront the changing nature of the healthcare system. Part of this evolution hai been a movement away from limiting the doctrine\u2019s applicability to the prescribing physician alone. The version of the doctrine set out in the Restatement, which includes \u201cother healthcare providers\u201d in the possible class of learned intermediaries, reflects this modern trend. Ir traditional doctor-patient relationships, the doctor provides the patien with the resources to make an informed choice, through explanatioi of the risks and benefits involved with a certain drug and knowledge of the patient\u2019s medical history. In these conventional, individualize* doctor-patient relationships, the doctor is in the best position to understand and communicate warnings effectively to the patient-fche \u2018learned intermediary\u201d standing in between the patient and thi pharmaceutical company. The modern healthcare system, howevei places far less emphasis on these traditional relationships, an patients today often receive the majority of their care from nurses nurse practitioners, physicians\u2019 assistants, and physicians other tha the prescribing physician. Appropriately, in situations where th| underlying rationale of the doctrine-4he traditional doctor-patien relationship's no longer present, the doctrine has adapted to fit tb realities of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b656 This evolution has occurred on two principal fronts. The first these, which has received the lion\u2019s share of the attention but is not issue today, is when the duty to warn is extended not only to otb healthcare providers, but to patients-khus, not applying the doctrim at all.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The second, which is directly relevant to our discussion, is t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>evolution of the doctrine through an expansion of the possible class of learned intermediaries. This development, likewise spurred by the fact that the medical professionals with whom patients most commonly interact are often no longer primary physicians, has led courts and secondary sources such as the Restatement to suggest that a variety of different healthcare providers may be considered learned intermediaries, depending on the unique facts of the patients\u2019 treatment scenario.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6U\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>\u00b657 For example, in <em>Holley v. Burroughs Wellcome Co., </em>330 S.E.2d 228, 235-36 (N.C. App. 1985), the court considered a registered nurse anesthesiologist who was responsible for the patient\u2019s anesthesia to be a learned intermediary to whom the manufacturer owed a duty to warn. The CRNA failed to recognize a known adverse reaction, which caused permanent brain damage in the patient. Just as Novartis argues today, the manufacturer asserted that its duty to warn was satisfied because the learned intermediary doctrine limited the scope of its duty to warn to the prescribing physician. The court was not persuaded. Noting that it was \u201cstandard practice\u201d for CRNAs to be responsible for monitoring, maintenance, and supervisory care of anesthetized patients, the court dismissed the argument that the duty to warn only extended to the prescribing physician as \u201cunpersuasive in the present context,\u2019\u2019and \u2018hot appropriate in actions like the present one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235. The court reasoned that while the Td]efendants\u2019 argument would be appropriate in cases ... where a nurse only administered a medicine ... but was otherwise not responsible for the patient\u2019s care,\u2019\u2019the nurse anesthesiologist in <em>Holley </em>was responsible for all aspects of patient treatment. Thus, the court concluded, the duty to warn ought to apply to her as the primary healthcare provider standing in between the patient and the manufacturer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b658 Similarly, <em>in McEwen v. Ortho Pharm. </em>Corp., 528 P.2d 522, 528-30 (Or. 1974), the court reviewed the underlying premise of the doctrine and extended the duty to warn beyond the prescribing physician. The plaintiff had been prescribed a contraceptive, but received treatment for a negative reaction to the drug from other physicians. The court explained that \u2018Ta]lthough the ethical drug manufacturer\u2019s duty tc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>warn has been discussed most often with reference to the prescribing physician, the [doctrine\u2019s] reasoning applies with equal force to the treating physician ... [who] may be more likely to observe the actual symptoms of the drug\u2019s untoward consequences.\u201d The court concluded that the manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn \u201cextends, then, to all members of the medical profession who come into contact with the patient in a decision-making capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">\u00b659 The realities of modern medicine increasingly conflict with the learned intermediary doctrine\u2019s underlying premises. Unsurprisingly, the doctrine is in a state of flux as it adapts to new medical practices. We need not set out the precise confines of the doctrine as it would apply to numerous hypothetical scenarios. We concur with authorities who consider the learned intermediary to be the healthcare professional actually responsible for making decisions related to the patient\u2019s care, especially when the prescribing physician is no longer involved with the continuing treatment and supervision of the patient. In these instances, the underlying rationale of the individualized relationship between the prescribing physician and the patient is truly no longer present. Here, it is clear that Stevens received much of her treatment from nurses, treating physicians, and nurse practitioners, and that Dr. Schmidt was rarely, if ever, a participant in her continuing care. Most importantly, when Stevens called Dr. Schmidt\u2019s practice to discuss the risk of dental surgery while on Zometa, she spoke with a locum tenens physician rather than Dr. Schmidt herself.</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">\u00b660 These facts suggest that the scope of Novartis\u2019 duty to warn, in this case, would presumably include at least the treating locum tenens physicians at Guardian Oncology who counseled Stevens on dental [surgery, if not the nurses who routinely administered Zometa to Stevens.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not find the Restatement, nor the District Court\u2019s instructions, at odds with the body of law in this area, or with any precedent set out by this Court in <em>Hill. </em>We need not conclusively decide this issue today, however, because Novartis cannot demonstrate \u00a1that the instruction resulted in prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">|\u00b661 Novartis cannot demonstrate prejudicial error because the jury [verdict form allowed the jury to find Novartis negligent <em>without </em>relying on the allegedly deficient jury instruction. The jury verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>form asked whether Novartis was negligent \u2018in its label <em>or </em>information to Dr. Jndy Schmidt and Guardian Oncology treating professional staff.\u201d(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the jury had two options: (A) the label was inadequate, or (B) the information provided to Dr. Schmidt and the treating staff was inadequate. The error complained of-an overbroad scope of the duty to warnis <em>only </em>implicated with regard to (B), the \u2018information,\u201d and <em>not </em>with regard to (A), the label.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, Novartis cannot demonstrate that the duty to warn was even considered by the jury in reaching its verdict, and therefore cannot demonstrate prejudicial error as a result of the instruction. \u00b662 Thus, while we would tend to conclude that the jury instruction correctly instructed the jury on the applicable law, we need not definitively resolve this issue today. It is clear that because the instruction was not implicated by one of the two mutually exclusive alternatives, Novartis cannot demonstrate that the instruction resulted in prejudicial error. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b663 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in refusing Novartis permission to amend its complaint to include an apportionment defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b664 We review the denial of a motion to amend, like other discretionary rulings made by a district court, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Deschamps v. Treas. St. Trailer Ct., Ltd., </em>2010 MT 74, \u00b6 18, 356 Mont. 1, 230 P.3d 800. The trial court\u2019s decision will not be reversed in the absence of an affirmative showing of abuse of tha1 discretion resulting in prejudice. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Callan v. Hample, </em>73 Mont. 321, 326, 236 P. 550, 551-52 (1925)). Amendments are permitted by M R. Civ. P. 15(a), which provides that a party may amend the party\u2019 pleading by leave of the court. The proposed amendment should b permitted, in keeping with the policy that leave to amend \u201cshall b freely given when justice so requires,\u201d unless: (1) the \u201cmotion causesj undue delay, is made in bad faith, is based upon a dilatory motive o: the part of the movant, or is futile,\u201d or (2) \u201cthe party opposing thi amendment would incur substantial prejudice as a result of tb amendment.\u201d <em>Stundal v. Stundal, </em>2000 MT 21, \u00b6 12, 298 Mont. 141, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>995 P.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">\u00b665 The District Court denied Novartis permission to amend its complaint to assert a defense seeking to apportion liability between Novartis and Dr. Schmidt for the damages suffered by Stevens. The court\u2019s stated basis was that Novartis had not acted with reasonable promptness, given that almost two months had passed since the notice of settlement between Dr. Schmidt and Stevens. The court reasoned that to allow amendment to include a completely new defense with less than a month before trial would substantially prejudice Stevens, who had repeatedly sought to discover whether Novartis planned on asserting that any third parties shared responsibility for Stevens\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b666  We conclude that it was within the District Court\u2019s discretion to deny leave to amend the pleadings. Novartis sought to introduce an entirely new defense shortly before the trial date and offers no persuasive reason for its delay in doing so. Stevens\u2019 counsel had clearly been trying for some time to learn whether Novartis sought to add this defense, which would plainly be a central and vigorously contested issue at trial, in an effort to prepare adequately should Novartis seek :o apportion liability. We see no reason aside from an attempt to gain an advantage why Novartis should not have made clear its intention ;o blame Dr. Schmidt from its initial appearance in the case. Its delay n doing so until Dr. Schmidt no longer had a reason to defend herself speaks volumes. Novartis\u2019 complaint that the District Court\u2019s ruling on his issue caused it irreparable harm by \u201cpreventing it from making he case for the liability of Dr. Schmidt\u201d is a far cry from an accurate epresentation of the proceedings below. Novartis easily could have nade such a case, were it upfront about its intention to do so at any ime in the eight months after it was joined as a party.

We will \u25a0rst set out the general framework governing admissibility of prior (leadings, and then address each statement in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">19 <em>A. Admissibility of prior pleadings in general.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u00b670 At common law, statements in pleadings were generally not admissible as evidence. This rule arose from the former nature of pleadings, which were filled with hypothetical allegations and legal conclusions framing the issues of the case in terms of numerous fictional common-law counts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These pleadings served technical and discovery purposes, and statements made therein were rightly considered attributable to the attorney rather than the client on whose behalf the pleading was prepared.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But with the adoption of the modern rules eschewing technical pleading in favor of fact-basec pleading, the underlying rationale behind the rule began to fade away. As the modern system requires parties to plead facts, the statements\u00ae made in pleadings are now often considered to have evidentiary value Modern pleadings also service a notice function and permr hypothetical and inconsistent claims, however, so some limitations d( exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b671 The manner in which these statements are admissible in cour depends on a variety of factors. Such factors may include: whether th( statements in the pleadings are sought as substantive evidence or a\u00a1 impeachment evidence, whether the pleadings have been sine amended or superseded, whether the pleadings were filed in the sam case or in an unrelated action, or whether the statements are of fact o law, among other considerations. Admissibility is of course also subjec to traditional evidentiary considerations, such as relevant materiality, and prejudice. The common law rule barring t evidentiary use of pleadings has survived only as an exception, some courts have declined to hold parties responsible for allegations i their pleadings when it is evident that they truly had little idea of t contents therein.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_f\">\u00b672 <em>B. Stevens\u2019 statement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u00b673 In the present suit, before Novartis was joined to the case, Stevens alleged that Dr. Schmidt was aware of the risks associated with Zometa and was negligent in failing to communicate those risks. This statement was made in Stevens\u2019 original complaint, and was repeated in her amended complaint, expert disclosures, and discovery responses to Dr. Schmidt. In the lower court, Novartis offered two rationales for the admissibility of these statements. First, Novartis argued that the statements were admissible as judicial admissions. Alternatively, Novartis argued that the positions taken in these pleadings were inconsistent with Stevens\u2019 position at trial and that Stevens should therefore be judicially estopped from denying their veracity. We discuss these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">\u00b674 Novartis first argues that the statements made by Stevens in her prior pleadings are judicial admissions. Montana\u2019s general rule is that \u201callegations, statements, or admissions contained in a pleading are conclusive as against the pleader, and are admissible as against the party making them in the litigation as proof of the facts which they admit.\u201d <em>Meadow Lake Ests. Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 41, \u00b6 45, 341 Mont. 345, 178 P.3d 81 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Mace, </em>99 Mont. 421, 427-28, 45 P.2d 771, 773-74 (1935)). Judicial admissions may clearly be made at \u201cany point during the litigation process,\u201d including \u201cduring discovery, pleadings, opening statements, direct and cross-examination, as well as closing arguments.\u201d <em>In re Est. of Hill, </em>281 Mont. 142, 149-50, 931 P.2d 1320, 1325 (1997) (quoting <em>Kohne v. Yost, </em>250 Mont. 109, 112, 818 P.2d 360, 362 (1991)). In Montana, a judicial admission \u2018has a conclusive effect upon the party who makes it, and prevents that party from introducing further evidence to prove, disprove, or contradict the admitted fact.\u201d <em>In re Raymond W. George </em>Trust, 1999 MT 223, \u00b6 36, 296 Mont. 56, 986 P.2d 427 (quoting <em>DeMars </em>v. <em>Carlstrom, </em>285 Mont. 334, 337, 948 P.2d 246, 248 (1997)). A judicial admission is not binding, however, unless it is an unequivocal statement of <em>fact, </em>as opposed to a conclusion of law or the expression bf an opinion. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 37 (emphasis added) (citing <em>DeMars, </em>285 Mont. at 338, 948 P.2d at 249; <em>Kohne, </em>250 Mont. at 113, 818 P.2d at 362).</p>\n<p id=\"APx\">1175 In <em>George Trust, </em>we held that a statement made by a party relating to that part/s ownership of an interest in trust property was n. conclusion of law, not a statement of fact, and was thus not a judicial gidmission. In the present case, the statements made by Stevens Ihrough her attorney were allegations made on the flawed information Ivailable to Stevens at the time, which demonstrates that they were laere expressions of opinion and conclusions of law, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>statements of fact. \u201c[A] judicial admission applies to facts, not to legal theories or positions.\u201d <em>Stanley L. and Carolyn M. Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 34, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620. The District Court correctly ruled that Stevens\u2019 statements made in prior pleadings were not judicial admissions because they were not statements of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayg\">\u00b676 Novartis next contends, in the alternative, that Stevens should be judicially estopped from denying the statements made in her prior pleadings. The doctrine of judicial estoppel precludes a party from taking a position inconsistent with previously made declarations in a subsequent action or proceeding. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 33. Judicial estoppel applies only when: (1) the estopped party had knowledge of the facts at the time he or she took the original position; (2) the estopped party succeeded in maintaining the original position; (3) the position presently taken by the estopped party is inconsistent with its original position; and (4) the original position misled the adverse party so that allowing the estopped party to change its position would injuriously affect the adverse party. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Kauffman-Harmon v. Kauffman, </em>2001 MT 238, \u00b6 16, 307 Mont. 45, 36 P.3d 408).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b677 We conclude that the doctrine of judicial estoppel is not applicable here. First, the present case is not a \u201csubsequent action or proceeding\u201d-!! is the same proceeding, as Stevens correctly observes. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that Novartis was \u201cmisled\u201d by Stevens\u2019 alleged prior positions. Nor has Novartis shown tha Stevens had knowledge of the facts surrounding Novartis\u2019 prio: warnings to Dr. Schmidt at the time-to the contrary, the record suggests that Stevens believed that the failure to warn wai attributable to Dr. Schmidt rather than Novartis.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b678 Novartis also raises the argument, for the first time on appe\u00e1 that the pleadings are admissible pursuant to M. R. Evid. 801(d)(2), a.1 statements of a party offered against a party. While sometime; referred to as \u201cadmissions against interest,\u201d statements under Rub 801(d)(2) need not be against the party\u2019s interest at the time the part] made the statement, nor need be a statement of fact rather than legal opinion or position.

But regardless of the strength or weakness of this theory, the trial court must be given the opportunity to weigh such an argument against traditional evidentiary considerations such as prejudice and relevance, which might still tip the scales in favor of the inadmissibility of the statement. We will not fault the District Court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider. The rule is well established that this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Gomez, </em>2007 MT 111, \u00b6 21, 337 Mont. 219, 158 P.3d 442 (citing <em>State v.

Dr. Morris\u2019 statement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">i \u00b681 Novartis maintains that the trial court erred by excluding a I statement contained in a pleading filed by Dr. Eugene Morris before I the Montana Medical Legal Panel (MMLP). The response, prepared by I Dr. Morris\u2019 attorney, was filed in answer to Stevens\u2019 MMLP complaint I against Dr. Morris. Novartis sought to use the answer, which stated 1 that extraction of Stevens\u2019 tooth through dental surgery was \u201cthe only I realistic treatment option,\u201d to impeach Dr. Morris\u2019 trial testimony that H alternatives to extraction did exist. Novartis maintains that this H evidence was critical to its argument as to proximate cause, because it \u25a0 shows that Stevens had no option but to undergo the dental surgery, H and that a failure to warn could thus not have caused Stevens\u2019 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u25a0 \u00b682 Two considerations relate to the statement\u2019s admissibility. First, Hthe parties dispute whether the statement is admissible for Himpeachment purposes as a prior inconsistent statement made by Dr. \u25a0Morris. The trial court supported Stevens\u2019 argument that the \u25a0statement should be excluded because it was not a statement of the Hwitness, Dr. Morris-it was a statement of the witness\u2019 attorney, Hunsigned by the witness, and thus could not be used to impeach the Hwitness. Second, the parties dispute the holding in <em>Linder v. Smith, </em>193 Mont. 20, 30, 629 P.2d 1187, 1192 (1981), a Montana Supreme \u25a0Court case that held a prior statutory bar on use of MMLP proceedings Hpr impeachment purposes unconstitutional. Novartis maintains that H;he decision made all parts of the MMLP proceedings available for IHmpeachment purposes, while Stevens asserts that the holding is Himited to sworn testimony given during a MMLP hearing. We will first Consider whether the statement is available for impeachment purposes .s a prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u00b683 M. R. Evid. 801 provides that if a declarant testifies at trial, is subject to cross-examination, and makes a statement which is inconsistent with a prior statement, then the prior inconsistent statement is by definition not subject to the hearsay bar. Clearly, the statement made in Dr. Morris\u2019 prior pleading was inconsistent with his testimony in trial. But while some jurisdictions condition admissibility of prior pleadings on whether they are signed or otherwise verified,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in Montana, parties are responsible for all statements made by their attorneys within the scope of representation, whether made in pleadings or in open court. <em>Est. of Hill, </em>281 Mont. at 149, 931 P.2d at 1325; <em>Kohne, </em>250 Mont. at 112, 818 P.2d at 362; <em>Rasmussen v.

The proceedings of the Panel are similar in form to regular court actions, but are entirely creature of statute, separate and distinct from regular courts and tb rules applicable to regular court actions. It is therefore incorrect t assume that principles applicable to standard proceedings are alsi applicable to MMLP proceedings, despite their outward similarity. Thi Act stresses that MMLP hearings are \u201cconfidential and informal,\u201d and) that \u2018the Montana Rules of Evidence shall not apply to hearings befor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the Panel.\u201d Section 27-6-502, MCA, Rule 15(c). It is unclear, however, to what degree the statutorily-mandated confidentiality of the proceedings overrides competing principles. In <em>Linder, </em>we severed part of the Act <em>sua sponte, </em>on the basis that it unconstitutionally infringed on the right to impeach the sworn testimony of a witness, by providing that \u201c[no] statement made by any person during a hearing before the panel may be used as impeaching evidence in court.\u201d <em>Linder, </em>193 Mont. at 30, 629 P.2d at 1192. This holding involved <em>testimony </em>before the MMLP panel, and not pleadings in the proceeding, as Stevens correctly observes. Conversely, however, as pleadings are not specifically addressed, it is unclear whether the general confidentiality provisions of the MMLP Act would trump the right to impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement made in the pleadings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">|\u00b685 Furthermore, assuming that the holding in <em>Linder </em>makes only sworn testimony available for use for impeachment purposes, it still remains unclear whether inconsistent statements made during other parts of the proceeding would be available for impeachment should they be <em>voluntarily </em>made available to opposing parties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The present lase suggests no clear resolution. Perhaps understandably, given the oreadth and depth of other issues on appeal, the parties have focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>their attention elsewhere and have made only cursory, largely unsupported arguments on this issue. As we have previously held, it is not our obligation to conduct legal research, guess at precise positions, or develop legal analysis that may lend support to the parties\u2019 positions. M. R. App. P. 23; <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 44. 340 Mont. 10, 171 P.3d 731. Because we find that any error alleged by Novartis was harmless, we decline to dive into these unexplored waters today.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b686 In order for the erroneous admission of evidence to constitute grounds for a new trial, the error must be so significant as tc materially affect the substantial rights of the complaining party Section 25-11-102, MCA; <em>Stevenson v. Felco </em>Indus., 2009 MT 299, \u00b6 16, 352 Mont. 303, 216 P.3d 763. Our rule is that no reversible error occur unless the evidence in question was of such character as to have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 65 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. While the evidence here may well have assisted Novartis in undermining Dr. Morris\u2019 credibility, we canno conclude that this evidence was of such character as to have affecte the outcome of the trial. Dr. Morris was merely one of many medics professionals at trial who testified that there were alternatives to th surgery Stevens ultimately elected, and Novartis had ampl opportunity to cross-examine both Dr. Morris and the other medics professionals, and to introduce its own evidence that no alternative existed. Furthermore, the statement arose in an informal an confidential proceeding where Dr. Morris\u2019 counsel would be expecte to file highly protective initial answers, and as such was likely of lo' probative value in any case.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b687 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court wi' respect to both the exclusion of statements made in Stevens\u2019 complai: and Dr. Morris\u2019 answer before the MMLP.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b688 <em>5. Whether the District Court erred in admitting testimo. regarding a change to Novartis\u2019 warning label.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b689 Novartis contends that it is entitled to a new trial because t trial court erroneously admitted evidence of a change to Novart: Zometa warning label, allegedly in order to demonstrate that Novar should have given the later warning <em>prior </em>to the surgery. Nova: argues that the evidence is inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 407, whii provides that evidence of subsequent remedial measures is \u2018h| admissible to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a defect in a produi a defect in a product\u2019s design, or a need for a warning instructio: Novartis asserts that the trial court erred in permitting Nurse Ji <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Landes, Dr. Schmidt\u2019s office manager, to testify to a change in the label, and contends that Landes\u2019 testimony was offered as \u201cproof that [Novartis\u2019] prior warnings were not adequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">\u00b690 Stevens paints a starkly different picture. She responds that the \u201cremedial measure\u201d testified to by Landes, and complained of by Novartis, was actually a change in Guardian Oncology\u2019s office protocol, not a change in Novartis\u2019 label. Stevens asserts that any reference to Novartis\u2019 later label was in passing and not offered as substantive evidence. Furthermore, asserts Stevens, M. R. Evid. 407 is not applicable here because it only governs subsequent remedial measures taken by a <em>party, </em>not a non-party such as Guardian Oncology, in keeping with the premise of the rule: to dissuade parties from failing to remedy dangerous situations out of fear that their remedies will be seen as admissions of guilt. Lastly, Stevens asserts that even had the remedial measure been Novartis\u2019, it was not admitted to show liability, but rather to show that adequate warnings <em>would </em>have been passed on to Stevens were they given to Dr. Schmidt-a point which Novartis vigorously disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b691 We agree with Stevens that two distinct remedial measures are referenced by the parties. The first is the change in Novartis\u2019 warning label in February 2005, which more explicitly warned about the risk of ONJ. The second is the change in Guardian Oncology\u2019s office protocol for patients at risk of ONJ, also initiated in February 2005. We agree with Stevens that M. R. Evid. 407 is not applicable in the latter situation, and thus any evidence of the change in Guardian Oncology\u2019s office protocol is not prohibited by the rule. Evidence of Novartis\u2019 subsequent change in label, however, if offered to demonstrate the insufficiency of the warning that was given at the time of the surgery, <em>would </em>conceivably fall within the prohibition of Sthe rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">0292 On closer examination of the trial transcript, it is clear that \u25a0Novartis significantly mischaracterizes the uses to which Stevens put \u25a0evidence of Novartis\u2019 changed label. While it is true that Landes did fteference Novartis\u2019 change in label in early 2005, she did so only when Contrasting information freely available in 2005 to information on the \u25a0abel at the time of Stevens\u2019 dental surgery in 2004, in an attempt to Bxplain why Guardian Oncology had changed its office protocol. Bjandes explained that she initiated the change in office protocol as a \u25a0esult of receiving an Oncological Nursing Society bulletin detailing \u25a0he risk of ONJ, which she received <em>before </em>Novartis changed its label, \u25a0'he change to the label was referenced only to provide chronological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>context for the receipt of the Nursing Society bulletin. Furthermore, Landes\u2019 testimony was introduced in order to rebut Novartis\u2019 argument that even if Guardian Oncology had received adequate warnings, the warnings would not have been passed on to patients like Stevens. Thus, while it is true that Landes spent some time discussing a remedial measure, and true that she did reference Novartis\u2019 change in label, it is not at all accurate to portray Landes\u2019 testimony as an attempt to introduce evidence of a subsequent remedial measure on Novartis\u2019 part. Novartis\u2019 attempt to conflate the clinic\u2019s change in procedure with Landes\u2019 brief reference to the changed label is entirely unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b693 We conclude that the District Court correctly ruled that M. R. Evid. 407 was not applicable here. M. R. Evid. 407 does not prohibit evidence of subsequent remedial measures taken by non-parties. Nor does it prohibit \u201cevidence\u201d of a change in Novartis\u2019 package insert, in this case. Stevens did not use the subsequent label to show negligence or need for a warning, and thus the evidence is not prohibited by the rule. Rather, Stevens referred to the subsequent Zometa label only in passing while discussing the change in Guardian Oncology office protocol. It was not offered as substantive evidence. Novartis argument on this issue is utterly misleading and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b694 We affirm the District <em>Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b695 <em>6. Whether Novartis is entitled to judgment as a matter o\\ law because Stevens failed to prove proximate causation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u00b696 Novartis contends that Stevens failed to present evidenci establishing proximate cause, because Stevens did not show that ther&lt; were any options available to treat her fractured tooth that would havi prevented her from developing ONJ. Given that Stevens needed ai invasive dental procedure, Novartis argues, she did not show that th <em>specific </em>procedure undertaken was any more likely to cause ONJ thai other procedures, such as crown lengthening, that might have bee: undertaken. M</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">\u00b697 Stevens responds by summarizing the testimony of sever\u00bb experts called at trial. She contends that this expert testimony clearlH shows that other procedures were available, and that the injury whicH caused her ONJ would not have occurred were she to have undergone these procedures. While we are sympathetic to the fact that the othJ| procedures available to Stevens also carried a risk of ONJ, tbl unstated premise of Novartis\u2019 argument is that because all procedure carried some risk of ONJ, it would be <em>impossible </em>for Stevens 1M establish proximate cause. We do not agree. Expert testimony at trim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>showed that the trauma caused by tooth extraction caused Stevens\u2019 ONJ, and that this particular trauma to Stevens\u2019 jawbone would have been avoided by choosing less invasive options. The testimony also showed that Dr. Morris would not have undertaken the tooth extraction if he had known of the risks of ONJ in Zometa patients such as Stevens. Stevens offered evidence of all links in the causal chain. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">\u00b698 7. <em>Whether the District Court erred in refusing Stevens permission to amend her complaint to include a claim for punitive damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b699 On cross-appeal, Stevens claims that the District Court abused its discretion by not allowing her to amend her complaint to include a claim for punitive damages. Stevens previously petitioned this court for a writ of supervisory control on this issue, which we denied. The trial court ruled that to allow amendment of the pleadings at the time Stevens\u2019 petition was filed would unduly prejudice Novartis, because the entirely new issue of intent would be raised by a punitive damage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b6100 While Stevens claims that the allegations would \u2018hot require additional time by [Novartis] to defend because they arose out of the same operative facts which served as the basis for [Novartis\u2019] liability,\u201d it is immediately apparent that this is not the case. Defending against a charge of actual fraud or actual malice would have required Novartis to address an entirely new argument, and the facts related to such an argument would <em>not </em>be the same as those already at issue. The defense would have taken careful preparation and would have involved substantial discovery, and Novartis could not have adequately prepared in the three weeks before the end of the discovery period. The District Court had a legitimate interest in ensuring an efficient \u00a1progression to the trial date, and we conclude that it did not abuse its \u00a1broad discretion to deny leave to amend. The matter of amendment \u00a1\u201crests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its action will \u00a1not be reversed in the absence of an affirmative showing of abuse of \u00a1that discretion resulting in prejudice.\u201d <em>Deschamps v.

Stevens observes that under \u00a727-1-308, MCA, a plaintiffs recovery may only be reduced by \u201ccollateral sources,\u201d defined in \u00a7 27-1-307, MCA, as \u201c... something that is later included in a tort award and which is made to or for the benefit of a plaintiff ....\u2019\u2019As the jury only awarded general damages, Stevens argues, it is impossible to determine whether the damages that Novartis seeks to offset were included in the jury verdict. Novartis counters that the trial court correctly included all amounts \u201cpaid or payable\u201d under the statute, and that the verdict was properly reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b6104 Our decision in <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 916 P.2d 122 (1996), controls resolution of this issue. In <em>Busta, </em>the defendant hospital sought to offset benefits received by the plaintiff from the Veterans\u2019 Administration against the damages awarded in the plaintiffs wrongful death action. As here, the jury was instructed that its award could include damages for economic loss, reasonable compensation for mental anguish, and loss of \u201ccomfort, guidance care, protection and companionship,\u201d among other compensable losses. The jury returned a verdict with a single amount for all damages without any breakdown of damages allotted to each of the losses. We held that without a breakdown of damages attributable to each loss the lower court could not have properly determined how much of thei award was attributable to damages for which the plaintiff would bej compensated by collateral sources, as would be a prerequisite for an; offset. Section 27-1-308, MCA, allows offsets only against \u201cthat part o: a recovery which ... [is] compensated by a collateral source.\u201dThus, wel concluded, \"... there was no method by which the District Court could| calculate what, if any amount, the hospital was entitled to offset by thi amount of... benefits awarded,\u201d and no offset could be applied. <em>Busta </em>276 Mont. at 375, 196 P.2d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b6105  Here, as in <em>Busta, </em>the jury verdict does not set out wha' portion of its damage award is attributable to items subject t collateral source offsets-in this instance, losses due to diminishei wage-earning capacity, for which Stevens will be compensated b; social security disability benefits. Without this Tine-item\u201d breakdown] of the damages awarded by jury, the District Court could not hav complied with the mandate of \u00a727-1-308, MCA, that jury awards ma; only be reduced by amounts attributable to losses which an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>compensated by collateral sources. There was no basis on which to conclude that the disability benefits would compensate Stevens in whole or in part for damages which were included in the jury1 s award. Without a factual basis for the offset, the District Court erred in concluding that Novartis was entitled to offset the jury award by Stevens\u2019 disability benefits. No offset should have been permitted. \u00b6106 For the reasons above, we reverse the judgment of the District Court as to the social security disability benefits offset, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">\u00b6107 <em>9.

First, public health clinics and mass immunization programs hai commonly been found to lack the requisite doctor-patient relationship. <em>See e.g. Davis v.

Second, when the patient] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>actively involved in choosing to use a given drag, some courts have not applied the doctrine. This exception has usually arisen in relation to birth control pills. <em>See e.g. MacDonald v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., </em>475 N.E.2d. 65, 68-70 (Mass. 1985); <em>Hill v. Searle Laboratories, </em>884 F.2d 1064, 1070-71 (8th Cir. 1989). Third, some courts have declined to apply the doctrine where there has been excessive direct-to-consumer advertising of the drug. <em>See e.g. State ex rel. Johnson &amp; Johnson Corp. v.
