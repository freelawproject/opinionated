Longley and Castle Homes present a number of issues for review which will be noted below. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\u00b62 In 2006 Steve and Donna White bought 28 acres near Troy, Montana as the site of their retirement home. Upon the recommendation of a family member they contacted Tom Longley in Washington state about building their home. They met with Longley and showed him drawings and pictures of the type of house they wanted. They toured Longley\u2019s personal house that he had built, and observed the house next door that he also built. Longley gave them a business card identifying himself as the general manager of Castle Homes, LLC, and representing that he was a professional engineer with a doctorate degree. The promotional materials for Castle Homes, LLC contained endorsements by satisfied customers and a biographical sketch that indicated that Longley had earned a Ph. D. in civil engineering from the University of Idaho. Neither Longley nor the materials disclosed that his degree was in agricultural engineering.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">\u00b63 The Whites asked about hiring an architect but Longley told them he could design the house based upon the ideas and images they had provided. After Donna confirmed that Longley\u2019s contractor license in Washington was current and that the Better Business Bureau had no complaints against him or Castle Homes, the Whites believed that they j had found the right contractor to build their home. In January, 2007 I the 'Whites entered a written contract with Longley and Castle Homes. The contract provided that Castle Homes would do the foundation and framing and would contract out the rest of the work. The Wfiiites agreed to pay costs plus 30% and tendered a down payment of $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u00b64 A month later Longley sent a set of drawings depicting the floor plan and exterior views. The District Court found that the drawings contained a \u201cremarkable lack of detail regarding framing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b65 Steve White retired from his job in California and moved to Montana to camp on the property and help work on the house. Jason Ellis, an employee of Longley\u2019s in Washington, volunteered to come to Montana to work on the White house project. Ellis also camped on the property and Steve White became his primary helper, even though Steve had no experience in home building. Longley flew Ellis to Montana and back to Washington weekly in Longley\u2019s personal airplane.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b66 Longley\u2019s initial crew of workers did some foundation work and departed, leaving Ellis to finish the foundation and pour the concrete walls. The project suffered throughout from a lack of skilled workers. While Ellis had years of experience as a carpenter, he was \u201cover his head\u201d trying to build the large and complicated house for the Whites. For example, Longley called for insulated forms to be used to pour concrete walls. Ellis had never worked with these forms, so Longley left an instructional DVD for him along with the materials. While Longley berated Ellis during the weekly flights back to Washington that the work was not progressing fast enough, Ellis would complain that the crew was inadequate and that many mistakes were being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b67 One of the largest problems was that the house had not been adequately designed and that the roof would have to be fitted to the structure once the framing was done. Both Ellis and Steve White saw that there were substantial structural problems, not the least of which was that there would be inadequate support for the heavy roof beams.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayl\">\u00b68 Meanwhile, Donna White, who was then working outside of the United States, became concerned with Longley\u2019s billings. These were coming in increments of $25,000 with little detail. In June, 2007, she returned to Montana and met with Longley and Steve at the property. At that time, in what the District Court described as a \u201cremarkably audacious move,\u201d Longley proposed to the Whites that their best course of action was to pay him $30,000 to \u2018buy out\u201d the written contract with Castle Homes. Longley\u2019s plan was to continue with the project, complete the framing and installation of the windows and winterize the structure. The Whites would then hire the subcontractors to complete the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b69 The Whites paid Longley the $30,000 to \u201cbuy out\u201d the contract, and agreed to keep Longley on the project until the framing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>finished, the windows were in and the house was secured from the weather for the winter. The District Court found that nothing changed and that the \u2018job continued to be understaffed and the work continued to be woefully substandard.\u201d The Whites continued to pay Longley in $25,000 increments in July and August, 2007, when it came time to install the roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b610 Longley never consulted a structural engineer about the structural requirements and installation of the roof, which was complicated by multiple dormers and intersecting angles. Instead he went to Larson Lumber in Troy to order beams and rafters for the project. Larson employees told Longley that the roof system needed to be sufficient to handle a snow load of 80 pounds per square foot, and that specification was sent on to Boise Cascade, which was to manufacture the beams and rafters. Against Larson\u2019s advice, Longley ordered a roof package rated at 40 pounds per square foot, along with custom-made support hangers that would allow the rafters to be attached despite the framing mistakes. When Bonnie Larson at Larson Lumber objected, Longley told her that he was an engineer and that she should butt out.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b611 Longley later blamed Larson and Boise Cascade for the inadequacies in the roof, and for selling him a miscalculated and undersized system. The District Court found \u2018Larson to be believable on this issue and Longley to be unbelievable.\u2019\u2019The District Court found that while it was \u2018inconceivable\u201d that both Larson and Boise Cascade would make such fundamental mistakes with the roof, even if mistakes had been made it was Longley\u2019s duty as the contractor to \u201ccatch the error and send the undersized roof package back.\u201d The District Court concluded that \u2018Longley\u2019s version of the roof transaction is simply not credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b612 Shortly after the roof system arrived on site, Longley and Ellis disagreed on how it should be installed. Ellis quit. The District Court found that by this point the Whites had paid Longley more than $180,000 for a \u201cshoddily constructed unroofed structure.\u201d The Whites hired an engineer from Kalispell to inspect the project and advise them on the status. The engineer wrote a report describing numerous issues with the house and the Whites sent it to Longley. He assured them that he was aware of the issues and that a \u201csuper crew\u201d was on its way to fix the problems and secure the structure for winter. With the information they had, the Whites were concerned about the ability of the structure to support the roof and became unwilling to pay Longley any more money.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u00b613 Longley then threatened to take the Whites to arbitration pursuant to the contract with Castle Homes, even though he had been paid $30,000 at his instigation to \u2018buy out\u201dthat same contract. He told the Whites that he had already talked to an arbitrator about the situation; that their claims would not \u2018hold water;\u201d and that they would have to arbitrate each of their complaints separately. Longley then served the Whites with an arbitration notice. They hired counsel and filed the suit. The District Court enjoined Longley\u2019s attempt at arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b614 On the eve of the trial in the Whites\u2019 lawsuit, they entered a written settlement with Longley. The parties agreed that Longley would hire the same engineer who he had designated as his trial expert to evaluate the structure and recommend corrective measures that Longley would complete. The settlement fell apart when Longley\u2019s engineer also found numerous serious structural problems with the work. Longley would not agree to correct the problems and refused to pay the engineer for his work. The Whites then filed an amended complaint incorporating a claim for breach of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b615 The Whites and Longley tried the case to the District Court sitting without a jury. The District Court\u2019s findings of fact detailed numerous structural issues and poor workmanship with the house that made the \u201csituation unsalvageable.\u201d In just the basement those issues included a foundation \u201csignificantly out of square;\u201d undersized footings with inadequate depth; a bearing wall that misses the foundation poured for it; plumbing pipes intended to be inside a wall located in concrete outside the wall; wire mesh designed to be within the concrete slab to strengthen it located under the slab; structural errors in the floor heating system; door and window headers that are undersized or missing; and rigid foam insulation omitted when the slab was poured. Above the basement, there were too few anchor bolts to attach the sill plate; inferior lumber was used for studs; support posts were not aligned from one floor to the next; support posts were built from scraps of discarded lumber; vertical and horizontal framing members did not butt squarely; and window and door headers were again undersized or missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b616 The District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">It is not just that there is a complete lack of craftsmanship, but the house is structurally compromised from top to bottom. It would be foolish to attach heavy Glulam beams and a roof system on top of this structure and expect that a crew of carpenters could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>go back and repair the pervasive damage caused by inadequate planning and shoddy workmanship in every phase of the construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">The fact of the matter is, however, that the house is a total loss even without considering the roof problem. With or without the undersized roof, the house is a tear down proposition. The evidence convinces the Court that it is doubtful that the deficiencies in this house could be remedied at any price, but it could certainly not be done cost effectively. The only reasonable remedy is to tear this house down, haul it away, and start over again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The District Court awarded the Whites a total of $392,184.32 against Longley and Castle Homes, LLC, jointly and severally. That amount included $100,000 for emotional distress and $62,500 for demolition of the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b617 The district court\u2019s findings of fact will be upheld unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2003 MT 357, \u00b6 23, 319 Mont. 23, 83 P.3d 256. Conclusions of law will be upheld if they are correct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\u00b618 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court properly find that Castle Homes and Longley were in breach of contract with the Whites? </em>One of the District Court\u2019s Conclusions of Law was that 'Longley and Castle Homes breached their contract(s) with the Whites.\u2019\u2019Longley and Castle Homes contend that since there was a \u2018buyout or recission of the written contract\u201d it was error to conclude that there was a breach of both the written and subsequent \u201coral buyout\u201d contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u00b619 Longley and Castle Homes first contend that the issue of the validity of both contracts was not properly raised to the District Court. The pretrial order in this case shows that all relevant contractual issues were raised. The Whites\u2019 issues of fact in the pretrial order included whether Castle Homes breached its contract; whether Longley personally contracted; whether Longley breached his contract; and whether the Whites were damaged by breach of contract. The issues of law listed in the pretrial order included whether the Whites\u2019 claims \u201cshould be only a breach of contract action against Castle Homes; and nothing more.\u201d There is no support for the contention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Longley and Castle Homes that the breach of contract issues were not properly raised in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b620 The position of Longley and Castle Homes on the \u201cbuyout\u201d of the original written contract is unclear. On the one hand they argue that the extra $30,000 the Whites were convinced to pay amounted to a recission of the written contract. On the other, they contend that the Whites were obliged to arbitrate because the written contract provided for arbitration. At best, the \u2018buyout\u201d was, as the District Court found, a \u201cremarkably audacious move\u201d by Longley that conferred no benefit at all to the Whites and for which they paid Longley and Castle Homes an additional $30,000. As the District Court found, \u2018ta]fter the buy out, nothing changed.\u201d The project \u201ccontinued to be understaffed, and the work continued to be woefully substandard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b621  There was clearly no recission of the written contract. A recission requires the rescinding party to \u201crestore to the other party everything of value that the rescinding party has received from the other party under the contract.\u201d Section 28-2-1713(2), MCA; <em>Brunner v. LaCasse, </em>234 Mont. 368, 371, 763 P.2d 662, 664 (1988). There is no evidence that Longley or Castle Homes ever restored the parties to their pre-contract position or offered to do so. If there is no formal recission, a contract may still be terminated or cancelled, thereby being abandoned \u201cas a live and enforceable obligation.\u201d <em>Cruse v. Clawson, </em>137 Mont. 439, 447, 352 P.2d 989, 994 (1960). Termination or cancellation still entitles a party to Took to the contract to determine the compensation he may be entitled to under its terms for the breach which gave him the right of abandonment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b622  After the buyout, the Whites clearly continued in a contractual relationship with Longley individually. The District Court\u2019s findings contain sufficient evidence that Longley breached the contractual obligations he had to the Whites after the buyout.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u00b623 After termination of the written contract, the Whites were still entitled to seek recovery for any damages they suffered for any breach that occurred prior to the termination. There is nothing in the record to show that when the Whites agreed to the buyout they also agreed to forego any damages they had suffered up to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b624 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in concluding that Castle Homes and Longley committed constructive fraud? </em>Longley and Castle Homes argue on appeal that there was insufficient evidence of constructive fraud. They argue that if the Whites were misled it was due to their \u201cown factual misunderstanding\u201d and <em>their </em>failure to disclose everything that they assumed from their dealings with him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Further, Longley and Castle Homes remarkably assert in briefing on appeal that \u201c[a]t no time did Longley practice, offer to practice, or attempt to practice professional engineering in the design or construction of the Whites\u2019 home.\u201d Longley\u2019s representations to the Whites were, according to Longley and Castle Homes, merely puffing.</p>\n<p id=\"Am6\">\u00b625  Longley and Castle Homes present no support for their contention that a party being defrauded has the obligation to inform the defrauder that he is being defrauded. The District Court\u2019s detailed findings describing the deficiencies in the house and the conclusion that it was not salvageable support the truth of Longley\u2019s contention on appeal that he never practiced professional engineering in the design or construction of the Whites\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b626 The District Court made express findings of fact that support the conclusion that Longley engaged in constructive fraud. His written materials featured the fact that he had \u201cPh.D., P.E.\u201d credentials. He told the Whites that he could build the home they envisioned with the budget they had to spend. He answered the Whites\u2019 inquiry about hiring an architect by telling them that he could complete the design of the house. He promoted his \u201ccastle wall\u201d concept of exterior wall insulation that would make the home energy efficient. His written materials contained glowing endorsements that he represented to be from satisfied customers. He furnished supposed construction drawings for the house which were wholly inadequate to guide the construction of the project. He represented that he would provide a sufficient crew of skilled workers to build the house. He failed to disclose to the Whites the inadequacy of his preparation for the project, the inferior materials being used, and the inferior workmanship. He cajoled the Whites into the \u2018buyout\u201d of the written contract, which did not benefit the Whites and cost them an additional $30,000 that went to Longley and Castle Homes. He threatened the Whites with expensive and protracted arbitration, and represented that he had talked to the arbitrator and that the Whites would lose.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b627 Longley failed to disclose to the Whites that the structure was inadequate to support the roof, that the roof was not properly engineered, and that the materials he bought for the roof were inadequate. After deficiencies surfaced, Longley assured the Whites that he would put a \u201csuper crew\u201d on the project and repair any problems. He listed Steve White as the \u201cregistered agent\u201d for Castle Homes, LLC, in filings with the State of Montana, without Steve White\u2019s consent and without Steve White\u2019s knowledge. He threatened the Whites with expensive and protracted arbitration proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>even after taking $30,000 from them to terminate the contract that provided for arbitration. When he needed to do so, Longley blamed others for the problems with the project, including Larson Lumber, Boise Cascade, and the Whites themselves. As the District Court found, Longley \u201cmisrepresented his ability to assist in the design of the Whites\u2019 home and to provide a skilled crew to construct the home according to applicable industry standards. When problems were pointed out to Longley, he misrepresented the seriousness of the problems and his ability to fix them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b628 Constructive fraud is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">(1) any breach of duty that, without an actually fraudulent intent, gains an advantage to the person in fault or anyone claiming under the person in fault by misleading another person to that person\u2019s prejudice or to the prejudice of anyone claiming under that person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">(2) any act or omission that the law especially declares to be fraudulent, without respect to actual fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Section 28-2-406, MCA. This Court has determined that a prima facie case of constructive fraud rests upon establishing a representation; the falsity of the representation; the materiality of the representation; the speaker\u2019s knowledge of the representation\u2019s falsity or ignorance of its truth; the hearer\u2019s ignorance of the representation\u2019s falsity; the hearer\u2019s reliance upon the truth of the representation; the hearer\u2019s right to rely upon the representation; and the hearer\u2019s consequent and proximate injury or damage caused by reliance on the representation. <em>Town of Geraldine v. Mt. Municipal Ins. Auth., </em>2008 MT 411, \u00b6 28, 347 Mont. 267, 198 P.3d 796. The District Court applied these standards in concluding that Longley committed constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b629  It is clear from the facts that Longley knowingly made any number of material representations about the Whites\u2019 house project that induced them to trust him and to invest substantial sums of money with him. Longley knew exactly what was going on. He knew the limits of his own qualifications and abilities. He knew the deficiencies in the project because they were obvious to any experienced contractor and because his crew foreman Ellis told him. There is abundant evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">\u00b630 <em>Issue Three: Whether the District Court properly concluded that Tom Longley was jointly and severally liable along with Castle </em>Homes, <em>LLC, to the Whites. </em>The District Court found that Longley as a general contractor owed a duty of care to the Whites to produce a home built <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to industry standards, and that he breached that duty. The District Court found that Longley misrepresented to the Whites his ability to assist in the design on the house and to provide skilled workers to construct the home. When problems arose during the construction, Longley misrepresented the seriousness of them and his ability and willingness to fix them.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b631 Longley described himself in an affidavit filed in the District Court as the \u201coperating manager, owner, principal, and sole member of defendant Castle Homes, LLC.\u201d The Whites dealt solely with Tom Longley and the District Court found that \u201cas far as the Whites were concerned, they hired Tom <em>Longley\u201d to </em>build their house. The District Court found that in \u201cvirtually every aspect... Castle Homes and Tom Longley are indistinguishable.\u2019\u2019Longley acknowledged that he had the power to contract for Castle Homes and that he was responsible for doing the construction work on the Whites\u2019 home for Castle Homes. Longley acknowledged that on behalf of Castle he accepted and retained the $30,000 the Whites paid to buy out the Castle Homes contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b632 Longley, however, contends that he bears no personal liability to the Whites because he was only the agent of Castle Homes, LLC. According to Longley, imposing personal liability on him \u201ceviscerates protections afforded to\u201d him and will \u201cundo decades of law protecting those who properly form and operate commercial entities.\u201d These contentions are based upon the fact that Longley organized Castle Homes as a limited liability company.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b633 Castle Homes was organized as a Washington Limited Liability Company. Tom Longley registered Castle Homes, LLC, with the Montana Secretary of State, listing Steve White as Castle Homes\u2019 registered agent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Castle Homes was a foreign LLC operating in Montana, we apply Montana law to this issue. Under \u00a735-8-1008(2), MCA, a foreign LLC with a certificate of authority to do business in Montana is subject to the same \u201cduties, restrictions, penalties, and liabilities imposed on a domestic limited liability company of similar character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b634 Statutory recognition of limited liability companies is relatively new, and the first LLC statutes were enacted in Wyoming in 1977. Section 35-8-101, MCA, <em>Official Comments. </em>Montana adopted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Limited Liability Company Act, \u00a735-8-101, et seq., MCA in 1993 and has since amended it to substantially follow the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (1996). Section 35-8-101, MCA, <em>Official Comments. </em>The intent of the LLC form of organization is to provide a corporate-styled liability shield with pass-through tax benefits of a partnership. Section 35-8-101, MCA, <em>Official Comments. </em>There is little law on LLCs in Montana, although this Court has recognized them as legal entities distinct from their members, with obligations separate from their members, <em>Ioerger v. Reiner, </em>2005 MT 155, \u00b6 20, 327 Mont. 424, 114 P.3d 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b635 While individual liability limitation is an aspect of the LLC form of business organization, there is wide-spread acknowledgement that individual members of an LLC may be subjected to personal liability. Steven C. Bahls, <em>Application of Corporate Common Law Doctrines to Limited Liability Companies, </em>55 Mont. L. Rev. 44, 59-66 (1994). This is reflected in both the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (1996), \u00a7303 and the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (2006), \u00a7304. 6B Thomson, West, <em>Uniform Laws Annotated, </em>475, 597 (2008). Both of those sections provide that a member or manager of an LLC is not personally liable for an obligation of the company <em>solely </em>by reason of being or acting as a member or manager. The comments to the uniform acts make it clear that the intent of this language is that \u201ca member or manager is responsible for acts or omissions to the extent those acts or omissions would be actionable in contract or tort against the member or manager if that person were acting in an individual capacity.\u201d Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (1996), \u00a7 303, Comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b636 The Montana LLC Act reflects the liability language of the 1996 Uniform Act. Section 35-8-304, MCA, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">A person who is a member or manager, or both, of a limited liability company is not liable, <em>solely by reason of being a member or manager, </em>or both, under a judgment, decree or order of a court, or in any other manner, for a debt, obligation, or liability of the limited liability company, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise or for the acts or omissions of any other member, manager, agent, or employee of the limited liability company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afn\">(Emphasis added.) The District Court applied this statute, concluding that the basis for Tom Longley\u2019s individual liability was not \u201csolely by reason of his being a member or manager\u201d of the LLC, but was based upon his own conduct. The District Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">The Court does not read this statute as immunizing members or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>managers of an LLC from personal liability for their conduct. If an LLC has a liability, the member or manager cannot be held liable \u201csolely by reason of being a member or manager, or both,\u2019\u2019but that language does not offer blanket protection from liability for a member or manager\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">The Whites have been damaged by Longley. Castle Homes was nothing more than the entity through which Whites\u2019 checks were tunneled. The Court concludes that Longley should be jointly and severally liable for the Whites\u2019 damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b637 Contrary to Longley\u2019s contentions, the Limited Liability Company Act does not offer blanket protection from liability to a member of an LLC for the member\u2019s own conduct, and there are not \u201cdecades\u201d of precedent establishing any such protection. Section 35-8-304, MCA, merely provides that a member or manager may not be personally liable based \u201csolely\u201d upon being a member or manager. The Official Comments to \u00a735-8-304, MCA, adopted from the comments to \u00a7303 of the Uniform 1996 Act, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">A member or manager is responsible for acts or omissions to the extent those acts or omissions would be actionable in contract or tort against the member or manager if that person were acting in an individual capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The Official Comments are helpful in construing the statute. The Comments support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Tom Longley could be held liable to the Whites because his own conduct would have exposed him to liability \u2018if [he] were acting in an individual capacity.\u201d We therefore construe \u00a7 35-8-304, MCA, to allow personal liability against a member or manager of an LLC based upon contract or tort if the member or manager would be liable if acting in an individual capacity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\u00b638  In the present case the District Court found ample evidence that Tom Longley\u2019s own acts or omissions in the construction of the Whites\u2019 house damaged them and were actionable against him individually in both contract and tort. Under \u00a7 35-8-304, MCA, this removes any protection from liability that Longley might otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>have based upon the organization of Castle Homes as a limited liability company.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b639 The District Court\u2019s decision to impose joint and several liability on Tom Longley and Castle Homes, LLC, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b640 <em>Issue Four: Whether the District Court erred in staying arbitration. </em>As noted above, when the Whites began to question the quality of the construction, Longley threatened to institute arbitration as provided in the written contract. He did this after he had talked the Whites into paying him $30,000 to terminate that same contract. Just before the Whites filed their complaint, Longley served notice of arbitration proceedings. On October 16, 2007 the District Court entered an order staying the arbitration proceeding. Nothing else occurred on the arbitration issue until April, 2009 shortly before the original trial date when Longley moved to compel arbitration. After considering the arguments of the parties the District Court denied Longley s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AxF\">\u00b641  This issue is simply disposed of by the fact that the only basis for arbitration was a provision in the original written contract. Longley and Castle Homes received $30,000 from the Whites to terminate the parties\u2019 on-going obligations under that contract. There was no legal or factual basis upon which Longley could compel the Whites to arbitrate any of their disputes and the District Court\u2019s order denying arbitration was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b642 <em>Issue Five: Whether the District Court erred in admitting improperly disclosed expert testimony. </em>Longley and Castle Homes contend that the District Court improperly admitted testimony from the Whites\u2019 engineering experts concerning the training and experience required to practice as a professional engineer. The Whites called John Thomas as an expert witness at trial, and opened his testimony by asking him to describe the education and experience required for practicing professional engineering. As is customary and required for qualifying an expert witness, Thomas described the training requirements for certification as a professional engineer, the separation of the practice of engineering into specialties by training, and his own background and training. He then testified in detail as to the defects in the construction of the Whites\u2019 house, and rendered his opinion that it did not meet the reasonable standard of care for a \u2018builder/engineer.\u201d The Whites also presented similar expert engineering testimony of Marc Waatti, which was received without objection at trial or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b643 Longley and Castle Homes contend on appeal that the District Court improperly allowed the portion of Thomas\u2019 testimony in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>he described the education and experience requirements for a professional engineer, and the branches and specialties of professional engineering. Longley and Castle Homes contend that the Whites did not adequately disclose prior to trial that Thomas would be giving this testimony and that they were unfairly surprised by it. As stated in a Longley-Castle Homes brief on appeal: 'The court committed clear error in permitting Thomas to testify to general qualifications and standards of engineers.\u201d They further claim that: \u2018Thomas\u2019 previously undisclosed testimony, regarding engineering ethics and the standard of care for engineers, was disastrously damaging to Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b644 Longley and Castle Homes appended to their brief Thomas\u2019 two reports on the Whites\u2019 house and the many structural defects he found. These reports were disclosed to Longley and Castle Homes prior to trial, and they comply with the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) concerning disclosure of experts\u2019 opinions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 26(b)(4) does not specifically require disclosure of an expert\u2019s training and experience nor does it require disclosure of an explanation of the nature of the expert\u2019s area of expertise. While Longley and Castle Homes might have obtained this information through specific interrogatories or by deposing the Whites\u2019 experts, nothing in the record indicates that they did either. Therefore, Longley and Castle Homes have failed to establish that the Whites failed to comply with any pre-trial disclosure obligation concerning Thomas\u2019 testimony about engineering.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b645 In addition, the record of Thomas\u2019 testimony concerning the education and experience requirements for a professional engineer, and the branches and specialties of professional engineering does not contain any objection from Longley and Castle Homes based upon surprise or prior failure to disclose. The only objections lodged during this portion of Thomas\u2019 testimony were based on relevance and that a question was leading. Because there was no relevant objection to this portion of Thomas\u2019 testimony, we need not further consider the Longley and Castle Homes contentions. We find no basis for concluding that the District Court erred on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b646 <em>Issue Six: Whether the District Court erred in awarding damages to the Whites for emotional </em>distress. Longley and Castle Homes contend that the District Court erred in awarding emotional distress damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>to the Whites in a contract action. They additionally contend that the proof of emotional distress did not rise to the level required by Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b647 Section 27-1-310, MCA, excludes recovery for emotional distress in contract actions unless the plaintiff sustains actual physical injury. The District Court found Longley and Castle Homes liable to the Whites on claims of negligence and constructive fraud. Since the basis of their recovery was not limited to contract, the statute does not preclude the award of emotional distress damages. As to obligations not arising from contract, a party may recover damages in \u201cthe amount that will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused ....\u201d Section 27-1-317, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b648 Longley and Castle Homes rely on <em>First Bank v. Clark, </em>236 Mont. 195, 771 P.2d 84 (1989) and <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, </em>271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411 (1995) for the proposition that emotional distress damages can be recovered only where there is a substantial invasion of a legally protected interest causing serious or severe emotional distress. <em>Sacco </em>applies only to independent causes of action for infliction of emotional distress, and not to emotional distress claimed as an element of damage arising from a different cause of action (sometimes called \u201cparasitic claims\u201d for emotional distress). <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 66, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649. <em>First Bank </em>was overruled on the emotional distress issue in <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 66, where this Court held that there is no heightened threshold standard for parasitic emotional distress claims, and that the severity of the distress affects the amount of damages recovered but not the underlying entitlement to recover. <em>Jacobsen </em>also endorsed the damage instructions in Montana Pattern Jury Instructions 2d, 25.02, as containing a correct statement of the law. That instruction provides, in part, that there is no \u201cdefinite standard by which to calculate compensation for mental and emotional suffering and distress.\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b649 Here the District Court found that \u201cthere is no doubt that the Whites suffered greatly as they watched their dream turn into a nightmare.\u201d The Whites testified as to stress, anxiety and depression they have suffered arising from dealing with the house- building fiasco. They have had to live apart after Steve White had to abandon retirement and return to California to work again.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b650  There was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s award of damages for emotional distress, and the District Court\u2019s award met the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u00b651 <em>Issue Seven: Whether the District Court erred awarding damages for demolition costs. </em>Longley and Castle Homes contend that there was insufficient evidence to support the District Court\u2019s award of $62,500 to pay for demolition of the house. The District Court found that the construction of the house was so substandard that it could not reasonably be repaired, and that the Whites would have to tear down Longley5 s structure and start over. At trial the Whites presented an estimate of $62,500 they received from Mack Excavating in Troy, Montana, for the cost of demolition of the existing structure and hauling away the debris. Longley and Castle Homes did not object to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b652  Based upon this evidence that was received by the District Court without objection, there is substantial evidence to support the award of demolition costs as an element of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b653 The District Court\u2019s \u2018Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc\u201d are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\"> White did not sign the registration documents and Longley never notified White that he had designated him as the registered agent for Castle Homes.

See <em>e.g. </em>Bahls, 59-66. Because \u00a735-8-304, MCA, clearly does not establish blanket liability protection for members of LLCs, and because the intent of that section is to allow liability in a situation in which the member acting individually would be liable, it is not necessary to engraft the veil piercing law from the corporate arena to resolve this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> M.

Extensive testimony and materials were provided to the legislative committees which considered the LLC business form and ultimately enacted authorizing legislation during the 1993 Legislative Session. Law professor Steven Bahls testified that \u2018tojwners of limited liability companies, like corporate shareholders, are generally not liable for the debts of the limited liability company.... <em>Exceptions </em>include when owners guarantee debts of a LLC or <em>when owners personally commit wrongs while acting for an LLC.... </em>For both of these exceptions, owners will be <em>personally liable </em>for the debts or damages.\u201dMont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on Sen. Bill 146, </em>Exhibit 3, 53rd Legis., Reg. Sess. 3-4 (January 21, 1993) (emphasis added) (testimony of Steven Bahls, Associate Dean and Professor, University of Montana School of Law). Presciently, he also provided an example involving the same factual scenario at issue in the case before us: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on Sen. Bill 146, </em>Exhibit 3 at 6 (emphasis added); <em>accord </em>Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on Sen. Bill 146, </em>Exhibit 5,53rd Legis., Reg. Sess. 7 (January 21,1993) (Executive Summary, Questions and Answers About Limited Liability Companies). Further, other courts examining this issue have reached the same conclusion. <em>See People v. Pac. Landmark, LLC, </em>129 Cal. App. 4th 1203, 1213, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 193, 199 (2d Dist. 2005) (\u201cwe hold that whereas managers of limited liability companies may not be held liable for the wrongful conduct of the companies <em>merely </em>because of the managers\u2019 status, they may nonetheless be held accountable ... for their personal participation in tortious or criminal conduct, even when performing their duties as manager\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>For example, assume a construction company has become a limited liability company.
