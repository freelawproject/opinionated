Reichmand appeals from the conviction, from the restitution condition of his sentence, and from the District Court\u2019s denial of his post-trial motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">\u00b62 On appeal we consider whether our recent decision in <em>State v. </em>Goetz, 2008 MT 296, 345 Mont. 421, 191 P.3d 489, should be retroactively applied to Reichmand\u2019s direct appeal and, if so, whether Reichmand\u2019s conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">\u00b63 In August 2007, officers working with the Southwest Montana Drug Task Force began investigating whether Reichmand was selling drugs from his residence in Butte, Montana. Officers recruited Terry Chor to act as an undercover agent to make drug purchases. On August 21,2007, Chor arranged to make a drug buy from Reichmand. Agents searched Chor and his vehicle, gave him money to make the buy, and equipped him with a transmitter that allowed agents off-site to hear and record Chor\u2019s conversations. On August 24, 2007, Chor again bought ten morphine tablets for $35 each. Agents listened to and recorded Chor\u2019s conversations during both transactions. Chor and the listening agents testified at the March 2008 trial. The recordings were played to the jury several times during the course of the trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>officers did not obtain a search warrant authorizing use of the electronic monitoring. Reichmand did not testify or present any other evidence at trial. His defense centered on his contention that he was misidentified as the person who sold drugs to Chor.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b64 A jury found Reichmand guilty of two counts of felony Criminal Distribution of Dangerous Drugs. On September 5, 2008-after the verdict but two weeks before the scheduled sentencing hearing-Reichmand filed a motion to set aside the jury verdict based on our decision in <em>Goetz, </em>which was announced on August 20, 2008. The parties submitted briefs on the motion, including supplemental briefs addressing this Court\u2019s latest decision <em>in State v. Foster-DeBerry, </em>2008 MT 397, 347 Mont. 164, 197 P.3d 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b65 On December 3, 2008, the District Court denied the motion, relying on <em>Foster-DeBerry, </em>in which the defendant\u2019s appeal was pending when <em>Goetz </em>was decided. Foster-DeBerry asked this Court to remand her case so that she could present a Goetz-based challenge to the warrantless recording of her conversations during a police investigation. We concluded that she was not entitled to the benefits of retroactive application of <em>Goetz </em>because her case was not \"similarly situated\u201d for purposes of a newly-announced rule. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8. <em>Foster-DeBerry </em>defined \"similarly situated\u201d as having raised the issue addressed by the new rule at the trial court level, thereby preserving it for appeal. <em>Id. </em>Utilizing this reasoning from <em>Foster-DeBerry, </em>the District Court concluded that Reichmand had failed to assert a <em>Goetz-</em>type claim prior to or during trial and was therefore precluded from arguing that he is \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to the defendant in <em>Goetz. </em>Reichmand now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b66 Reichmand\u2019s appeal requires us to consider the retroactivity of <em>State v. Goetz, </em>which is a question of law. We review questions of law de novo. <em>In re Fair Hearing of Hanna, </em>2010 MT 38, \u00b6 13, 355 Mont. 236, 227 P.3d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\u00b67 <em>I. Did the District Court err in not granting Reichmand\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the retroactive application of the holding in </em>State v. Goetz?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">\n<em>A. Appellate review.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">\u00b68 As an initial matter, we pause to consider our ability to review this issue on appeal. Questions of retroactivity may implicate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>number of doctrines, such as plain error review, which allow appellate courts to consider issues that were not presented in the lower court. Given the requirement in our statues that the defendant must object to an alleged error \u201cat trial\u201d in order to preserve his rights to appeal, it would seem that we might need to rely on one of these doctrines to review the present case. Reichmand objected in the lower court several months after the verdict was pronounced, and the language of \u00a746-20-701(2)(a) and \u00a746-20-104(2), MCA, greatly restricts appellate review unless objections are made \u201cat the time of trial\u201d or \u201cduring trial,\u201d respectively. We interpret \u201ctrial\u201d here, however, to encompass the entire proceeding in the lower court, and thus may proceed directly to evaluating the retroactivity of <em>Ooetz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b69 This interpretation of \u201cat trial\u201d is supported by the underlying rationale of these statutes-that it is \u2018fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>State v. Gomez, </em>2007 MT 111, \u00b6 21, 337 Mont. 219, 158 P.3d 442, quoting State <em>v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 17, 314 Mont. 434, 67 P.3d 207. Where the trial court <em>was </em>given an opportunity to rule on the issue, as here, then the objection has been made \u201cat trial\u201d and the defendant has properly preserved the issue for review by this Court. <em>State v. Waters, </em>1999 MT 229, \u00b6 24, 296 Mont. 101, 987 P.2d 1142 (interpreting \u00a746-20-104(2), MCA, as extending through sentencing); see also Commission Comments to \u00a746-20-104, MCA, at 1067 (2010 Annotations) (emphasizing that the appellate court has the authority to \u201cdecide all questions raised by the entire proceeding, below\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b610 Objecting below at trial is a general requirement of appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>procedure. The District Court ruled that Reichmand was precluded from the retroactive application of <em>Goetz </em>because he failed to object at trial and thus he was not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d under the rule from <em>Foster-DeBerry. </em>As mentioned <em>shove, Foster-DeBerry </em>defined \u2018Similarly situated\u201d as having raised the issue addressed by the new rule at the trial court level, thereby preserving it for appeal. Although we conclude that Reichmand objected \u201cat trial\u201d below, since the District Court based its conclusion on the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d standard in <em>Foster-DeBerry, </em>we take this opportunity to address <em>Foster-DeBerry\u2019s </em>place in our retroactivity jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b611 In previous <em>Goetz </em>retroactivity decisions, we have interpreted \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to be a retroactivity-specific requirement. We first addressed the retroactivity of <em>Goetz </em>in <em>Foster-DeBerry, </em>where we relied on <em>State v. Zivcic, </em>229 Wis. 2d 119, 124-25, 598 N.W.2d 565, 568 (Wis. App. 1999), for the proposition that \u201csimilarly situated\u201d means having raised the same objection below. The Wisconsin court\u2019s definition of \u201csimilarly situated\u201d in <em>Zivcic </em>was itself based on an invocation of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 107 S. Ct. 708 (1987). On closer examination, however, <em>Griffith </em>does not appear to support the Wisconsin court\u2019s position, and it becomes clear that both <em>Griffith </em>and <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989), used \u201csimilarly situated\u201d only to justify retroactive <em>and </em>prospective application of new rules of procedure. The majority in <em>Griffith </em>used \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to explain why the Court\u2019s past policy of excluding \u201cclear break\u201d new rules from retroactive application was inequitable. In <em>Teague, </em>the Court used \u201csimilarly situated\u201dto describe how defendants who were still in the same direct appeals pipeline as the defendant in whose case the new rule was announced were denied the benefit of the new rule once their own cases reached the Supreme Court. These usages make clear that the Court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csimilarly situated\u201d is nothing more than a compelling rationale for retroactive application of new rules, rather than limiting new rules to prospective application after the decision is handed down. Thus, it does not appear that there is any convincing support in either the federal rules of retroactivity we have adopted, or in Montana\u2019s own subsequent retroactivity jurisprudence, for interpreting \u201csimilarly situated\u201das having objected below. We therefore overrule our decisions in <em>Foster-DeBerry </em>and <em>State v. Foston, </em>2009 MT 191, 351 Mont. 85, 209 P.3d 262, insofar as they require an appellant-within the rules of retroactivity-to have raised a Goetz-type objection at trial in order for <em>Goetz to </em>apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u00b612 [1] In conclusion, there is a general rale of appellate procedure that in order to preserve an issue for appeal, the appellant must have raised the issue \u201cat trial.\u201d In the context of retroactivity jurisprudence, however, there is no independent requirement that the appellant have objected below, as <em>Foster-DeBerry </em>suggests. In order to be \u201csimilarly situated\u201d for purposes of retroactivity, the defendant merely has to show that his case is pending on direct review or not yet final.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><em>B. The retroactivity of </em>Goetz.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b613 We next review the District Court\u2019s ruling that Reichmand was not entitled to a new trial as a result of the retroactive application of <em>Goetz. </em>This is a question of law, which we review de novo. Retroactivity jurisprudence in Montana is closely intertwined with federal law. The U.S. Supreme Court recently held that each state has the right to craft its own unique retroactivity jurisprudence, using federal requirements as a floor. <em>Danforth v. Minnesota, 552 </em>U.S. 264, 128 S. Ct. 1029 (2008). That is, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s retroactivity analysis for <em>federal </em>constitutional errors is binding upon the states when <em>federal </em>constitutional errors are involved. Danforth\u2019s unequivocal grant of flexibility allows states to hand-pick retroactivity rules for application of new <em>state </em>rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b614 In <em>State v. Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. 114, 900 P.2d 260 (1995), we chose to adopt two such rules from <em>Griffith </em>and <em>Teague </em>and applied them to our own retroactive application of new state rules. We held that the following retroactivity principles were binding on the Montana Supreme Court. First: \u201c[A] new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21 (citing <em>Griffith, </em>479 U.S. at 328, 107 S. Ct. at 716). Second: \u2018tOjnce a new rule is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rale, evenhanded justice requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22 (citing <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 300-01, 109 S. Ct. at 1070). We then held that these new rules would apply retroactively to cases still subject to final decision on direct review as of the date of the opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b615  Thus, <em>Goetz </em>will retroactively apply to Reichmand if the requirements established in <em>Egelhoff </em>are met. As <em>Goetz </em>clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>announces a new rule, and Reichmand\u2019s case is pending on direct review, not yet final, and thus \u201csimilarly situated,\u201d we conclude that the requirements in <em>Egelhoff </em>are satisfied. The District Court erred in determining that <em>Goetz </em>was not retroactively applicable to Reichmand. We must next determine whether this error requires a reversal of Reichmand\u2019s conviction. When a trial court commits an error, the record must show that the error was \u201cprejudicial,\u201d i.e. not harmless, or we cannot reverse. MCA \u00a746-20-701. Thus, we will not overturn the District Court despite its incorrect conclusion that <em>Goetz </em>was not retroactive to Reichmand unless this error prejudiced Reichmand\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b616 To determine whether an error is \u201cprejudicial,\u201d we employ the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test set out in <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><em>C. Prejudicial error under </em>Van Kirk.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b617 The first step is to determine whether the claimed error is \u201cstructural\u201derror or \u201ctrial\u201derror. Structural errors are those that affect the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than an error in the trial process itself. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 38. These errors undermine the fairness of the entire proceeding. Examples include errors in jury selection, total deprivation to right to counsel, and lack of an impartial judge. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 38. These structural errors are presumptively prejudicial and are automatically reversible. In contrast, \u201ctrial\u201d errors occur during the presentation of the case to the jury. Trial errors are amenable to qualitative assessment by a reviewing court for prejudicial impact. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 40. Reichmand\u2019s alleged error is a trial error. It was an error occurring during the presentation of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b618  Because we have determined that the error in this case was a \u201ctrial\u201d error, the next step in the <em>Van Kirk </em>analysis is to determine whether the error was prejudicial. When inadmissible evidence is introduced and the convicted person alleges prejudice, the burden shifts to the State. The State must then satisfy a two-part test. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44; <em>State v. Peplow, </em>2001 MT 253, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 307 Mont. 172, 36 P.3d 922. First, the State must show that \u201cthe fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved <em>the same facts as the tainted evidence proved.\u201d </em>Second, the State must demonstrate that \u201cthe <em>quality </em>of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-44 (emphasis in original). As we observed in <em>Van Kirk, </em>this new test is \u2018inarguably more restrictive\u201d than our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>previous \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d test. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b619 The audiotape recordings oftwo separate drug transactions, made by wiring a confidential informant, are inadmissible under <em>Goetz </em>and thus \u2018tainted.\u201d The recordings or portions of the recordings were played for the jury on three separate occasions during the trial. First, the State played the August 21, 2007 recording of the transaction during Agent David Clark\u2019s testimony. Second, the State played the recording of the August 24, 2007 transaction during the same direct examination of Agent Clark. Third, the State played the audiotape during rebuttal closing. Thus, the State will first need to show that it submitted relevant evidence to prove the same facts as were proved by these recordings, and then will need to show that the \u201cquality\u201d of the recordings was such that there was no reasonable possibility that they might have contributed to Reichmand\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b620 The first recording contains audio of the confidential informant Chor entering the house, asking \u2018Is Dallas home?\u201d After a few seconds of silence, Chor asks the other person, \u2018You got six?\u201d He responds, \u2018Yeah, I got six.\u201d He then counts from one hundred, concluding with \u201ctwo hundred and ten.\u201d Chor can then be heard counting twenty dollar bills: \u201cOne, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Two hundred.\u201d He then asks: \u201cAnd ten?\u201d Chor then presumably hands him the money, saying: \u2018Here you go, buddy.\u201d The rest of the tape seems to be small talk followed by Chor\u2019s exit from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b621 The second recording is of the August 24, 2007 transaction. One can hear Chor knock on the door, enter, and say: \u2018Dallas, do you have ten?\u201dTo which the other person responds, \u2018Yeah.\u201dChor responds: \u2018Ok, I\u2019ll take ten.\u201d After the two briefly struggle to get the math right, the other person eventually adds up the amount: \u2018Thirty-five and ten is three hundred and fifty.\u201d Chor counts in tens from forty, ending with three hundred and fifty. The other person can be heard saying, \u201cMan, you are good. Here, have a cigarette.\u201d Chor asks for a beverage, the other person briefly disappears out of the Cl\u2019s microphone range, and then returns to count out one through ten (presumably doling out tablets of morphine). Chor says, \u2018Thank you very much. I\u2019m out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b622 The jury heard the audio transcribed above during direct examination and during closing. Thus, we consider whether the fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved these same facts. We conclude that the jury <em>was </em>presented with evidence that proved these same facts, through the testimony of Chor, the confidential informant. On direct examination, Chor testified that he set up the August 21, 2007 transaction, went to the residence, bought the pills, and returned to meet the Task Force at a predetermined location. Chor also testified that on August 24, 2007, he bought ten pills from Dallas. Chor\u2019s testimony was admissible and proved, generally, the same facts as the tainted evidence did.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b623 We therefore move to the second inquiry under <em>Van Kirk\u2019s </em>harmless error analysis: was the <em>quality </em>of the tainted evidence such that there was no reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction? <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 44. It is important here to note that the inquiry does not require us to definitively say whether or not the tainted evidence <em>actually </em>influenced the jury\u2019s decision to convict. Rather, the question is whether the State can show there is no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence <em>might </em>have contributed to the conviction. As we stated in <em>Van Kirk, </em>and we reemphasize now, this is a very high bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b624 The State\u2019s argument regarding this prong is brief and unpersuasive. The State admits that it used the recordings in response to Reichmand\u2019s defense of misidentification: \u2018The primary use of the recordings to refute this defense was to <em>confirm </em>Chor had used the name \u2018Dallas\u2019 to refer to the supplier of the morphine tablets.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The recordings <em>confirmed </em>Chor\u2019s testimony, likely bolstering his credibility in the minds of the jurors. Given that the defense had turned a spotlight on Chor\u2019s potential ulterior motives, his shaky mental capacity, and his inability to remember parts of the transactions or names of officers he worked with, there is no doubt the recordings \u201cpossibly\u201dinfluenced the outcome. The recordings provided the jurors with just what they needed in order to fully believe Chor: actual, objectively reliable recordings of everything that happened during both transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b625 The recordings also filled in chronological gaps in the testimony of the agents who, without the recordings, could only testify to how they prepared Chor for the transactions and their observations of Chor when he again met with agents after the transactions. They could not see the back entry of the house or observe the drug transactions inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the house. The circumstantial evidence was far from conclusive. Chor and the agents all testified that there were other people in the residence at the time of both transactions. The recordings of both transactions constituted objective and qualitatively superior evidence for the jury to compare against Chor\u2019s testimony about the details of the transactions and his identification of Dallas as the dealer. The recordings also filled in large holes in the agents\u2019 testimony regarding the most critical part of the case: the transaction itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b626  It is hard to imagine that after hearing the recordings, a juror would not be more convinced that what Chor claimed happened actually did happen. The State admits to using the recordings as a means of corroborating Chor\u2019s testimony. The state not only played and emphasized both recordings on direct, but also replayed a portion of the recording in its rebuttal closing. That recording was the sole piece of evidence the State presented again to the jury during closing arguments. In light of the above facts, the State has failed to demonstrate there is no reasonable possibility that the recordings might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b627 The State has not met its burden under <em>Van Kirk, </em>and thus the error is prejudicial and \u201creversal is compelled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 45. We reverse Reichmand\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial. Because we find that he is entitled to a new trial, we need not reach the other issues Reichmand presents for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b628 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\"> In his dissent, Justice Rice cites three cases for the proposition that post-trial objections do not properly preserve an issue for appeal. <em>State v. McWilliams, </em>2008 MT 59, \u00b6\u00b6 43-47, 341 Mont. 517, 178 P.3d 121; <em>State v. Misner, </em>2007 MT 235, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 339 Mont. 176, 168 P.3d 679; <em>State v. Grace, </em>2001 MT 22, \u00b6 35, 304 Mont. 144, 18 P.3d 1008. In each of these cases, we denied appellate review for failure to object contemporaneously to allegedly objectionable material in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, citing our longstanding rule that an objection \u201cmust be made as soon as the grounds for the objection become apparent\u201d in order to timely preserve the issue for appeal. <em>McWilliams, </em>\u00b6 45, citing <em>Grace; Misner, </em>\u00b6 24, citing <em>Grace; Grace, </em>\u00b6 35, citing <em>State v. Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. 430, 442, 949 P.2d 239, 247 (1997). In the cited cases, because the grounds for the objection became apparent during the closing argument, we properly applied the rule to block appellate review of post-verdict objections made by the defense.

Second, the fact that warrantless electronic surveillance evidence was admitted and used at trial should be a sufficient prima facie showing that it was prejudicial to the finding of Reichmand\u2019s guilt, meeting another requirement of the statute. Third, the rights determined by <em>Goetz </em>did not exist at the time of Reichmand\u2019s trial, and <em>Goetz </em>has now been determined to be retroactive, meeting the last requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b631 It is clear that \u00a746-20-701(2)(a), MCA allows this Court to \u201cnotice\u201d Reichmand\u2019s <em>Goetz </em>issue on appeal and to determine whether use of the warrantless electronic surveillance evidence against him warrants reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b632 <em>Goetz </em>is substantially similar to this case legally and factually.

The Court\u2019s faulty analysis leads to use of a harmless error analysis instead of a plain error analysis which should be used under the plain error statute-particularly in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the statute\u2019s legislative history, which the Court also ignores. Applying the correct analysis, I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b635 The Court\u2019s analysis confuses two different issues. Under the law, the retroactivity of a new constitutional principle is completely distinct from the questions of whether a defendant has preserved the issue for appeal, whether this Court should take up the issue, and under what standards to do so. These concerns ask whether this Court should address Reichmand\u2019s <em>Goetz </em>issue for the first time on appeal where he failed to raise the argument to the District Court before or during his trial. The law is clear that retroactive application of a new constitutional rule does not relieve a defendant\u2019s obligation to preserve the issue for appeal-even under the plain error statute. This principle was recognized recently by the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">Petitioner is not correct that retroactivity extends to cases where, as here, the issue was not properly preserved for appeal. The Montana Supreme Court is not <em>required </em>to recognize and address errors that were not objected to at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\"><em>Paranteau v. </em>Mahoney, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66634 at * 7 (D. Mont. Apr. 8, 2010) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b636 The Court\u2019s error begins with its application of \u00a746-20-701(2), MCA. We have explained that this provision is Montana\u2019s \u201cplain error statute\u201d which mirrors the federal plain error doctrine and \u201ccodified the common law doctrine of plain error.\u201d <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 132-33, 915 P.2d 208, 212-13 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. The Court acknowledges that the plain error statute \u201cgreatly restricts appellate review unless objections are made \u2018at the time of trial\u2019 or \u2018during trial,\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 8, but then, without acknowledging our canons of statutory construction and our contrary precedent, simply leaps to the conclusion that the phrases \u201cat the time of trial\u201d and \u201cduring trial\u201d actually can mean \u201cfive months after trial,\u201d or, apparently, any time after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u00b637 It is necessary to once again repeat the law\u2019s instruction to us about statutory interpretation. The Court renders its interpretation without employing the law\u2019s guides-apparently because they are facially contradictory to the Court\u2019s interpretation. \u2018In ascertaining legislative intent, we look first to the <em>plain meaning </em>of the words used.\u201d <em>State v. Stanczak, </em>2010 MT 106, \u00b6 17, 356 Mont. 263, 232 P.3d 896 (citing <em>Van Der Hule v. Mukasey, </em>2009 MT 20, \u00b6 10, 349 Mont. 88, 217 P.3d 1019) (emphasis added). \u2018During trial\u201dplainly means \u201cduring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>trial\u201d-not five months after trial concludes. Indeed, the Court\u2019s repeated use of quotation marks when stating its holding that Reichmand objected \u201cat trial,\u201dis a wink to the reader that this holding is directly contrary to the statute\u2019s plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b638 It is also directly contrary to our precedent. Consistent with the statutes, our cases clearly hold that post-trial objections do not properly preserve an issue for appeal, but are waived. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA, <em>State v. McWilliams, </em>2008 MT 59, \u00b6\u00b6 43-47, 341 Mont. 517, 178 P.3d 121; <em>State v. Misner, </em>2007 MT 235, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 339 Mont. 176, 168 P.3d 679; <em>State v. Grace, </em>2001 MT 22, \u00b6 35, 304 Mont. 144, 18 P.3d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b639 This conflict is significant under the plain error statute because, in contrast to other appellate statutes, the plain error statute provides that waived issues may not even be \u201cnoticed\u201d on appeal unless the defendant satisfies a threshold burden to show prejudice as to guilt. <em>Compare </em>\u00a746-20-701(2), MCA, <em>with </em>\u00a746-20-104(1), MCA (appeal may be taken from issues which merely \u201caffect the substantial rights of the defendant\u201d). Thus, this \u201c[codification of] the common law doctrine of plain error,\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 133, 915 P.2d at 213, embodies the same kind of threshold determination to obtain appellate review as applied under the common law-in addition to establishing retroactivity of a new rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b640 This understanding is also supported by the statute\u2019s legislative history, which informs the issue of what standards of review are to be applied. Section 46-20-701, MCA, was first enacted in 1967, and amended in 1983, to provide several instances in which this Court could undertake plain error review, provided the defendant could still demonstrate heightened prejudice. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 133, 915 P.2d at 212-13. When amending the statute in 1983, the Legislature intended to \u201climit the issues which can be raised by a criminal defendant on appeal,\u201d and \u201cto discourage the abuses and prolonged appeals.\u201d Mont. Sen. Jud. Comm., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on Sen. Bill 2, </em>48th Legis., Reg. Sess. 2-3 (Jan. 19, 1983). In the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Underdal supported the bill out of frustration for appeals \u2018based, not on the question of guilt, but on technicalities.\u201d Mont. H. Jud. Comm., <em>Minutes of the Hearing on Sen. Bill </em>2,48th Legis., Reg. Sess. 8 (Mar. 16,1983). The Legislature sought to limit plain error review to selected circumstances, including retroactivity, when the defendant had actually suffered prejudice <em>as to his or her guilt or punishment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00b641 Consequently, under the plain meaning of the statute, its legislative history, and our cases, traditional plain error standards should be used by the Court in reviewing issues under the plain error statute. However, instead of following these statutory and common law plain error principles, the Court imports the harmless error analysis of <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. In <em>Van Kirk, </em>the defendant had objected in the trial court and preserved the suppression issue, which he then raised on appeal. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 9. We thus formulated in <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29, 36, a new test for applying the <em>harmless error </em>analysis under \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, to address prejudice to the defendant from trial errors objected to at trial-not the <em>plain error </em>analysis under \u00a746-20-701(2), MCA, for errors waived at trial. \u2018We therefore deem it appropriate to formally adopt an approach to harmless error issues....\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b642 Harmless error is much different than plain error, involving different purposes, standards, and burdens, and I believe the Court is making a mistake in incorporating <em>Van Kirk </em>harmless error standards into a plain error analysis. Under harmless error, the burden is on the State, which committed the error over defendant\u2019s objection, to demonstrate the lack of prejudice to the defendant because of that error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42 (\u201c[I]t then becomes incumbent on the State to demonstrate that the error at issue was not prejudicial.\u201d). Under plain error, it is the defendant who permitted the error to occur by failing to object, not the State, and the defendant thus bears the burden of demonstrating a need for review which overcomes that error. Further, the harmless error standard of review is a lesser standard than plain error, and is contrary to the plain language of the statute and the clearly expressed intent of the Legislature. Harmless error requires reversal merely when there is a Reasonable possibility\u201d that \u2018inadmissible evidence might have contributed to a conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42. Under plain error, as explained in <em>Finley, </em>prejudicial error is that which constitutes \u201ca manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont, at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. We should not confuse the two, but rather apply <em>Van Kirk </em>harmless error standards under the harmless error statute, and apply <em>Finley </em>plain error standards under the plain error statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b643 This error is further evidence by the nation\u2019s jurisprudence. Although acknowledging that \u2018Trletroactivity jurisprudence in Montana is closely intertwined with federal law,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 13, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Court woefully misunderstands federal law on this point. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s retroactivity jurisprudence clearly supports the principle that a defendant waives a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure by failing to object, even when the new rule had not been announced until after the defendant\u2019s trial. In cases in which the Supreme Court has determined whether a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure is retroactive, the defendant who sought retroactive application of the new rule had objected, thereby preserving the issue for appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Shea v. Louisiana, </em>the Supreme Court began by reiterating that the issue to be decided was \u201cwhether [the] ruling [in <em>Edwards v. Arizona] </em>applies retroactively with respect to petitioner\u2019s convictions <em>when the issue was raised </em>and his case was pending and undecided on direct appeal in the state system at the time <em>Edwards </em>was decided.\u201d <em>Shea v. La., </em>470 U.S. 51, 55, 105 S. Ct. 1065, 1068 (1985) (emphasis added). The <em>Shea </em>Court held that \u2018if a case was pending on direct review at the time <em>Edwards </em>was decided, the appellate court must give retroactive effect to <em>Edwards, subject, of course, to established principles of waiver, harmless error, and the like.\u201d Shea, </em>470 U.S. at 59 n. 4, 105 S. Ct. at 1070 n. 4 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b644 The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed these principles in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>explaining that retroactive application of a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure will not necessarily lead to a new trial or sentencing hearing. <em>U.S. v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 268, 125 S. Ct. 738, 769 (2005). \u2018That is because we expect reviewing courts to apply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, for example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the \u2018plain-error\u2019 test <em>.\u2019\u2019Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 268, 125 S. Ct. at 769.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADP\">\u00b645 In <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S. Ct. 1544 (1997), the Supreme Court undertook the defendant\u2019s retroactivity claim under plain error review standards because the defendant had failed to preserve the issue by objecting. The Supreme Court described its review under the plain error rule as discretionary, not mandatory. <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 467, 117 S. Ct. at 1549. Further, the Supreme Court ultimately <em>denied </em>relief to Johnson because, even though the new rule was retroactive, under plain error there was \u2018ho basis for concluding that the error \u2018seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 470, 117 S.

Under this long-established principle, whether a defendant has objected is clearly relevant, even for purposes of retroactive application of new rules. If a defendant properly preserves the issue by objecting-and Reichmand could have done so just as easily as Goetz-then he or she is automatically entitled to raise the retroactivity issue on appeal for consideration by the appellate court. If not, then the defendant must satisfy plain error standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b648 Further reasons to apply established plain error standards are the similarities and purposes of the federal and state plain error tests. Our <em>Finley </em>plain error test is nearly identical to the plain error test announced in <em>U.S. v. Atkinson, </em>297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S. Ct. 391, 392 (1936), and followed in <em>U.S. v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 1779 (1993), <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 467, 117 S. Ct. at 1549, <em>U.S. v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 631-33, 122 S. Ct. at 1785-86, and a host of other cases. <em>The Atkinson </em>plain error test was eventually codified as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), <em>see Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736-37, 113 S. Ct. at 1779, which formed the basis for the plain error doctrine applied in <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 465-70, 117 S. Ct. at 1548-50. The federal and state plain error tests serve the same purpose: to review fundamental error, even in the absence of a contemporaneous objection, that otherwise would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. Employing the <em>Van Kirk </em>test not only disregards our plain error test, our plain error statute, and its legislative history, but also the directive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>of <em>Johnson </em>and the substantial federal guidance on this issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I suspect that, at some point in the future, fresh eyes will see the folly in failing to apply plain error standards under the plain error statute, and will restore common law review standards to the statute as originally intended. If the Legislature grows impatient for that day, it may want to consider adding language to the statute requiring it to be applied as originally intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b649 Plain Error Application to Reichmand\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b650 I do not believe that admission of the electronic recordings between Reichmand and Chor resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice, unsettled the fundamental fairness of Reichmand\u2019s trial, or compromised the integrity of the judicial process against him. <em>See Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. The State\u2019s case at trial rested heavily on the testimony of the confidential informant Terry Chor. The electronic recordings were marginal evidence at best, and merely cumulative of a fraction of Chor\u2019s testimony, while the evidence supporting Reichmand\u2019s guilt was overwhelming and largely uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b651 The recorded conversations, combined, lasted a total of about five minutes. During the trial, Reichmand was first to inquire about the substance of the recordings when, during the recross-examination of the State\u2019s fourth witness, Agent Martenson, his counsel attempted to demonstrate that Martenson couldn\u2019t identify the individuals speaking on the recording. The State presented the testimony of five witnesses: a forensic scientist, three drug task force agents, and confidential informant Chor. The State played the electronic recordings only during the testimony of its final witness, Agent David Clark, and played a brief portion of one of the audiotapes in rebuttal closing. The recording was of such poor quality that, during rebuttal closing argument, the court reporter could not transcribe the recording because it was \u2018hot audible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b652 Reichmand\u2019s defense was mistaken identity-4hat Reichmand\u2019s brother was really the person who had sold the drugs.

At one point, the following exchange occurred between the prosecutor and Chor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">Q. When you went in the house, who did you meet with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">A. Dallas. Dallas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">Q. And how do you know Dallas again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">A. That\u2019s Dallas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">Q. That\u2019s Dallas[?] Is that the person you purchased the drugs from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">A. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">Q. Do you know the man or the person you purchased those drugs from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">A. Yes. This man right here, Dallas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">\u00b653 I disagree with the Court\u2019s statement that the electronic recordings provided \u201cobjective and qualitatively superior evidence\u201d admitted at trial, Opinion \u00b6 25. Three agents with the Southwest Montana Drug Task Force and Montana Department of Justice all testified as to the protocol they followed for the two separate drug transactions with Reichmand. Agent Clark described the officers\u2019 involvement with Chor in gathering evidence against Reichmand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">We usually meet with the informant at a prearranged location, away from everybody. At that time, the informant is searched, his vehicle is searched for any items of contraband or money he might have.... At this point, we sometimes place a phone call to a suspect or we place an electronic transmitting device, or a wire, on the informant, give the informant some money. The informant is then followed to the location of a suspect by agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-14\">At that time, the informant goes to wherever the suspect is. It could be anywhere. In this instance, it was a house. He goes in the house, makes a transaction, comes back out, drives away. We follow him back to a prearranged meeting location, where, at that time, we take the dangerous drugs from him. And the informant is then searched for any items of contraband or money. His vehicle is also searched. The wire, the electronic transmitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>device, is then removed. And we usually have an interview with him, a taped interview, of what occurred during the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYF\">The officers prearranged the meeting with Reichmand by searching Chor and his vehicle and giving Chor traceable money to purchase the drugs. In that way, any money spent or kept, and any illicit drugs removed from Chor after the purchase, were objective evidence of the criminal drug transactions with Reichmand. Further, the agents followed Chor to Reichmand\u2019s house, surveilled the house while Chor was inside for the time necessary to make the drug purchases, followed him back to a prearranged location where they confiscated the drugs and money, and then interviewed him. All of this was objective, credible evidence against Reichmand.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b654 As we did in <em>State v. Schwartz, </em>2009 MT 234, 351 Mont. 384, 212 P.3d 1060,1 would affirm Reichmand\u2019s convictions on the basis of the other evidence and conclude that the recordings here did not result in a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-5\"> <em>See Linkletter v.

The <em>Foster-DeBerry </em>decision, in particular, recognized the requirement that the defendant must object to preserve error for appeal. The Court there noted that, unlike here, the defendant had not made a plain error argument which could have allowed the <em>Goetz </em>issue to be considered. <em>Foster-DeBerry </em>thus left open the question we answer in this case. Adhering to <em>stare decisis, </em>I would not overrule those decisions. <em>Certain v. Tonn, </em>2009 Mont. 330, \u00b6 19, 353 Mont. 21, 220 P.3d 384; <em>State v.
