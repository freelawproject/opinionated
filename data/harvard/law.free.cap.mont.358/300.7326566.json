We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\">\u00b62 Blehm presents issues for review that we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b63 Issue 1. Whether the District Court erred in determining that she was a probationary employee under \u00a739-2-904(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred in refusing to imply a common-law exception to \u00a7 39-2-904(2), MCA, based upon Blehm\u2019s contention that she was terminated for refusing to violate public policy or for reporting a violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b65 In August, 2008 Blehm was employed as a human resources manager at the Sidney Health Center in Sidney, Montana. She interviewed with St. John\u2019s for a similar position at its hospital in Libby, Montana. St. John\u2019s offered her the position of Human Resources Manager on August 12. Blehm accepted the offer and a proposed start date of September 29. On August 26 Blehm withdrew her acceptance of the St. John\u2019s job, which offered $85,500 per year plus benefits, in favor of a higher paying job in Butte.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b66 Blehm then changed her mind again and on September 1, 2008 requested that St. John\u2019s re-offer the job to her. St. John\u2019s agreed to do so and offered a starting date of September 29. Blehm accepted the job and requested a later starting date of October 6, 2008. Blehm moved from Sidney, Montana to Libby Montana, and St. John\u2019s reimbursed her $6,000 for moving expenses. Upon arrival at St. John\u2019s, Blehm executed several employment-related documents each stating that her date of hire was October 6,2008. On that first day at work Blehm and other St. John\u2019s employees flew to Nashville, Tennessee, to attend a work-related conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b67 When Blehm began work as Human Resources Manager at St. John\u2019s the Employee Handbook specified a probationary period for employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">Full-time and part-time employees are considered to be in an orientation period for the first ninety (90) calendar days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8a\">Department managers will have a 180 day orientation/probationary period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">One of Blehm\u2019s first official acts as the Human Resources Manager was to amend the provision on probationary employment to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">The first six months of employment are considered a probationary period; however, probationary periods may be extended. At the end of this time there is no guarantee of future employment. Demonstrated work proficiency, dependability, expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>behaviors, ability, initiative, attitude and cooperation of the employee will be some of the factors determining continued employment at St. John\u2019s Lutheran Hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Blehm sent this amended language to all St. John\u2019s employees who had been hired in the previous six months, with directions that they should include the new provision in their Employee Handbooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b68 The District Court found that \u201c[t]hings did not go smoothly with Blehm\u2019s employment with SJLH.\u201d St. John\u2019s terminated Blehm\u2019s employment on April 2,2009. She filed suit on July 17,2009 under the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, \u00a7\u00a739-2-901, et seq., MCA. The District Court entered summary judgment for St. John\u2019s, dismissed the complaint, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo, using the same standards as the district court. <em>Revelation Industries v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 123, \u00b6 13, 350 Mont. 184, 206 P.3d 919. We review a district court\u2019s resolution of issues of law such as statutory interpretation to determine whether they are correct. <em>LeFeber v. Johnson, </em>2009 MT 188, \u00b6 19, 351 Mont. 75, 209 P.3d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b610 Issue 1. Whether the District Court erred in determining that Blehm was a probationary employee who could be terminated for any reason under \u00a739-2-904(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\u00b611 Montana adopted the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act in 1987. One of the purposes of the Act is to provide protection from wrongful discharge to employees after the end of their probationary period. Section 39-2-904, MCA. However, Td]uring a probationary period of employment, the employment may be terminated at the will of either the employer or the employee on notice to the other for any reason or for no reason.\u201d An employer may establish the relevant probationary period, but if not \u201cthere is a probationary period of 6 months from the date of hire.\u201d Section 39-2-904(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">\u00b612 In this case the District Court found that there were three possible sources for a probationary period for Blehm\u2019s employment with St. John\u2019s: the 180-day orientation/probationary period provided for department managers in the original Employee Handbook; the first six months of employment provided for all employees in the Employee Handbook revision adopted by Blehm; or the statutory default period of six months from the date of hire provided in \u00a739-2-904(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u00b613 Much of the argument in the briefs on appeal is devoted to competing theories for determining Blehm\u2019s \u201cdate of hire\u201d under the default probationary period provided in \u00a7 39-2-904(2)(b), MCA. However, the default \u201cdate of hire\u201d provision in the statute does not apply here because the employer established a specific probationary period of either the \u2018first\u201d 180 days (under the Employee Handbook in effect when Blehm started working) or the \u2018first six months of employment\u201d (under the amendment adopted by Blehm as Human Resources Manager for St. John\u2019s). Under either version of the Employee Handbook, Blehm\u2019s probationary period began the day she began working for St. John\u2019s, on October 6, 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1v\">\u00b614 Blehm argues that she actually began employment with St. John\u2019s prior to October 6, 2008. She contends that she began employment \u25a0with St. John\u2019s either in early August, 2008, when she first accepted the hospital\u2019s offer of employment, or in September, 2008, when she accepted a second offer after having withdraw her acceptance of the first. She contends that under either of these dates her 6-month probationary period expired before she was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">\u00b615 The District Court properly rejected these contentions. The existence of a probationary period for new employees is an integral part of the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act. Section 39-2-904, MCA, not only allows employers to define a probationary period, but also provides a default probationary period if the employer fails to do so. The purpose of probationary employment at St. John\u2019s, in the language Blehm drafted for the revised Employee Handbook, is for the new employee to demonstrate \u201cwork proficiency, dependability, expected behaviors, ability, initiative, attitude, and cooperation ....\u201d Under Blehm\u2019s arguments, a substantial portion of a new employee\u2019s probationary period could expire before the employee ever sets foot on the employer\u2019s premises. It is illogical that any of the purposes of probation can be furthered by starting a probationary period before the new employee actually starts to work. The illogic is compounded here, where Blehm was actually working for another employer-the hospital in Sidney, Montana-during at least part of the period that she now contends that she was a probationary employee of St. John\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b616  The only reasonable construction of St. John\u2019s probationary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>period is that it began for Blehm when she began work as Human Resources Manager on October 6,2008. St. John\u2019s terminated Blehm\u2019s employment within the probationary period and \u00a739-2-904(2), MCA, therefore applies. St. John\u2019s could terminate Blehm\u2019s employment \u2018for any reason or for no reason.\u201d The District Court\u2019s conclusion on this issue is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b617 Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred in refusing to imply a common-law exception to the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act based upon Blehm\u2019s contention that she was terminated for refusing to violate public policy or for reporting a violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b618 The Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act provides a cause of action against an employer in favor of an employee who has been wrongfully discharged. Section 39-2-905, MCA. A discharge is wrongful only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">(a) it was in retaliation for the employee\u2019s refusal to violate public policy or for reporting a violation of public policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">(b) the discharge was not for good cause and the employee had completed the employer\u2019s probationary period of employment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">(c) the employer violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Section 39-2-904(1), MCA. As noted above, the Act specifically provides that employment maybe terminated for any reason or for no reason during a probationary period. Section 39-2-904(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">\u00b619 The Act provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful discharge from employment, \u00a7 39-2-902, MCA, and preempts common-law remedies.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">Preemption of common-law remedies. Except as provided in this part, no claim for discharge may arise from tort or express or implied contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">Section 39-2-913, MCA. Nevertheless, Blehm contends that she was terminated because of the positions she took on various issues such as employee management and evaluation, reporting of work place accidents, and executive salary. She claims that an employee discharged during probation should still have the right to sue if he or she alleges that the discharge arose from a refusal to violate public policy or for reporting a violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">\u00b620 The District Court correctly considered and rejected Blehm\u2019s argument. The role of the Court in construing a statute \u2018is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>inserted.\u201dSection 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Miller v. District Court, </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 38, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121. Adopting Blehm\u2019s argument would require this Court to substantially re-write critical provisions of the Act, contrary to \u00a71-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">\u00b621 Blehm argues that this Court should recognize a common-law exception to \u00a739-2-904, MCA, any time an employee alleges that he or she was discharged during the probationary period for refusing to violate public policy. In support Blehm cites case law from various jurisdictions that have recognized such an exception in \u201cat will\u201d employment. While some of those cases are also from Montana, none dealt with claims under the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, and are therefore inapplicable here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Montana\u2019s former at-will employment statute, \u00a7 39-2-503, MCA, was repealed in 2001 and essentially replaced with \u00a7 39-2-904(2), MCA. The clear intent of the Act was to replace common-law causes of action in wrongful discharge cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b622 Blehm finally contends that she was denied equal protection of the law by the District Court\u2019s refusal to construe a common-law exception to \u00a7 39-2-904(2), MCA. She contends that probationary period employees who can be terminated for any reason \u201cdo not receive the same protection from laws (such as workers\u2019 compensation laws) that other employees have.\u201d Blehm then contends that the Act, or the construction of it, should be subject to the strictest scrutiny because a probationary employee is less likely to report violations of public policy. This, she contends, puts all employees\u2019 lives and health at risk and that since \u201clife is a fundamental right,\u201d any classification that infringes on the fundamental right to life must be strictly construed. \u00b623 Equal protection of the law is guaranteed by Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. The rule of equal protection is that persons similarly situated should receive like treatment. <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Cas. Co., </em>2009 MT 368, \u00b6 15, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566. Resolution of an equal protection challenge to a statute is determined by identifying the classes of persons involved; by determining the appropriate level of scrutiny; and applying the appropriate level of scrutiny to the situation involved. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u00b624 Blehm does not discuss the class distinction involved in her equal protection challenge. In order to move forward, however, we will assume that the classification involved is probationary and non-probationary employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b625 Blehm asserts that this Court should apply the highest level of strict scrutiny, based upon her contention that people who report violations of public policy help protect the lives of others and that therefore a fundamental right to life is implicated. This is a tenuous thread upon which to hang a contention that constitutional rights have been abridged. Here there is no suspect classification such as race or gender and a fundamental right to life is not even remotely implicated by the facts of the case. Rather, it is appropriate to use the lower-tier rational basis standard to review the application of the statute in this case. That was the standard applied in <em>Meech v. Hillhaven West, </em>Inc., 238 Mont. 21, 776 P.2d 488 (1989) in the context of an equal protection challenge to the damages limitation of the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b626  Applying a rational basis analysis to the statute, we determine that \u00a7 39-2-904(2), MCA, is rationally related to the purposes of the Act, which include limiting the scope of claims for wrongful discharge and defining the respective rights of employers and employees. Section 39-2-904, MCA, seeks to strike a balance between the interests of employees and employers, and provides significant protections to employees who complete their probationary period. The statute recognizes the importance of a probationary period to the success of an employment relationship. That importance was reflected and explained in the language Blehm herself adopted for the St. John\u2019s employee handbook.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b627 Statutes carry a presumption of constitutionality, <em>Brewer v. Ski Lift, </em>234 Mont. 109, 112, 762 P.2d 226, 228 (1988); <em>LaFournaise v. Montana Dev. Center, </em>2003 MT 240, \u00b6 26, 317 Mont. 283, 77 P.3d 202, that Blehm has not overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00b628 The District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-9\">JUSTICES RICE, WHEAT, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\"> Blehm also argues that she was subject to the 90-day probationary period applicable to \u2018full time and part time employees\u201d under the original St. John\u2019s Employee Handbook. It is clear, however, that Blehm, as Human Resources Manager for the Hospital, was a \u201cdepartment manager\u201d subject to the 180-day probationary period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-5\"> Blehm\u2019s reliance <em>wpon Ritchie v. Town of Ennis, </em>2004 MT 43, 320 Mont. 94, 86 P.3d 11, is misplaced. That case was expressly not decided under the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, hut under a separate statute applicable to municipal law enforcement officers, \u00a77-32-4113, MCA. <em>Ritchie, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\"> Blehm also argues that \u00a739-2-904, MCA, violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution unless it is construed to allow an exception for employees who claim they were terminated for refusal to violate public policy. There is no support for this contention. Section 39-2-912, MCA, exempts from the Act a wide range of claims based upon \u201cany other state or federal statute that provides a remedy for contesting the dispute.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
