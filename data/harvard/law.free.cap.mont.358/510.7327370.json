He pled guilty to felony sexual assault that same year. In 1997, Tirey was sentenced to 50 years in Montana State Prison with 25 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b69 Tirey was instructed to register as a Sexual Offender, but the court did not specify a tier level. Tirey was paroled in 2004. His parole was revoked in 2005 and he returned to prison to complete the unsuspended portion of his sentence. On April 15, 2008, the Department of Corrections designated Tirey a Level I Sexual Offender in anticipation of discharge. He was released to serve the suspended portion of his sentence on November 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b610 Tirey\u2019s probation officer, Sandra Fairbank (Fairbank), met with him on November 12, 2008 to explain the terms of his parole. Tirey was required to, among other things, (1) get a job right away, (2) report to his probation officer weekly, and (3) get into sexual offender treatment in two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u00b611 Tirey claims that after November 12,2008, he attempted to reach Certified Sexual Offender Treatment Specialist, Lindsay Clodfelter (Clodfelter). He claims that he had trouble contacting Clodfelter and reaching her office because he was unaware of the location and did not! have directions. Fairbank reminded Tirey that he needed to be in treatment in two weeks and that he would need to start a formal jot search if he had not found a job in a few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u00b612 Tirey missed his scheduled sexual offender treatmenl appointments on November 20, 2008 and November 25, 2008 Fairbank then put Tirey on 72 hour hold. At this time, Fairbank gav\u00ab Tirey job log forms which he needed to begin filling out. Also during that time, Fairbank spoke with Clodfelter and looked at othei supervision options for Tirey. Tirey was released from custody oi November 29, 2008, and was instructed to report to his probatioi officer as soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">\u00b613 Tirey did not report to Fairbank until December 2, 2008. At tha time, he had not completed any job logs and claimed to have ai appointment with Clodfelter. Tirey did not attend his appointmenl Clodfelter then classified Tirey as non-compliant with the sexuaB offender treatment program. B</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\u00b614 On December 3, 2008, Tirey did not appear for his weeklB appointment with Fairbank. She called him and he claimed that hfl was in a job interview and would make it back to town if he coulcH Tirey alleges that he ran out of gas outside of town and left a messadB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>with Fairbank. Fairbank started looking for Tirey. Tirey also called Clodfelter and told her that he needed to come into her office or he would be thrown in jail. Clodfelter scheduled an appointment for noon that day. Fairbank arrested Tirey when he arrived at Clodfelter\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b615 Tirey offers a number of excuses for violating his probation, including that he ran out of gas, job logs were too difficult to complete, his lack of medication was making him feel sick, Clodfelter had not called him back for a few days, and a job interview prevented him from getting to a meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b616 The county attorney filed a petition for revocation of Tirey\u2019s probation. Fairbank filed an affidavit in support of modifying the conditions of Tirey\u201d s suspended sentence and heightening his sexual offender status to Level II.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b617 The District Court found that Tirey had violated conditions of his parole by failing to (1) complete required job logs, (2) report to his probation officer as directed, and (3) comply -with all recommendations for outpatient sexual offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">j \u00b618 On July 24,2009, the District Court revoked Tire/ s probation and sentenced him to 25 years at Montana State Prison with seven years suspended. Tirey was not given any credit for time served on probation. The District Court also designated Tirey as a Level II Sexual Offender and ordered that 13 probation conditions be \u00a1integrated into his current suspended sentence conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">|\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s revocation of a suspended sentence for \u00a1abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Rudolph, </em>2005 MT 41, \u00b6 9, 326 Mont. 132, 107 P.3d 496. We review a criminal sentence for legality only, that is, \u00a1whether the sentence falls within the statutory parameters. <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 5, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">[20 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in revoking [Trey\u2019s probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">[21  Where the judge finds that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended sentence, the judge has the authority to revoke the suspended sentence. <em>Rudolph, </em>\u00b6 13. A single violation of the terms and conditions of a sentence is sufficient to support a court\u2019s \u00a1\u2022evocation of that sentence. <em>Id. </em>In <em>State v. Senn, </em>2003 MT 52, \u00b6 23, 314 Mont. 348, 66 P.3d 288, we upheld the revocation of a suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>sentence where defendant failed to meet personally with his probation officer as required. Defendant offered numerous excuses including that he had to go to the hospital and did not receive contact letters. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. We affirmed the district court\u2019s revocation of Senn\u2019s suspension and return to incarceration because Senn\u2019s explanation of his health, poverty, and \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to comply with probation were insufficient to excuse Senn\u2019s violation of a term of probation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b622  In the case before us, the District Court appropriately revoked Tirey\u2019s suspension because he violated the conditions of his probation in three ways. Tirey failed to report to his probation officer, submit job logs, and begin sexual offender treatment. Tirey contends that his failure to meet the conditions of his parole was out of his control and largely the fault of his probation officer who he argues made unreasonable demands. Tirey relies on <em>State v. Lee, </em>2001 MT 176, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 173, 31 P.3d 998, and argues that his probation violations were not a product of his willfulness; therefore, he is entitled to an evaluation of alternatives to incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b623 In <em>Lee, </em>defendant\u2019s suspended sentence was conditioned on completing a sexual offender treatment program while incarcerated. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5. Lee spent over three of his five years of incarceration on a wait list for the various levels of the sexual offender program. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6. His treatment was further delayed by a sit down strike. <em>Id. </em>Despite substantial delays, Lee completed phase one and nearly phase two (the final phase), of sexual offender treatment by his release date. <em>Id. </em>We found that when the circumstances are such that failure to complete a condition of probation is solely the fault of the State, due process requires the trial court to consider adequate alternatives tc incarceration. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b624 Unlike <em>Lee, </em>Tirey\u2019s failure to comply with probation conditions ii not anyone\u2019s fault but his own. Tirey\u2019s excuses are similar to thos offered by the defendant in <em>Senn. </em>Regarding his December 3, <em>2001 </em>appointment with Fairbank, Tirey claims that he had insufficient ga to reach the appointment even though he chose to stop at a jol interview on his way into town that morning. Tirey alleges that he di&lt; not attend treatment because he was unable to find Clodfelter\u2019s office Finally, Tirey\u2019s contention that the job log requirement wa unreasonable does not establish that the requirement was impossible* thus his failure to complete and turn in job logs was his own faulffl Tirey also argues that his poverty and the extreme weather condition\u00bb contributed to his noncompliance. However, none of Tirey\u2019s excuse\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>establish, as the defendant did in Lee, that his noncompliance was not of his own volition. Indeed, the District Court noted a particular frustration with Tir\u00e9is unwillingness to accept responsibility for any of his violations. Because we conclude that evidence supports the District Court\u2019s determination that Tirey willfully violated conditions of his probation, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Urey's suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b625 2. Did the District Court act outside statutory parameters in incorporating 13 probation conditions into Tirey\u2019s sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b626 The law in effect at the time an offense is committed controls as to the possible sentence for the offense, as well as the revocation of that sentence. <em>State v. Tracy, </em>2005 MT 128, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 220, 113 P.3d 297. Tirey committed his offense in 1996. Therefore, the 1995 MCA is the applicable statute. Section 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA (1995), states that the court may \u201crevoke the suspension of sentence and require the defendant to serve either the sentence imposed or any lesser sentence[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b627 In determining whether the sentence at revocation is the \u201csame orlesser\u201dthanthe sentence originally imposed under \u00a746-18-203(7)(c), MCA (1995), we must look beyond the fact that new conditions were imposed at revocation. In <em>Tracy, </em>\u00b6 20, and <em>State v. Striplin, </em>2009 MT 76, \u00b6 32, 349 Mont. 466, 204 P.3d 687, we declined to uphold a district court sentence where the court revoked the defendant\u2019s sentence and imposed, by way of additional conditions, additional time in prison. Our holding in <em>State v. White, </em>\u00b6 30, 2008 MT 464, 348 Mont. 196, 199 P.3d 274, <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 27, 308 Mont. 154, 41 P.3d 314, and <em>State v. Rudolph, </em>2005 MT 41, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 326 Mont. 132, 107 P.3d 496, notwithstanding, the mere fact that the original sentence imposed had only conditions A, B, and C while the sentence at revocation has conditions A, B, C, D, and E does not necessarily mean that the sentence at revocation is greater. To the extent <em>White, Brister, </em>and <em>Rudolph </em>suggests otherwise, they are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u00b628 A proper analysis requires that we look at the substance of the conditions to determine whether they are punitive in nature. For example, whether additional conditions require the defendant to spend Imore time incarcerated or that defendant serve his time at Montana State Prison rather than with the Department of Corrections. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Therriault, </em>2000 MT 286, \u00b6\u00b6 38-47, 302 Mont. 189, 14 P.3d 444 (wherein we discussed that participation in an intensive supervision program overseen by the Department of Corrections does not change [the offender\u2019s status from probationer to inmate). On the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>a condition that the defendant attend Alcoholics Anonymous sessions is not punitive in nature. Secondly, the new conditions must be reviewed in the context of the entire sentence. That is, whether the defendant\u2019s overall sentence is the same or whether the defendant is being sentenced to more or less punishment than the sentence originally imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b629  Although the 2009 sentence requires the integration of 13 probation conditions, many of those conditions merely reiterate the I conditions of Tirey\u2019s original suspended sentence. Unlike the conditions added in <em>Tracy </em>and <em>Striplin, </em>the 2009 conditions which could be considered \u2018hew\u201d are not punitive in nature. Additionally, Tirey\u2019s 2009 sentence amounts to a substantial reduction in overall punishment when compared to the 1997 sentence. Whereas the 1997 sentence required Tirey to serve 50 years in Montana State Prison with 25 years suspended, the 2009 sentence only imposes 25 years, with seven suspended. Even when the conditions imposed by the District Court are added to Tirey\u2019s sentence, the 2009 sentence is overall less than the 1997 sentence and therefore within 1995 MCA sentencing parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b630 3. Did the District Court act outside statutory parameters in designating Tirey a Level II Sexual Offender?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b631  According to \u00a746-23-509(5), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">[I]f, at the time of sentencing, the sentencing judge did not apply a level designation to a sexual offender ... the [Department of Corrections] shall designate the offender as level 1, 2, or 3 when the offender is released from confinement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In this case, the sentencing court did not apply a sex offender level designation to Tirey. Thus, the Department of Corrections had statutory authority to issue a designation. The Department designated! Tirey a Level I Sexual Offender on April 15, 2008. Therefore, the District Court erred in subsequently issuing a Level II designation at| revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">\u00b632 4. Did the District Court act outside statutory parameters! by failing to expressly state the reason why it did not credi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Tirey\u2019s time spent on probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u00b633  Section 46-18-201(4),MCA(1995)requiresthatthesentencing judge consider any elapsed time and either expressly allow all or part as credit or reject all or part as credit. The judge must state the reasons in the order. <em>Id. </em>As we held in <em>State v. Hardy, </em>278 Mont. 516, 524, 926 P.2d 700, 705, (1996), where \u201c[t]he denial of credit for \u2018street time\u2019 is an express provision of [a defendant\u2019s] sentence,\u201d a statement of reasons for the sentence \u2018include[s] the reasons for the denial of credit for \u2018street time.\u2019 \u201d In this case, the District Court\u2019s judgment includes a broad statement of reasons for its sentence upon revoking Tirey\u2019s probation. In its sentencing order, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asf\">In fashioning the following sentence, the Court has considered the nature of the violations of probation condition, particularly his failure to participate in sex offender treatment as recommended. The Defendant fails to take responsibility for not attending treatment as directed and offers incredible excuses for when he does miss treatment appointments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">This statement by the District Court is similar to the statement of reasons we upheld in <em>Hardy. </em>On the basis of that authority, we conclude that the District Court acted within statutory parameters in stating its reasons for not crediting the time Tirey spent on probation. \u00b634 We remand to the District Court for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b539-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\"> We note that in <em>Rudolph, </em>although we erroneously concluded that the mera adding of new conditions was necessarily punitive, we could have reached the sama result on the basis that the overall sentence had been increased. Rudolph was originalH sentenced to five years with all but 139 days suspended. <em>Rudolph, </em>\u00b6 6. At revocation! he was sentenced to five years with all but 20 months suspended. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8. Therefore! the sentence imposed at revocation <em>inRudolph </em>exceeded the original sentence in overalj punishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b539-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AaF\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">|\u00b635 I concur with the result reached by the Court in this case. In my \u00a1view, based on the totality of the sentence at issue here, Tirey received k \u2018lesser\u201d sentence than that originally imposed, for purposes of \u00a746-|18-203(7)(c), MCA (1995). Moreover, while I think I understand the kuance intended by the Court in overruling <em>State v. White, </em>2008 MT 464, 348 Mont. 196, 199 P.3d 274, <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, 308 Mont. 154, 41 P.3d 314, and <em>State v. Rudolph, </em>2005 MT 41, 326 Mont. 132, 107 P.3d 496 <em>(see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 27), I believe the Court\u2019s opinions in fthose cases were, nevertheless, correct based on the facts of the cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u00b636 I am not entirely in agreement with the Court that, other things being equal, adding to a sentence a condition that might be denominated as \u201cnon-punitive\u201d keeps the sentence within the \u201csame\u201d or \u2018lesser\u201drequirement of \u00a746-18-203(7)(c), MCA (1995). Opinion, \u00b6 28. \u2018Rehabilitative\u201d or \u201cnon-punitive\u201d conditions-arguably, for example, | mandatory attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings-still make the defendant\u2019s sentence more burdensome<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and provide an additional pitfall that the probationer must negotiate if he is to maintain his probationary status. Indeed, many of the probation revocation cases we review are grounded in the probationer\u2019s failure to abide by one or more of the ever-growing laundry list of \u201crehabilitative\u201d or \u201cnon-punitive\u201d conditions that sentencing courts, probation officers, and the Department of Corrections cram into sentencing orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b637 I agree with the result of the Court\u2019s decision here. However, I will continue to apply the <em>Mount </em>test, on a case-by-case basis, in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u00b638 I specially concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\"> In <em>White, </em>for example, we observed that the revocation sentence was the same h terms of the incarceration time. <em>White, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 23. However, the court added onditions to that sentenceJWhite was required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings four times a week and to participate in counseling as deemed appropriate by er probation officer, including counseling for chemical dependency and financial ifficulties. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 5. Hence, White did not receive a \u2018lesser\u201d sentence as required by 46-18-203(7)(c), MCA (1993). <em>Brister, </em>moreover, did not even involve the issue of a esser\u201d sentence, since the 1983 revocation statute allowed the district court either to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>revoke the suspended sentence and order the defendant to serve the remainder of ha prison term, or to continue the suspended sentence \u201cunder the original terms.\u201d BristeI \u00b6 27. Thus, the district court had no authority to continue Brister\u2019s suspended sentenf conditioned upon multiple new conditions and terms not contained in his origin| sentence. <em>Brister, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> <em>See State v.
